In a market saturated with overhyped projects that frequently fall short of their promises, these three are capturing attention for a very different reason, consistent delivery, strategic advancements, and a clear vision backed by tangible progress. With Pi gaining 16% in 24 hours, VEChain quietly maintaining nearly $2 billion in market cap, and Qubetics pushing into its final presale phase with a complete tokenomics overhaul, momentum is quietly building, and early participants are racing to position themselves ahead of what might soon be the breakout stories of the year. Qubetics ($TICS), in particular, is solving what no Layer 1 before it truly could: blockchain interoperability with zero-friction architecture. While past protocols promised scalability and speed, they often came at the cost of network compatibility or decentralization. Qubetics enters with an entirely new framework that actively integrates existing infrastructures into a unified ecosystem. Real-world applications? Think seamless asset movement across networks without bridges or wrapped tokens. With just 9 million tokens left in its presale at a locked-in price of $0.3370, the time to act is shrinking fast, one of the best crypto to buy for June 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): Solving Interoperability with Purpose and Precision Interoperability remains one of the most pressing and under-addressed problems in blockchain. Currently, moving assets across blockchains requires third-party bridges, often introducing security vulnerabilities, transaction fees, and delays. These inefficiencies restrict mass adoption and real-world use. Qubetics ($TICS) takes this challenge head-on with a modular Layer 1 infrastructure designed to connect multiple chains without relying on centralized bridges or wrapped assets. In practice, this means that stablecoins from one network can be used in decentralized applications (dApps) on another without leaving the ecosystem. For example, a DeFi application built on Ethereum could seamlessly interact with liquidity protocols hosted on Qubetics, while a supply chain tracking smart contract on VeChain could receive payment data from the Qubetics mainnet, all without rewriting code or migrating assets. Qubetics Presale Nears Completion with Top Exchange Listing and Explosive Growth Potential Qubetics is now in Stage 37, the final phase of its public crypto presale , having already raised over $18.1 million from more than 28,300 token holders and selling over 516 million $TICS tokens. The current presale price is fixed at $0.3370, but with only 9 million tokens left, time is running out. The presale will officially close on June 30 at 8:00 AM UTC, just hours before Qubetics lists on a top 10 global crypto exchange at $0.40, giving last-minute investors an instant 20% upside at launch. A major driver behind Qubetics’ growing demand is its aggressive supply strategy, which saw total token supply reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, creating built-in scarcity. In addition, the team has committed to a community-first model, allocating 38.55% of the supply to public sale participants ensuring fairer distribution and a more decentralized ownership structure. Unlike many projects that promise future utility, Qubetics is already rolling out real-world solutions like its decentralized VPN (dVPN), built to address privacy, censorship, and centralization issues across the internet. With use-case-driven technology and strong tokenomics, analysts are forecasting that $TICS could reach between $10 and $15 post-mainnet, translating to a potential ROI of up to 4,350% for early supporters. With the presale ending soon, listing confirmed for June 30 at 11:00 AM UTC, and token availability shrinking rapidly, this may be the final opportunity to get in before Qubetics gains global market exposure and draws institutional attention, making it one of the most promising crypto buys for June 2025. Pi Network (PI) Surges 16% on AI Integration Buzz Ahead of Pi2Day Event Pi Network (PI) made headlines once again, surging 16% following speculation around a possible integration with generative AI technologies. This rally coincided with the community’s upcoming Pi2Day event and reinforced growing interest in Pi’s long-standing mobile mining ecosystem. Technically speaking, PI has broken through a significant resistance point, suggesting further upside if the current momentum continues. The MACD indicator has just flashed a fresh buy signal, while the RSI has climbed to 53—often a marker of building bullish strength. If PI maintains price action above $0.6600, analysts expect a potential climb toward the $0.8686 mark, previously recorded in May. On the flip side, a retracement to the $0.5090 level could signal a short-term cool-off, especially if broader market sentiment dips, one of the best crypto to buy for June 2025. VEChain (VET) Holds Steady at $0.021 Amid Real-World Enterprise Adoption Momentum While VEChain (VET) hasn’t produced fireworks lately, it remains a cornerstone of blockchain utility in logistics, supply chain, and enterprise adoption. Currently trading at $0.02128, VET has shown consistency in volume and user activity, with around $30 million in daily turnover. The circulating supply stands at 86 billion, nearly reaching its max, giving it a fully diluted market value of approximately $1.82 billion. While short-term traders may overlook it, the protocol’s long-term fundamentals and enterprise-first approach create a strong case for those looking to diversify into blockchain assets with real use cases. Its stability and reliable throughput make it a solid choice for community members looking beyond speculative hype toward foundational growth, and stand out as the best crypto to buy for June 2025. Final Thoughts on the Best Crypto to Buy for June 2025 Among the three, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out for addressing the future of blockchain utility through interoperability, while also offering significant upside through its current final-stage presale. Pi Network (PI) continues to capture attention with bold technology hints and a resilient community model. VEChain (VET), meanwhile, stays steady, anchoring itself in proven adoption and enterprise solutions. Each of these projects presents a different type of value. Qubetics is offering early participants a shot at securing what might be the next major Layer 1—built not just for speed or cost, but true utility. Pi Network is gathering community momentum with each technical advancement. VEChain continues to quietly execute on everything many networks only talk about. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy for June 2025 , these three deserve serious attention. Whether the focus is potential ROI, technological innovation, or long-term stability, each has a distinct position in the blockchain market that’s not to be ignored. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics ($TICS) the best crypto to buy for June 2025? Qubetics addresses the biggest challenge in blockchain—interoperability—with real-world solutions, a powerful tokenomics update, and a final presale opportunity that promises high ROI potential. Why is Pi Network (PI) gaining attention again in 2025?

46851830,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756136,1750979919,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46851830.jpeg,Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urges Congress to dump Trump’s retaliatory tax in BBB,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/scott-bessent-congress-dump-retaliatory-tax/,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has formally asked Congress to delete a controversial provision buried in President Donald Trump’s newest budget plan. The section, known as Section 899, would’ve allowed the US to slam companies and investors from other countries with additional taxes, specifically if those countries imposed harsh tax policies under international agreements. Scott said on Thursday that the rule no longer made sense because parts of the OECD’s Pillar 2 tax regime won’t apply to US companies anymore. According to reporting from the Financial Times, Scott posted on X that the Treasury had requested lawmakers in both the House and Senate to remove the section from the “Big, Beautiful Budget.” The provision was originally designed to hit back at countries using the OECD’s global minimum tax rules to go after US multinationals. Trump signed onto the bill with the rule intact, but the economic and political climate has changed. Scott said the US had reached an understanding with G7 countries after “months of productive dialogue,” making the retaliation part of the bill unnecessary. Treasury walks away from Pillar 2 enforcement Pillar 2 was part of a 2021 deal agreed under former President Joe Biden, meant to enforce a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate. That deal gave countries the power to collect extra taxes if multinational firms weren’t paying enough at home. But now the US says those rules won’t apply to American companies anymore, meaning other countries won’t be able to collect taxes from them under Pillar 2. That’s what made Scott come out and push for the removal of Section 899. The tax had raised alarms in the financial sector. Major banks and investors warned it would drag down corporate investment and cause money to flow out of the US Some even said it could make the US a less attractive place for foreign capital. The Treasury Department had tried to narrow the damage by excluding interest on US Treasury securities from the scope, but the provision still applied to dividends, rent, and royalties, which industry groups said would wreck passive investment flows. Even within Trump’s own party, some Republicans in the House weren’t sold on the tax. They said on Wednesday that Section 899 was too risky and hinted that it might be taken out of the final bill. Scott’s announcement gave them the cover they needed to go public. Right now, the GOP wants to get the bill passed before July 4, which is when Trump wants to sign the law to mark Independence Day with a legislative win. Wall Street lobbies hard against the tax The financial industry didn’t stay quiet. They made it known that they hated the plan. Wall Street firms warned that adding this kind of penalty on foreign investors would backfire. The US already saw a drop in demand for government debt earlier this year, and investors blamed Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on nearly every major trade partner. That dip created serious concern, especially since the Treasury would need to issue a ton of bonds to pay for the spending in the budget bill. The threat of Section 899 just added fuel to that fire. Business groups feared the extra tax would discourage foreign direct investment and make investors steer clear of US markets altogether. One of the most vocal critics was Jonathan Samford, CEO of the Global Business Alliance, who said: “This is what leadership looks like. Choosing economic strength over squandered opportunity, investment over isolation, and American workers over misguided tax hikes.” The political shift came fast. Once Scott made the Treasury’s position public, the path to removing Section 899 got clearer. The House GOP moved quickly to prepare for a final vote on the broader budget package, which also includes an extension of Trump’s 2017 individual tax cuts and new tax breaks meant to appeal to middle-income Americans heading into the 2026 election season. The unfinished parts of the OECD deal—including the idea of replacing digital services taxes with new rules on profit-sharing across countries—no longer appear to be a concern for the administration. With the G7 on board and foreign tax enforcement no longer a threat to US firms, the retaliatory move lost its reason to exist. In Scott’s words, the new understanding with the G7 “provides greater certainty and stability for the global economy” and will “enhance growth and investment in the United States and beyond.” His message was clear: the US doesn’t need a revenge tax when it’s already negotiated its way out of the fight. Now it’s on Congress to act before foreign investors pull back even more. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This comes as the index climbed 0.8% during the day, ending the session at 6,141.02, just inches away from the 6,147.43 intraday record last hit in February. The Dow Jones added 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite moved up nearly 1%, also heading toward a potential all-time high of its own. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added just 33 points in after-hours trading, a 0.1% lift. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures stayed mostly unchanged. This cautious positioning comes ahead of key inflation data that will either keep the rally going or yank it off course. Investors wait for new inflation data According to CNBC, Rick Rieder, who heads global fixed income at BlackRock, said, “There is so much money that wants to come into the market that didn’t for a while. And I just think if you don’t have any negative news, the natural gravitational pull is across all these assets.” On Friday, traders are set to dig into May’s personal consumption expenditures price index. It’s a big deal—this is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a monthly increase of 0.1%, and a year-over-year jump of 2.3%. The core PCE, which takes out food and energy, is also forecasted to rise 0.1% for the month and 2.6% for the year. That’s not all investors are watching. The morning will also bring updates on consumer spending, personal income, and consumer sentiment. The results could decide if the recent rally continues or runs out of steam. Despite the Fed still dancing around its rate strategy and ongoing geopolitical pressure, the stock market has clawed its way back from its lows earlier this year. All three major indexes have posted solid weekly gains: the S&P 500 and Dow are up over 2%, and the Nasdaq has jumped more than 3%. Bitcoin trapped in tight range as whales unload While equities flirt with records, Bitcoin is stuck pacing the same ten-foot circle it’s been walking since May 9. The price has mostly bounced between $102,000 and $112,000, with just one brief spike beyond that ceiling to hit a new high, still barely ahead of its last one. It hasn’t managed a strong rally, despite an insane amount of interest from institutions. Just this Wednesday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their 12th straight day of inflows and are now heading toward their ninth positive week in eleven, pulling in $3.5 billion just this month, according to Coin Metrics. Yet Bitcoin itself has only risen by 2%. Markus Thielen, who leads 10x Research, explained why. “We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets,” he said. Markus called it an “orderly” change of ownership, where old megawhales are taking their time to sell off coins to new buyers like ETFs and corporate treasuries. The wallets that are buying the most this year? Those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. CryptoQuant classifies these holders as dolphins, and Julio Moreno, the firm’s head of research, says that many ETFs probably fall into this group. Whales and miners control the game The biggest players in crypto right now are still whales (wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC) and megawhales (10,000+ BTC). But they’re not buying. They’ve been net sellers since the start of the year. Retail wallets, those holding less than one full bitcoin, are also dumping. It’s the dolphins who are stepping in to soak up that pressure. But that balance is fragile. Julio said that companies like BlackRock and Strategy (the company formerly known as MicroStrategy) have built large positions using hundreds of wallets. BlackRock holds around 550 wallets, each averaging 1,290 BTC. Strategy controls about 490 wallets, with an average of 927 BTC per wallet. But even with these holdings spread out, they’re considered large buyers behind most of the recent ETF flows. Despite all the buying, price movement has stayed muted. That’s because some of the biggest bitcoin reserves on the planet are still in the hands of Chinese miners. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate. Out of the 19.9 million bitcoins mined so far, between 11 and 15 million came from China-based miners. Of that, about 5 million are still under their control, according to Markus. Normally, during a big price rally, these wallets start dumping on exchanges. This time, they haven’t. “It seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many bitcoin as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” Markus said . Strategy, now focused on corporate crypto adoption, has slowed down its BTC buying this year. That’s mostly because its stock premium has narrowed, and competition from other treasury buyers is rising fast. Markus warned that “if megawhale selling accelerates further, a deeper correction is likely.” On the other hand, if those big sellers back off and whale accumulation starts to rise, the next leg up might finally begin.

But the Central Bank abruptly postponed the launch “indefinitely” in early March . The bank stunned the public when it initially gave no alternative launch timeline. This led to a flurry of speculation that Moscow was preparing to ditch its CBDC. Others suggested Moscow might push back the rollout to at least 2027 . Some forecasted that the Central Bank would pursue crypto-powered alternatives to the digital ruble. They cited a lukewarm reception for digital RUB plans from both the public and the banking sector. However, the Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that some of the biggest banks in the country are looking forward to the launch. The Russian Central Bank in Moscow.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-expert-says-something-big-is-coming-heres-why/,"XRP may be gearing up for a significant upward move, according to recent analysis by Teo Mercer, a digital asset strategist with a large following on social media. Mercer believes that the current market conditions and evolving regulatory developments in the United States could provide the momentum needed for XRP to achieve higher valuations in the coming months. In a recent post, Mercer noted that XRP is showing strong indicators of a potential breakout, following an extended period of subdued performance. With XRP currently priced near $2, he suggests this range may offer an attractive opportunity for new entrants. Projected Price Range: $3 to $4 Considered Attainable Mercer’s outlook is centered around the belief that XRP could realistically climb to between $3 and $4 in the short-to-medium term. He explained that these levels are achievable if current market sentiment continues to improve and regulatory clarity is maintained. $XRP is starting to show serious signs of life. With U.S. crypto regulation entering its final stages, the environment is aligning in XRP’s favor. Feels like something big is loading. This looks like a strong entry point, with $3–$4 as a realistic target in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/TrmhZ4Us0r — ︎ Teo Mercer (@TeoMercer) June 25, 2025 Earlier in the year, XRP temporarily entered this price zone but was unable to sustain the momentum due to broader market resistance. Since then, it has hovered around $2, prompting frustration among holders. However, analysts like Mercer believe that conditions are finally aligning in XRP’s favor, particularly as legislative and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies take shape in the U.S. U.S. Moves Toward Comprehensive Crypto Regulation The renewed optimism around XRP and other digital assets is largely being driven by recent progress in U.S. crypto regulation. Notably, the Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act , which introduces a regulatory structure for stablecoins. The law establishes oversight requirements, full asset backing, and consumer protections for these digital currencies. Additionally, new legislation proposed by Republican lawmakers aims to clarify how cryptocurrencies are categorized. The bill distinguishes between securities and commodities, assigning regulatory authority according to either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). If passed, this could significantly reduce regulatory ambiguity and support more consistent market growth. Further signaling institutional adoption, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has instructed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to incorporate digital assets in assessing borrowers’ financial qualifications. This directive could open doors for broader acceptance of crypto assets in traditional finance, particularly under the pro-crypto posture of the current U.S. administration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another important factor supporting XRP’s potential growth is the conclusion of its prolonged legal battle with the SEC. Ripple and the agency have reportedly agreed to a $50 million settlement, pending court approval. The end of this high-profile case removes a significant obstacle that has overshadowed XRP’s market outlook for years. Differing Views on XRP’s Upside While Mercer’s price target remains conservative compared to more aggressive forecasts, it aligns with a growing consensus that XRP could soon gain momentum. In contrast, some analysts have issued far more ambitious predictions. For instance, Dustin Layton recently suggested that 1,000 XRP, currently valued at approximately $2,000, could yield profits of $50,000 before year-end, implying a price per coin of over $52. Such a valuation would require XRP to reach a market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion, a milestone many view as unrealistic in the near term. Nonetheless, the existence of these projections reflects heightened expectations from portions of the crypto community. The supportive market sentiment has created a favorable environment for XRP’s potential appreciation. While price predictions vary, analysts like Mercer maintain that a move to $3 or $4 is not only possible but increasingly likely in the coming months as conditions continue to stabilize.

Reinforcing this bullish outlook is the Elliott Wave 5 count, which points to an epic price rally that could propel Bitcoin above $300,000, eclipsing its previous all-time high and current market value by a substantial margin. Bitcoin Price Ultimate Parabolic Push Unveiled A newly released Bitcoin price forecast by X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Gert van Lagen boldly suggests that the leading cryptocurrency may be on the verge of its most aggressive bull run this cycle. Lagen’s price chart indicates that BTC is firmly locked into a parabolic step-like growth structure, potentially eyeing an extended Wave 5 breakout that could drive prices well beyond $345,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The trajectory of the analyst’s chart illustrates a clear parabolic growth curve anchored by four distinct formations, labeled Base 1 through Base 4. Each of these bases represents a phase of accumulation and consolidation that preceded a Bitcoin price breakout. This structure also mirrors a textbook parabolic setup, where each new base sets the stage for steeper upward moves. Most notably, after the completion of Base 3, marked by the inflection point on the chart, Bitcoin launched into a sharp rally, confirming the expected parabolic behavior. Lagen’s analysis now indicates that BTC’s current Base 4 has been completed, followed by a corrective A-B-C structure that appears to have reached its bottom, positioning the cryptocurrency for the anticipated final leg of its cycle. Using Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin’s price action is still unfolding within the fifth wave, which is the final advance in the five-wave impulsive cycle. The price chart identifies Wave 1 as beginning shortly after the 2022 lows. This was followed by a powerful breakout in 2023, which defined Wave 3, while Wave 4 concluded more recently with a classic corrective pattern. Notably, the upcoming Wave 5 could see Bitcoin skyrocket anywhere between $300,000 and $425,000, depending on the timing and strength of its bullish momentum. Timeline For Game-Changing Rally A key element in Lagen’s analysis is the dynamic “sell line” drawn near the upper end of the parabolic arc that runs underneath the Bitcoin price movement on the chart. According to the analyst, the longer it takes for Bitcoin to hit this projected vertical trajectory, the higher the price at which the potential market top might occur. This is due to the upward curvature of the parabolic trend line itself, which steepens over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Currently, Lagen forecasts an early breakout by July 7, 2025, if momentum resumes immediately. However, if Bitcoin continues consolidating through the summer, the projected peak could rise further, as the sell line would continue climbing over time.

XRP and Shiba Inu are both mounting fresh comebacks, backed by legal milestones, whale activity, and ecosystem upgrades. Their renewed momentum has analysts revisiting the possibility of both tokens climbing back into the top 10 by market cap before the year closes. But there’s another name on the radar that’s changing the game entirely. MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new presale altcoin, is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about breakout candidates of the year. While XRP and SHIB work to reclaim lost ground, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting from the ground up—fast. Its low entry price, viral presale momentum, and strong investor engagement have positioned it as a serious contender for exponential gains. And if early signals are right, it may not just join the top 10 conversation—it could hijack it XRP and Shiba Inu Show Strength XRP and Shiba Inu have both spent years near the spotlight—but for very different reasons. As of late June 2025, XRP is once again at the center of a legal standoff with the SEC. Despite talk of settlement, a federal judge recently shut down both sides’ attempt to escape a final ruling. It’s a reminder that legal clarity for XRP isn’t guaranteed, even after years of litigation. Still, XRP isn’t standing still. Futures contracts tied to XRP are now live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, marking a milestone moment for the token’s institutional credibility. Ripple’s acquisition of brokerage firm Hidden Road—now approved by FINRA—adds another layer of compliance strength to its growing financial ecosystem. And while XRP’s price hovers between $2.10 and $2.18, analysts are split on whether a breakout or deeper correction is next. What’s clear is that XRP remains in play, but the path forward depends on more than just technical patterns. Shiba Inu, by contrast, is fighting its way back with innovation and whale support. A massive $110 million SHIB accumulation day—its largest in five months—sparked a sharp rebound from a 16-month low. On-chain momentum is improving, but it’s the ecosystem upgrades that could give SHIB lasting strength. Developers recently launched the Shib Alpha Layer, introducing encrypted smart contracts and the infrastructure for ultra-fast Layer 3 rollups. ShibDAO is also bringing real governance to holders, moving SHIB closer to true decentralization. While neither XRP nor SHIB is guaranteed a top 10 finish by year-end, both are showing they’re far from finished. But in a market increasingly hungry for new stories, a different kind of contender is catching fire. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Contender Everyone’s Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t a household name yet—but that could change fast. The project is deep in its presale phase, where token stages are selling out faster than most memecoins can update their roadmaps. It’s already raised more than $10 million, with early buyers treating this like a once-in-a-cycle opportunity. There’s no shortage of early-stage tokens, but what’s pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE ahead is the mix of timing, positioning, and momentum. It enters the market during a period of blue-chip fatigue. Ethereum is consolidating, XRP is tied up in court, and most of the top coins are moving sideways. Traders aren’t just watching anymore—they’re rotating. Unlike most meme coins that launch with hype and little else, MAGACOIN FINANCE has branding, token scarcity, and a fast-growing online movement. The token is priced under a cent, and that’s part of the draw—investors know the biggest returns are made before listings, not after. Analysts calling for 25x to 50x gains may sound aggressive, but if MAGACOIN FINANCE hits major exchanges with the kind of community firepower it’s currently building, that kind of upside becomes plausible. This isn’t about replacing XRP or SHIB. It’s about identifying the next breakout before the market catches up. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like that play. Conclusion: A Race with Room for a Surprise Winner XRP has the legal and institutional foundation. SHIB has the community and evolving tech. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding pure momentum—and doing it at the exact moment when crypto traders are looking for underpriced upside. By the end of 2025, we may see all three tokens fighting for a spot in the top 10. The difference? Only one of them is still giving early investors a shot at the ground floor.

The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, and a recent announcement from crypto giant Coinbase has sent ripples through the community. Coinbase has officially launched cbADA and cbLTC on Base, its very own Ethereum Layer-2 network. This move, as reported by Unfolded on X, isn’t just another product launch; it’s a strategic expansion that promises to enhance accessibility and utility for Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) holders within the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem on Base. Understanding Coinbase Base ‘s Latest Move The news that Coinbase is bringing wrapped versions of Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) to its Base network is a game-changer for several reasons. For those new to the space, Coinbase Base is an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) blockchain incubated by Coinbase. It’s designed to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications (dApps). By leveraging the security of Ethereum while offering significantly lower transaction fees and faster processing times, Base aims to be a cornerstone of the next wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation. This strategic decision by Coinbase to integrate cbADA and cbLTC directly onto Base signals a strong commitment to expanding the utility of major cryptocurrencies beyond their native blockchains. It means that holders of ADA and LTC, which traditionally operate on their own distinct networks, can now seamlessly participate in the diverse DeFi protocols and dApps being built on Base, all while benefiting from the robust infrastructure provided by Coinbase. The Power of cbADA and cbLTC : What Are Wrapped Tokens ? At the heart of this announcement are cbADA and cbLTC , which are examples of ‘wrapped tokens.’ But what exactly does that mean? Imagine you have a physical asset, like a gold bar, but you want to use it in a different financial system that only accepts paper currency. A wrapped token is essentially a digital representation of a cryptocurrency from one blockchain that’s ‘wrapped’ or tokenized to be usable on another blockchain. Here’s a simple breakdown: Definition: A wrapped token is a cryptocurrency token pegged to the value of another crypto asset. It’s like an ERC-20 version of a non-ERC-20 coin, allowing it to be used on the Ethereum network (or an L2 like Base). How it Works: When you wrap a token, the original asset is typically locked in a smart contract on its native chain, and an equivalent amount of the wrapped token is minted on the target chain. When you unwrap it, the wrapped token is burned, and the original asset is released. Benefits: Interoperability: Enables assets from different blockchains to interact, breaking down silos in the crypto ecosystem. Enhanced Liquidity: Brings liquidity from one chain to another, opening up new trading and lending opportunities. DeFi Participation: Allows holders of non-Ethereum native assets to participate in Ethereum’s vast DeFi ecosystem. With cbADA and cbLTC , Coinbase is providing a trusted bridge for Cardano and Litecoin holders to enter the Base ecosystem. This is a significant step towards a more interconnected and fluid decentralized financial world, where assets aren’t confined to their original chains but can flow freely to where they can be most utilized. Why an Ethereum Layer-2 Network Matters for Adoption The choice of Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 Network , is crucial to understanding the long-term implications of this launch. Ethereum, while robust and secure, faces scalability challenges due to high transaction fees (gas fees) and slower transaction speeds during periods of high network congestion. Layer-2 solutions like Base address these issues by processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain (Layer-1) and then batching them into a single transaction that is settled on Layer-1. Here’s why Layer-2 networks are so vital for the mass adoption of blockchain technology: Feature Ethereum Layer-1 (Mainnet) Ethereum Layer-2 (e.g., Base) Transaction Speed Slower (15-30 TPS) Much Faster (1,000s TPS) Transaction Cost Higher Gas Fees Significantly Lower Fees Scalability Limited High, designed for mass adoption Security Inherited from Ethereum Inherited from Ethereum User Experience Can be costly/slow Smoother, more affordable By building on Base, Coinbase ensures that users interacting with cbADA and cbLTC will experience a much more efficient and cost-effective environment. This lower barrier to entry for users, combined with the immense security of Ethereum, creates an attractive platform for both developers to innovate and users to engage with DeFi applications without prohibitive costs. Unlocking New Opportunities with Wrapped Tokens on Base The introduction of cbADA and cbLTC on Base opens up a plethora of new opportunities for both existing holders of these assets and the broader DeFi community. Previously, if you held ADA or LTC, your participation in the Ethereum-centric DeFi world was limited without going through complex bridging solutions or centralized exchanges. Now, with these wrapped tokens, the doors to Base’s growing ecosystem are wide open. DeFi Integration: Holders can now use their cbADA and cbLTC in various DeFi protocols on Base, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for trading, lending protocols to earn yield, and borrowing platforms to access liquidity. Enhanced Liquidity: This move injects new liquidity into the Base ecosystem, potentially attracting more users and developers, leading to a more vibrant and robust decentralized economy. Accessibility for Coinbase Users: Given Coinbase’s massive user base, this integration makes it incredibly easy for millions of users to bridge their ADA and LTC directly into the Base ecosystem, bypassing the complexities often associated with cross-chain transfers. New Trading Pairs: Expect to see new trading pairs emerge on DEXs on Base, allowing for more diverse trading strategies and opportunities for arbitrage. This move underscores a growing trend in the crypto space: the push for greater interoperability and utility across different blockchain networks. By facilitating the seamless flow of value, Coinbase is contributing to a more integrated and user-friendly DeFi landscape. Navigating the Future: Challenges and What’s Next for Coinbase Base While the launch of cbADA and cbLTC on Coinbase Base is undoubtedly a positive development, it’s also important to consider the potential challenges and the road ahead. The primary consideration for any wrapped token solution is trust and centralization. Since Coinbase is the entity facilitating the wrapping and unwrapping of these tokens, users are inherently trusting Coinbase to custody the underlying ADA and LTC assets securely. Key considerations include: Centralization Risk: While Base itself is decentralized, the issuance of cbADA and cbLTC relies on Coinbase as a centralized custodian. This introduces a point of trust that users must be comfortable with. Smart Contract Security: The smart contracts governing the wrapping and unwrapping process on Base must be rigorously audited and secure to prevent vulnerabilities. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for wrapped tokens and Layer-2 solutions could impact future operations. Looking ahead, this launch could be just the beginning. We might see Coinbase introduce wrapped versions of other popular cryptocurrencies on Base, further expanding the network’s utility and attracting more users. This also strengthens Base’s position as a leading Layer-2 solution, potentially fostering more innovation and dApp development within its ecosystem. The success of cbADA and cbLTC will likely dictate the pace and scope of future wrapped asset integrations. In conclusion, Coinbase’s launch of cbADA and cbLTC on its Base Layer-2 network is a monumental step towards a more interconnected and efficient decentralized financial future. By bridging the gap between distinct blockchain ecosystems, Coinbase is not only enhancing the utility of Cardano and Litecoin but also reinforcing Base’s position as a crucial player in the Ethereum scaling solution landscape. This move promises lower fees, faster transactions, and expanded DeFi opportunities for a broader audience, paving the way for a truly accessible and interoperable crypto economy. As the Base ecosystem continues to mature, we can expect even more innovative applications and increased liquidity, further solidifying its role in the evolution of decentralized finance.

Resupply, a stablecoin protocol, confirmed a substantial security breach resulting in a $9.5 million loss. This incident underscores the critical importance of robust security measures and swift response in the volatile realm of digital assets, especially for those interested in the future of decentralized finance. Understanding the Resupply Exploit: What Exactly Happened? In a recent announcement via X (formerly Twitter), the Resupply team detailed the specifics of the exploit. The Resupply exploit was meticulously targeted, focusing solely on the market within their protocol. This precision attack led to a staggering $9.5 million being siphoned off, sending ripples of concern throughout the DeFi community. The immediate identification and pausing of the compromised smart contract hack was a crucial step, preventing further losses and demonstrating a rapid response capability by the Resupply team. While the market bore the brunt of the attack, it’s reassuring to note that the rest of the stablecoin protocol remains operational, a testament to the protocol’s modular design and the team’s quick containment efforts. A full post-mortem analysis is promised, which will undoubtedly shed more light on the intricate details of the vulnerability and the exploit’s mechanics. Why Are Smart Contract Hacks a Persistent Threat in DeFi Security? The incident at Resupply is not an isolated event. Smart contract hack incidents have become an unfortunate recurring theme in the decentralized finance landscape. These vulnerabilities often stem from a confluence of factors that challenge even the most robust DeFi security frameworks: Complexity: DeFi protocols are intricate systems, often built on layers of smart contracts interacting with each other. This complexity inherently increases the attack surface for malicious actors. Immutability: Once deployed, smart contracts are designed to be difficult, if not impossible, to alter. A bug, once exploited, can lead to catastrophic and irreversible losses. Composability Risks: The ‘money legos’ nature of DeFi, where protocols build upon and interact with each other, means a vulnerability in one underlying protocol can have cascading effects across the ecosystem. Audit Limitations: While security audits are crucial, even well-audited contracts can harbor undiscovered flaws, especially zero-day exploits that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities. Novelty: The DeFi space is constantly innovating, pushing new boundaries with experimental financial products. This rapid development sometimes outpaces thorough security testing and established best practices. The Resupply incident highlights that even established stablecoin protocols , which are often seen as pillars of stability within the volatile crypto market, are not immune to sophisticated attacks. This reinforces the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation in DeFi security practices. Strengthening DeFi: Lessons from Every Crypto Vulnerability Every crypto vulnerability , including the recent Resupply exploit , offers invaluable lessons for the entire ecosystem. For users, it’s a stark reminder to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before interacting with any protocol. For developers and project teams, it emphasizes the absolute necessity of a multi-faceted approach to security: Rigorous Audits: Engage multiple, independent security audits by reputable firms specializing in blockchain security. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivize white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities and report them responsibly before malicious actors can exploit them. Decentralized Incident Response: Establish clear protocols for rapid response, including the ability to pause specific functions or markets, and transparent communication strategies. Continuous Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring systems to detect anomalous activities, unusual transaction patterns, or potential exploits as they happen. Community Engagement: Foster an active and vigilant community that can help identify and report potential issues, acting as an additional layer of oversight. The swift action taken by Resupply to pause the compromised contract and communicate transparently is a positive example of effective incident management in the face of a significant smart contract hack . This level of responsiveness is vital for maintaining user trust and ensuring the long-term viability of stablecoin protocols and the broader DeFi ecosystem. The Road Ahead for Resupply and the Future of DeFi Security As Resupply prepares to release its full post-mortem, the focus will shift towards understanding the root cause of the crypto vulnerability and implementing robust measures to prevent future occurrences. Rebuilding trust after a significant exploit is a challenging but achievable goal. Protocols that demonstrate transparency, accountability, and a commitment to enhanced DeFi security often emerge stronger from such trials, learning from their experiences to build more resilient systems. The incident serves as a crucial reminder that while DeFi offers unparalleled opportunities for financial innovation and inclusion, it also comes with inherent risks. The ongoing battle against malicious actors requires a collective effort from developers, auditors, users, and the wider community to continuously fortify the digital infrastructure that underpins this revolutionary financial system. Vigilance and continuous improvement are not just buzzwords; they are necessities for survival and growth in this dynamic space. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Protocol Users? For users of stablecoin protocols and other DeFi platforms, this incident reinforces several key takeaways that can help navigate the risks: Diversify Your Holdings: Never put all your funds into a single protocol, regardless of its perceived safety. Spreading your investments can mitigate potential losses from a single exploit. Stay Informed: Follow official channels for updates and announcements, especially during security incidents. Reliable information is crucial. Understand the Risks: Be aware that even well-established projects can suffer from a smart contract hack . Understand the specific risks associated with each protocol you use. Prioritize Transparency: Support protocols that are transparent about their security measures, audit reports, and incident responses. Transparency builds trust and indicates a commitment to user safety. The Resupply exploit , while unfortunate, is a critical learning experience for the entire decentralized finance industry. It highlights the continuous need for innovation not just in financial products, but equally in the sophisticated security mechanisms required to protect them, fostering a more secure and resilient future for all participants.

On Thursday, during a summit in Brussels, EU officials said a new American proposal had been submitted and shared with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who then pushed it to EU leaders. The offer, described by officials as just an “outline” with “a couple of points,” showed up while the bloc scrambles to avoid steep new tariffs that Trump has set for July 9. The US president had previously warned that if no deal is reached by that date, tariffs would go up. According to Bloomberg, the China deal was confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said during an interview that “that deal was signed and sealed two days ago.” He didn’t elaborate on what’s in the document. Just hours earlier, Trump himself told reporters at the White House, “We just signed with China yesterday,” but offered no explanation. The agreement is based on trade talks that happened last month in Geneva, though no final text has been released publicly. White House pushes deadline but says Trump can act unilaterally Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, said on Thursday that Trump’s July 8 and 9 deadlines for restoring full reciprocal tariffs aren’t fixed in stone. “Perhaps it could be extended, but that’s a decision for the president to make,” Leavitt told reporters. She made it clear that even if countries refuse to sign a deal by the deadline, Trump still has options. “The president can simply provide these countries with a deal,” she said. “And that means the president can pick a reciprocal tariff rate that he believes is advantageous for the United States, and for the American worker.” Leavitt’s statement triggered an immediate rise in stocks during Thursday’s session, with investors reacting to the idea that the president might give countries more time. This comes after Trump rolled out reciprocal tariffs in early April on nearly all imports. A 90-day pause was granted for any tariff amounts above 10%, and that grace period runs out on July 8. In late May, Trump went a step further. He threatened to slap a 50% tariff on all goods coming from the European Union. These countries were already hit with the April tariffs. But after von der Leyen asked for more time to finalize a deal, Trump agreed to delay the extra tariff until July 9. That’s the exact window EU leaders are trying to navigate right now with the fresh US proposal. Trump admin expects deals after tax bill clears Congress With only two deals, China and the United Kingdom, done out of a goal of 90 in 90 days, the White House is far behind its own timeline. Both agreements have been described as incomplete frameworks with no final terms released. One deal that keeps getting mentioned is with India, but that hasn’t happened yet. Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, told Fox Business this week, “We know that we’re very, very close to a few countries.” He added that more agreements are expected once Congress passes Trump’s large-scale tax-and-spending bill, which the president wants signed by July 4. Hassett said, “I think you’re going to see a sequence of trade bills” starting from that date. Back in June, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified before the House Ways and Means Committee, saying it’s “highly likely” that Trump will extend the tariff pause beyond July 8 for countries negotiating in good faith. Stephen Miran, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Yahoo Finance the same thing: “I don’t see why [tariff] rates would snap back higher” if talks are ongoing and serious. Still, none of these statements come with hard guarantees. What’s happening is a calculated game of pressure. The administration’s current stance is that Trump can impose or extend tariffs unilaterally, especially if he believes doing so benefits US industries. With China’s deal already completed and EU leaders now reviewing a last-minute American proposal, the heat is rising fast. Negotiations are now running on a tight clock. The EU knows exactly what’s coming if there’s no agreement by July 9. Trump’s team has already drawn the line. He’s offered a proposal. He’s closed with China. And if no other country wants to sit down and finalize something? The White House says he’ll simply impose his own terms.

This trend provides critical insight into miner behavior, according to the latest report by CryptoQuant. Bitcoin Miners Show Patience Historically, BTC.com increases its outflows to Binance when Bitcoin’s price rises, indicating strategic profit-taking at local tops. On the other hand, when flows drop, it reflects growing miner confidence, as they choose to hold their Bitcoin rather than sell. Interestingly, despite Bitcoin trading above $100K in recent months, BTC.com’s flows to Binance have sharply declined. This suggests that miners are anticipating further price appreciation and are reducing selling pressure, potentially supporting a more sustained rally. “Miners are among the smartest players in the market. Watching their moves helps us understand where we are in the cycle.” Zooming out, a deeper look at network-level data reveals a “seasonal” trend. Hash Rate Seasonality The latest development comes as Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000 this weekend after reports emerged of a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites, dropping to $98,000 in a swift response to geopolitical tensions. However, the dip was short-lived, as the crypto asset rebounded by early Monday. Despite the recent price milestones, Bitcoin’s on-chain transaction fees remain weak, as per the latest observation by Digital Mining Solutions. In 2025, fees have consistently accounted for less than 1% of the total block reward and have failed to offset the halving-induced subsidy cuts. This weak fee environment means miner revenue, or hash price, is tightly correlated to Bitcoin’s price. When BTC falls, hashprice drops nearly in sync, with minimal fee support to cushion the decline. Bitcoin’s network hash rate has been highly volatile this year, and has seen several record highs and sharp drops. It peaked at 950 EH/s in mid-June before plunging to 827 EH/s – a 13% decline.

Bloomberg, citing info from Crane Data LLC, reports that the amount of capital invested in the money-market industry has now soared to a record $7.4 trillion, with $320 billion pouring into the funds in 2025 so far. Money-market funds are financial instruments that allow people to invest in lower-risk and short-term debt securities, including US Treasuries. Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes, tells Bloomberg that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing monetary policy choices suggest the money market industry could continue to grow and easily stretch to $7.5 trillion in assets this year. “Five-percent-plus rates were nirvana, four-percent-plus is still very good – and if we dip down into the high threes, that’s quite acceptable as well.” The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced last week that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. Michael Bird, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, tells Bloomberg that it’s “not surprising” that asset levels in the money-market sector have grown. “Even if the Fed picks up its easing campaign this year, rates will still be relatively high…” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The exchange has temporarily suspended all deposits and withdrawals of the FLR token . This crucial decision stems from a significant technical issue: a halt in block production on the underlying Flare network. For anyone holding or trading FLR, understanding the implications of this Upbit FLR suspension is paramount. Why the Upbit FLR Suspension Matters When a major crypto exchange like Upbit announces a suspension of services for a particular asset, it sends ripples through the market. Upbit, being one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, plays a vital role in the global crypto ecosystem. Their official statement highlighted that the immediate cause for the suspension was an issue directly related to the Flare network itself. Specifically, the network experienced a complete halt in its block production, which is akin to a blockchain’s heartbeat stopping. Without new blocks being produced, transactions cannot be processed, making any deposit or withdrawal activity impossible and unsafe for users. This proactive measure by Upbit is standard protocol to protect user funds and prevent potential issues during network instability. While inconvenient, such suspensions are often necessary to maintain the integrity of transactions and ensure the security of assets on the platform. Understanding the Critical Flare Network Halt So, what exactly does a ‘halt in block production’ mean for a blockchain network like Flare? Imagine a train track where trains (transactions) move from station to station (blocks). If the track construction suddenly stops, no new trains can move forward. In blockchain terms, a halt means that the network is no longer able to validate and add new transactions to the ledger. This can happen for various reasons, including: Consensus mechanism issues: Problems with how network participants agree on the next block. Software bugs: Unforeseen errors in the network’s code. Network congestion: Although less common for a full halt, extreme congestion can lead to processing failures. Security incidents: While not confirmed in this case, attacks can sometimes disrupt block production. The Flare network halt directly impacts the usability of the FLR token, as its movement relies entirely on the underlying network’s functionality. Until the Flare team resolves the issue and block production resumes, the token remains in a state of operational limbo. What This Means for FLR Token Holders For individuals holding the FLR token on Upbit, the immediate consequence is the inability to move their assets. This means you cannot deposit more FLR into your Upbit account or withdraw existing FLR to an external wallet or another exchange. It’s important to note that your funds are typically safe during such suspensions, as the exchange is preventing transactions, not accessing your holdings. Key considerations for FLR token holders: Patience is key: Network issues are usually temporary, and development teams work diligently to resolve them. Stay informed: Monitor official announcements from Upbit and the Flare Network’s official channels (website, Twitter, Discord) for updates on the resolution. Consider your strategy: While you cannot move FLR on Upbit, if you hold FLR on other exchanges or in self-custody wallets, their functionality might vary depending on their integration with Flare and the network’s overall status. Navigating Crypto Deposit Withdrawal Challenges The situation with Upbit and FLR highlights a broader challenge within the cryptocurrency space: the occasional necessity for exchanges to implement crypto deposit withdrawal suspensions. These measures are not unique to Upbit or Flare and can occur across any blockchain or exchange due to a variety of factors, including: Network upgrades: Scheduled maintenance or hard forks. Security audits: Temporary halts for routine security checks. Regulatory compliance: Adjustments to meet new legal requirements. High network fees/congestion: To prevent users from incurring excessive costs for failed transactions. While frustrating for users, these actions are often taken to safeguard assets and ensure a smooth, secure trading environment once the underlying issue is resolved. It underscores the importance of understanding the operational nuances of both the tokens you hold and the exchanges you use. The Role of Upbit Crypto Exchange in Crisis Management As a leading Upbit crypto exchange , its response to such incidents is crucial for maintaining user trust and market stability. Upbit’s swift announcement demonstrates transparency and a commitment to keeping its users informed. In such situations, the exchange’s primary responsibilities include: Immediate communication: Notifying users promptly about the suspension and its reasons. Monitoring and coordination: Working closely with the Flare network’s development team to get real-time updates on the issue’s resolution. Ensuring asset safety: Protecting user funds during the downtime. Resumption of services: Reinstating deposit and withdrawal functionality as soon as the network stabilizes and it’s safe to do so. Users should always rely on official announcements from Upbit’s website or their verified social media channels for the most accurate and timely information regarding the resumption of FLR services. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Dynamic Crypto Landscape The temporary Upbit FLR suspension due to a Flare network halt serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such incidents can cause concern, they are often temporary operational hurdles that blockchain networks and exchanges navigate. For FLR token holders and users of the Upbit crypto exchange , the best course of action is to remain calm, verify information from official sources, and patiently await updates. The ability to perform a seamless crypto deposit withdrawal is fundamental to the user experience, and exchanges like Upbit are typically quick to restore these services once network stability is assured.

While both tokens are trading below their year-to-date highs, analysts aren’t writing them off just yet. Technical signals, community sentiment, and macro catalysts suggest strong moves could be brewing—but there’s another token that’s starting to outshine them on watchlists: MAGACOIN FINANCE , an early-stage presale project quietly generating serious heat. XRP Looks Poised—But Needs Catalysts to Deliver XRP is currently hovering around the $2.17–$2.20 range, locked in a period of tight consolidation. At first glance, the sideways movement might appear uninspiring. But under the hood, something different is happening. Whale transactions to exchanges have dropped off completely. The number of wallets holding more than 1 million XRP just hit a 12-year high. Daily active addresses are surging. All signs point to quiet accumulation. Traders are now watching for the next leg up. Forecasts suggest a move to $2.50 is in play if current momentum holds, with $3.00 firmly on the table if institutional demand reappears and ETF chatter intensifies. The MVRV Z-score—an often overlooked but historically accurate valuation tool—still places XRP well below its overbought zone, suggesting there’s room for growth. But even with all this lining up, XRP remains dependent on macro factors: legal clarity, regulatory shifts, and broader market sentiment. It’s a heavyweight asset—but it still needs a green light to sprint. Dogecoin’s Next Act May Come From the Crowd Dogecoin, currently trading around $0.17, is far from its 2021 peak. Volume has cooled, and sentiment remains mixed. But the technicals are whispering something different. DOGE is moving within a symmetrical triangle—a classic breakout pattern. If it cracks $0.22, analysts say a move to $0.35 or even $0.36 could follow quickly. As always, Dogecoin’s power lies in its community. It doesn’t need institutional adoption or DeFi utility to pump. It just needs attention—and in past cycles, that’s been enough. With Bitcoin expected to stabilize during the summer, altcoins like DOGE could ride the wave of renewed interest. But traders remain cautious. A rally isn’t guaranteed. Without strong external hype, the price could remain capped near $0.30. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Challenger Turning Heads in Q3 While XRP and Dogecoin prepare for their next potential moves, a much newer name is generating the kind of speculative momentum that hasn’t been seen since early SHIBA or PEPE. MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in presale—but that hasn’t stopped it from attracting thousands of early adopters and a fast-growing base of online supporters. It’s not just the memes or the messaging. MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a high-volatility, fixed-supply ecosystem at the intersection of politics, finance, and decentralized speculation. With 170 billion tokens locked as the total supply, traders see a clear path for explosive growth—especially once the token hits public markets. Presale access remains limited, but interest is growing daily. While XRP and DOGE fight to regain relevance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something even more valuable: the chance to get in early on a high-risk, high-reward altcoin narrative before the crowd catches on. Final Word: Traders Are Watching—but Investors Are Acting There’s no doubt XRP and Dogecoin will be closely watched in Q3. Technical setups are aligned. Forecasts hint at upside. But both rely on catalysts outside their control—whether that’s regulatory breakthroughs or revived community enthusiasm. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already moving. It doesn’t need to reclaim lost ground. It’s starting from scratch—and racing upward. For traders who missed the last wave of viral presales, this may be the only second chance worth taking.

If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz around its incredible potential. The cryptocurrency world is often a whirlwind of rapid movements and unexpected turns, but savvy analysts look for underlying patterns to guide their predictions. One such pattern, highlighted by crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., points to a compelling indicator for future growth: the persistent accumulation by Long-Term Holders (LTHs). This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a historical blueprint that has previously paved the way for significant rallies, making it a crucial signal for anyone interested in the future trajectory of the leading digital asset. Understanding Long-Term Holders: The Backbone of Bitcoin’s Strength Who exactly are these Long-Term Holders , and why does their behavior matter so much for Bitcoin ‘s market dynamics? LTHs are individuals or entities who hold their BTC for extended periods, typically over 155 days, signaling a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value rather than short-term speculative gains. They are often seen as the ‘diamond hands’ of the crypto space, less likely to sell during price dips and more inclined to buy during periods of consolidation or even correction. Reduced Selling Pressure: When LTHs accumulate, it means fewer coins are available on exchanges for sale, naturally tightening supply. Strong Conviction: Their holding behavior reflects a deep belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and future appreciation. Market Stability: LTHs act as a stabilizing force, absorbing supply and reducing volatility compared to short-term traders. Their collective actions provide a powerful insight into the underlying sentiment of the market’s most patient participants. When these experienced investors are actively increasing their positions, it often suggests they anticipate significant upward movement, reinforcing the overall bullish outlook for the asset. Historical Precedent: When LTH Accumulation Ignited Bitcoin’s Rallies Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis isn’t based on mere speculation; it’s rooted in observable historical patterns that have consistently preceded major Bitcoin surges. Examining past cycles reveals a clear correlation between sustained LTH accumulation and subsequent price explosions. This isn’t just anecdotal evidence; it’s a recurring theme in Bitcoin’s journey. Consider these compelling examples from Bitcoin’s history: Accumulation Period (Approx. BTC Price) LTH Action Subsequent Price Rally (Approx. Target) Timeframe $28,000 Ramped up long positions Jumped to $60,000 Approx. 2 months later $60,000 Continued strong accumulation Rose to $100,000 Following period These instances are not isolated. They demonstrate a consistent pattern where a period of quiet, yet persistent, accumulation by LTHs sets the stage for explosive upward movements. This behavior is akin to winding a spring; the more it’s compressed, the more force it releases when unleashed. For Bitcoin , LTH accumulation represents that compression. Current Trends: What Does LTH Accumulation Signal for Bitcoin’s Price Prediction? If history is any guide, the current robust accumulation by Long-Term Holders paints an incredibly optimistic picture for Bitcoin ‘s immediate future. Analyst Axel Adler Jr. explicitly states that if the present situation mirrors past cycles, the flagship cryptocurrency is poised for a significant rally, potentially targeting a remarkable $160,000. This projection isn’t merely a hopeful guess; it’s an extrapolation based on established market behavior. The fact that LTHs are consistently building their positions, even amidst market fluctuations, underscores a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. They are not deterred by short-term volatility, instead viewing current prices as opportune entry points for future gains. This sustained accumulation reduces the circulating supply available for sale, creating an environment ripe for upward price pressure when demand eventually surges. The Broader Crypto Market: How Bitcoin’s Trajectory Influences Altcoins Bitcoin ‘s dominance often dictates the overall sentiment and direction of the wider crypto market . As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its movements have a ripple effect across thousands of altcoins. When Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, it often pulls the entire market upward, leading to an ‘altcoin season’ where other cryptocurrencies also see substantial gains. Why is Bitcoin’s performance so pivotal? Gateway Asset: Bitcoin is typically the first cryptocurrency institutional and retail investors buy, acting as the primary entry point into the crypto ecosystem. Liquidity Anchor: Its sheer size provides a foundational layer of liquidity that supports the entire market. Sentiment Driver: Positive news or price action for Bitcoin tends to generate broader enthusiasm and investor confidence across the board. Therefore, if LTH accumulation indeed propels Bitcoin towards the $160,000 mark, it’s highly probable that we will witness a broader bullish trend engulfing the entire crypto market , offering opportunities across various digital assets. This interconnectedness means that understanding Bitcoin’s signals is paramount for navigating the broader crypto landscape. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors While the signals from Long-Term Holders are undeniably bullish, it’s crucial for investors to approach the crypto market with a well-informed strategy. A potential Bitcoin price prediction of $160,000 is exciting, but responsible investing requires diligence and a clear understanding of both opportunities and risks. What Should Investors Consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying fundamentals of any asset you invest in. Analyst predictions are indicators, not guarantees. Long-Term Perspective: Emulate the LTHs. Bitcoin’s volatility can be intense in the short term, but its long-term trend has historically been upward. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, if appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments that could influence the market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, to smooth out market volatility and benefit from long-term accumulation . The consistent accumulation by LTHs is a powerful vote of confidence, but the path to $160,000, while projected, will likely not be a straight line. Market corrections and unexpected events are always possible, making a resilient strategy essential. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Remarkable Journey Continues, Fueled by LTH Conviction The compelling evidence presented by analyst Axel Adler Jr. regarding Long-Term Holders ‘ persistent accumulation provides a potent bullish narrative for Bitcoin . This isn’t just about a hopeful price prediction ; it’s about understanding the deep-seated confidence of the most committed participants in the crypto market . History has repeatedly shown that when LTHs are actively building their positions, significant rallies often follow, transforming what might seem like ordinary market activity into a prelude for extraordinary gains. As Bitcoin continues its remarkable journey, the unwavering conviction of its LTHs serves as a powerful testament to its enduring value proposition. While no investment is without risk, the current patterns suggest a future brimming with potential, positioning Bitcoin for what could be one of its most impressive surges yet. For those looking to understand the core drivers of Bitcoin’s next potential leap, the actions of its long-term holders offer an invaluable compass.

For businesses and investors navigating the volatile yet promising world of cryptocurrencies, clarity in financial reporting is not just a preference—it’s an absolute necessity. In a significant move that underscores its progressive stance on financial innovation, the Central Bank of Brazil is stepping up to address this critical need, ushering in a new era for digital asset accounting . Why Brazil Crypto Regulation is Taking Center Stage Brazil has long been recognized as a trailblazer in financial technology adoption, from its highly successful PIX instant payment system to its proactive exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This innovative spirit extends naturally to its approach to cryptocurrencies. The recent announcement from the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) to update its accounting rules for digital assets held by companies is not just a bureaucratic formality; it’s a strategic move to integrate digital finance more seamlessly into the traditional economy. This forward-thinking approach aims to provide the much-needed legal and accounting certainty that institutional players and large corporations require to fully embrace the digital asset space. It signals Brazil’s commitment to fostering a secure and transparent environment for crypto innovation, setting a precedent for other nations to follow. Understanding the Nuances of Digital Asset Accounting For many years, companies holding cryptocurrencies or engaging in digital asset activities have faced significant ambiguity regarding how these assets should be classified and reported on their balance sheets. Unlike traditional assets, digital assets possess unique characteristics, such as decentralization, pseudonymity, and high price volatility, which pose complex challenges for conventional accounting principles. The BCB’s initiative seeks to demystify this process, providing specific guidelines for various types of digital assets. This includes, but is not limited to, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, stablecoins, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and even potential future CBDCs. The new rules will clarify how companies should record assets that are: Issued: How to account for tokens or digital currencies that a company itself creates and issues. Received: Guidelines for recording digital assets obtained through sales, services, or investments. Held in Custody: Clear rules for financial institutions or service providers that hold digital assets on behalf of clients. This comprehensive approach is vital for ensuring accurate financial statements, which in turn builds investor confidence and reduces regulatory risk for businesses operating in the crypto sphere. The Role of the Central Bank Brazil in Shaping Crypto Policy The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has consistently demonstrated a pragmatic and measured approach to financial innovation. Rather than outright bans or excessive restrictions, the BCB has opted for a strategy of understanding, adapting, and integrating new technologies into its regulatory framework. This latest update to accounting rules is a testament to this philosophy. By initiating a public consultation on the regulatory draft, which began on August 24, the BCB is inviting stakeholders—including crypto companies, financial institutions, accounting firms, and the general public—to provide feedback. This collaborative approach is crucial for developing robust and practical regulations that truly serve the needs of the market while safeguarding financial stability. The BCB’s proactive engagement helps ensure that the new rules are not just theoretically sound but also operationally feasible for businesses navigating the complexities of digital assets. Setting New Crypto Accounting Standards: A Global Precedent? The move by Brazil’s central bank comes at a time when global financial bodies and national regulators are grappling with the challenge of establishing clear crypto accounting standards . Currently, there’s no universally accepted framework, leading to inconsistencies in how digital assets are treated across different jurisdictions. Some countries classify them as intangible assets, others as commodities, and some even as currencies. Brazil’s detailed approach, particularly its inclusion of specific scenarios like staking and airdrops, could potentially serve as a blueprint or at least a significant case study for other nations and international standard-setting bodies like the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) or the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). By providing clear guidelines for these complex transactions, Brazil is contributing to the broader effort to bring greater transparency and comparability to financial reporting in the digital asset space. This clarity is essential for fostering institutional adoption and integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system. Navigating Staking and Airdrops Accounting Complexities One of the most anticipated aspects of the BCB’s new rules is their specific coverage of assets derived from staking and airdrops accounting . These activities, while common in the crypto world, present unique accounting challenges: Staking: When users lock up their cryptocurrencies to support the operations of a blockchain network, they often receive rewards in return. The accounting treatment of these rewards – whether they are considered income, a new asset, or something else – has been a grey area. The new rules are expected to provide clarity on when and how these rewards should be recognized and valued. Airdrops: These are distributions of free tokens to a large number of cryptocurrency wallet addresses, often as a marketing strategy or a way to decentralize ownership. Determining the fair value of airdropped tokens, especially if they have no immediate market, and how they impact a company’s income or assets, has been a significant hurdle. By addressing these specific scenarios, the BCB is demonstrating a deep understanding of the intricacies of the crypto ecosystem, moving beyond generic definitions to provide actionable guidance for businesses engaged in these popular activities. This will undoubtedly reduce uncertainty and help companies ensure compliance with tax and financial reporting obligations. Benefits of Clear Digital Asset Accounting Rules The implementation of updated accounting rules for digital assets offers a multitude of benefits for the Brazilian economy and its participants: Enhanced Transparency: Clear rules lead to more accurate and comparable financial statements, providing stakeholders with a true picture of a company’s digital asset holdings and activities. Increased Investor Confidence: With greater transparency and reduced accounting ambiguity, investors, both domestic and international, will feel more secure in allocating capital to companies involved in the digital asset space. Reduced Regulatory Risk: Businesses will have a clearer understanding of their obligations, minimizing the risk of non-compliance, penalties, and legal challenges. Facilitated Institutional Adoption: Financial institutions and large corporations, which often operate under strict accounting standards, will find it easier to engage with digital assets once the accounting framework is clear. Improved Tax Compliance: Clear accounting rules naturally pave the way for more straightforward tax reporting and collection related to digital asset activities. Fostering Innovation: By providing a stable regulatory environment, Brazil encourages further innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, attracting talent and investment. Challenges on the Horizon While the move is overwhelmingly positive, implementing these new rules won’t be without its challenges: Complexity of Digital Assets: The sheer variety and evolving nature of digital assets mean that accounting rules must be flexible enough to adapt to future innovations. Valuation Difficulties: The volatile nature of many cryptocurrencies can make consistent and accurate valuation challenging, requiring frequent re-evaluations. Need for Skilled Professionals: Companies will require accountants and auditors with specialized knowledge of digital assets and blockchain technology to ensure proper implementation of the new rules. International Harmonization: As Brazil sets its standards, the challenge remains for these rules to align with, or at least be reconcilable with, global accounting practices to facilitate cross-border operations. Technological Integration: Accounting systems may need significant upgrades to accurately track and report digital asset transactions in accordance with the new guidelines. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors For companies currently holding or planning to engage with digital assets in Brazil, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Actively follow the public consultation process and the finalization of the new accounting rules by the Central Bank of Brazil. Assess Current Holdings: Conduct an internal audit of all digital assets currently held, including those from staking and airdrops, to understand their nature and volume. Engage with Experts: Seek advice from legal, accounting, and tax professionals who specialize in digital assets to understand the implications for your specific business. Prepare for System Updates: Evaluate your current accounting software and systems to determine if they can handle the new reporting requirements for digital assets. Provide Feedback: If you have insights or concerns, participate in the public consultation process to help shape the final regulatory framework. Train Your Team: Ensure your finance and accounting teams are educated on the specifics of digital asset accounting and the new Brazilian regulations. A New Dawn for Digital Finance in Brazil The Central Bank of Brazil’s initiative to update accounting rules for digital assets is a pivotal moment for the nation’s burgeoning digital finance sector. By providing much-needed clarity and structure, Brazil is not just reacting to the rise of cryptocurrencies; it is actively shaping a responsible and transparent future for them. This move will undoubtedly pave the way for greater institutional participation, foster innovation, and solidify Brazil’s position as a leader in the global digital economy. As the public consultation progresses and the final rules take shape, the entire crypto community will be watching, eager to see how this crucial step influences the broader conversation around digital asset regulation worldwide.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Bar-Nathan officially took the position in June. He joins Google Cloud from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, where he was CFO and was critical in steering Oracle’s financial strategy in its fast-paced expansion into cloud services. Before Oracle, he was in leadership roles at Microsoft, including in cloud finance, affording him a deep perspective on three of the world’s top five clouds. Alphabet has not posted any formal announcement, but a spokesman for the company confirmed to reporters that Bar-Nathan commenced in the new position in the past two weeks. Oracle declined to comment. Hiring move intensifies Cloud industry battle The hire recognizes the high-stakes race in a cloud-computing industry that has become increasingly competitive. Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are growing competitors in a space still heavily controlled by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. According to a report from Synergy Research Group, the market is currently dominated by Amazon, which has about 1/3 of the market share, followed by Microsoft. Google is number three, and Oracle is number five. Both companies are behind the top two, but they have made a name for themselves with aggressive pricing, AI integrations, and solutions for particular industries. Google has a unique advantage in Bar-Nathan’s diverse background. His understanding of Oracle’s internal cloud finance playbook could help Google Cloud fine-tune its pricing models, cost management, and go-to-market strategy. The move also stokes a rivalry between the two tech giants. It’s worth noting that Thomas Kurian, now CEO of Google Cloud, was a long-time Oracle executive next to Ellison, who left over reported disputes around the Oracle cloud strategy. Alphabet’s Google Cloud becomes AI growth engine Google Cloud has become one of Alphabet’s most promising business divisions . The former loss-making division has now posted several consecutive quarters of operating profits against many analysts’ expectations. Fuelled by Kurian’s leadership and Alphabet’s growing focus on AI-centric enterprise business segments, the division has become a strategic cornerstone of the company’s future expansion. The momentum also follows Google Cloud’s recent efforts to expand its AI structures. The company has increasingly been bulking up its AI product and service portfolio, particularly as it courts enterprise customers building large language models and generative AI apps on its cloud. Alphabet’s commitment to AI is aligned with cloud infrastructure. Over the past year, the company announced new data centers, bespoke AI chips (TPUs), growth, and new business partnerships in healthcare, finance, and retail. Oracle, meanwhile, has been following the same playbook. Oracle, the software and cloud company, made waves earlier this year with “Project Stargate,” a joint effort to provide OpenAI with enormous computing power. This is a sign that Oracle, too, has aggressive plans in the AI cloud race. The project is meant to strengthen Oracle’s infrastructure offerings and give it exposure to the developers building AI.

Binance , the global blockchain ecosystem, has officially announced the upcoming launch of the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract . This highly anticipated listing, set to go live on June 26 at 12:00 UTC, is generating significant buzz, especially with its staggering offer of up to 75x leverage . For traders seeking to amplify their positions and capitalize on market movements, this new contract presents a compelling opportunity. Understanding the SAHARA/USDT Perpetual Contract What exactly is a perpetual contract, and why is the SAHARA/USDT pairing significant? A perpetual contract is a type of futures contract that, unlike traditional futures, has no expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. It’s a cornerstone of modern crypto trading , offering flexibility and continuous exposure to price action. The SAHARA/USDT contract means you’ll be trading the SAHARA token against Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This pairing is popular for its stability and liquidity, making it easier for traders to enter and exit positions without significant slippage. While specific details about the SAHARA project itself are still emerging, its listing on Binance’s robust futures platform instantly grants it massive visibility and potential for increased liquidity. Key Features of Perpetual Contracts: No Expiry Date: Hold positions as long as you maintain margin. Funding Rate: A mechanism that keeps the contract price aligned with the underlying asset’s spot price. High Liquidity: Typically, perpetual contracts on major exchanges like Binance offer deep liquidity, allowing for efficient trading. Unleashing the Power of 75x Leverage: What Does it Mean for Traders? The headline feature of this new listing is undoubtedly the incredible 75x leverage . But what does this truly entail for your trading strategy? Leverage, in simple terms, is borrowed capital used to increase the potential return of an investment. With 75x leverage, a trader can control a position worth 75 times their initial capital (margin). For example, with just $100 of your own funds, you could open a position worth $7,500. This dramatically amplifies potential profits from even small price movements in the SAHARA/USDT pair. Benefits and Risks of High Leverage: While the allure of amplified gains is strong, it’s crucial to understand both sides of the coin: Benefits: Magnified Profits: Small price movements can lead to substantial gains. Capital Efficiency: You don’t need a large amount of capital to open significant positions. Diverse Strategies: Enables more complex trading strategies like hedging or arbitrage with less capital. Challenges and Risks: Amplified Losses: Just as profits are magnified, so are losses. A small adverse price movement can quickly wipe out your initial margin. Liquidation Risk: If your position moves against you and your margin falls below a certain threshold, your position will be automatically closed (liquidated) to prevent further losses. This is a common occurrence with high leverage. Increased Volatility Impact: Highly volatile assets, when traded with high leverage, can lead to rapid liquidations. Consider this simplified example of how leverage works: Leverage Initial Capital (Margin) Position Size Required Price Movement for 100% Loss (Approx.) 1x $100 $100 100% 10x $100 $1,000 10% 50x $100 $5,000 2% 75x $100 $7,500 ~1.33% As you can see, with 75x leverage , a mere 1.33% adverse price movement against your position could result in the loss of your entire initial margin. This underscores the critical need for robust risk management. Navigating High-Leverage Crypto Trading on Binance While the opportunity presented by the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract with 75x leverage is significant, success hinges on careful planning and disciplined execution. Binance offers a comprehensive suite of tools and features designed to help traders manage their positions effectively. Actionable Insights for Responsible Trading: Start Small: Especially if you’re new to high leverage, begin with small position sizes to get comfortable with the mechanics. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order. This is your most critical tool for risk management, automatically closing your position if the price moves against you beyond a predefined point, limiting potential losses. Understand Liquidation Price: Binance clearly displays your liquidation price. Always be aware of it and monitor your margin ratio. Don’t Over-Leverage: Just because 75x leverage is available doesn’t mean you have to use it. Many experienced traders opt for lower leverage (e.g., 5x, 10x, 20x) to reduce liquidation risk. Educate Yourself: Before diving in, thoroughly understand how Binance Futures works, including margin calls, funding rates, and different order types. Monitor Market Conditions: Crypto markets are highly volatile. Stay informed about market news, SAHARA-specific developments, and overall sentiment. What Does This Mean for the SAHARA Ecosystem? The listing of SAHARA/USDT on Binance Futures is a significant milestone for the SAHARA project. It brings: Increased Visibility: Exposure to Binance’s massive global user base. Enhanced Liquidity: Futures contracts often attract substantial trading volume, which can contribute to overall market depth for SAHARA. Price Discovery: The futures market can play a crucial role in the price discovery of an asset. Broader Adoption: Easier access for traders means more opportunities for the SAHARA token to be traded and utilized. While the primary focus of this announcement is the trading opportunity, the underlying project benefits immensely from such a high-profile listing on a leading exchange like Binance. Ready to Dive In? Your Next Steps For those looking to engage with the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract , ensure your Binance account is set up for Futures trading. Familiarize yourself with the platform’s features, especially risk management tools. Remember, high rewards come with high risks, and a well-thought-out strategy is your best asset. Binance continues to solidify its position as a leading platform for crypto trading , constantly expanding its offerings to meet the diverse needs of its global user base. The addition of SAHARA/USDT with 75x leverage is a testament to its commitment to providing cutting-edge trading instruments. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Trading The launch of the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract on Binance with an impressive 75x leverage capability marks a thrilling new chapter for the SAHARA project and the broader crypto trading community. While the potential for substantial gains is undeniable, the amplified risks associated with high leverage demand a cautious and informed approach. Traders who prioritize risk management, utilize stop-loss orders, and continuously educate themselves on market dynamics will be best positioned to navigate this exciting new opportunity. As the crypto market continues to evolve, offerings like these from Binance empower traders with diverse tools, but always remember: trade responsibly.

Dogecoin Awaits Critical Signal, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/boom-or-bust-dogecoin-awaits-critical-signal/,"Dogecoin changed hands near $0.162 in late-European trading on June 26, little changed on the day but still more than 13% above last Sunday’s swing low. Yet beneath that placid price action, the market is balancing on what YouTube analyst More Crypto Online calls “a wait-and-see situation” that could ignite either a decisive upside impulse or a slide back toward $0.14. Dogecoin Teeters On The Edge In a video published yesterday under the headline “Is DOGE About to CRASH or SOAR? Price Analysis & Scenarios,” the Elliott-wave commentator argues that the advance from the June 22 bottom remains incomplete. “The Doge chart is currently still, yeah, trying to reverse here to the upside from the swing low that formed on the 22nd of June,” he says at the outset, stressing that the rise so far is “only a three-wave move.” Because the structure has not yet printed the full five-wave sequence that typically inaugurates a new bullish trend, he cautions traders against assuming the worst is over. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal—But One Move Could Ruin It The technician locates that June 22 low inside a demand band between $0.15 and $0.14, a zone that also includes the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the May–June rally and sits just above April’s cycle through—his hard “invalidation point.” From there, Dogecoin bounced in what he labels an a-b-c recovery, with the third wave peaking at $0.169, exactly the 1.618 Fibonacci extension he looks for in a “healthy third wave.” If price can now carve a fourth-wave higher low and extend to a fifth-wave high near $0.174–$0.177, the analyst says, “we actually get five waves up and then we can add support … and we have a setup.” Until that confirmation, the move remains a “chameleon-like” B-wave—prone to deeper pullbacks than the more bullish wave-two alternative. The line in the sand is $0.158. “Any break now below $0.158 cents would indicate the upside-reversal attempt is failed and we fall back into the support region, maybe we’ll even test the $0.14 level,” he warns. Conversely, holding that micro-support and punching through the $0.17 handle would provide the first “evidence” that a durable bottom has formed. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target The stakes are high because, as the analyst points out, confirmation of a five-wave impulse would force subsequent corrections to respect a higher-low framework, allowing traders to reposition with clearer risk parameters. Failure would likely drag Dogecoin back into the wide consolidation range that has dominated June and risk flipping sentiment toward a protracted downside grind. For now, the memecoin’s near-term fate rests on whether buyers can engineer that final fifth-wave pop without first violating $0.158. “At the moment,” he concludes, “we’re in a wait-and-see situation to see if we actually get five waves up.” Until the chart resolves, Dogecoin remains suspended between a technical breakout and another leg down—boom or bust hinging on a single intraday signal. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.161.

Retail and institutional investors are reconsidering their bets, especially as some high-profile coins plateau and new opportunities emerge. With Cardano and Solana delivering consistent performance but fewer surprises, attention is turning toward XRP and a rising star in the presale market — MAGACOIN FINANCE . It isn’t merely a matter of timing when it relates to rotating capital. It’s a matter of momentum, structure, and future returns. XRP is building momentum with increasing institutional alliances. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE has blitzed the presale market with a scarcity-based supply model. Cardano’s Steady Climb Faces Investor Fatigue Cardano continues to grow incrementally, with considerable expansion on DeFi platforms like Minswap and increased institutional exposure through Nasdaq indexes. The network maintains focus on upgrades and ecosystem growth. But the silence on ETFs or exchanges clamping down has seen some investors looking for alternatives. Even considering ADA’s $0.69 to $0.76 projections for the quarter, hope is not exactly high. Lacking a strong catalyst on the table, Cardano can simply keep moving forward at its steady pace, not having much incentive to be over-invested by short-term speculators. Solana’s Performance Remains Strong — But Is It Tapped Out? Solana maintains its title as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains in operation. Projects like Raydium, Magic Eden, and Helium are thriving within its ecosystem. Solana’s real-time performance, with 65,000 transactions per second, remains impressive. Yet, resistance near the $175 mark has proven difficult to break. While a surge toward $200–$210 remains possible, many traders feel the coin is already pricing in much of its potential. As a result, eyes are drifting toward less saturated opportunities with greater upside. XRP Attracts Smart Money With Institutional Backing XRP is gaining serious traction in Q3 2025. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product is being adopted by over 200 U.S. financial institutions, cementing XRP’s use case in global payments. The legal clarity surrounding XRP has boosted investor confidence, especially as speculation grows around a possible ETF. Analysts are forecasting XRP to reach between $2.10 and $2.59 in the coming months. If ETF news or another partnership breaks, that range could move higher. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating the 2025 Presale Market MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads and winning capital from investors who previously focused on large-cap tokens. With a capped supply of 170 billion and no VC allocations, the tokenomics are built to reward early holders. Each stage of the presale is selling out rapidly, showing undeniable traction and urgency. The HashEx-audited smart contract has instilled trust across both retail and institutional sectors. Unlike many tokens, there are no hidden unlocks or supply surprises. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track for potential 35x returns — a bold forecast, but one gaining traction across investment circles. Its politically charged branding has added to its visibility, helping it stand apart from meme coins lacking substance. More than hype, the project is backed by a roadmap, transparency, and a clear growth trajectory. Should Investors Reallocate Now? With Cardano and Solana delivering slow gains and limited short-term catalysts, XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting high-volume attention. XRP brings real utility and institutional engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE brings fresh energy, supply control, and breakout potential that meme-era tokens once offered — but with structure. Analysts are calling this rotation one of the smarter moves of Q3. As market dynamics shift, early action often separates top performers from laggards. For investors looking at Q3 with growth in mind, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most compelling paths, as early presale stages sold out like hotcakes.

Trump’s frustration with Powell’s slow pace on easing interest rates has reached a point where he’s considering replacing him this summer. But despite the pressure, Powell still has most of his policy team on his side. According to a detailed report from the Wall Street Journal, while a couple of Trump’s own picks are now backing a July cut, most of the Fed’s twelve voting members still prefer holding steady. Inside the Fed, it’s not quiet. Tensions are building ahead of the July policy meeting, where the committee might be split down the middle. On one side, you have Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both appointed by Trump, who say they’re open to cutting. On the other, a larger group, including all the key reserve bank presidents, are arguing there’s no rush. Bowman caught everyone off guard when she said she would support a rate cut in July. She was just named the Fed’s vice chair for supervision a few months ago and was one of the most hawkish members last year, even voting against a 0.5-point cut in September. That switch in tone came fast. Trump’s own appointees push back, but remain outnumbered Waller is also leaning toward a cut. He echoed Bowman’s view just last week, telling reporters he’s now open to loosening rates sooner than later. This dual push from both governors made traders nervous. Betting markets showed the odds of a July rate cut rose from 14% the week before to nearly 25% after Bowman’s comments. It looked like momentum was shifting, until the rest of the committee stepped in. John Williams, the New York Fed President, was the first to push back. He said the current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% is still “entirely appropriate,” and made it clear that the Fed should wait for more data before taking action. “We need to be vigilant in analyzing the totality of the data to see how conditions evolve,” he said. After Williams, other Fed presidents followed with the same message: don’t move too soon. Kevin Burgett, an analyst at LHMeyer, said flatly that “Waller and Bowman are definitely still outliers versus the committee as a whole.” That’s not just talk. If both Bowman and Waller vote for a cut next month and the rest of the committee doesn’t, it’ll be a rare moment. It’s been 32 years since two Washington-based Fed governors dissented in the same meeting. The divide is real. Matthew Luzzetti, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said, “This is the most divided they’ve been in a good while.” The Fed’s internal projections make the disagreement even clearer. Of the voting members, ten support cutting rates two or three times before the year ends. Seven want to wait until 2026. The committee’s split is public now—and Trump is watching every move. He’s already pressuring Powell in public speeches and could name a new Fed chair soon. His options include any of the remaining six governors on the board, or an outsider when Adriana Kugler’s term ends in January. Tariff fears fuel more disagreement inside the Fed Trump’s loud demands for cheaper credit are clashing with warnings from economists inside the Fed. Powell, testifying before Congress this week, said the only reason rates haven’t already been cut is concern that new tariffs could trigger a new wave of inflation. Without those risks, the Fed might have acted already. Bowman and Waller argue there’s no real danger of that. Inflation has been dropping. Forecasts show that the Fed’s preferred inflation metric probably rose just 2.3% in the twelve months ending May, which is close enough to the 2% target. Waller thinks companies will absorb most of the tariff costs instead of passing them to shoppers. Bowman said the economy’s already slowing down and that means consumers won’t trigger another inflation spiral like the one seen in the early 2020s. But again, most Fed officials aren’t buying that. Williams pointed to a New York Fed survey showing that many businesses are passing all their tariff-related costs directly to consumers. Other economists believe companies may have front-loaded inventory before the tariffs hit, so the price impact just hasn’t shown up yet. With inflation memories still fresh, there’s concern that people are hyper-sensitive to even small price increases. That kind of panic can turn into real price pressure. Mary Daly, who runs the San Francisco Fed, also weighed in. She said that although she sees a path to lower rates later in the year, the risks of cutting now are too high. “I look more to the fall,” she told CNBC. Her voice adds to the majority who are saying: not yet. So, as July approaches, the Fed is walking a tightrope. Trump wants action. Bowman and Waller are nodding along. But Powell isn’t moving, at least not without more numbers. And the rest of the table is still on his side… for now.

Canadian cryptocurrency mining powerhouse, HIVE Digital Technologies, recently captivated the market with an announcement that vividly illustrates its robust financial health and astute foresight. As the fiscal year 2025 concluded, HIVE Digital proudly disclosed an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , a substantial portion of which is anchored by a significant 2,201 Bitcoin. This pivotal revelation offers more than just a financial snapshot; it provides profound insights into the operational prowess and sophisticated asset management framework of a true trailblazer in the digital economy. HIVE Digital’s Strategic Accumulation of Digital Asset Holdings What does it truly signify for a pioneering entity like HIVE Digital to command such a formidable sum in digital asset holdings ? This figure is not merely a number; it represents a meticulously curated portfolio of cryptocurrencies, predominantly Bitcoin, which HIVE has diligently mined and, critically, chosen to retain rather than immediately liquidate. This deliberate strategy transcends conventional corporate treasury management, reflecting a profound bullish conviction in the enduring value of these assets and a proactive decision to fortify its financial bedrock. A Modern Treasury Approach: Unlike traditional corporations that might hold cash or government bonds, HIVE Digital’s treasury strategy embraces the native assets of the digital realm. This approach positions them to directly benefit from the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Balance Sheet Fortification: These substantial holdings are a direct infusion of strength into the company’s balance sheet. They serve as a formidable reserve, offering unparalleled flexibility to fund future operational expansions, invest in cutting-edge technologies, or provide a vital buffer during inevitable market downturns. Unwavering Market Confidence: By choosing to ‘HODL’ a significant portion of its self-mined assets, HIVE Digital unequivocally signals its deep-seated confidence in the long-term appreciation trajectory of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the charge. This transparency can foster immense trust among investors, demonstrating that the company’s interests are intrinsically aligned with the success of the broader crypto ecosystem. What Does HIVE Digital’s Bitcoin Portfolio Reveal? The precise mention of 2,201 Bitcoin as a cornerstone of HIVE Digital’s treasury illuminates a critical facet of its financial strategy. Bitcoin, often hailed as ‘digital gold,’ remains the preeminent cryptocurrency, serving as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . For a dedicated mining company, accumulating and safeguarding such a significant Bitcoin portfolio is a nuanced strategic maneuver that extends far beyond routine operational considerations. The HODL Philosophy in Action: HIVE’s decision to hold over two thousand Bitcoin is a clear manifestation of a ‘HODL’ strategy. This implies a calculated long-term bet on Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, indicating that the company is not merely covering immediate operational expenses but actively building wealth through asset accumulation. Proof of Operational Excellence: The ability to retain such a large Bitcoin reserve strongly suggests that HIVE Digital’s mining operations are not just profitable, but exceptionally efficient. They are generating enough revenue to comfortably cover their considerable expenses without being forced to liquidate all their freshly mined Bitcoin. This speaks volumes about their rigorous cost management, energy optimization, and overall operational superiority, especially in light of the escalating mining difficulty and the recent Bitcoin halving events that compress margins for many miners. Strategic Market Exposure: This substantial Bitcoin portfolio also provides HIVE Digital with direct and significant exposure to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. While this introduces a degree of volatility to their balance sheet, it also offers immense upside potential, allowing the company’s valuation to soar during pronounced bull markets, directly benefiting shareholders. The Dynamics of Cryptocurrency Mining in Today’s Market The landscape of cryptocurrency mining is a relentless arena of innovation, constantly reshaped by technological breakthroughs, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the fluctuating economics of energy. Companies like HIVE Digital operate at the vanguard of this demanding industry, where sustained success is inextricably linked to unparalleled efficiency and visionary strategic planning. Sustainability as a Core Pillar: A paramount consideration in modern crypto mining is energy consumption. HIVE Digital has consistently championed its unwavering commitment to harnessing sustainable and green energy sources. This dedication is not merely an environmental statement; it’s a strategic imperative that significantly reduces operational costs, enhances their global reputation, and aligns perfectly with critical ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment criteria. This focus on clean energy also mitigates regulatory risks associated with high energy usage. Relentless Hardware Innovation: To maintain a competitive edge, mining companies must perpetually invest in the most advanced and energy-efficient mining hardware. This necessitates substantial capital expenditure, a challenge that robust digital asset holdings can effectively help finance, ensuring HIVE remains at the technological forefront. Navigating Halving Events: Bitcoin’s programmed halving events, which periodically halve the block reward for miners, represent a significant operational hurdle. These events fundamentally alter the revenue model. However, companies possessing strong balance sheets, exemplified by HIVE Digital’s asset base, and highly efficient operations are uniquely positioned to weather these periods of reduced revenue. They can often consolidate their market share as less efficient or undercapitalized miners are compelled to exit the industry, making the strong stronger. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market: HIVE’s Approach The crypto market is famously characterized by its extreme volatility, with asset prices capable of experiencing dramatic swings within remarkably short periods. For an enterprise whose core product and treasury are intrinsically linked to these digital assets, the masterful management of this inherent volatility is not just important—it is existential. HIVE Digital’s substantial holdings are a clear indicator of a meticulously calculated approach to risk management and astute market timing. Sophisticated Treasury Management: It is highly probable that HIVE employs advanced treasury management strategies. These would dictate precise protocols for when to liquidate a portion of mined coins to cover operational expenditures and, crucially, when to strategically hold them for long-term capital appreciation. This dynamic balance is key to optimizing profitability and stability. Prudent Risk Mitigation: While accumulating significant assets offers immense upside potential, it inherently exposes the company to downside risk during market corrections. HIVE Digital’s reported holdings underscore a profound, long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s foundational value. This suggests they are strategically prepared to endure and even capitalize on market downturns, viewing them as opportunities rather than existential threats. Commitment to Transparency: By transparently disclosing their digital asset holdings , HIVE Digital significantly enhances its credibility and builds robust investor confidence. This level of openness is a distinguishing factor in the often opaque crypto space, setting them apart and fostering a stronger relationship with their shareholder base. Beyond the Numbers: The Future of HIVE Digital The announcement of an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings is far more than a mere financial snapshot; it serves as a powerful testament to the strategic direction and ambitious future trajectory of HIVE Digital . This exceptionally strong financial bedrock strategically positions the company for sustained expansion and continuous innovation within the rapidly burgeoning digital economy. Unlocking Expansion Opportunities: Armed with a formidable war chest of digital assets, HIVE Digital is exceptionally well-equipped to pursue a myriad of expansion opportunities. This could manifest as the acquisition of new, high-capacity mining facilities, significant investments in pioneering blockchain technologies, or strategic diversification into other lucrative blockchain-related ventures, such as high-performance computing or AI infrastructure powered by their extensive GPU fleets. Solidifying Industry Leadership: By consistently demonstrating robust financial stability, unwavering operational efficiency, and a crystal-clear long-term vision, HIVE Digital is actively reinforcing its esteemed position as a leading innovator in the global cryptocurrency mining industry. Their steadfast commitment to environmentally responsible and sustainable practices further solidifies this leadership, resonating with a growing segment of environmentally conscious investors and regulators. Elevating Investor Confidence: For current and prospective investors, these substantial holdings send a resounding message: this is a company that is not only generating significant profits from its core mining operations but is also astutely accumulating wealth in the very assets it produces. This deep alignment of interests with the broader success of the crypto ecosystem makes HIVE Digital an attractive proposition for those seeking exposure to the digital asset space. In summation, HIVE Digital Technologies’ impressive disclosure of $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , featuring a substantial 2,201 Bitcoin portfolio , paints a vivid portrait of a meticulously managed and forward-thinking enterprise. This strategic accumulation profoundly underscores their resolute confidence in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies, their exemplary operational efficiency within the challenging cryptocurrency mining sector, and their demonstrated ability to expertly navigate the inherent volatility of the broader crypto market . As HIVE Digital continues its trajectory of innovation and expansion, its robust digital asset base will undoubtedly serve as a pivotal cornerstone for sustained success, cementing its formidable presence in the rapidly evolving digital economy. This strategic move by HIVE Digital is a powerful declaration, signaling the increasing maturity and sophisticated strategic depth emerging within the digital asset investment landscape.

The traditional system, riddled with delays, high fees, and compliance headaches, often feels like a relic from another era. Imagine a world where your international workforce receives their salaries instantly, with minimal costs, and full regulatory compliance. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s the immediate reality offered by the groundbreaking collaboration between Rain and Toku, ushering in a new era of stablecoin payroll . Why Are Global Employers Embracing Stablecoins for Payroll? For businesses operating across borders, managing payroll is a monumental task. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations, slow bank transfers, exorbitant fees, and the ever-present challenge of adhering to diverse labor and tax laws in multiple jurisdictions can drain resources and productivity. This is where the innovation of stablecoin payroll shines, offering a compelling alternative for global employers seeking efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Rain, a prominent stablecoin payments platform, has joined forces with Toku, a leading compliance provider specializing in digital asset compensation. Their new stablecoin payroll system is designed to directly address these pain points, providing a streamlined solution for businesses with a global footprint. It’s about more than just payments; it’s about transforming the entire compensation landscape for international teams. Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments with Stablecoins The core of this new service lies in its ability to facilitate real-time, cross-border payments . Traditional international wire transfers can take days, incurring significant delays that impact employee satisfaction and cash flow management. With stablecoins, these transactions can be completed in minutes, if not seconds, offering unparalleled speed and efficiency. The system’s reach is impressive, supporting payroll processing while adhering to labor and tax laws in over 100 countries. This extensive global coverage is a testament to the meticulous planning and technological prowess behind the partnership. Initially, the service supports well-known stablecoins like USDC, along with RLUSD and USDG, providing flexibility and choice for businesses. The commitment to expanding stablecoin support based on demand and evolving compliance landscapes ensures the platform remains adaptable and future-proof. Seamless Digital Asset Compensation : Integration and Expansion One of the most appealing aspects of this new stablecoin payroll service is its seamless integration with existing payroll systems. This means businesses don’t need to overhaul their entire financial infrastructure to adopt this modern solution. Instead, they can enhance their current operations by incorporating the benefits of digital asset compensation . For employees, receiving compensation in stablecoins can offer several advantages, especially in regions with volatile local currencies or limited access to traditional banking services. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer stability and predictability, protecting employees’ earnings from market fluctuations. This approach to digital asset compensation can empower a truly global workforce, providing them with more control and flexibility over their finances. Rain and Toku’s forward-looking approach includes plans to expand stablecoin support, ensuring the platform evolves with the market and user needs. This adaptability is crucial in the fast-paced world of digital assets, guaranteeing that businesses can continue to leverage the most efficient and compliant stablecoin options available. The Power of Real-time Payroll : Speed, Cost, and Compliance The promise of real-time payroll is not just about speed; it encompasses a trifecta of benefits: reduced costs, enhanced transparency, and robust compliance. Traditional payroll often involves multiple intermediaries, each adding fees and delays. By leveraging stablecoins, many of these intermediaries can be bypassed, leading to significant cost savings on transaction fees and foreign exchange conversions. Toku’s expertise as a compliance provider for digital asset compensation is a critical component of this service. Navigating the complex web of international labor and tax laws is a daunting task, but Toku ensures that every transaction processed through the system adheres to the specific regulations of each country. This meticulous attention to compliance offers immense peace of mind for global employers , mitigating legal risks and ensuring ethical compensation practices. Here’s a quick look at the key advantages: Instant Settlements: Say goodbye to multi-day waiting periods for international transfers. Reduced Fees: Lower transaction costs compared to traditional banking channels. Global Reach: Compliant payroll processing in over 100 countries. FX Stability: Compensation in stablecoins minimizes exposure to volatile currency fluctuations. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain-based transactions offer clear, immutable records. Seamless Integration: Works with existing payroll systems, minimizing disruption. Regulatory Adherence: Built-in compliance with local labor and tax laws. What Challenges Might Lie Ahead for Stablecoin Payroll ? While the benefits are clear, the widespread adoption of stablecoin payroll isn’t without its considerations. Regulatory clarity around digital assets is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which can present complexities. Furthermore, educating employees and employers about stablecoins and digital wallets will be essential for smooth adoption. However, as the digital asset space matures and becomes more mainstream, these challenges are likely to diminish, paving the way for even broader acceptance. Actionable Insights for Your Business For global employers looking to streamline their international payroll, exploring Rain and Toku’s stablecoin payroll service could be a transformative step. Consider: Assessing Your Needs: Evaluate your current international payroll challenges and how stablecoins could offer solutions. Pilot Programs: Start with a smaller team or specific region to understand the system’s benefits firsthand. Employee Education: Provide clear information and support to your workforce on how to receive and manage stablecoin payments. Staying Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the digital asset space to ensure continued compliance. A Compelling Future for Global Compensation The partnership between Rain and Toku marks a significant milestone in the evolution of global finance. By offering a compliant, efficient, and real-time payroll solution powered by stablecoins, they are not just improving a process; they are redefining how global employers manage their international workforce.

Consumer appetite is weak despite increasing public discussion and legislative action; incentives are still being formulated. While PayPal brought one of the first stablecoins from a big financial company to market in 2023, it has proved difficult for users to use the coins for everyday financial activities, Chriss said. The Genius Act may also cause restrictions around cryptocurrency to ease up and become more accessible to people, he said. PayPal uses stablecoins mainly for sending money abroad Chriss believes stablecoins are very practical in dealing with the delays, high transaction fees, and a lack of transparency with traditional methods when sending money across borders. The company sees cross-border payments as a gateway for mainstream users in underserved regions, where people often rely on outdated financial systems, and wants everyone to experience the benefits of stablecoins firsthand. However, Chriss says adoption rates in the US are low because consumers haven’t yet found a compelling reason to change their habits. They don’t see how stablecoins can improve their daily financial lives and are comfortable using credit cards, bank transfers, and mobile apps. Chrics explained that PayPal builds tools and programs that make stablecoins easier and safer. The company is also launching its own stablecoin early and investing in infrastructure, education, and partnerships that make stablecoins more useful in the real world. New US laws will convince more people to use st ablecoins T he GENIUS Act recently passed the Senate and is now waiting for a vote in the House of Representatives. It could give businesses and consumers more confidence to participate in the digital economy. Meanwhile, th e US lawmakers are working on a second major piece of legislation focusing on the broader crypto market. Senate Banking Committee lead, Senator Tim Scott, said he wants Congress to pass a digital asset market structure bill before the end of September. The bill will determine whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should oversee different types of digital assets, including stablecoins, tokens, and cryptocurrencies. Senator Cynthia Lummis also said she would feel “extremely disappointed” if the GENIUS Act and the digital asset market structure bill failed to pass before 2026. More companies will confidently join the industry, and there will be opportunities for innovation once Congress passes the bill. The new protections and guidelines for how stablecoins and other digital assets should work will make users feel more secure and allow companies to invest in new technology and offer digital money services to more people. Many lawmakers and industry leaders strongly support the bill, but no one knows exactly when Congress will take the final step to pass it. So far, the bill has progressed; it passed in the Senate and gained attention in public debates, but it still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives. Even after that, lawmakers might suggest more changes or debate parts of the bill before it becomes a final law.

While Ethereum and XRP prices remain in the spotlight, one unexpected contender is emerging fast: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a red-hot crypto project that’s capturing serious investor attention. XRP and Ethereum: Developments are Driving Attention XRP has had a few turbulent weeks. On June 26, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected a joint motion by Ripple and the SEC to settle their long-standing lawsuit early. The court ruled that there weren’t “exceptional circumstances” to justify overriding its final judgment, meaning Ripple’s legal battles will continue. While this keeps uncertainty around institutional sales of XRP, retail sales remain unaffected, and the market is showing resilience. In fact, talks of a potential XRP ETF and the upcoming CME launch of XRP futures are keeping investor interest alive. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains a pillar of the market. Coinbase has announced the launch of Ethereum and Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts starting July 21—an important step for regulated exposure in the U.S. Additionally, core developer Barnabé Monnot has proposed cutting block times in half with EIP-7782, potentially doubling the Ethereum network’s speed. With ETH currently trading around $2,425, the price remains stable, but the groundwork is being laid for long-term upside. The Rising Domination of MAGACOIN FINANCE While top altcoins like XRP and Ethereum deal with regulatory hurdles and technical upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking the market by storm. It’s quickly become one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto projects—and for good reason. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens ensures no dilution risk, and the project has already passed a HashEx smart contract audit, offering peace of mind to investors focused on security. Presale demand is exploding, with early stages selling out at lightning speed. Investors who jump in now can also access high staking APYs as leading altcoins like Ethereum and XRP prices gain strength from improving macro conditions. This may skyrocket the price of MAGACOIN FINANCE by the end of 2025. Final Thought MAGACOIN FINANCE is being compared to leading altcoins, but with more advanced tokenomics and real growth potential. From retail holders to serious crypto investors, many are shifting part of their portfolios into this high-upside project. As macro conditions improve under Trump’s guidance, the altcoin market is ready to boom, pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE to new highs. With projections suggesting returns as high as 30x–100x, and in some bullish scenarios even up to 5000%, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the breakout star of late 2025.

These foundational markets influence global liquidity, investor sentiment, and ultimately, the broader economic landscape that even digital assets operate within. A recent forecast from ING, one of Europe’s leading financial institutions, has ignited discussions across financial circles, flagging a potential path for the Euro to USD exchange rate to reach $1.20. This isn’t just a technical projection; it signals a significant shift in the global economic narrative, heavily reliant on evolving Central Bank Policy decisions. ING’s projection isn’t a mere speculative guess; it’s rooted in a detailed analysis of macroeconomic indicators, monetary policy trajectories, and market sentiment. The $1.20 target for the Euro to USD represents a significant appreciation from recent levels, suggesting that ING sees fundamental shifts aligning in favor of the single currency. But what exactly are these ‘policy triggers’ that ING emphasizes, and how do they pave the way for such a substantial move in one of the world’s most traded currency pairs? Let’s delve into the core drivers and potential implications. What’s Driving the Euro to USD Outlook? The potential ascent of the Euro to USD is not a singular event but a confluence of factors, primarily centered around a projected divergence in monetary policy and a shifting perception of economic resilience. ING’s analysis points to several key elements that could underpin this bullish outlook for the euro: Monetary Policy Divergence: The European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) are at different stages in their respective policy cycles. While the Fed has been aggressively hiking rates, the ECB has been more cautious. ING anticipates a potential shift where the ECB becomes more hawkish, while the Fed might signal a pause or even a future pivot, narrowing the policy gap. Relative Economic Performance: The resilience of the Eurozone economy, despite geopolitical headwinds and an energy crisis, is a crucial factor. If the Eurozone continues to show signs of robust recovery and manages to navigate inflationary pressures effectively, it could strengthen the euro’s appeal. Shifting Market Sentiment: For a significant period, the U.S. Dollar has benefited from its safe-haven status amidst global uncertainties. However, if global risk appetite improves and investors become more confident in the Eurozone’s stability and growth prospects, capital could flow back into euro-denominated assets, bolstering the currency. These elements combine to create a compelling narrative for the euro’s potential strength, moving it beyond a mere technical rebound to a more fundamental revaluation against the dollar. How Do Central Bank Policy Decisions Impact EUR/USD? At the heart of ING’s forecast lies the pivotal role of Central Bank Policy . The actions and forward guidance from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) are arguably the most potent forces shaping currency valuations. Their decisions on interest rates, quantitative easing (QE), and quantitative tightening (QT) directly influence the attractiveness of holding a currency. The ECB, under President Christine Lagarde, has been grappling with persistent inflation while also navigating the complexities of a fragmented Eurozone economy. Historically, the ECB has been more dovish than the Fed, but recent inflationary pressures have pushed it towards a more hawkish stance. ING’s view suggests that the ECB might need to accelerate its tightening cycle, perhaps through more aggressive rate hikes or a faster reduction of its balance sheet (QT), to bring inflation under control. Such a move would make euro-denominated assets more appealing. Conversely, the Federal Reserve has already embarked on an aggressive tightening path. However, concerns about a potential U.S. recession or a significant cooling of inflation could lead the Fed to pause its rate hikes or even consider rate cuts later on. This divergence – a potentially more hawkish ECB meeting a less hawkish Fed – would significantly narrow the Interest Rate Differentials between the two economic blocs, making the euro relatively more attractive. ECB vs. Fed: A Policy Comparison Understanding the nuances of each central bank’s approach is key to grasping the future trajectory of the Forex Market : Policy Aspect European Central Bank (ECB) U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Current Stance Cautiously tightening, addressing high inflation. Aggressively tightening, focused on inflation control. Inflation Target 2% over the medium term, symmetrical. 2% over the longer run, average inflation targeting. Balance Sheet Policy Gradual reduction (QT), phasing out asset purchases. Significant reduction (QT) underway. Future Outlook (ING’s View) Potential for more aggressive rate hikes. Potential for pausing or slowing rate hikes. The Crucial Role of Interest Rate Differentials in Currency Valuation When investors decide where to park their money, the return on that money is paramount. This is where Interest Rate Differentials become a critical determinant of currency flows. A higher interest rate in one country, relative to another, makes that country’s currency more attractive to investors seeking better yields. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‘carry trade’, where investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency and invest in a high-interest-rate currency. For the Euro to USD pair, if the ECB begins to raise rates more aggressively, or if the market anticipates that Eurozone rates will eventually surpass or even match U.S. rates, it could trigger significant capital inflows into the euro. This is not just about current rates but also about market expectations of future rates. If the market believes the ECB will tighten more than previously thought, or that the Fed will ease sooner, the euro gains a significant advantage. Consider this: if a European bond yields 3% and a comparable U.S. bond yields 2.5%, an investor would naturally prefer the European bond for a higher return, assuming all other factors are equal. This increased demand for euro-denominated assets translates directly into increased demand for the euro currency itself, pushing its value higher against the dollar. This dynamic plays a powerful role in the daily fluctuations and long-term trends observed in the Forex Market . Navigating the Broader Forex Market Landscape While central bank policy and interest rate differentials are dominant, the broader Forex Market is also influenced by a myriad of other factors. Geopolitical events, global risk sentiment, and commodity prices can all significantly impact currency valuations, sometimes overshadowing monetary policy in the short term. For the Euro to USD , these external forces are particularly relevant: Geopolitical Developments: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine, for instance, has had a profound impact on Europe’s energy security and economic stability. Any escalation or de-escalation of such tensions can lead to swift shifts in currency preferences. A resolution or stabilization could boost the euro, while renewed instability could see a flight to the safe-haven dollar. Global Risk Sentiment: During periods of high global uncertainty or ‘risk-off’ sentiment, investors tend to flock to the U.S. Dollar due to its perceived safety and liquidity. Conversely, a ‘risk-on’ environment, characterized by optimism about global growth, tends to favor currencies like the euro, as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets. ING’s $1.20 forecast implies a degree of improving global risk appetite. Commodity Prices: Europe is a net importer of energy, making the euro particularly sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. High energy prices can weigh on the Eurozone’s terms of trade and economic growth, potentially weakening the euro. A stabilization or decline in energy prices would be beneficial for the euro’s strength. Trade Balances: A country’s trade balance (exports minus imports) can also influence its currency. A persistent trade surplus generally strengthens a currency, while a deficit can weaken it. Understanding these interconnected factors provides a more holistic view of the forces at play in the ever-evolving Forex Market , complementing the analysis of central bank actions. What’s the Economic Outlook for the Eurozone and US? The fundamental strength and prospects of an economy are direct drivers of its currency’s value. ING’s forecast for the Euro to USD to reach $1.20 implicitly suggests a more optimistic Economic Outlook for the Eurozone relative to, or at least in comparison with, the United States. This involves looking at key economic indicators such as growth, inflation, and employment. Eurozone’s Path to Resilience: Despite significant challenges, the Eurozone has shown surprising resilience. Indicators to watch include: Inflation Trends: While still high, signs of peaking or gradual decline in inflation could give the ECB more confidence to pursue a less aggressive tightening path or indicate that previous hikes are having an effect. However, persistent high inflation could force the ECB’s hand for more aggressive action. Growth Momentum: Data on GDP growth, industrial production, and services sector activity will be crucial. A robust recovery, particularly if it outperforms expectations, would be a strong tailwind for the euro. Fiscal Policies: The fiscal stance of individual Eurozone members and the broader EU recovery fund initiatives can also influence investor confidence and the euro’s stability. United States’ Economic Trajectory: The U.S. economy, while strong, faces its own set of challenges that could impact the dollar’s relative strength: Inflation Fight: The Fed’s primary focus remains taming inflation. Success here could allow for a less hawkish stance, but persistent inflation might necessitate continued tightening, supporting the dollar. Employment Resilience: The U.S. labor market has remained remarkably strong. A significant weakening could signal a recession and prompt the Fed to ease policy, potentially weakening the dollar. Recession Risks: Many analysts foresee a potential recession in the U.S. as a consequence of aggressive rate hikes. If a recession materializes, it could lead to dollar weakness, especially if other major economies prove more resilient. The comparative performance of these two economic giants, as reflected in their respective Economic Outlooks , will heavily influence the path of the Euro to USD exchange rate. ING’s $1.20 forecast hinges on a scenario where the Eurozone’s economic narrative improves or stabilizes relative to the U.S. Challenges and Risks to ING’s Forecast While ING presents a compelling case for the euro’s appreciation, the dynamic nature of the Forex Market means that forecasts are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Several factors could derail the euro’s path to $1.20: Persistent Inflation Surprises: If inflation in the Eurozone proves more stubborn than anticipated, forcing the ECB into an even more aggressive tightening cycle that risks a deeper recession. Conversely, if U.S. inflation remains persistently high, the Fed might be forced to maintain a hawkish stance longer than expected, supporting the dollar. Escalation of Geopolitical Conflicts: A significant worsening of the geopolitical landscape, particularly related to energy supply or broader global stability, could trigger a flight to safety, strengthening the U.S. Dollar as a safe-haven asset. Renewed Energy Crisis: Despite efforts to diversify, Europe remains vulnerable to energy supply shocks. A harsh winter or renewed disruption to energy imports could severely impact Eurozone growth and undermine the euro. Slower-than-Expected ECB Tightening: If the ECB opts for a more cautious or delayed approach to monetary tightening due to concerns about economic growth or financial stability, it could temper the euro’s strength. Stronger-than-Expected U.S. Economy: If the U.S. economy proves more resilient than anticipated, avoiding a recession and maintaining strong growth, it could provide continued support for the dollar, challenging the Euro to USD appreciation. These challenges highlight the complex interplay of economic, political, and market forces that constantly shape currency valuations. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Understanding ING’s forecast and the underlying drivers can provide valuable insights for those active in the financial markets: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches, press conferences, and minutes from both the ECB and the Fed. Any subtle shifts in language or outlook can signal future policy changes and impact currency pairs like the Euro to USD . Track Key Economic Data: Keep an eye on inflation reports, GDP growth figures, employment data, and consumer confidence indices from both the Eurozone and the U.S. These provide real-time insights into the health of the respective economies and influence central bank decisions. Assess Risk Sentiment: Global events and headlines can quickly shift market sentiment. Understanding whether the market is in a ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ mode can help anticipate currency flows. Consider Diversification and Hedging: For investors with international portfolios, currency movements can significantly impact returns. Understanding the Economic Outlook and potential currency shifts can inform decisions on portfolio diversification and hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk. Set Realistic Expectations: While a $1.20 target is significant, currency markets are inherently volatile. It’s crucial to approach trading and investing with robust risk management strategies and to avoid over-leveraging based on single forecasts. Conclusion: The Path Ahead for the Euro ING’s forecast of a potential path for the Euro to USD to reach $1.20 underscores a significant shift in the global financial landscape. This isn’t just about a number; it’s about a fundamental re-evaluation of the Eurozone’s economic prospects and the future trajectory of Central Bank Policy . The interplay of Interest Rate Differentials , the broader Forex Market dynamics, and the evolving Economic Outlook for both regions will be the decisive factors in whether this ambitious target is met. While challenges and uncertainties remain, the emphasis on policy triggers suggests that the proactive or reactive stances of the ECB and the Fed will continue to be the primary determinants of EUR/USD’s journey. For investors and traders, staying attuned to these macroeconomic shifts and central bank signals will be paramount in navigating the exciting, yet complex, world of currency markets. The euro’s ascent to $1.20, if realized, would mark a pivotal moment, signaling a potential rebalancing of global economic power and a new chapter for one of the world’s most watched currency pairs.

But in crypto, the model sometimes flips. BlockDAG is a perfect example. With over $323 million raised in presale and more than 2 million users mining via its X1 app, this project isn’t just gathering hype. It’s using a game theory-based approach that benefits early participation in a big way. With zero venture capital and no insider allocations, the design is simple: support early, and the network gives back. Even before anything goes live on exchanges, community nodes, testnet tools, and mining infrastructure are already rolling out. That’s why some of the savviest buyers are making their moves before full-scale market liquidity sets in. Incentives Built Into the Presale Foundation BlockDAG’s system is wired to reward people who act early. Buyers right now can still get in at $0.0030, increasing soon to $0.0080, while the confirmed listing price stands at $0.05, setting up a massive potential return for current buyers. Node operators will be running before listings begin, earning BDAG from mining, shielded from live market volatility. Developers are already building apps on the EVM-compatible testnet, using a no-code builder and claiming early grants. The incentives don’t just kick in post-launch; they’re designed to reward involvement from day one. That’s rare for presale-stage projects, where hype usually outpaces utility. Letting the Network Start Running Before the Price Moves Most Layer 1 networks wait until post-launch to decentralize or distribute mining power. BlockDAG is doing the opposite. Miners and node operators are going live before any trading starts. So far, over 18,150 ASIC miners have been sold, and the X1 mining app has onboarded more than 2 million users. Yet, none of them can sell anything, because nothing has hit exchanges yet. That setup leads to: Organic network growth fueled by user participation No downward price pressure from early unlocks Miners adding value without triggering market selling This creates a delay on the supply side, while demand from builders and users starts building momentum. Game theory suggests this sets the stage for stronger price action once the coin goes live. Early Builders Are Setting the Stage Now Often overlooked in crypto is the role of developers before launch. In BlockDAG’s case, builders are already busy. They’re using the no-code dApp builder to create smart contracts today Grants are rolling out ahead of the mainnet Apps are being deployed and tested on a functioning testnet By the time BlockDAG’s coin becomes tradable, it won’t be entering an empty space. It’ll be stepping into an ecosystem that already has tools, apps, and users. That early builder activity doesn’t just benefit developers; it helps shape a stronger launch. And for those building now, the visibility and support are far higher than what they’d get after a crowded post-launch environment. Understanding the Game Theory at Play Game theory tells us people make decisions based on what they expect others will do. With BlockDAG, this plays out clearly: Buy now at $0.0030 and lock in big upside Wait and pay more in later batches, $0.0080, $0.01, and finally $0.05 Meanwhile, over 23.2 billion coins have already been sold, nearly 200,000 wallets are active, and the six-week rollout timeline includes mainnet launch, mining pool activation, and token airdrops. So the choice becomes simple: get in early for a higher return, or wait and possibly miss out once the system gains full visibility and user saturation. What Buyers Should Know as the Window Narrows For large buyers or retail users planning for the long haul, BlockDAG’s structure offers more than just presale pricing. It’s building a fully functioning network in real time. Miners are already active, adding real usage Developers are laying the groundwork with working apps Participants are entering now, ahead of liquidity This coordinated rollout reduces uncertainty and gives the network a measurable head start. But with a $600 million presale cap, there are only so many spots left before the market catches up. The current $0.0030 tier is closing within days. After that, the price will jump to $0.0080. More importantly, what’s closing isn’t just the pricing, it’s the chance to be part of a working ecosystem before it becomes widely known.

While blockchain’s inherent transparency is a boon for many, it often poses a significant hurdle for traditional finance (TradFi) players who operate under strict confidentiality requirements. Enter Taurus, a leading digital asset infrastructure provider, which has just unveiled a groundbreaking privacy-focused stablecoin contract on the Aztec Network. This development is poised to redefine how institutions interact with digital currencies, offering a powerful solution that blends the best of both worlds: robust privacy with essential compliance. What’s the Big Deal with Taurus’s Privacy-Focused Stablecoin? Imagine a digital currency that allows you to conduct transactions with the confidentiality of traditional banking, yet leverages the efficiency and security of blockchain. That’s precisely what Taurus aims to deliver with its new privacy-focused stablecoin contract. According to CoinDesk, this innovative contract, built on the Aztec Network, is specifically designed to cater to financial institutions wary of privacy issues on public blockchains. It’s a clever fusion of cutting-edge zero-knowledge privacy technology and USDC-style compliance features. What does this mean in practice? It allows for transactions to be fully encrypted, safeguarding sensitive financial data from public view. However, critically, it also incorporates mechanisms that enable regulatory access when absolutely necessary. This ‘selective disclosure’ capability is a game-changer, addressing the core conflict between blockchain’s transparency and the institutional need for discretion and regulatory oversight. Unlocking Institutional Adoption: Addressing the Privacy Paradox For years, the promise of crypto has been tantalizing for traditional finance, yet widespread institutional adoption has been slow. One of the primary reasons? The inherent transparency of most public blockchains, where every transaction is visible to anyone with an internet connection. This level of openness is simply not compatible with the operational requirements and regulatory mandates of banks, asset managers, and other financial entities. Taurus’s solution directly confronts this ‘privacy paradox.’ By offering a contract that ensures transactional confidentiality while maintaining a pathway for regulatory compliance, they are building a crucial bridge for institutional adoption . This move could significantly accelerate the integration of digital assets into mainstream financial operations, paving the way for new products, services, and efficiencies previously unimaginable due to privacy concerns. Institutions can now explore the benefits of stablecoins – instant settlement, reduced costs, global reach – without compromising their core business principles. The Magic Behind Zero-Knowledge Privacy: A Closer Look At the heart of Taurus’s new contract lies zero-knowledge privacy (ZKP). This cryptographic marvel allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Think of it like this: you can prove you are over 18 without revealing your actual birthdate. In the context of Taurus’s stablecoin, zero-knowledge privacy means: Encrypted Transactions: The details of transactions (sender, receiver, amount) are encrypted and not publicly visible on the blockchain. Proof of Validity: ZKP proofs ensure that the transactions are legitimate and adhere to the contract’s rules (e.g., sufficient balance, valid addresses) without exposing the underlying data. Conditional Disclosure: In specific, legally mandated circumstances, a trusted third party or regulator can be granted access to decrypt and verify transaction details, satisfying compliance requirements. This powerful combination is what makes the Taurus contract so appealing to institutions. It offers a level of data protection that public blockchains traditionally lack, while still operating within a regulated framework. Building the Future: The Crucial Role of Digital Asset Infrastructure Taurus isn’t just launching a contract; they are reinforcing their position as a vital player in the evolving landscape of digital asset infrastructure . For institutions to truly embrace digital assets, they need more than just a stablecoin; they require a robust, secure, and compliant ecosystem to manage, store, and transact these assets. Providers of digital asset infrastructure like Taurus offer comprehensive solutions that include: Secure Custody: Safely storing digital assets. Tokenization Platforms: Creating and managing digital representations of real-world assets. Connectivity: Bridging traditional financial systems with blockchain networks. Compliance Tools: Ensuring adherence to AML, KYC, and other regulations. Taurus’s new privacy-focused stablecoin contract is a testament to their commitment to building the foundational layers necessary for the seamless integration of digital assets into the global financial system. It demonstrates a deep understanding of institutional needs and the technical prowess to deliver sophisticated solutions. Ensuring Secure and Encrypted Transactions: The Operational Advantage The ability to conduct encrypted transactions is not just about privacy; it’s also about operational security and efficiency for financial institutions. In a world where data breaches are a constant threat, minimizing the exposure of sensitive financial data is paramount. Taurus’s approach achieves this by ensuring that transaction details are not openly broadcast on the public ledger. Consider the operational advantages: Reduced Data Footprint: Less sensitive information exposed means a smaller attack surface for malicious actors. Enhanced Client Confidentiality: Financial institutions can assure their clients that their transaction data remains private, fostering greater trust. Streamlined Internal Compliance: While external regulators can access data when needed, internal compliance teams can manage disclosures more effectively, avoiding unnecessary exposure of proprietary information. Competitive Edge: Institutions can explore new business models and participate in digital asset markets without revealing their strategic moves to competitors. The implementation of encrypted transactions within a compliant framework represents a significant leap forward, making digital assets a far more viable and attractive option for enterprise-level operations. Benefits at a Glance: Enhanced Privacy: Confidential transactions for institutions. Regulatory Compliance: Built-in mechanisms for regulatory access when required. Increased Institutional Trust: Addresses core concerns hindering TradFi adoption. Technological Innovation: Leverages cutting-edge zero-knowledge privacy. Operational Efficiency: Reduces data exposure and enhances security. Potential Hurdles & The Road Ahead While Taurus’s new offering is a significant step forward, the path to widespread institutional adoption of privacy-preserving digital assets still has its challenges. Regulatory frameworks are constantly evolving, and achieving global harmonization for such solutions will take time. Furthermore, the inherent complexity of zero-knowledge technology requires continuous education and robust integration support for institutions. Despite these hurdles, the direction is clear: the financial world is moving towards digital assets, and solutions that intelligently balance privacy with compliance will be key enablers of this transition. A New Era for Institutional Crypto? Taurus’s launch of a privacy-focused stablecoin contract on the Aztec Network marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. By directly addressing the critical privacy and compliance needs of financial institutions, Taurus is not just launching a product; they are laying down a foundational piece of the puzzle for true institutional adoption . This innovative blend of zero-knowledge privacy with regulatory access, built upon robust digital asset infrastructure , promises to unlock a new era of secure and encrypted transactions for the world’s largest financial players. The future of finance is increasingly digital, and solutions like this are paving the way for its secure and private evolution.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is generating serious traction among early investors, gaining attention as a new cryptocurrency with real DeFi utility and a high-engagement token model. MUTM emerges as a top buy this week alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme coin. Presale of Mutuum Finance is in 50% sold out in Phase 5 with MUTM available for a mere $0.03. Mutuum Finance presale has attracted over 12,500 investors. More than $11.2 million has been raised. As presale allocations continue to fill rapidly, interest around MUTM has sparked debate among traders asking what’s the best crypto to buy now before the next major market move. Shiba Inu Consolidates Near $0.000012 Amid Cool June Sentiment Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at an accumulation level at around $0.000012, but a short period ago, it was trading at a level of short-term support after recording a decline of approximately 6% over the last 24 hours. Technical indicators also portray a cautious outlook: RSI is still in a state of mild overselling and on-chain indicators depict token outflows to exchanges, which is normally a bearish signal. Even though there is a severe, 112000% increase in the burn rate, withdrawing more than 116 million tokens, it has not caused any significant increase in price action due to increased headwinds in the overall market. In the absence of newer catalyst, i.e. new usage of Shibarium or accumulation by whales, SHIB can resume its lateral course. In the meantime, lesser known projects, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are attracting attention. Revolutionizing DeFi with a Proven Dual-Lending Formula In comparison with ordinary DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance will be the first to try to build a hybrid lending system that will have opportunities to meet the requirements of users with passive and sophisticated users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), clients meet the requirements of any investor who wishes to own passive income by depositing his USDT into the smart contract pools which provide stable passive income on the basis of an interest rate which it estimates up and down as the market demands. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P), experienced users can take advantage of this model where both borrowers and lenders are in complete control of establishing the terms, which is ideal to handle volatile assets. Mutuum Finance Presale Booms with 12,500+ Investors and $11.2M Raised Mutuum Finance is one of the DeFi protocols that are stirring up the market as it has already raised over $11.2 million, and over 12,500 investors are already backing it up. The existence of such a momentum is a testimony of the increased trust in the long-term project vision and the role it would play in transforming the decentralized finance market. As the broader crypto market cools, savvy investors are already positioning themselves ahead of the next breakout. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains range-bound near $0.000012, lacking strong bullish catalysts, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a breakout contender with real DeFi innovation and serious investor momentum. The presale has now raised over $11.2 million, with more than 12,500 participants, and tokens are 40% sold out in Phase 5 at just $0.03 each. Offering a unique dual-lending system and backed by a full CertiK audit, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. The clock is ticking, secure your presale allocation now and get ahead of the next market pump.

Shiba Inu: Reinvention Through Infrastructure and Community Action Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized names in crypto, and its community isn’t slowing down. With billions of tokens being removed from circulation and the integration of Shibarium, SHIB is pushing to transform its image from speculative meme coin to decentralized utility hub . Recent developments like automation of burn events and partnerships aimed at cross-chain functionality are positioning Shiba Inu to play a more active role in the DeFi space. But while its roadmap is ambitious, momentum has been inconsistent , and even major burn surges have not yet triggered sustained breakout moves. Sentiment around SHIB remains neutral overall, with many market participants waiting for stronger catalysts to reignite serious upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin Redefining Hype in 2025 While SHIB continues to build, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exploding onto the scene with a different playbook —one driven by raw energy, viral branding, and unmistakable investor urgency. Analysts are already describing it as one of the most promising meme cryptos of the year, fueled by a powerful mix of early traction and market hype. What’s turning heads? Unlike typical meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE leverages a narrative that is both politically charged and culturally resonant, designed to rally mass engagement. It’s not just a token—it’s a movement. Early interest has snowballed, with every phase of its rollout triggering a fresh wave of wallet activity. Analysts are pointing to its early-stage performance metrics, which outshine many of 2025’s so-called “blue chip” altcoins . And with a staking mechanism rolling out exclusively for its earliest supporters, the project is building both loyalty and locked-in demand before even hitting major exchanges. Strategic Analyst Picks Are Locking In Early With legacy tokens facing delays, legal entanglements, and uneven momentum, many market veterans are shifting toward asymmetric opportunities —and MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of that rotation. Analysts tracking altcoin trends say this project is positioned to dominate headlines and performance charts once it enters full circulation. The takeaway? While Shiba Inu continues to evolve its tech stack and brand identity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is charging forward with speed, conviction, and viral reach .

Chart Pattern Points To Support Analysts have noted that Dogecoin’s slide to $0.142 fits neatly into a rising pattern of higher lows. Based on analysis, the dip hit a multi-year trendline that first showed up in October 2023. At that time, prices fell to a similar zone before reversing.

If the current support holds, they argue, DOGE may pick up speed and push toward the wedge’s tip and hit $1. The analyst’s chart shows a potential rally to $1.40, which would mark a 740% jump from today’s levels and blow past the $1 mark that many have eyed for years. Multiple Forecasts Add Fuel To The Debate This isn’t the first time experts have set sights on $1 for Dogecoin. Galaxy Research put the $1 target on its radar before the end of 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Buying Solana at $148 looked like a mistake, but with strategy and patience, it became a lesson in conviction, not delusion. In crypto, there’s a fine line between conviction and delusion. Buying Solana at $148 can be a conviction. But as the price slides to $126, someone may question whether they have just paid for a front-row seat to yet another brutal lesson in volatility. This is the story of how someone went from red to breakeven — not through luck, but through strategy, patience, and a clear-eyed understanding of the market I was operating in. You might also like: PI, XYZVerse, XMR: Are these fast-rising cryptos set to hit new all-time highs in 2025? The entry: High hopes, higher risk Imagine an investor who entered SOL at $148 when momentum was strong, when Bitcoin was climbing, Ethereum was regaining dominance, and Solana — with its relentless developer activity and growing DeFi footprint — seemed poised to retest $180 resistance. The market, however, had other plans. Within days, macro headwinds took hold. ETF rumors stalled. Traders rotated back into BTC. And Solana, like much of the altcoin market, lost altitude fast. It didn’t pause until it was sitting nearly 15% lower, at $126.80. The drawdown: Holding, not hoping The mistake most traders make when facing a red position is treating it like a problem to be solved with emotion. This can be approached with a framework. As the following questions: Has the core thesis changed? Is this a liquidity flush or a trend reversal? Are there fundamentals that justify staying in the trade? The answers can be clear. Solana’s June health report showed a network that hadn’t gone down in nearly 16 months — no small feat considering its past struggles. Governance participation was up. Developer tooling was improving. New protocols were launched. The recovery blueprint At $133, the investor averages down. Not recklessly — about 30% more capital. They built a ladder and added again near $127. That brings their average entry to $137.50. But this isn’t just about chasing breakeven. The drawdown was a wake-up call. It is a reminder of how fragile even the strongest assets can be once they’ve matured. Solana is no longer a moonshot — it’s a blue chip with blue-chip risks. That’s when they start hunting for asymmetric plays again. Something high-conviction, high-upside and they come across XYZVerse (XYZ) . Why XYZ? XYZVerse could be where real upside might lie because of the following reasons: Early-stage tokenomics with a tight float and aggressive incentive design. Backed by a community-first launch with meme culture but layered with real mechanics. A clear roadmap to utility and planned integrations in DeFi and gaming. Last but not least, it is a cheap entry point. Currently, $XYZ is selling at $0.003333, and the team behind the project seems to be closing the presale soon. The team plans to list its token at $0.1. Sounds quite ambitious, yet possible if they manage to raise the necessary funding. So far, they have secured over $14 million. This gives the same feeling Solana once did — when it was trading under $5 and felt like a crazy idea, but look at it now. TL;DR: Buying SOL at $148 hurt. Seeing it at $126 felt worse. But managing that drawdown with strategy, not sentiment, was arguably the only way to break even and obtain a better edge moving forward. For interested investors who are still chasing blue chips for 2x returns, that’s fine. But those who are ready to go back to where the exponential plays live — it’s projects like XYZ they should be paying attention to.

What Does ‘Decimated’ Mean for the Iran Nuclear Program ? The assertion by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the Iran nuclear program has been ‘completely decimated’ is a powerful declaration, signaling a dramatic shift in the geopolitical landscape surrounding Tehran’s atomic ambitions. This isn’t merely a claim of reduction; ‘decimation’ implies a severe, perhaps irreversible, blow to their capabilities. Historically, Iran’s nuclear development has been a source of immense international tension, leading to sanctions, diplomatic efforts, and covert operations. If Hegseth’s statement holds true, it suggests a profound success in preventing proliferation, potentially reshaping security dynamics in the Middle East and beyond. However, such a definitive statement also raises questions about verification and the methods by which this ‘decimation’ was achieved, keeping the international community on edge. The Role of the IAEA and Halting IAEA Cooperation Adding another layer of complexity to this narrative is the report from Walter Bloomberg on X, indicating that Iran’s constitutional committee has approved halting IAEA cooperation . The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the world’s nuclear watchdog, responsible for verifying that states comply with their non-proliferation obligations. Their access and monitoring are crucial for building international confidence. Iran’s decision to restrict or halt cooperation with the IAEA, especially at a time when such bold claims are being made, creates a significant challenge for independent verification. Without the IAEA’s eyes on the ground, assessing the true state of Iran’s nuclear facilities becomes far more difficult, fueling speculation and potentially increasing distrust among international actors. Analyzing the US Defense Secretary’s Bold Claim When the US Defense Secretary makes a statement of this magnitude, it’s rarely without significant intelligence backing, or at least a strategic purpose. Pete Hegseth’s declaration suggests either a highly effective campaign to dismantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, or a powerful psychological operation aimed at deterrence and managing perceptions. While specifics are often shrouded in secrecy, such pronouncements are carefully weighed for their impact on adversaries, allies, and global financial markets. The claim itself could be a signal to Iran that their nuclear ambitions are futile, or a reassurance to regional partners and the international community that a major threat has been neutralized. However, the lack of immediate, public corroboration from independent sources like the IAEA means the world is largely relying on official U.S. statements, which naturally invites scrutiny and skepticism from some quarters. Broader Implications for Geopolitical Stability The ramifications of this development extend far beyond Iran’s borders, touching upon the delicate balance of geopolitical stability worldwide. A ‘decimated’ Iranian nuclear program, if confirmed, could significantly reduce a major source of regional tension, potentially leading to a de-escalation of conflicts in the Middle East. For instance, countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia, who view Iran’s nuclear aspirations as an existential threat, might see this as a positive shift. Conversely, if the claim is perceived as exaggerated or if Iran retaliates by further isolating itself, it could lead to new forms of instability. The ongoing conflict dynamics, energy security, and global trade routes are all intricately linked to the stability of this critical region. Any major shift, whether perceived as positive or negative, will undoubtedly ripple through international relations. How This Impacts Global Markets and Crypto The interplay between geopolitics and financial assets is undeniable, and the latest news regarding Iran is no exception. Major shifts in global markets are often triggered by perceived changes in international stability. Historically, periods of heightened geopolitical tension lead to a ‘flight to safety,’ where investors move away from riskier assets like stocks into traditional safe havens such as gold, government bonds, and sometimes, the U.S. dollar. For the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the impact is multifaceted: Volatility: Geopolitical shocks often amplify volatility across all markets, and crypto is particularly susceptible due to its relatively smaller market cap and 24/7 trading nature. Safe-Haven Narrative: Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ sometimes sees increased demand during uncertainty, as investors seek assets outside traditional financial systems. However, this narrative isn’t always consistent. Correlation with Tech Stocks: Cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, often exhibit correlation with broader tech stock performance. If geopolitical news dampens overall market sentiment, crypto can follow suit. Investor Confidence: A perceived reduction in global threats could boost overall investor confidence, potentially leading to more capital flowing into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, unverified claims or new tensions could create fear. To illustrate the potential reactions, consider this: Geopolitical Event Impact on Traditional Markets Impact on Crypto Markets Increased Tension Oil prices up, stocks down, gold up Increased volatility, flight to “safe-haven” cryptos (if narrative holds), potential sell-off De-escalation Oil prices down, stocks up, gold down Potential for broader market stability, but also reduced “safe-haven” demand for crypto For crypto investors, staying informed about global events is not just about general knowledge; it’s about understanding potential market movers. While cryptocurrencies offer decentralization, they are not immune to the macro environment. Diversification and careful risk management remain paramount. Conclusion: Navigating a Shifting Landscape The U.S. Defense Secretary’s striking declaration regarding Iran’s nuclear capabilities, coupled with Iran’s decision to halt IAEA cooperation, marks a pivotal moment in international relations. While the full implications and verifiability of these claims remain to be seen, their immediate effect on geopolitical discussions and market sentiment is undeniable. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, these developments serve as a potent reminder that the digital asset landscape is inextricably linked to the broader world stage. Monitoring geopolitical stability , understanding the nuances of international policy, and adapting investment strategies accordingly are essential for navigating the complex interplay between geopolitics and the future of finance.

The announcement on X (formerly Twitter) came as Coinbase shares hit an all-time high of $375.07, surpassing its previous record from November 2021. The comment suggests Armstrong and his company’s strong belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. On multiple occasions, Armstrong has suggested that Bitcoin’s price could someday go into millions of dollars. Armstrong also suggested it won’t be long before nations start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets , a shift that could redefine global demand and establish the asset as a player in world politics. Some dismissed it as overly speculative, but others pointed out that countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic have already moved in that direction. Whether symbolic or strategic, Armstrong’s consistent Bitcoin purchases reflect a growing trend among crypto leaders and institutional investors who see BTC as a hedge against inflation, currency volatility, and systemic risk. Market confidence drives Coinbase to a new peak Coinbase Global Inc. shares closed at the highest level ever, capping off a rally fueled by the growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency industry on Wall Street and Washington. The crypto-exchange operator’s stock rose 5.5% on Thursday to $375.07. The previous high was $357.39 in November 2021, just months after the company went public through a direct listing. Coinbase shares have surged more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, which came as the collapse of FTX raised questions about the future of digital assets. The stock’s comeback occurred as cryptocurrency prices rebounded and the industry won powerful new allies, including US President Donald Trump. Just last month, Coinbase was added to the prestigious S&P 500 Index . This extraordinary revival comes after a dark period in the crypto industry. FTX and other heavyweights crashed in 2022, leading to the absurdly high skepticism rate about digital assets. Few of the largest exchanges were left unscathed, and Coinbase was one of the few that didn’t get whacked, leaving it as a safe player in a chaotic industry. Now, renewed optimism is back. Institutional capital is moving in, retail traders are coming back, and financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are plowing ahead with crypto products. Coinbase recently joined the S&P 500 Index, a sign of increasing legitimacy in traditional finance. Analysts say the wider recovery in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and greater regulatory clarity are helping lift investors’ confidence in Coinbase. The exchange’s various revenue streams, including trading fees, custody services, and institutional partnerships, have also contributed to its stock performance. US lawmakers boost crypto sentiment with policy shift The return of Coinbase also coincides with growing regulatory clarity and political support of digital assets in the United States. Washington is warming to crypto after years of hostility and uncertainty. Legislation on the horizon on stablecoins and clearer signals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also helping the sector lay down the law. Bipartisan backing in Congress has added fresh momentum to bills that could provide transparency and oversight, particularly in critical functions including custody, staking, and decentralized finance. President Donald Trump has publicly supported crypto innovation, unlike previous administrations. Under his rule, there has been a huge policy expansion in the domain of crypto, such as creating a crypto reserve for the country. Coinbase, a longtime advocate for reasonable regulation, has been one of the most vocal in communicating with legislative staff and regulatory agencies. And it is paying off. Investors, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts these days see Coinbase as not just an exchange but also a bridge between the digital economy and the traditional financial system.

This is according to filings submitte d to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, June 26. The shelf offering could consist of sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities. The shift would be the latest strategic change for Bakkt. However, according to the SEC filing , the firm has not yet made any crypto purchases. Bakkt files for SEC shelf registration amid the growing interest in crypto Bakkt submitted a filing to the SEC through a “shelf” registration process. With this shelf registration, the firm can occasionally sell any mix of the securities mentioned in the prospectus in one or more offerings. The filing stated that Bakkt may sell securities occasionally through one or more offerings, with amounts, prices, and terms decided at the time of each offering. This prospectus outlined the basic terms of these securities and how the firm will offer them. According to the filing, the total price for the securities Bakkt sells will not go over $1 billion. The SEC also required the company to include the price they would pay for those securities and the amount of money they expected to make from the sale. This came after Bakkt said it had “updated” the investment policy to specifically allocate capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets as part of its treasury and corporate strategy on June 10. Founded in 2018, Bakkt is now an emerging crypto treasury firm that allows investors to make a leveraged bet on digital assets such as Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL by financing digital asset purchases in the traditional capital markets. Earlier, the Atlanta-based firm, which started with backing from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) owner Intercontinental Exchange, offered an institutional-grade trading platform for daily physically-settled Bitcoin futures before trying to tokenize rewards points and crypto custody. This product failed to gain traction. The company went public in 2021. Meanwhile, Bakkt’s initial Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Loeffler, resigned in 2019 to briefly serve as a Republican United States senator in Georgia under the first Trump administration . Moreover, President Donald Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, was said to be in “advanced talks” to acquire Bakkt last November. Bakkt officials highlight the firm’s focus on crypto Following the announcement that Bakkt had “updated” the investment policy, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, stated that this plan aims to help Bakkt change into a company that focuses solely on crypto infrastructure and allows them to add Bitcoin and other digital assets to their treasury carefully. According to Naheta’s speculations, their strategy shows their strong belief in the future of digital assets and their goal for Bakkt to grow globally and become a leader in programmable money. Andy Main, Co-CEO and President of Bakkt, also commented on the topic of discussion. According to him, their updated investment policy shows their confidence in digital assets’ long-term potential and dedication to seeking strategic opportunities that increase shareholder value. Main said this is a significant step for the company as it looks to expand into global payments and remittance systems using stablecoins while being part of the ongoing development of the digital asset ecosystem.

This isn’t just any financial announcement; it carries the weight of a former U.S. President’s backing, making its upcoming move particularly noteworthy. Within days, WLFI, a venture associated with Donald Trump, is poised to release the very first audit of its USD1 stablecoin, promising to pull back the curtain on its crucial reserve backing . This event is not merely a procedural step; it represents a critical moment for crypto transparency and trust in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Understanding WLFI and the Promise of WLFI USD1 Before diving into the audit’s implications, it’s essential to grasp what World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is and the vision behind its USD1 stablecoin. WLFI has emerged as a player in the financial technology space, aiming to bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning world of digital assets. Its connection to Donald Trump adds a unique dimension, potentially drawing attention from both crypto enthusiasts and those interested in political figures’ ventures beyond their primary roles. The USD1 stablecoin, as its name suggests, is designed to maintain a stable value pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering a digital medium of exchange that avoids the notorious volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The core promise of any stablecoin, including WLFI USD1 , lies in its ability to offer stability. This stability is typically achieved by backing the digital token with an equivalent amount of fiat currency (like USD) or other stable assets held in reserve. For users, stablecoins serve multiple purposes: Safe Haven: A place to park funds during market downturns without converting back to fiat. Efficient Transactions: Faster and cheaper international transfers compared to traditional banking. Trading Pairs: A common base currency for trading other cryptocurrencies on exchanges. The impending audit is therefore not just a formality; it’s a foundational step in building confidence around WLFI’s ability to deliver on this promise of stability and reliability for its WLFI USD1 stablecoin. Why a Stablecoin Audit is Crucial for Crypto Transparency In the world of digital assets, trust is paramount, and nowhere is this more evident than with stablecoins. The history of stablecoins has seen its share of controversies, primarily revolving around the actual reserves held by issuers. This is precisely why a robust and transparent stablecoin audit is not just beneficial, but absolutely critical. An audit provides an independent verification of an issuer’s claims regarding their reserve assets. It answers the fundamental question: Is every USD1 token truly backed by one U.S. dollar (or equivalent assets)? The importance of such an audit cannot be overstated. Here’s why: Building User Confidence: Users need assurance that their stablecoin holdings are genuinely collateralized and can be redeemed at par. An audit provides this peace of mind. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments and financial regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on stablecoins, demanding greater transparency and accountability. A comprehensive audit helps meet these evolving regulatory expectations. Market Integrity: The stability of major stablecoins impacts the entire crypto market. If a large stablecoin were to de-peg due to insufficient reserves, it could trigger a ripple effect across the ecosystem. Preventing Fraud and Mismanagement: Regular, independent audits act as a safeguard against potential mismanagement of funds or outright fraudulent claims about reserves. For WLFI, being among the first to publish a detailed audit for its USD1 stablecoin, especially with the high-profile association of Trump crypto ventures, sets a precedent. It demonstrates a commitment to transparency that could potentially differentiate it in a competitive market. The Significance of Reserve Backing Disclosure At the heart of any stablecoin’s credibility lies its reserve backing . This refers to the assets that the stablecoin issuer holds to back each token in circulation. For USD-pegged stablecoins, these reserves typically consist of U.S. dollars, short-term U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, corporate bonds, or other highly liquid assets. The quality and liquidity of these reserves are critical. If the reserves are not liquid enough, or if they consist of risky assets, the stablecoin may struggle to maintain its peg, especially during periods of high redemption demand. WLFI’s announcement that its audit will disclose its reserve backing is a significant step. This disclosure will likely detail: Composition of Reserves: What specific assets make up the backing? (e.g., cash, T-bills, etc.) Custodian Information: Where are these assets held? Which financial institutions are involved? Total Value of Reserves: The exact monetary value of the assets held. Circulating Supply of USD1: The total number of USD1 tokens currently in circulation. Attestation or Audit Report: An independent verification confirming that the reserves indeed match or exceed the circulating supply. For a stablecoin, particularly one associated with a figure like Donald Trump, clear and unambiguous disclosure of reserve backing is paramount. It addresses potential skepticism and builds foundational trust, which is vital for any financial product, digital or otherwise. This move by WLFI could serve as a benchmark for future stablecoin projects, pushing for greater accountability across the board. How Does This Impact Trump Crypto Ventures and the Broader Market? The foray of a prominent political figure like Donald Trump into the cryptocurrency space has always been a topic of intense interest and debate. While his previous ventures have largely focused on NFTs, the involvement with a stablecoin through WLFI marks a more direct engagement with the financial infrastructure of the crypto ecosystem. This impending stablecoin audit for USD1 could have several implications: Legitimization for Political Figures: It could set a precedent for how political figures engage with and potentially legitimize aspects of the crypto industry through transparency initiatives. Increased Scrutiny: The high-profile nature means that WLFI and USD1 will likely face heightened scrutiny from regulators, media, and the public, potentially pushing them to maintain even higher standards of compliance and transparency. Market Diversification: It introduces a new player into the stablecoin arena, potentially fostering competition and innovation, especially around audit practices. Public Perception: Depending on the audit’s findings, it could either boost public confidence in the viability of stablecoins backed by non-traditional entities or raise further questions about their operational integrity. The broader crypto market, already grappling with evolving regulations and calls for greater accountability, will be watching closely. A successful, transparent audit from WLFI could reinforce the idea that stablecoins can be robust and reliable, even those from less conventional issuers. Conversely, any perceived shortcomings could add to the regulatory pressures facing the entire stablecoin sector. Challenges and Opportunities for WLFI USD1 While the upcoming audit is a positive step towards crypto transparency , WLFI and its USD1 stablecoin face both challenges and significant opportunities in the competitive stablecoin market. Challenges: Competition: The stablecoin market is dominated by established giants like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), which boast massive market caps and widespread adoption. Gaining market share will be an uphill battle. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for stablecoins is still in flux globally. WLFI must navigate complex and potentially changing rules, especially given its high-profile association. Trust Deficit: Despite the audit, some users may harbor skepticism due to past controversies surrounding stablecoins or the political affiliation. Consistent transparency will be key to overcoming this. Operational Scalability: As adoption grows, WLFI must ensure its operational infrastructure can handle increased transaction volumes and redemption requests efficiently. Opportunities: Niche Market: The ‘Trump-backed’ aspect could attract a specific segment of users who align with his brand or political views, creating a unique market niche. First-Mover Transparency: By being among the first to release a detailed audit, WLFI can set a new standard for transparency, potentially attracting users who prioritize this above all else. Innovation in Compliance: The intense scrutiny could drive WLFI to innovate in terms of how they conduct audits, manage reserves, and communicate with stakeholders, potentially leading to best practices for the industry. Bridging Divides: If successful, WLFI USD1 could serve as a bridge, introducing traditional investors and a broader public to the benefits of stablecoins and digital assets in a seemingly more familiar and regulated context. The success of WLFI USD1 will hinge not just on the initial audit, but on continuous adherence to the highest standards of financial integrity and transparency. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors For those observing or participating in the cryptocurrency market, the WLFI USD1 audit presents several points to consider: Examine the Audit Details: Don’t just rely on headlines. When the audit is released, delve into the specifics of the reserve backing . Look at the quality of assets, the custodian, and the independent auditor’s reputation. This is crucial for assessing the true stability of WLFI USD1 . Compare with Peers: How does WLFI’s audit and reserve structure compare to those of USDC, USDT, or BUSD? Understanding these differences can inform your stablecoin choices. Monitor Regulatory Response: Pay attention to how regulators react to this audit, especially given the political connection. Their response could signal future regulatory trends for stablecoins. Consider Diversification: Even with a transparent audit, it’s wise to diversify your stablecoin holdings if you rely heavily on them for liquidity or trading. Stay Informed on WLFI’s Roadmap: Beyond the audit, what are WLFI’s plans for adoption, utility, and integration within the broader crypto ecosystem? This event underscores a broader trend towards greater accountability in the crypto space. As the industry matures, crypto transparency will become less of an option and more of a requirement for long-term success and mainstream adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Stablecoin Trust? The impending release of the first audit for Trump-backed WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin marks a pivotal moment, not just for WLFI, but for the entire stablecoin ecosystem. By promising to fully disclose its reserve backing , WLFI is stepping forward in an effort to champion crypto transparency , an increasingly vital component for widespread adoption and regulatory acceptance. This move could set a new benchmark for how stablecoins operate and how they are perceived by the public and regulators alike. While challenges remain in a highly competitive and evolving market, this commitment to a rigorous stablecoin audit could position WLFI USD1 as a credible and trustworthy option. It signals a growing maturity within the digital asset space, where verifiable proof of reserves is becoming non-negotiable. As the crypto world continues to evolve, initiatives like this will be instrumental in building the trust necessary for digital currencies to fulfill their transformative potential.

Ethereum continues to attract institutional optimism following ETF speculation, while Avalanche’s expanding ecosystem has drawn steady developer attention. XRP, backed by fresh futures listings and Ripple’s ongoing regulatory progress, remains one of the most recognized altcoins in the market. Yet for many long-term holders of these assets, the recent market tone feels familiar: stable, but stale. ETH and AVAX have traded in tight ranges for weeks. XRP, despite its progress on the legal and compliance front, is still struggling to decisively break resistance. As capital searches for higher upside, many of these investors are now turning to a surprising new name— MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Eyes as Breakout Contender for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most watched early-stage projects of the year. Priced at under a penny and still in its presale phase, the token has already raised over $10 million. Each round is selling out faster than the last, and community growth is accelerating across platforms. From seasoned ETH traders to XRP loyalists, many are making the same move: rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE early—before listings, before FOMO peaks. What’s driving the shift? Timing and structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE arrives in a window where the market is hunting asymmetrical returns, and the project is delivering exactly that setup. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, transparent smart contract audits, and no confusing emissions, the value proposition is simple: a low market cap entry point with the potential for exponential upside if momentum continues. For holders of ETH, AVAX, and XRP—assets with multi-billion dollar valuations—MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something those large caps can’t: the chance to get in at the beginning of a narrative. The same kind of narrative that once surrounded SHIB, DOGE, or even XRP in its earliest days. Except now, that narrative is forming in real time—and the window is still open. Presale Momentum Signals a Shift in Market Sentiment The broader presale landscape has been hit or miss in recent years, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be striking the right chord. Its message is resonating: bold branding, unapologetic positioning, and a tokenomics structure that rewards early conviction. Investors who’ve held through bear markets are tired of waiting on sideways charts. MAGACOIN FINANCE gives them a reason to act now. And this isn’t just retail speculation. The growing volume of ETH and AVAX wallets entering the presale suggests smart money is already moving. Discussions in private trading circles, Telegram groups, and crypto forums increasingly mention MAGACOIN FINANCE not as a gamble—but as a calculated, early-stage play. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Join the Ranks of Top Performers? It’s too early to call any token a guaranteed winner. But the ingredients are lining up: strong early fundraising, an exploding community, a capped supply, and a presale structure that mirrors previous breakout plays. For Ethereum, Avalanche, and XRP holders watching the charts go sideways, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents something rare—a shot at being early again. As Q3 unfolds and exchange listings approach, the noise around MAGACOIN FINANCE is likely to get louder. For now, the signal is clear: capital is moving, and momentum is building.

It is about recognising the moment just before quiet progress turns into public acceleration. With BlockDAG (BDAG) , that shift has not happened yet. And that is what makes the current window so important. The six-week rollout plan outlined in BlockDAG’s roadmap is detailed and structured. Each week brings new functionality, from staking and mining to DeFi tools and exchange listings. It is a sequence built to drive utility before price discovery. But the key detail is this. The countdown has not started. Those entering now are ahead of every major milestone, before token circulation, before staking closes, and before DeFi activation changes the pace. Inside BlockDAG’s Six-Week Rollout Plan BlockDAG’s six-week countdown is not a placeholder. It is a structured execution plan designed to deliver real network value ahead of listings. It begins with the end of the presale, the start of staking, and the conversion of all X1 and TAP points into BDAG coins. Wallet migration also finalises at this point, preparing users for on-chain participation. As the countdown continues, the mainnet goes live. Production infrastructure, including high-performance ASIC miners, becomes active while tokens remain non-tradable. In the third week, decentralisation takes hold with the launch of community-run nodes and mining pools, allowing early participants to secure the network pre-listing. By Week 2, 40% of presale tokens are airdropped. At the same time, the full DeFi stack launches, including the DEX, bridge, oracle services, lending features, and the launchpad. This culminates in listing week, which opens with a lead exchange before expanding across more than nine platforms. Every phase builds function before exposure, setting up a foundation for lasting network value. The Importance of Getting In Before the Clock Starts This early phase is not just about getting a better price. It is about locking in strategic positioning. With the current limited-time offer at $0.0030 and only for a few days until the increase to $0.0080, participants are entering ahead of visibility acceleration. The confirmed $0.05 listing puts the return window at 1500%, a rare setup in any presale cycle. But the real edge lies in what is already happening behind the scenes. Over 2 million users are actively mining BDAG using the X1 app, creating sustained engagement before trading begins. More than 18,000 ASIC miners have been sold. Deliveries for the X30 and X100 models begin July 7, with X10 units shipping by August 15. Demand is rising well ahead of liquidity. BlockDAG has sold 23.2 billion BDAG coins and raised $323 million toward its $600 million goal. That capital is being deployed to build a structure, not just fuel speculation. It’s an ecosystem already under construction, building momentum before it ever hits exchanges. A Network That Exists Before the Token Trades Unlike projects that debut a token before anything works, BlockDAG is taking the opposite route. Its testnet is live and functional. Developers can deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts, build dApps using a no-code interface, and test ecosystem tools without needing coins in circulation. This reverses the typical flow seen in Layer 1 launches. Infrastructure is going live first. Trading comes later. This structure mimics the early success paths of Bitcoin’s initial mining model, Kaspa’s DAG architecture, and Solana’s validator-driven rollout. But BlockDAG brings all of it into one combined framework, streamlining early access through mobile apps, miner rigs, and developer grants. Crypto Market Snapshot BlockDAG has designed its rollout to favour early movers, not momentum chasers. The testnet is active, miner adoption is rising, and no-code dApps are already being built. Decentralised mining pools are ready, and real builder activity is underway. But marketing campaigns, exchange volume, and token liquidity have yet to begin. That is exactly what makes this phase so powerful. In crypto, the advantage comes from owning infrastructure before it becomes the headline. BlockDAG still offers that window. But once the six-week countdown begins, the early edge fades, and the rush to catch up begins.

New on-chain data suggests that BTC “weak hands” are selling their holdings to larger investors. Bitcoin Moving Upstream From Weak Hands To Big Money According to a recent Cryptoquant Quicktake post by contributor IT Tech, Bitcoin’s supply is moving upstream from retail investors to larger holders. This movement denotes a fundamental shift in the investor sentiment toward the largest digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 Retail investors – those holding less than one BTC – have seen a significant reduction in their holdings, with total balances dropping by 54,500 BTC year-over-year (YoY), to 1.69 million BTC. On average, this cohort has experienced outflows of approximately 220 BTC per day. In contrast, large holders – wallets with 1,000 BTC or more – have expanded their total BTC exposure by 507,700 BTC over the same period, bringing their combined holdings to 16.57 million BTC. This group is now seeing average inflows of around 1,460 BTC per day. Institutional interest in Bitcoin also continues to rise at a historic pace. Notably, institutions are currently absorbing about seven times more BTC than retail investors are selling. At the same time, the post-halving issuance of BTC is currently hovering around 450 BTC a day, raising the possibility of a true “supply squeeze” amid strong buying pressure. To recall, BTC underwent its latest halving in April 2024, when the mining reward for each block on the chain was slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In their commentary, IT Tech noted that meaningful retail interest has yet to kick in during this cycle. Unlike previous market tops – where retail investors aggressively accumulated BTC – current data shows them exiting the market, suggesting that the bull run may still have more room to grow. Another metric that points toward the market top being far from the current price level is the Bitcoin 30-day MA Binary CDD. In a recent analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Avocado_onchain noted that the BTC market is “far from overheating.” BTC Short-Term Holder Floor Approaching $100,000 As BTC remains range-bound between $100,000 and $110,000, the short-term holder (STH) realized price – a key psychological support level – is steadily climbing. It currently sits near $98,000, reflecting rising investor conviction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall Further on-chain data also shows that both retail and institutional holders are reducing exchange deposits, signalling reluctance to sell at current levels. This behavior supports the idea that many are positioning for further upside. At press time, BTC trades at $107,012, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Wormhole, a leading interoperability platform, has announced a monumental partnership with Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger. This collaboration is set to bring robust multichain support to the XRP Ledger and its highly anticipated EVM sidechain, marking a significant leap forward for blockchain connectivity. This isn’t just about moving tokens; it’s about fostering a new era of decentralized applications, enhancing liquidity, and unlocking unprecedented possibilities across payments, DeFi, and real-world asset (RWA) use cases. Understanding the XRP Ledger and its EVM Sidechain: What’s the Big Deal? Before diving into the specifics of Wormhole’s integration, it’s crucial to grasp the foundational elements: the XRP Ledger and its upcoming EVM sidechain. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has long been recognized for its speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability, primarily in facilitating global payments. Its native cryptocurrency, XRP, enables near-instantaneous cross-border transactions, making it a favorite for financial institutions and individual users alike. However, while efficient for payments, the XRPL’s core design has historically limited its direct support for complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) in the same vein as Ethereum. Enter the EVM sidechain. This addition is a game-changer for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. An EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible sidechain allows developers to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity – the programming language of Ethereum – directly onto a network connected to the XRP Ledger. This means that the vast ecosystem of dApps, tools, and developer talent built around Ethereum can now seamlessly extend their reach to the XRPL. It’s about combining the XRPL’s payment efficiency with the flexibility and programmability of an EVM environment, creating a hybrid powerhouse for innovation. Key aspects of the EVM sidechain’s importance: Smart Contract Functionality: Enables the creation of complex dApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and more. Developer Familiarity: Lowers the barrier to entry for Ethereum developers looking to build on the XRPL ecosystem. Ecosystem Expansion: Attracts new projects and users, diversifying the types of applications available on the XRPL. Unlocking Potential with Wormhole Multichain Interoperability The partnership with Wormhole is the key that unlocks the full potential of this evolving XRP Ledger ecosystem. Wormhole is a leading decentralized messaging protocol that enables arbitrary data and asset transfers between different blockchains. Think of it as a universal translator and bridge for the blockchain world. With Wormhole’s integration, assets and information can flow freely and securely between the XRP Ledger, its EVM sidechain, and the multitude of other blockchains Wormhole already supports, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and more. This Wormhole multichain capability addresses one of the most significant challenges in the blockchain space: fragmentation. Currently, different blockchains operate in silos, making it difficult for users and applications to interact across networks. Wormhole breaks down these barriers, creating a more unified and liquid digital economy. For the XRP Ledger, this means: Cross-Chain Asset Transfer: XRP and other assets on the XRPL can be securely wrapped and used on EVM-compatible chains, and vice-versa. Data Exchange: Decentralized applications on the EVM sidechain can communicate with and leverage data from other Wormhole-connected chains. Enhanced Liquidity: Capital can move more freely, improving liquidity for DeFi protocols and tokenized assets across ecosystems. This level of blockchain interoperability is not just a technical feat; it’s an economic accelerator. It allows developers to build truly cross-chain applications, rather than being confined to a single network. This fosters innovation, reduces development costs, and ultimately provides a richer, more integrated experience for end-users. Revolutionizing DeFi Payments and Beyond: What Does This Mean for You? The implications of this integration are profound, especially for DeFi payments and the broader decentralized finance landscape. The XRPL’s inherent efficiency for payments, combined with the EVM sidechain’s smart contract capabilities and Wormhole’s interoperability, creates a powerful trifecta. Imagine a scenario where: Seamless Cross-Chain Lending: You could deposit XRP on the XRPL, use Wormhole to bridge it to an EVM chain, and then use that bridged asset as collateral for a loan on an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol, all without multiple complex steps. Global Payment Rails for DeFi: Businesses could leverage the XRPL’s payment speed for international settlements, while simultaneously utilizing DeFi protocols on the EVM sidechain for yield generation or automated treasury management. Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs): Real-world assets like real estate, commodities, or intellectual property, tokenized on the EVM sidechain, could gain broader accessibility and liquidity by being easily transferable to other major blockchains via Wormhole. This partnership is poised to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance, making DeFi more accessible, efficient, and versatile. It paves the way for new financial products and services that can leverage the best features of multiple blockchain networks, ultimately driving mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. The Strategic Importance of the EVM Sidechain in This Ecosystem The EVM sidechain is not just an add-on; it’s a strategic imperative for the XRP Ledger’s future growth and its integration into the wider blockchain universe. By providing an EVM-compatible environment, Ripple is effectively inviting the vast community of Ethereum developers and projects to build on the XRPL. This significantly expands the potential use cases beyond traditional payments to encompass the burgeoning world of DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. The sidechain’s ability to host complex smart contracts, combined with Wormhole’s bridging capabilities, creates a powerful magnet for innovation. Developers can now leverage the XRPL’s core strengths – speed, low fees, and established network – while still benefiting from the flexibility and extensive tooling of the EVM ecosystem. This dual approach ensures that the XRP Ledger remains competitive and relevant in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Benefits of this Landmark Integration: Enhanced Liquidity: Capital can flow freely between the XRP Ledger, its EVM sidechain, and other major blockchains, increasing overall market liquidity. Expanded Developer Reach: Ethereum developers can easily port their dApps to the XRPL EVM sidechain, fostering a vibrant new ecosystem.

This denial, confirmed by reports, specifically targeted a motion seeking an ‘indicative ruling’ to dissolve a permanent injunction and significantly reduce Ripple’s proposed monetary penalty by more than half. The motion was officially terminated on June 26, marking a pivotal moment in this high-stakes legal drama. But what does this mean for Ripple, XRP, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape? Understanding the SEC Ripple Case : A Legal Saga Unpacked To truly grasp the gravity of Judge Torres’s recent decision, it’s essential to revisit the origins of the SEC Ripple case . This legal saga began in December 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen. The core of the SEC’s accusation was that Ripple had engaged in an unregistered, ongoing offering of securities through the sale of its digital asset, XRP, to retail investors. The regulatory body alleged that XRP functioned as an investment contract, thereby falling under the purview of U.S. securities laws, which Ripple vehemently denied. Ripple, on the other hand, argued that XRP is not a security but rather a digital currency used for facilitating fast and low-cost international payments. They contended that the SEC’s regulatory approach was a classic case of ‘regulation by enforcement,’ lacking clear guidelines for the burgeoning crypto industry. This fundamental disagreement has fueled a protracted legal battle, with significant implications not just for Ripple and XRP, but for how digital assets are classified and regulated across the United States and potentially globally. The crypto community has closely watched every development, recognizing that the outcome could set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. The Significance of Judge Torres Ruling : A Deep Dive into Judicial Authority Judge Analisa Torres has been at the helm of this complex litigation, and her rulings have often been a source of major market movements for XRP. Her previous partial summary judgment in July 2023 was a landmark decision that brought significant clarity to the case. In that ruling, Judge Torres distinguished between Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP, which she deemed unregistered securities, and programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges, which she ruled were not securities. This nuanced distinction was a partial victory for Ripple and was widely celebrated by the crypto community, leading to a significant surge in XRP’s price and a sense of optimism about the case’s eventual resolution. The recent denial of the joint request for an ‘indicative ruling’ further underscores Judge Torres’s firm judicial approach. An indicative ruling is typically sought when a case is on appeal, and a party wants the trial court to indicate whether it would grant a motion (like dissolving an injunction or reducing a penalty) if the case were remanded. The denial suggests that, at this stage, Judge Torres sees no immediate reason to reconsider or modify her previous orders concerning the permanent injunction or the proposed Ripple penalty . This indicates a preference for allowing the legal process to unfold as prescribed, without premature interventions based on potential future appellate outcomes. Navigating the XRP Lawsuit : Implications for Holders and the Market The XRP lawsuit has cast a long shadow over the digital asset, impacting its market performance, liquidity, and perception within the broader crypto ecosystem. For years, the uncertainty surrounding its legal status led many exchanges to delist XRP or restrict its trading for U.S. customers. This created significant market fragmentation and hindered XRP’s growth compared to other major cryptocurrencies. The partial victory in July 2023 brought a wave of relief, with many exchanges relisting XRP, and its price experiencing a notable rally. However, the recent denial by Judge Torres injects a renewed sense of caution. While not a direct loss for Ripple, it signals that a quick and easy resolution, particularly concerning the financial penalties, might not be on the horizon. XRP holders, who have weathered significant volatility and legal uncertainty, continue to watch every development closely. The ongoing legal battles emphasize the need for regulatory clarity in the crypto space, as the lack thereof directly impacts market stability and investor confidence. The community’s sentiment often swings with each legal update, reflecting the deep personal and financial stakes involved. The Contested Ripple Penalty : Why the Reduction Was Denied At the heart of the recently denied joint request was the significant financial penalty that the SEC is seeking from Ripple. Originally, the SEC demanded approximately $2 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, alleging that Ripple illegally profited from unregistered XRP sales. Ripple, in response, argued for a much lower penalty, proposing a figure closer to $10 million. Their arguments for reduction centered on various factors, including the nature of their ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) sales, which they contended were not securities, and the lack of any investor harm from their programmatic sales. The joint request for an indicative ruling aimed to reduce this substantial monetary penalty by more than half and dissolve a permanent injunction that the SEC was seeking. While the exact legal reasoning for Judge Torres’s denial has not been fully detailed, common interpretations suggest that the court might view such a request as premature or unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings. It could imply that the court prefers to wait for the appellate process to potentially unfold or that it does not see sufficient grounds to alter its current position on the injunction or the penalty amount without further legal arguments or a definitive appellate decision. This denial means that the dispute over the exact size of Ripple’s financial penalty will continue to be a contentious point, potentially requiring further litigation or negotiation before a final figure is settled. The Role of the US District Court in Shaping Crypto Regulation The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has become a crucial battleground for cryptocurrency regulation. Its decisions, particularly in high-profile cases like the SEC Ripple case , carry immense weight and often set precedents for how digital assets are treated under existing laws. The court’s meticulous approach in distinguishing between different types of XRP sales highlights the complexities involved in applying traditional securities laws to novel technologies. This court’s rulings are not just about Ripple; they are about defining the boundaries of regulatory authority in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The challenges of regulating crypto are manifold: the global nature of digital assets, the decentralized characteristics of many projects, and the speed at which technology evolves often outpace legislative and regulatory frameworks. The judiciary, therefore, finds itself in a position of interpreting existing laws to fit new paradigms, a task that is inherently complex and often leads to prolonged legal battles. The denial of this joint request from the US District Court further underscores the judiciary’s commitment to due process and careful deliberation, rather than expediting outcomes that may have significant long-term implications for the entire crypto industry. What’s Next for the SEC and Ripple? Looking Ahead The denial of this joint request, while a significant development, is certainly not the final chapter in the SEC Ripple case . Both parties still have avenues to pursue. Ripple could appeal the aspects of Judge Torres’s ruling that went against them, particularly regarding the institutional sales. Similarly, the SEC could appeal the programmatic sales ruling. Settlement talks remain a possibility, though the current denial suggests that the path to a quick resolution is not straightforward. The court will likely proceed with determining the final penalty amount, which could involve further hearings or submissions from both sides. For investors and market participants, the key takeaway is that regulatory clarity for XRP and other digital assets remains a work in progress. While the lawsuit has provided some distinctions, the ultimate classification of various crypto assets continues to be debated. It is crucial for market participants to stay informed, understand the potential implications of ongoing legal proceedings, and consider how regulatory developments might impact their investment strategies. The long-term outlook for XRP will largely depend on the final resolution of this lawsuit and the broader regulatory environment that emerges in the U.S. Conclusion: A Definitive Step, But Not the End Judge Analisa Torres’s denial of the joint SEC and Ripple request to modify her ruling and reduce the Ripple penalty marks a definitive, if not final, step in this protracted legal saga. It reinforces the court’s intention to meticulously follow legal procedures and not rush to judgment, especially on matters of significant financial and legal consequence. While it may prolong the uncertainty for some, it also highlights the judiciary’s commitment to a thorough and deliberate process in shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulation. The crypto world will continue to watch closely, as every decision in this case has far-reaching implications for how digital assets are treated under the law, influencing everything from market dynamics to innovation in the blockchain space.

Judge Analisa Torres has officially rejected a request from both Ripple and the SEC. They had asked the court to allow them to move forward with a private settlement, hoping it would cancel out the court’s earlier judgment. But the judge made it clear that private deals don’t erase public court decisions. In her ruling, Judge Torres explained that her judgment was made based on the law, and since those laws haven’t changed, there’s no reason for her decision to change either. She also pointed out that Ripple and the SEC don’t have the power to ignore a final court ruling. If they want to settle, they’ll need to either drop their appeals and accept her decision or continue through the appeal process. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: Judge Torres has denied the parties’ Motion for an Indicative Ruling. pic.twitter.com/9AMhGcQUsU — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 26, 2025 Crypto attorney Fred Rispoli weighed in on social media, giving some insight into what might happen next. He said both sides have to submit a status report to the 2nd Circuit Court in August. That report will reveal whether they plan to move forward with the appeal, which could keep the case going until late 2026 or early 2027, or if they’ve reached a settlement. According to Rispoli, settlement is the most likely outcome and expects we could hear about it by the end of July or early August this year. For now, everyone’s waiting to see what the next move will be in this closely watched legal battle. Attorney Bill Morgan also took to social media and wrote, “But as the judge points out the parties can just agree to settle by withdrawing the appeals. As I said in a post a few hours ago they could’ve done that any time over the last two months but Ripple wanted more. It wanted the injunction dissolved.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 02:13:23

HYPE, Kaspa Climb Post-Conflict",https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-nears-june-30-launch-is-it-the-top-crypto-with-100x-potential-hype-kaspa-climb-post-conflict/,"As geopolitical tensions ease following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, signs of renewed confidence are emerging across the crypto market. Daily volume on key exchanges has increased, speculative assets have begun regaining traction, and leading tokens like HYPE and Kaspa are seeing a surge in attention. With this environment regaining momentum, the question is: which asset is poised to dominate the next wave? One contender is gaining extraordinary traction. Qubetics ($TICS) is making headlines with its upcoming top 10 global exchange listing. It’s rapidly expanding presale, which has already surpassed $18.1 million. Unlike many of its contemporaries, Qubetics directly tackles real-world utility through a decentralised VPN and secure cross-border connectivity, all while analysts increasingly call it the top crypto with 100x potential. Qubetics Decentralized VPN Could Redefine Secure Access in Web3 What sets Qubetics apart from a growing crowd of presale projects is its foundational use case: a decentralised VPN designed to eliminate Web2-era vulnerabilities. As surveillance fatigue and data insecurity mount globally, the demand for secure, anonymous browsing and data flow has intensified across industries. Through its Decentralized VPN (dVPN), Qubetics provides a multi-layered framework enabling encrypted, location-agnostic connectivity. For example, healthcare organisations working with sensitive patient data can use Qubetics’ VPN infrastructure to enable real-time, compliant remote access for cross-border clinical collaboration. Similarly, journalists or human rights groups in censorship-heavy regions could communicate safely without traceability. Even small-to-medium enterprises conducting overseas operations stand to benefit from the dVPN’s immunity to centralized choke points or ISP throttling. Built into the broader Qubetics architecture, one that aggregates Layer-1 blockchains, privacy tech, and tokenised services, the VPN module aligns with the project’s mission: to provide seamless, secure digital infrastructure to both individuals and organisations. The project’s emphasis on privacy, decentralisation, and functional utility is why some analysts are placing it at the front of the top crypto with 100x potential list. Why Early Adopters Are Taking Notice of This Top Crypto with 100x Potential As of Stage 37, Qubetics is priced at $0.3370 with over 516 million $TICS tokens sold. The presale tally now exceeds $18.1 million, and the total token holder count has surpassed 28,300. With fewer than 9 million tokens remaining at the current price, demand is accelerating. Once this stage ends, the price will rise again until the presale closes permanently and access transitions to the open market. At the time of writing, a $5,500 contribution would secure roughly 16,322 $TICS tokens. Should $TICS reach $1, this would convert to $16,322, offering a return of over 196%. If the token climbs to $5 in the next cycle, that initial $5,500 becomes $81,610. A rise to $10 or $15 would raise the value to $163,220 or $244,830 respectively. The tokenomics further support long-term viability. From an initial supply of over 4 billion, the circulating cap has been reduced to 1.36 billion tokens. Public allocation accounts for 38.55% of that, ensuring decentralisation while preserving scarcity. With a top 10 global exchange listing confirmed and an initial trading price projected around $0.40, early adopters are eyeing a 20% price increase immediately upon launch. Qubetics isn’t just gaining attention, it’s redefining expectations for what a high-utility presale can offer. Three Hours to Market: Qubetics Locks in June 30 Exchange Debut Qubetics will close its final presale stage on June 30 at 8 AM UTC and list on a top 10 exchange by 11 AM UTC, just three hours later. The confirmed listing price is $0.40—up 20% from current presale levels—fueling last-minute buying from early adopters. This seamless shift from presale to exchange signals a calculated launch, backed by reduced token supply and rising demand. With over 516 million tokens already sold, Qubetics is being dubbed the best crypto pre sale closing out June and one of the strongest bets for Q3. Analysts expect post-launch momentum to build rapidly, making this a rare entry point for those still on the sidelines. Kaspa’s Early Buyers See 50x Returns as Community Momentum Accelerates While Qubetics builds momentum, Kaspa has shown why early adoption in fundamentally strong Layer-1 projects still pays off. According to Coinpedia, early community members who backed Kaspa have seen returns exceeding 50x. This growth is rooted in Kaspa’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which enables instant confirmation and high throughput, an innovation that remains unique among major Layer-1 blockchains. Kaspa’s rising popularity is not only due to its tech. Its accessibility has played a major role in community traction. Low entry barriers and strong decentralisation narratives have made it a go-to option for those seeking transparent, scalable alternatives to Ethereum or Solana. The platform’s ability to combine proof-of-work security with DAG-based speed is attracting new protocols to consider it as infrastructure. While the token’s future price targets are speculative, its performance has already become a reference point in the discussion around altcoins that could sustain relevance through multiple market cycles. HYPE Eyes New All-Time High Amid Perpetual DEX Growth Another coin making news in this stabilising market is HYPE (Hyperliquid), which analysts believe could be on track for a new all-time high. Per TradingView, the decentralised perpetuals exchange supporting the token has grown exponentially in both liquidity and user onboarding. HYPE’s core infrastructure supports 0.01-second trading latency and advanced risk engines, making it attractive to high-volume traders who need speed, accuracy, and autonomy. The HYPE price prediction for 2025 hovers around ambitious targets, driven by the expansion of on-chain perpetuals, a niche growing rapidly amid dissatisfaction with centralised exchanges. With the broader DeFi ecosystem seeking deeper liquidity and faster execution, Hyperliquid is emerging as a protocol positioned to capture a large share of that shift. While the current price remains below previous peaks, analysts forecast that structural growth in DeFi combined with new partnerships may help HYPE chart new price territory within the next 12–18 months. Its role in the ongoing decentralisation of financial markets gives it long-term appeal, especially as regulatory scrutiny on centralised platforms intensifies. A Strategic Look at the Top Crypto with 100x Potential As the market settles after a period of conflict-driven uncertainty, participants are searching for the top crypto with 100x potential, and these three projects are at the forefront. Kaspa has validated its long-term promise with real results. HYPE is riding the DeFi expansion wave and could redefine DEX trading velocity. But Qubetics combines Layer-1 interoperability, privacy, and a decentralised VPN into a single framework, and that’s not just novel, it’s essential. With a confirmed top exchange listing at $0.40, over 516 million tokens already sold, and a finite window remaining at current prices, Qubetics may offer what few presales can: scalability, utility, and price potential. For those exploring the best crypto presale right now, this is one project that warrants serious consideration. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the Qubetics use case? Qubetics enables secure, decentralized internet access through its dVPN system, protecting user privacy across industries and regions. Is Qubetics available on major exchanges? Not yet, but it is confirmed to be launching soon on a top 10 global exchange with an initial listing price of $0.40. Which is the top crypto with 100x potential in 2025? Qubetics is increasingly cited by analysts as the top crypto with 100x potential due to its real-world utility and upcoming exchange listing. Summary As the crypto market steadies following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, renewed momentum is building around select altcoins, particularly Qubetics, Kaspa, and HYPE. Kaspa’s early adopters have seen up to 50x gains, while HYPE’s perpetual DEX is positioning for a possible new all-time high. Yet, it’s Qubetics that stands out as the top crypto with 100x potential. With over 516 million tokens sold, $18.1 million raised, and a confirmed listing on a top 10 global exchange at $0.40, Qubetics is drawing serious attention. Its Decentralized VPN offers secure, scalable internet access, bridging privacy and real-world use cases across industries.

As the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all registered positive gains, investors are keenly observing what this bullish start signifies for broader investor sentiment and, crucially, its potential implications for digital assets. For many in the crypto community, understanding the interplay between traditional finance and the decentralized world is key to navigating market volatility and identifying emerging opportunities. Let’s delve into the specifics of today’s market open and explore its wider economic ramifications. What’s Driving the US Stock Markets Rally Today? Today’s trading session commenced on a high note, with all major US stock markets indices showing promising gains right from the opening bell. The S&P 500, a benchmark for large-cap U.S. equities, climbed by +0.37%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite, often a barometer for growth stocks and innovation, saw a respectable rise of +0.31%. Not to be outdone, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant American companies, posted a gain of +0.28%. These figures, while modest, paint a picture of renewed confidence and positive buying pressure. This upward movement suggests a prevailing optimism among investors, perhaps fueled by recent corporate earnings reports, economic data, or shifting macroeconomic expectations. Such an immediate positive reaction at the market open often sets the tone for the rest of the trading day and can indicate a broader shift in market psychology. Decoding Investor Sentiment: Why Does a Strong Open Matter? A strong market open , particularly across major indices, is more than just numbers; it’s a powerful indicator of prevailing investor sentiment . When markets open higher, it often reflects a collective belief among participants that economic conditions are favorable, corporate profits will continue to grow, or that anticipated challenges are manageable. This positive outlook can create a virtuous cycle, encouraging more investment and further bolstering asset prices. Conversely, a weak opening can signal apprehension or a lack of confidence. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, tracking traditional market sentiment is vital because, despite their distinct characteristics, crypto markets often mirror the risk appetite seen in equities. When traditional investors feel confident enough to buy stocks, they might also be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, perceiving the broader economic outlook as stable enough to support such ventures. This interconnectedness highlights the importance of keeping an eye on the bigger financial picture. The Crypto Correlation Conundrum: How Connected Are We? The relationship between US stock markets and the cryptocurrency space has been a subject of intense debate. Historically, Bitcoin, often seen as “digital gold,” was thought to be an uncorrelated asset, acting as a hedge against traditional market volatility. However, recent years have shown an increasing crypto correlation with major equity indices, particularly the NASDAQ. When tech stocks rally, often so do cryptocurrencies, and vice versa. Today’s positive stock market opening could, therefore, be interpreted as a bullish signal for crypto. Why this correlation? As institutional adoption of crypto grows and more traditional investors enter the space, digital assets are increasingly treated as risk-on assets, much like growth stocks. This means that factors influencing traditional equities—such as interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability—can also impact crypto prices. While the correlation isn’t always perfect, a robust performance in traditional markets often creates a favorable environment for crypto, signaling a broader willingness to take on risk across the investment landscape. It’s a reminder that while crypto offers unique value propositions, it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Navigating the Economic Outlook: What’s Next for Markets and Crypto? Today’s positive market open certainly paints an encouraging picture for the immediate future, but what does it mean for the broader economic outlook and its long-term implications for both traditional finance and cryptocurrencies? A sustained upward trend in stock markets typically suggests underlying economic strength, perhaps driven by strong employment figures, contained inflation, or a dovish stance from central banks. For crypto, this can translate into continued investor confidence and potentially higher capital inflows. However, investors must remain vigilant. The global economy is a complex web, influenced by geopolitical events, regulatory shifts, and technological advancements. While a positive start is welcome, factors like persistent inflation, potential interest rate hikes, or unexpected global events could quickly shift the narrative. Therefore, while today’s gains are a reason for optimism, a prudent approach involves closely monitoring upcoming economic data, central bank announcements, and significant news events. Understanding these broader macroeconomic forces is crucial for making informed decisions, whether you’re trading stocks or digital assets, as they all contribute to the overarching investor sentiment . Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor: Monitor Macro Trends: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Keep an eye on traditional market performance, inflation data, and interest rate announcements. They significantly influence risk appetite. Diversify Wisely: While correlations exist, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes (including a mix of traditional and digital assets) can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: News from major economies, particularly the US, can directly impact global market sentiment. Being aware of these developments helps in anticipating market shifts. Assess Risk Appetite: A rising tide lifts all boats, but be prepared for potential pullbacks. Understand your own risk tolerance before making significant investment decisions. In conclusion, today’s strong market open in US stock markets provides a significant boost to overall investor sentiment , reflecting a generally positive economic outlook . While not a direct predictor, this upward trajectory often fosters a more favorable environment for the cryptocurrency market, highlighting the growing crypto correlation . As traditional and digital financial worlds become increasingly intertwined, understanding these connections is paramount for any investor seeking to navigate the complex yet opportunity-rich landscape. The current positive momentum serves as a reminder that the broader financial ecosystem plays a crucial role in shaping the future of digital assets.

In a report released Thursday from Paris, the global watchdog said jurisdictions have made progress since 2024 on implementing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks for virtual assets and related service providers. However, it noted that critical challenges remain, particularly around licensing, offshore oversight, and identifying entities involved in virtual asset services. The FATF’s latest targeted update focused on Recommendation 15, which was expanded in 2019 to cover crypto markets. With virtual assets inherently borderless, regulatory failures in one jurisdiction can have global consequences.

The FATF also released a new guide outlining best practices for supervising compliance with the rule. The report flags mounting threats associated with the rise of stablecoins. It said their use by illicit actors, including North Korea-linked hackers, terror financiers and drug traffickers, has grown significantly. It warned that mass stablecoin adoption without coordinated regulation could increase global exposure to illicit finance. North Korea’s Record Crypto Theft Exposes Weak Links in Global Enforcement The update follows a series of alarming trends. So far this year, North Korea executed what the FATF described as the largest virtual asset theft in history, stealing $1.46b from exchange platform ByBit . Only about 3.8% of the stolen funds has been recovered. This shows serious gaps in international asset tracing and recovery efforts. Meanwhile, fraud and scams continue to trouble the crypto sector. The FATF cited industry estimates that around $51b in on-chain transactions last year were linked to such illicit activity. These cases point to increasingly sophisticated tactics by bad actors. As a result, governments are under growing pressure to enhance cooperation and improve asset seizure mechanisms. In one example, the UK’s Operation Destabilise demonstrated how coordinated law enforcement can disrupt crypto-fueled criminal networks. The FATF said such efforts must be replicated globally and backed by more robust supervision and enforcement. The watchdog acknowledged support from analytics firms including Chainalysis, Lukka, Merkle Science and TRM Labs in compiling the update. It also stressed that nearly 98% of the global virtual asset market is concentrated in jurisdictions within the FATF’s Global Network. Bringing these players into full compliance, it said, will be key to reducing worldwide risk.

Each built its own reputation—Ethereum as the foundation of DeFi and smart contracts, XRP as the institutional bridge asset, and AVAX as a scalable alternative layer one. But heading into Q3 2025, their hold on the market is slipping. Ethereum’s long-anticipated network upgrades have done little to reverse declining retail enthusiasm. Gas fees have eased, but congestion and complexity remain. XRP, despite legal progress and hints of an ETF push, continues to trade in a tight range. And AVAX, while technically sound, has lost the momentum it carried during the 2021–22 cycle. Traders looking for sharp upside are beginning to rotate out—and they’re not moving into other blue chips. Instead, attention is shifting toward earlier-stage opportunities. Among the names attracting serious interest, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a clear favorite. Certainly—here’s a reworked version that keeps the structure professional, sharpens the language, and reads naturally without sounding like AI-generated copy: MAGACOIN FINANCE: Built for Traders Who Want a Clearer Path In MAGACOIN FINANCE takes a different approach from the usual crop of new tokens. There’s no convoluted roadmap or flashy promises—just a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, no allocations for venture capital, and full transparency around how tokens are distributed. It’s a structure designed to reward early entrants and reduce the kind of selling pressure that typically drags new projects down. That clarity is part of what’s drawing in traders. Many are growing tired of navigating projects with complex vesting schedules, backroom deals, or ecosystem politics. MAGACOIN FINANCE avoids all of that. It doesn’t have to win back trust or reclaim lost ground—it’s starting clean, and building forward. Momentum is already building. The presale is gaining real traction, especially among investors who’ve grown frustrated with the slow pace of large-cap assets like Ethereum and XRP. Those tokens may still appeal to institutions, but for traders looking for early-stage opportunity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the more compelling option—a high-upside play with timing on its side.A Different Kind of Rotation This shift isn’t about abandoning fundamentals. It’s about time horizon and opportunity. Ethereum’s dominance is unlikely to disappear. XRP has weathered harsher storms. AVAX still runs efficient infrastructure. But for those positioning now—not for preservation, but for growth—the trade is changing. Presale-stage altcoins are volatile by nature. But that’s where many of the strongest gains have come in past cycles. And with altcoin season forecasts growing more confident by the week, the timing for early positioning has rarely looked stronger. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and AVAX will remain relevant. But for traders seeking meaningful upside, the attention is already elsewhere. Among the altcoins now emerging, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out not just for its narrative, but for its structure, timing, and growing momentum. Whether it becomes a breakout success depends on execution—but it’s clear that more and more traders aren’t waiting to find out.

For many traditional investors, an RSI hitting 70 often signals an ‘overbought’ asset, typically followed by a price correction. But what if the rules for the volatile and exciting crypto market are different? Renowned analyst PlanB, famous for his Stock-to-Flow model, recently took to X to share a crucial perspective that might just put those worries to rest. Understanding Bitcoin RSI: Is 70 Really Overbought? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100. Traditionally, an RSI reading above 70 suggests an asset is overbought, while a reading below 30 indicates it’s oversold. These are often seen as signals for potential reversals. However, PlanB’s latest insight challenges this conventional wisdom when applied to Bitcoin. He pointed out that while a 70 RSI might raise eyebrows in traditional finance, it’s quite a normal occurrence for Bitcoin. Why? Because Bitcoin typically operates within a much broader RSI range, historically trading between 40 and 90. This makes the current level of 70 only slightly above its historical average of 65. This critical piece of PlanB analysis suggests that applying traditional metrics without considering Bitcoin’s unique market dynamics can lead to misinterpretations. Why Does Bitcoin Behave Differently? Exploring Unique Market Dynamics Bitcoin isn’t your average stock or commodity. Its inherent volatility, driven by factors like halving events, global macroeconomic shifts, rapid technological adoption, and evolving regulatory landscapes, contributes to its distinct RSI behavior. Here are a few reasons why Bitcoin’s RSI might differ: Rapid Price Discovery: Bitcoin is still a relatively young asset class, undergoing rapid price discovery. Periods of intense buying pressure can sustain high RSI levels for longer than traditional assets. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events (halvings) often precede parabolic bull runs, during which the asset can appear ‘overbought’ for extended periods as demand outstrips supply. Global Accessibility: Unlike many traditional markets, Bitcoin trades 24/7 globally, leading to continuous price action that can sustain momentum. Investor Psychology: The unique blend of retail and institutional investor sentiment in crypto can lead to prolonged buying frenzies that defy traditional ‘overbought’ indicators. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors So, what does this mean for you, the everyday Bitcoin investor? It means looking beyond simplistic indicators and understanding the broader context. Here are some actionable insights: Context is King: Don’t just look at the RSI number; understand where Bitcoin is in its market cycle (e.g., pre-halving, post-halving, accumulation phase). Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s historical performance shows that even after periods of high RSI, significant upside has often followed. A long-term holding strategy often outperforms short-term trading based on single indicators. Diversify Your Analysis: While RSI is a valuable tool, combine it with other indicators like moving averages, volume trends, and on-chain metrics to get a more comprehensive picture. Avoid Panic Selling: The fear of an ‘overbought’ asset can lead to premature selling. PlanB’s perspective helps mitigate this fear by contextualizing the current RSI level. Challenging the ‘Overbought Bitcoin’ Narrative The idea of an overbought Bitcoin at an RSI of 70 is largely a narrative carried over from traditional markets. In equity markets, an RSI of 70 often suggests that a stock’s price has risen too quickly and is due for a pullback. However, Bitcoin’s parabolic growth phases have frequently seen its RSI sustain levels well into the 80s and even 90s before any significant correction. This resilience to traditional ‘overbought’ signals is a hallmark of Bitcoin’s unique market behavior and highlights the importance of crypto-specific analysis. PlanB’s consistent focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value and unique market dynamics provides a calming perspective amidst short-term market fluctuations. His emphasis on the historical trading range of 40-90 for Bitcoin’s RSI reminds us that what might seem alarming in one market is perfectly normal in another. This understanding empowers investors to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of reacting to false signals and staying focused on the asset’s potential. The Future of Investor Sentiment in the Crypto Market As the crypto market matures, the sophistication of its analysis must evolve. Relying solely on traditional indicators can be misleading. PlanB’s latest commentary serves as a powerful reminder that Bitcoin operates under its own rules, influenced by unique supply-demand dynamics, technological advancements, and a passionate global community. Understanding these nuances is key to navigating the exciting yet volatile world of digital assets. By embracing a crypto-native analytical approach, investors can better gauge true market health and make decisions aligned with Bitcoin’s unique trajectory.

Former Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett responded to this development, posting a summary of Judge Torres’s message to Ripple and the SEC, following the decision to deny their joint motion seeking to modify key terms of the court’s final judgment. Private Deals Cannot Override Public Judgments Terrett explained that the Judge made it clear that private agreements cannot override a public judgment issued by a federal court. The ruling leaves Ripple’s permanent injunction in place and maintains the $125 million penalty previously imposed. Judge Torres emphasized that a court’s final judgment is not something parties can negotiate away. Her statement was direct: “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment.” Terrett also noted that the ruling underlines that judgments serve the interests of the litigants and the broader public interest. NEW: Judge Torres’s message in the ruling is that private deals don’t erase public judgments and her judgment still serves the public interest. “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment… They have not come close to doing so… https://t.co/Jt5STl3nWt — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 26, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Limited Options for Ripple and the SEC Her message also offered a clear choice to Ripple and the SEC. If either party disagrees with the court’s decision, the path forward is through the appeals process, not through privately negotiated revisions. The SEC initially asked the Second Circuit to extend the stay on the appeals to August 15 to give Judge Torres time to make her decision. Her decision may force both parties into litigation. Alternatively, they can withdraw their appeals and accept the judgment as it stands. The judge made it clear that neither side had presented circumstances that would justify altering the judgment outside of the proper legal channels. Both Parties Failed to Meet the Required Standard While most market participants assumed the judge rejected the initial filing solely because of a procedural error, the recent ruling denies the notion that the court’s previous findings are subject to negotiation. Prominent attorneys believed Judge Torres would grant the motion . But the attempt to revise those terms without fully concluding the appellate process failed to satisfy the standards required for such relief. The language of the ruling leaves little room for ambiguity. According to Terrett’s post, Torres stated that the parties “have not come close” to demonstrating the type of extraordinary circumstances needed to set aside the judgment. Now, Ripple and the SEC must decide whether to pursue their appeals in full or accept the current judgment without further challenge.

This strategic acquisition is not just a one-off transaction but a foundational step in a much larger, ambitious crypto treasury strategy that could set a precedent for other established players. Why are HYPE Tokens Attracting Institutional Eyes? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with new projects emerging and gaining traction. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is one such asset that has recently captured the attention of major financial entities like Lion Group. According to a PR Newswire press release, Lion Group Holdings made an initial $2 million purchase of Hyperliquid (HYPE) tokens at an average price of $37.30. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a calculated move to integrate digital assets into their core financial operations. Hyperliquid, as a decentralized perpetual exchange, offers high-performance trading and liquidity solutions within the DeFi ecosystem. Its underlying technology and growing user base likely present a compelling case for institutions seeking exposure to innovative blockchain protocols. The decision by Lion Group to specifically target HYPE tokens suggests a belief in the platform’s long-term potential and its role in the future of decentralized finance. Lion Group’s Ambitious Crypto Treasury Strategy : What Does it Mean? Lion Group’s $2 million HYPE token acquisition is just the tip of the iceberg. This initial purchase is part of a much broader $600 million treasury strategy aimed at diversifying its holdings and leveraging the growth potential of digital assets. This significant allocation signals a deep commitment to the crypto space, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate these assets into their fundamental financial framework. The firm plans to acquire more HYPE, along with other prominent cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI). This multi-asset approach highlights a thoughtful diversification strategy within the digital asset sector. The capital for these future purchases will be sourced from the proceeds of a recent $11 million funding round, demonstrating a proactive and well-funded initiative. Key Aspects of Lion Group’s Treasury Strategy: Scale: A formidable $600 million target allocation for digital assets. Diversification: Including HYPE, SOL, and SUI, indicating a belief in different segments of the crypto market. Funding Source: Leveraging recent funding round proceeds, ensuring a dedicated capital pool for crypto acquisitions. Long-Term Vision: Integrating digital assets into the core treasury, suggesting a long-term holding and strategic utilization perspective rather than short-term speculation. Beyond Hyperliquid : The Broader Digital Asset Play While the initial focus is on HYPE tokens, Lion Group’s plans extend to Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), showcasing a comprehensive view of the digital asset landscape. Each of these assets represents a different facet of the blockchain ecosystem: Digital Asset Primary Role/Characteristics Why it Matters to Lion Group Hyperliquid (HYPE) Decentralized perpetual exchange, high-performance DeFi Exposure to cutting-edge DeFi infrastructure and trading innovation. Solana (SOL) High-throughput blockchain, scalable smart contracts, vibrant ecosystem Investment in a leading Layer-1 blockchain known for speed and growing dApp development. Sui (SUI) Layer-1 blockchain, object-centric model, designed for Web3 applications Betting on next-generation blockchain technology with unique design principles for future scalability. This multi-pronged approach allows Lion Group to gain exposure to different growth vectors within the crypto market, mitigating risks while maximizing potential returns. It reflects a sophisticated understanding that the digital asset space is not monolithic, and diverse investments are key to a robust crypto treasury strategy . The Rise of Institutional Crypto Investment : A New Era? Lion Group’s move is part of a larger trend of institutional crypto investment gaining momentum. Historically, the crypto market has been dominated by retail investors, but increasingly, large financial firms, hedge funds, and corporations are allocating significant capital to digital assets. This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market: Increased regulatory clarity (though still evolving), improved infrastructure, and more robust security measures make crypto more palatable for institutions. Inflation Hedging: Some institutions view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge against inflation or a store of value. Diversification: Digital assets offer a new uncorrelated asset class, providing diversification benefits to traditional portfolios. Technological Innovation: Belief in the underlying blockchain technology and its potential to disrupt various industries. The participation of Nasdaq-listed entities like Lion Group lends significant credibility to the crypto market, potentially encouraging other mainstream financial players to follow suit. This institutional influx can lead to increased liquidity, reduced volatility, and a more stable market environment overall. What Does Lion Group’s Move Mean for Lion Group Itself? For Lion Group Holdings, this aggressive foray into digital assets is a strategic pivot that could yield significant benefits. By integrating HYPE tokens , SOL, and SUI into their treasury, they are: Positioning for Future Growth: Tapping into a high-growth sector that could offer substantial returns, enhancing shareholder value. Innovating Their Business Model: Demonstrating adaptability and forward-thinking leadership in the financial services industry. Attracting New Clients: Appealing to a new generation of investors and businesses interested in digital assets, expanding their client base. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Potentially creating new opportunities for financial products and services related to digital assets. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties still present in the crypto market. Lion Group’s substantial commitment underscores their conviction, but like any investment, it comes with risks. Their careful selection of established and promising assets like Hyperliquid, Solana, and Sui suggests a measured approach within this high-growth sector. Conclusion: A Roaring Statement in the Digital Age Lion Group Holdings’ strategic $2 million acquisition of HYPE tokens , as part of its expansive $600 million crypto treasury strategy , marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. This move, alongside planned purchases of Solana and Sui, not only highlights the growing confidence in assets like Hyperliquid but also signifies a broader trend of institutional crypto investment reshaping the global financial landscape. As more traditional firms embrace these innovative technologies, the bridge between conventional finance and the decentralized world continues to strengthen, promising an exciting future for digital asset adoption.

XRP Price Prediction XRP’s overall price trend still leans bearish. The coin continues to make lower highs and lower lows, a pattern that signals weakness in the market. While small price jumps can happen even in a downtrend, a proper trend reversal would require XRP to start forming higher lows and eventually break past previous highs.

If the price does manage to move above $2.20 with a strong daily close, the next target area would be around $2.30 to $2.35. A breakout past this point would signal a much stronger bullish trend and could open doors for a rally towards $2.60. Can XRP Price Dip Below $2? On the downside, the key support zone to watch is between $2.05 and $2.10. If XRP falls below this, the next support would be around $1.92 to $1.95. Right now, momentum remains weak, with short-term gains appearing within a generally bearish market structure. For this bullish scenario to stay intact, XRP needs to hold above the $2.08 support area. If the price drops below this, it increases the risk of the market making a fresh low. If that happens, the focus would shift to the bigger support level around $1.79. At the moment, while Bitcoin has already shown signs of forming five waves up, XRP has yet to do the same. Until clearer signs of strength appear, experts are watching for signs of support holding and any move that could lead to a fifth wave upward.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 02:42:23

Recent developments surrounding Spot Dogecoin ETF filings by asset manager Bitwise are sending ripples of excitement across the market, hinting at a new era of mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity. What Exactly Did Bitwise Amend for Its Spot ETFs? In a significant move, leading cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise recently submitted amended S-1 filings for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic refinement in response to ongoing dialogue with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a keen observer of the ETF landscape, highlighted these updates on X, noting their positive implications. He emphasized that such amendments are a clear sign of active engagement from the SEC, a crucial step that has historically preceded the approval of other prominent spot ETFs. Why Are These Spot Dogecoin ETF and Aptos ETF Filings So Significant? The submission of amended S-1 filings for both the Spot Dogecoin ETF and Aptos ETF filing marks a pivotal moment. An S-1 filing is essentially a registration statement required by the SEC for new securities. When amendments are filed, it typically indicates that the issuer (Bitwise, in this case) is addressing feedback or concerns raised by the SEC. This iterative process is a standard part of regulatory review and, as Balchunas pointed out, aligns perfectly with the trajectory seen during the approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. For investors, this means the SEC isn’t just sitting on these applications; they are actively engaging, providing feedback, and moving towards a potential decision. It signals a maturation of the crypto market in the eyes of regulators, transitioning from outright skepticism to a more structured, albeit cautious, review. What Does Crypto ETF Approval Mean for the Broader Market? The potential for Crypto ETF approval , particularly for altcoins like Dogecoin and Aptos, carries immense implications for the entire digital asset ecosystem: Increased Accessibility: ETFs provide a regulated, traditional investment vehicle, making it easier for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This removes complexities like managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. Institutional Adoption: The entry of more regulated products encourages larger financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to crypto, legitimizing the asset class further. Market Liquidity and Stability: ETFs can bring significant capital inflows, potentially increasing market liquidity and reducing volatility over time as more sophisticated trading strategies are employed. Regulatory Clarity: Each approval sets a precedent, contributing to a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, which is vital for long-term growth and investor confidence. Of course, challenges remain, including ongoing regulatory scrutiny and market volatility, but the trajectory is undeniably positive. How Does This Reflect Evolving SEC Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s approach to SEC crypto regulation has been a subject of intense debate and evolution. Initially, the Commission maintained a highly cautious stance, often citing concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto industry. However, the approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs, followed by spot Bitcoin ETFs, and more recently, spot Ethereum ETFs, indicates a significant shift. This progression suggests a growing understanding and, perhaps, acceptance of digital assets within the existing regulatory framework. The engagement with Bitwise on Dogecoin and Aptos filings underscores a willingness to consider a broader range of cryptocurrencies for regulated investment products, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. This pragmatic approach, while slow, is crucial for fostering innovation while safeguarding investors. What’s Next for Bitwise ETF and the Crypto Market? For the Bitwise ETF proposals, the next steps will likely involve continued dialogue with the SEC, potentially more amendments, and eventually, a decision. While there’s no guaranteed timeline, the positive tone from analysts like Balchunas suggests a path forward. Potential Timelines: The review process can take months, but the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs offers a template. Market Reaction: Should these ETFs receive approval, expect significant positive price action for Dogecoin and Aptos, driven by increased institutional interest and retail accessibility. Actionable Insights for Investors: Investors interested in these assets might consider researching the fundamentals of Dogecoin and Aptos, understanding their use cases and communities, and staying informed on regulatory updates. Diversification remains key, and consulting a financial advisor is always recommended before making investment decisions. Bitwise’s proactive steps in amending its spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETF filings are more than just bureaucratic updates; they are powerful indicators of advancing regulatory acceptance within the U.S. This positive engagement from the SEC, coupled with the insights from leading analysts, paints an optimistic picture for the future of crypto ETFs. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature, these developments pave the way for greater institutional participation and broader mainstream adoption, fundamentally reshaping how we view and invest in cryptocurrencies. The journey towards full regulatory clarity is ongoing, but each amended filing brings us closer to a more integrated and accessible crypto market.

The intelligent design and consistent advancement of the project have made it a hot issue among intellectuals looking for the next significant blockchain invention. Lightchain AI is gaining traction not through hype but rather by real interest in its scalable and utility-driven approach. Its presale raised $20.9 million and tokens are priced consistently at $0.007. Cardano is under doubt about timelines, but Lightchain AI is gathering support among builders and investors ready for a more quick and intelligent blockchain solution. Cardano Faces Scrutiny Over Persistent Roadmap Delays In 2025, Cardano is being watched ever more closely as its roadmap continues to face delays after it previously promised decentralization and scalability. Founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed the end of the original roadmap, which culminated with events such as the Plomin hard fork and the on-chain ratification of the Cardano Constitution, while crucial projects such as Hydra and Leios continue without a commitment to further funding, working “under at risk conditions”. These delays have caused concerns in the community, mainly about the staking function and other functionalities that have been promised. With the creation of the Constitutional Committee and later DRep election, the present transfer of governance is seen as a chance to solve these problems by acting as mo re transparent and more involved community servant. Still to be seen, though, whether such policies will prove successful in boosting confidence rebuilding and development. Key Influencer Endorsements Give Lightchain AI Visibility As important players start supporting the project for its practical use and technical innovation, lightchain artificial intelligence is becoming more and more visible in the crypto scene. Lightchain AI’s AI-integrated Layer 1 design, dynamic pricing model, and optimized gas structure are attracting respected voices unlike fleeting hype tokens. These sponsorships are helping to hasten demand at a pivotal point as the Bonus Round is under progress at a set $0.007 price. Influencers are stressing Lightchain AI’s distributed validator and contributor nodes, forthcoming public repository launch, and $150,000 grant program meant to support AIVM-powered development. Lightchain AI keeps growing outside of early adopters as more credible leaders offer their optimistic view gains traction among larger investor audiences who give utility and transparency top priority. From Podcasts to Portfolio: Lightchain AI Is Changing the Crypto Scene From buzzing podcasts to investor portfolios, Lightchain AI is generating waves in the crypto space and inspiring enthusiasm everywhere. Its dynamic gas optimization, lightning-fast execution, and modern AI-integrated blockchain architecture help to explain de velopers and investors fl ocking to it. The Transparent AI Framework guarantees completely verifiable and auditable AI computations, so adding still another layer of trust.

Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Shows Mixed Behavior From Holders In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the BTC investor cohorts aren’t showing a unified behavior on the Accumulation Trend Score. The Accumulation Trend Score refers to an indicator that basically tells us whether Bitcoin holders are accumulating or not. The metric bases its value on two factors: the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors and the size of those wallets. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It When the value of the indicator is greater than 0.5, it means the large holders (or a large number of small hands) are leaning toward net accumulation. The closer the score is to 1.0, the stronger the buying. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold suggests the investors are in a phase of distribution (or simply, that they aren’t accumulating). This behavior is the strongest at the zero mark. Now, here is the chart for the Accumulation Trend Score shared by Glassnode, showing the trend in the metric separately for the various holder groups: As displayed in the above graph, the Accumulation Trend Score has recently varied in value across these cohorts. Investors who hold between 1 to 10 BTC appear to be distributing, while those with 10 to 100 BTC are accumulating. Among the large holders, the trend leans more neutral, but the indicator still doesn’t show any clear uniformity. Members of the 1,000 to 10,000 coins group, popularly referred to as the whales, are currently tending toward accumulation, but those part of the 10,000+ cohort, the ‘mega whales,’ are showing slight distribution. According to the analytics firm, the Accumulation Trend Score of the network as a whole stands at 0.57. As such, it seems there is no majority behavior being followed by the traders at the moment. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ That said, while a unifying buying push hasn’t appeared alongside the latest price rally toward $108,000, there has still been an improvement that has occurred in the score. According to the analytics firm, the indicator dropped to a low of 0.25 earlier. It only remains to be seen, however, whether the Bitcoin investors would continue to move in this direction, or if indecision is here to stay for a while. BTC Price Bitcoin attempted to find a break above the $108,000 level earlier, but the asset has so far not been able to maintain a sustainable move, and its price has even seen rejection toward $107,100.

One project has quickly become the talk of those rotating capital: MAGACOINFINANCE. Analysts’ attention is shifting toward this new altcoin as it nears a highly anticipated listing price of $0.007 — a metric signaling deepening interest and layered buying behavior. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Attracting Big Players In a market full of recycled narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something different — a fully capped 170 billion token supply, community-controlled governance, and verified smart contract infrastructure. But the real draw isn’t just tokenomics — it’s behavior. Long-term staking participation, wallet consolidation, and absence of dump cycles are the signals whales watch. And those signals are loud right now. Institutional whispers and early whale wallets suggest that many view MAGACOINFINANCE as more than just a meme contender — they see it as a positioning asset ahead of major price discovery. Solana (SOL) Maintains Ecosystem Momentum Solana continues to outperform expectations, both in user activity and network stability. With fast finality, low fees, and rising developer adoption, the Solana ecosystem has become a magnet for decentralized apps and retail traders alike. Its consistent infrastructure updates and growing TVL show long-term durability, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone in any serious crypto portfolio. As new capital flows into Solana, some of it is now being diverted into earlier-phase plays like MAGACOINFINANCE. Injective (INJ) Eyes a Breakout Range Injective is another altcoin drawing analyst attention, especially after new ETF-related developments and strong technical setups. Its current price action is consolidating above key support levels, and forecasts point to possible movement toward the $15–$16 range if bullish patterns hold. INJ’s growing on-chain value and increasing TVL are boosting investor sentiment — and yet, some capital is flowing into MAGACOINFINANCE as traders seek diversification ahead of major listing events. Kaspa (KAS) Signals Support Amid Volatility Kaspa is trading in a relatively tight range after facing volatility in early June. Although not yet signaling a definitive breakout, it remains on watch due to its strong community presence and fast block confirmation model. Momentum has slowed temporarily, but high engagement rates suggest that once the market pivots, KAS could regain traction — just as early holders of MAGACOINFINANCE expect similar timing for their project’s next wave. Uniswap (UNI) Tries to Reclaim Investor Confidence Uniswap is aiming to reclaim its status as a key DEX platform, especially as Layer 2 usage increases. However, competition has cut into its dominance, and UNI’s price action remains choppy. New upgrades and governance changes are being discussed, but capital rotation patterns suggest some traders are looking beyond established DEX names toward projects with cleaner entry profiles — a shift favoring altcoins like MAGACOINFINANCE. Final Thoughts With Solana delivering strong ecosystem growth, Injective testing bullish structures, Kaspa holding support, and Uniswap searching for momentum, traders are diversifying. And MAGACOINFINANCE — with its early performance and disciplined investor base — is quickly rising as the stealth contender ready to join 2025’s elite assets.

Imagine a company deciding to split its hard-won legal proceeds right down the middle, with half going into the volatile yet promising world of Bitcoin and the other half directly into the pockets of its shareholders. This is exactly what Genius Group is doing, setting a precedent that could reshape corporate financial strategies. Unpacking Genius Group’s Innovative Financial Strategy According to a GlobeNewswire press release, Genius Group has committed to allocating 50% of any future legal settlement proceeds to acquire Bitcoin. The remaining 50% will be distributed as special dividends to its shareholders. This dual-pronged strategy is not just about managing funds; it’s a statement about embracing new asset classes while rewarding loyal investors. The company is currently pursuing substantial damages, totaling over $1 billion, through two significant lawsuits. This includes a massive $750 million RICO case and an upcoming suit specifically targeting alleged short selling activities against the company. The potential for such a large inflow of capital makes their allocation strategy particularly impactful and intriguing. The Dual Appeal: Why Bitcoin Purchases and Shareholder Dividends? Why would a company choose such a distinctive path for its potential gains? The decision to dedicate half of its legal winnings to Bitcoin purchases and the other half to shareholder dividends reflects a strategic blend of forward-thinking investment and immediate shareholder gratification. The Allure of Bitcoin Purchases For many corporations, holding Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition. Here are a few reasons why Genius Group might be leaning into this: Potential for Capital Appreciation: Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has shown immense growth potential over the long term. Allocating funds to Bitcoin could allow Genius Group to benefit from future price surges, effectively growing their treasury. Diversification: Adding a digital asset like Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments, offering a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. Embracing Innovation: As an AI-focused education firm, embracing cutting-edge technology and digital assets aligns with Genius Group ‘s identity as an innovative entity. It signals a willingness to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. Attracting a New Investor Base: This move could appeal to a segment of investors who are enthusiastic about cryptocurrency and digital assets, potentially broadening Genius Group ‘s investor appeal. The Benefit of Shareholder Dividends On the other side of the coin, distributing shareholder dividends is a classic way to reward investors and boost confidence. Here’s why this half of the strategy is equally important: Direct Return to Investors: Special dividends provide a direct, tangible return on investment for shareholders. This can significantly increase investor satisfaction and loyalty. Signaling Financial Health: The ability to issue substantial dividends, especially from extraordinary income like legal settlements, signals strong financial health and management confidence to the market. Immediate Gratification: While Bitcoin offers long-term growth potential, dividends offer immediate cash flow to shareholders, which can be particularly attractive to income-focused investors. Market Confidence: A clear commitment to sharing profits with shareholders can enhance a company’s reputation and potentially attract more investment. Navigating the Legal Landscape: The Billion-Dollar Legal Settlement Pursuit The success of Genius Group ‘s strategy hinges entirely on the outcome of its ongoing legal battles. The company is seeking over $1 billion in damages, a significant sum that underscores the seriousness of its claims. Understanding the RICO Lawsuit One of the core components of their legal pursuit is a $750 million RICO lawsuit . RICO stands for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law in the United States designed to combat organized crime. However, it is also used in civil cases against individuals or organizations involved in patterns of racketeering activity. For Genius Group , this likely involves allegations of a pattern of illegal activities that have caused them significant financial harm. The specifics of Genius Group ‘s RICO lawsuit are not fully detailed in the initial press release, but such cases often involve complex allegations of fraud, extortion, or other illicit schemes that have impacted the company’s operations or market value. Winning a RICO case can be challenging, requiring substantial evidence to prove a pattern of criminal enterprise. The Short Selling Lawsuit In addition to the RICO case, Genius Group is preparing an upcoming lawsuit related to alleged short selling. Short selling is a trading strategy where an investor bets on a stock’s price decline. While legal, certain manipulative short selling practices, often referred to as ‘naked short selling’ or coordinated ‘short and distort’ campaigns, can be illegal and highly damaging to a company’s stock price and reputation. Genius Group ‘s pursuit of damages here suggests they believe they have been targeted by such illicit activities. The outcomes of these lawsuits are uncertain and can be lengthy processes. However, the company’s public commitment to how it will use the proceeds, should they win, adds a layer of transparency and investor confidence. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Crypto Adoption? Genius Group ‘s bold move could serve as a fascinating case study for other companies contemplating similar strategies. While some corporations like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, Genius Group ‘s approach of linking it directly to legal windfalls and simultaneously rewarding shareholders is relatively unique. Implications for Corporate Treasuries: Increased Crypto Exposure: If Genius Group ‘s strategy proves successful, it could encourage other companies to consider incorporating cryptocurrency into their treasury management, even if only for specific, extraordinary revenue streams. Hybrid Models: This could pave the way for more hybrid financial models where companies balance traditional financial practices with innovative digital asset adoption. Regulatory Scrutiny: As more companies venture into crypto, regulatory bodies will likely increase their scrutiny, leading to clearer guidelines and potentially more structured corporate crypto policies. Challenges and Considerations: Despite the excitement, this strategy is not without its challenges: Bitcoin Volatility: The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly. While this offers potential for significant gains, it also carries the risk of substantial losses, which could impact the perceived value of the legal settlement. Legal Outcome Uncertainty: Winning large lawsuits, especially complex RICO cases, is never guaranteed. The entire strategy hinges on favorable legal rulings. Shareholder Expectations: Once this precedent is set, shareholders might expect similar distributions from future extraordinary gains, potentially creating pressure on the company. Tax Implications: The tax treatment of Bitcoin purchases from legal settlements and the distribution of special dividends can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance? Genius Group ‘s decision to split potential legal wins between Bitcoin purchases and shareholder dividends is a remarkable demonstration of innovative corporate finance. It showcases a company willing to embrace the future of finance while remaining committed to its investors. As the legal battles unfold, the world will be watching to see if this audacious strategy pays off, potentially setting a new benchmark for how companies manage extraordinary income and integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. This move by Genius Group is more than just a financial decision; it’s a statement about confidence in both their legal claims and the long-term value of Bitcoin. It’s a testament to a company looking beyond traditional boundaries to create value for its stakeholders in an ever-evolving economic landscape.

A wave of institutional optimism and renewed ETF speculation has sparked conversations around whether the long-anticipated $5 target is finally within reach. But while XRP prepares for a possible breakout, another name is rapidly climbing investor watchlists — MAGACOIN FINANCE. In what many are calling a shift in strategy, investors are increasingly positioning ahead of the next wave by combining exposure to legacy assets like XRP with early-stage tokens that show breakout potential. At the center of this trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project that analysts say carries both narrative momentum and structural upside. XRP Gains Traction Amid ETF Rumors and Institutional Momentum XRP’s road over the past few years has been shaped by ongoing regulatory clarity and expanding use cases in cross-border payments. With the SEC dispute largely behind it and enterprise adoption on the rise, the asset is regaining attention from analysts and institutions alike. The possibility of a spot XRP ETF is adding fuel to the bullish case. Industry experts note that an ETF approval could dramatically shift capital inflows, boosting both volume and market positioning. This narrative has led analysts to revisit high-range targets, including the long-held projection of a move toward $5 — a milestone that once felt distant but is now back in the realm of possibility. Institutional interest, particularly from payment firms and tokenization platforms, continues to grow. These developments suggest that XRP’s accumulation phase may be evolving into a setup for long-term upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Breakout Contender for 2026 While XRP captures headlines for its comeback potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a focal point for forward-looking investors. The token is structured with high-conviction appeal — leveraging scarcity-based mechanics, early-stage positioning, and mounting interest from analysts across major research hubs. Previous entry rounds have sold out instantly, and new participation continues to accelerate as early signs of breakout behavior emerge. Wallet activity, investor positioning, and research-driven sentiment all point to MAGACOIN FINANCE entering a pivotal phase of its growth trajectory. Rather than rely on trends or comparisons, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a distinct identity, backed by a setup that many are calling one of the most asymmetric opportunities of the year. The listing price has already been confirmed, and strategic accumulation is on the rise as institutional and retail investors begin locking in positions. Analysts See Multi-Layered Growth Potential Across Both Assets Analysts covering both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlight a key difference in investor psychology: XRP is now viewed as a large-cap with renewed upside following regulatory progress, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is seen as a high-upside asset still early in its market journey. The rotation into early-stage projects while maintaining exposure to larger market anchors is not new, but the current cycle appears to be rewarding those who move with conviction before wider awareness sets in. In this sense, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tracked not as a speculative bet, but as a strategic position ahead of a potential surge. Final Thoughts: Positioning Ahead of the Next Cycle As the market gears up for what could be a watershed year in crypto, investors are busy positioning their portfolios around narrative, structure and timing. XRP is likely to undergo a strong upside potential in 2026 if an ETF happens. However, assets may grow quicker if they remain near areas of awareness where Easter-smart capital flows early. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of that conversation. Its confirmed structure parameters and analyst momentum continue to attract high-conviction interest. For those in tune with where the market is headed next, this is already clear.

In a discussion shared by prominent crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) on X, Vias explained how the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was purpose-built to handle high-volume financial transactions with unmatched efficiency. Vias emphasized that the XRPL is “very much a payments-focused ledger,” specifically engineered to support the demands of global financial infrastructure. He pointed to the payment channels feature on the ledger, which can handle up to 50,000 transactions per second. He added that, unlike experimental solutions elsewhere in the crypto space, this capability is live and functional today. RIPPLE: XRP IS THE “PERFECT” DIGITAL ASSET TO REVOLUTIONIZE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS This is Miguel Vias from Ripple. Listen closely. He even states that the “The ledger can CURRENTLY scale to 50,000 TPS so it’s designed for high volume.” pic.twitter.com/3LGuXifMqp — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 25, 2025 The Technology Behind the Vision According to Vias, the technical design of XRP Ledger directly reflects Ripple’s mission to modernize and enhance cross-border payments . He explained that scalability was always a core objective. It allows the ledger to process massive transaction volumes without compromising speed or security. This network is also highly efficient, as Ripple President Monica Long recently noted that the XRPL is 120,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin’s network. Vias shared that this robust architecture was a key reason he decided to join Ripple. He described the combination of XRP, Interledger, and Ripple’s solutions as a marriage that made complete sense from a technological standpoint. In his view, these components together form the foundation for a modern international payment system capable of displacing outdated processes . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Proven Use Cases Remain Relevant Reflecting on Ripple’s earlier projects, Vias pointed to Ripple Trade and the Ripple Payments Platform as examples of how the digital asset’s capabilities were already being applied as far back as 2014. Ripple Trade functioned as an on-ledger exchange, while RPP facilitated fiat-to-XRP conversions for cross-border payments. While both products were eventually phased out, Vias noted that the core use cases they supported have become essential parts of today’s digital asset ecosystem. He emphasized that XRP and its ledger are still deeply integrated with Ripple’s broader strategy. “It’s clear as day how all of these worlds are merging,” Vias said, showing that XRP remains the optimal asset for facilitating seamless, high-speed global transactions. Vias also addressed a question that often arises within the XRP community regarding whether the XRPL is central to Ripple’s plans. He stated that the ledger is not only part of Ripple’s story but continues to be a vital element of the company’s strategy moving forward.

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal proponent of responsible digital asset integration, has indicated that a draft bill addressing crypto market structure is on the horizon, aiming for release before the crucial August recess. This development, shared by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, signals a pivotal moment for an industry long yearning for regulatory certainty in the United States. For anyone invested in the future of digital finance, this legislative push represents a beacon of hope for clearer guidelines and a more robust operational environment. Senator Lummis’s Vision: A Clear Path for Digital Assets Senator Lummis has consistently championed a balanced approach to digital assets, advocating for frameworks that foster innovation while protecting consumers. Her latest announcement suggests that the Senate is moving with purpose to define the rules of engagement for cryptocurrencies and related technologies. The timeline is ambitious: a draft bill expected within weeks, with markup discussions — the process of amending and refining legislation — slated for September. This proactive stance by Senator Lummis is seen by many as a necessary step to bring the U.S. up to speed with other global jurisdictions that have already begun to establish comprehensive regulatory regimes. Her vision centers on creating an environment where the benefits of blockchain technology can be fully realized without stifling growth through ambiguity or overly burdensome rules. Why a US Crypto Bill is Crucial for Industry Growth The absence of a clear and comprehensive US crypto bill has been a significant impediment to the growth and maturation of the digital asset industry within the United States. Currently, companies navigate a patchwork of state-level regulations and federal agency interpretations, leading to confusion, inefficiency, and sometimes, outright conflict. The benefits of a well-crafted federal bill are numerous: Regulatory Certainty: Businesses would have a clear understanding of what constitutes a security versus a commodity, how digital assets should be custodied, and what compliance measures are required. This clarity reduces legal risks and encourages investment. Enhanced Consumer Protection: A unified framework can establish robust safeguards for investors, addressing issues like fraud, market manipulation, and the responsible handling of customer funds. Fostering Domestic Innovation: By providing clear rules, the U.S. can attract and retain blockchain talent and companies, preventing the exodus of innovation to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions often hesitate to fully engage with crypto due to regulatory uncertainty. A clear bill could unlock significant institutional capital. Global Competitiveness: The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish a coherent regulatory stance, potentially losing its leadership position in the evolving global financial landscape. The current challenges, including ongoing enforcement actions and conflicting statements from various regulatory bodies, underscore the urgent need for legislative action. Shaping the Digital Asset Regulation Landscape What key elements can we expect from this proposed digital asset regulation ? While details of the new draft remain under wraps, previous legislative efforts and public statements from policymakers offer clues. It’s highly probable that the bill will attempt to delineate the jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding various types of digital assets. This distinction is critical, as it determines which regulatory body has oversight and what rules apply. Other potential areas of focus include: Stablecoin Frameworks: Establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuers, addressing reserves, redemption mechanisms, and auditing requirements. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Oversight: How to approach the regulation of decentralized protocols without stifling their innovative, permissionless nature. Custody Rules: Guidelines for how exchanges and other entities hold customer digital assets. Taxation: Clarifying tax treatment for various crypto activities. The legislative process is often complex, involving extensive debate and compromise. However, the intent to create a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation is clear, aiming to provide both guardrails for the industry and confidence for participants. Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Market Structure Defining the ideal crypto market structure for the U.S. is no simple feat. The digital asset ecosystem is dynamic, rapidly evolving, and presents unique challenges that traditional financial regulations may not fully address. One of the primary complexities lies in classifying digital assets. Is a token a security, a commodity, or something entirely new? The answer has profound implications for how it is traded, offered, and regulated. Furthermore, the global nature of cryptocurrencies adds another layer of complexity. How can U.S. regulations effectively govern a market that operates 24/7 across borders? Policymakers must also consider the delicate balance between robust oversight and fostering technological advancement. Overly stringent rules could stifle innovation, pushing developers and entrepreneurs offshore. Conversely, a lack of clear rules can lead to market instability and harm investors. This ongoing legislative effort reflects a deep engagement with these intricate issues, striving for a framework that is both effective and adaptable. Fostering Blockchain Innovation While Ensuring Safety At its core, the goal of any sensible regulation should be to foster blockchain innovation while simultaneously ensuring market integrity and investor protection. The U.S. has a long history of leading technological advancements, and a well-designed crypto framework could solidify its position as a hub for Web3 development. This involves creating a regulatory environment that understands the nuances of decentralized technologies, smart contracts, and tokenization. For instance, clear guidelines can help distinguish between legitimate projects and fraudulent schemes, thereby building trust in the broader ecosystem. It can also encourage the development of new applications in areas like supply chain management, digital identity, and tokenized real-world assets. The challenge lies in crafting rules that are technology-neutral, allowing for future innovations without requiring constant legislative updates. This balance is critical to ensuring that the U.S. remains competitive and continues to attract the best minds in the blockchain space, turning the promise of distributed ledger technology into tangible economic benefits for all. For individuals and businesses operating in this space, staying informed about these legislative developments is paramount. Engaging with industry associations and providing constructive feedback to policymakers can help shape a future where blockchain innovation thrives within a clear and secure regulatory landscape. Senator Lummis’s announcement marks a significant and highly anticipated step towards establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. The impending release of a draft bill on crypto market structure before the August recess, with markup discussions set for September, signals a determined effort to bring clarity and stability to an industry that has long operated under a cloud of uncertainty. While the path to finalized legislation may be complex, this initiative represents a pivotal moment for the digital asset space, promising a future where innovation can flourish within a well-defined and secure regulatory environment. The crypto community will be watching closely as these legislative efforts unfold, hopeful for a framework that supports growth, protects consumers, and solidifies the U.S.’s position at the forefront of the global digital economy.

For months, the crypto community has watched closely as traditional financial giants navigate the complex waters of digital assets. Now, a significant development has emerged from Bitwise, one of the leading names in crypto asset management, signaling a potential new chapter for two prominent digital currencies: Dogecoin and Aptos. Bitwise has recently updated its S-1 filings for proposed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for both Dogecoin and Aptos, a move that has caught the attention of market analysts and investors alike. What does this mean for the future of crypto investment, and why are these updates so crucial? Bitwise ETF Filings: What’s the Latest Scoop? Bitwise, known for its pioneering efforts in the crypto ETF space, has taken another concrete step forward. The submission of amended S-1 filings for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETFs is more than just a procedural formality; it’s a strong indicator of ongoing, active engagement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a widely respected voice in the ETF community, quickly noted this development on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that these updates align perfectly with the trends observed during the approval processes for other major spot crypto ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These S-1 amendments typically involve refining disclosures, updating financial information, and addressing any feedback or questions from the SEC. They are a critical part of the regulatory dance that precedes any ETF approval. For Bitwise, this signifies not just persistence but a strategic alignment with the SEC’s evolving requirements and expectations for digital asset products. Decoding the Significance of SEC ETF Approval Progress Why are these updated filings by Bitwise so important in the grand scheme of SEC ETF approval ? The journey to getting a spot crypto ETF approved in the U.S. has been long and arduous. Historically, the SEC has expressed concerns over market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, the approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, followed by initial movements towards spot Ethereum ETFs, have set a precedent. Each amended filing, especially from a reputable firm like Bitwise, suggests a continued dialogue and a concerted effort to meet the SEC’s stringent criteria. The process often involves several rounds of amendments as the issuer and the regulator iron out details. Therefore, each new filing is a positive signal that the conversation is progressing, not stagnating. It indicates that Bitwise is actively responding to the SEC’s requests and refining its proposals to enhance transparency and investor safeguards. This iterative process is a hallmark of successful ETF launches in traditional finance, and its replication in the crypto sphere is a sign of market maturation. Spot Dogecoin ETF: A New Dawn for the ‘Meme Coin’? The prospect of a Spot Dogecoin ETF is particularly intriguing. Dogecoin, famously started as a joke, has evolved into a cryptocurrency with a massive community, cultural significance, and even practical applications. Its journey from a niche internet meme to a top-tier digital asset has been anything but conventional. An ETF for DOGE could mark a pivotal moment for the asset, offering several potential benefits: Increased Accessibility: A spot ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency, simplifying the investment process. Enhanced Legitimacy: SEC approval would bestow a significant level of institutional legitimacy upon Dogecoin, potentially attracting more conservative investors and capital. Liquidity and Price Discovery: An ETF could improve market liquidity for DOGE and contribute to more efficient price discovery by integrating it further into traditional financial markets. However, challenges remain. Dogecoin’s price is notoriously volatile and often influenced by social media trends, making it unique compared to other assets seeking ETF approval. The SEC will undoubtedly scrutinize its market dynamics and underlying structure closely. Despite these hurdles, the updated filing for a Dogecoin ETF underscores its growing mainstream appeal and the industry’s belief in its long-term potential. Exploring the Potential of a Spot Aptos ETF Equally significant is the updated filing for a Spot Aptos ETF . Aptos is a relatively newer blockchain, launched by former Meta (Facebook) employees, designed for scalability and high transaction throughput using the Move programming language. While it doesn’t have the same cultural history as Dogecoin, Aptos represents the cutting edge of blockchain technology, aiming to solve some of the scalability issues plaguing older networks. The potential benefits of an Aptos ETF are distinct: Institutional Exposure to Web3 Innovation: An ETF would provide traditional investors with a regulated avenue to invest in a next-generation blockchain platform, tapping into the broader Web3 ecosystem. Capital Inflow for Development: Increased investment via an ETF could further fuel the development and adoption of the Aptos network and its ecosystem. Diversification: For investors looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Aptos offers diversification into a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain. The SEC’s review of an Aptos ETF would likely focus on its technological robustness, decentralization, and market surveillance capabilities. As a newer asset, its market depth and regulatory clarity might present different considerations compared to more established cryptocurrencies. The Broader Impact on Cryptocurrency Investment These latest developments from Bitwise are not just about Dogecoin and Aptos; they represent a broader trend reshaping the landscape of cryptocurrency investment . The increasing number of spot ETF applications and the SEC’s gradual engagement signal a maturing market where digital assets are becoming more integrated into traditional finance. This integration offers several advantages: Mainstream Adoption: ETFs lower the barrier to entry for a vast pool of traditional investors, including retail and institutional clients, who prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. Market Efficiency: As more regulated products enter the market, it can lead to improved price discovery, reduced volatility (in the long term), and a more efficient overall market structure. Regulatory Clarity: Each ETF approval contributes to building a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, which is crucial for long-term growth and stability. However, it’s also important to acknowledge that the road to full approval is rarely straightforward. The SEC maintains a cautious stance, and further amendments or delays are always possible. Investors should view these filings as positive steps in a complex regulatory journey, rather than guarantees of immediate approval. What’s Next for Bitwise, Dogecoin, and Aptos? The updated S-1 filings mean the ball is now back in the SEC’s court. The Commission will review the amended documents, potentially providing further feedback or requesting additional information. While there’s no fixed timeline for approval, the current pace of engagement suggests that the industry and regulators are working towards a common goal of bringing regulated crypto products to market. For investors, this period calls for continued observation. Monitoring SEC announcements, Bitwise’s subsequent filings, and market reactions will be key. The potential introduction of a Spot Dogecoin ETF and a Spot Aptos ETF could significantly broaden the avenues for cryptocurrency investment, offering new opportunities for diversification and exposure to the dynamic world of digital assets. In Conclusion: A Promising Horizon for Crypto ETFs Bitwise’s latest S-1 amendments for spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETFs underscore a relentless drive towards expanding regulated access to cryptocurrencies. These filings are more than just paperwork; they are a testament to the industry’s commitment to meeting regulatory standards and bringing innovative investment products to market. As the SEC continues its review, the crypto community watches with anticipation, hopeful that these strategic moves will pave the way for a more inclusive and mature landscape for cryptocurrency investment. The journey is ongoing, but each step forward brings us closer to a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the global financial system.

For many, MAGACOINFINANCE is fast becoming the top answer . Backed by aggressive accumulation, staking participation, and community-led growth, this rising altcoin is earning serious attention from both early traders and long-term capital allocators aiming for the next $1.3 million payoff. Solana (SOL) Expands as Developer Activity Surges Solana remains one of the most active and stable Layer 1 networks. Recent upgrades have further improved throughput and lowered latency, driving consistent engagement from both developers and dApps. With top-tier NFT platforms, liquid staking protocols, and meme tokens flourishing in its ecosystem, Solana has once again cemented its role as a high-performance alternative to Ethereum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Case for Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a politically themed meme token with robust tokenomics, a capped supply of 100 billion, and a presale price under $0.0. Its early-stage status, viral marketing, and rapidly expanding community (over 12,500 holders and counting) are fueling speculation that it could replicate the exponential runs seen by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in previous cycles. Key factors driving bullish sentiment include: Community and Hype : Aggressive viral campaigns and a swelling grassroots following have made MAGACOINFINANCE a trending topic across crypto forums and social media. Audited Security: The project’s smart contracts have been audited by HashEx, adding a layer of trust and transparency. Strategic Bonuses: Early investors can secure up to 100% extra tokens during the presale, maximizing their upside potential. Ethereum (ETH) Consolidates While Institutions Accumulate Ethereum is now trading in a tightly coiled range between $2,500 and $2,600. While price has paused, behind the scenes, whales and institutions are buying. Nasdaq-listed firms have added ETH to treasuries and staked reserves, and spot ETF inflows continue to rise. ETH’s future looks more like traditional finance than ever before Aptos (APT) Maintains Engagement in a Competitive Layer 1 Field Aptos continues to be among the top Layer 1 chains by active addresses, even as price action remains subdued. Developer interest remains high, and the team is investing heavily in ecosystem tools. Kaspa (KAS) Holds Its Ground with a Loyal Community Kaspa remains quiet in major headlines but continues to build within its niche. Its high-throughput blockDAG architecture remains unique in the space, but lack of new catalysts has slowed speculative volume. Why Bitcoin and Solana Bulls Are Buying In Early-Stage Momentum: MAGACOINFINANCE is still in its infancy, offering the kind of ground-floor entry that produced life-changing returns in prior cycles. Narrative and Timing: The blend of political meme energy, robust tokenomics, and a market hungry for new narratives is a potent formula for viral adoption. Conclusion Bitcoin and Solana bulls believe MAGACOINFINANCE offers a rare shot at outsized returns, with $1.3 million dreams rooted in both historical precedent and current market momentum. Whether it can deliver remains to be seen, but in a market driven by narrative, hype, and early entry, MAGACOINFINANCE has quickly become the altcoin to watch in 2025.

46862879,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=172730,1750995034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46862879.jpeg,Synaptogenix Rebrand Unveils Transformative Shift to TAO Synergies,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/synaptogenix-rebrand-tao-synergies/,"BitcoinWorld Synaptogenix Rebrand Unveils Transformative Shift to TAO Synergies In a groundbreaking move that underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world, Synaptogenix, a company listed on Nasdaq, has announced a significant corporate transformation. The company is set to undergo a complete Synaptogenix Rebrand , changing its name to ‘TAO Synergies’ and adopting the new ticker ‘TAOX.’ This pivotal decision follows closely on the heels of its strategic commitment to invest $10 million in TAO tokens as part of an innovative Blockchain Treasury Strategy . This shift isn’t just a name change; it’s a powerful statement about the company’s future direction and its embrace of decentralized technologies. What Propelled the Synaptogenix Rebrand to TAO Synergies? The decision by Synaptogenix to rebrand as TAO Synergies is directly linked to its recent foray into the cryptocurrency market. Just earlier this week, the company publicly declared its intention to allocate a substantial $10 million towards the acquisition of TAO tokens. This isn’t merely an opportunistic investment; it’s a foundational element of their newly articulated Blockchain Treasury Strategy . By integrating digital assets into their core financial operations, Synaptogenix is signaling a profound shift in its corporate identity and strategic focus. The new name, ‘TAO Synergies,’ reflects this embrace of synergy between traditional business models and the potential of blockchain technology, with ‘TAO’ clearly referencing their significant token acquisition. This strategic pivot highlights several key aspects: Commitment to Digital Assets: A $10 million TAO Token Investment by a Nasdaq-listed entity is a strong signal of conviction in the long-term value and utility of specific digital assets and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Forward-Thinking Treasury Management: Moving beyond traditional cash reserves, the company is exploring new avenues for capital management and value creation in a digital-first economy. Brand Alignment: The rebranding ensures that the company’s public identity is aligned with its evolving strategic direction, clearly communicating its new focus to investors, partners, and the market at large. Understanding the Blockchain Treasury Strategy For many traditional corporations, treasury management has historically revolved around cash, bonds, and other low-risk, liquid assets. However, the emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has introduced a paradigm shift. A Blockchain Treasury Strategy involves integrating digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or specific utility tokens (such as TAO tokens in this case) into a company’s balance sheet and financial operations. This strategy offers several potential advantages, though it also comes with unique challenges. Here’s a comparison of traditional versus blockchain-enabled treasury approaches: Aspect Traditional Treasury Blockchain Treasury Primary Assets Fiat currency, bonds, money market funds Fiat, digital assets (cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, NFTs) Inflation Hedge Limited, susceptible to fiat devaluation Potential hedge against inflation (e.g., Bitcoin) Diversification Traditional asset classes Adds a new, uncorrelated asset class Technological Alignment Conventional financial systems Embraces Web3, future-proofs business models Liquidity & Accessibility High for established markets Growing, 24/7 global markets The adoption of such a strategy by Synaptogenix, now TAO Synergies , reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage digital assets not just for investment returns but as a strategic component of their long-term financial health and innovation roadmap. The specific choice of a TAO Token Investment indicates a belief in the particular utility or ecosystem associated with that token, beyond just a general crypto allocation. The Impact of TAO Token Investment on Corporate Identity The decision to make a significant TAO Token Investment and subsequently rebrand to TAO Synergies is more than a financial transaction; it’s a profound shift in corporate identity. A company’s name and ticker symbol are central to its public perception and investor relations. By explicitly incorporating ‘TAO’ into its new name, the company is directly tying its future to the success and development of the TAO token ecosystem and, by extension, the broader blockchain space. What does this signal to the market? Innovation and Adaptability: It positions the company as an innovator, willing to adapt to new technological paradigms and explore unconventional avenues for growth. Investor Appeal: It could attract a new segment of investors who are keen on companies with exposure to the high-growth potential of digital assets and blockchain technology. Strategic Vision: It suggests a long-term vision where blockchain and digital assets are not just an investment but an integral part of future business operations and value creation. However, this bold move also comes with increased scrutiny. Investors will be watching closely to see how the company manages the volatility inherent in digital assets and how its new blockchain-centric strategy translates into tangible business results beyond just treasury management. Broader Implications for Crypto Corporate Adoption The Synaptogenix Rebrand and its strategic investment are part of a larger, accelerating trend: Crypto Corporate Adoption . While companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have previously made headlines for their Bitcoin acquisitions, Synaptogenix’s move is distinct in its immediate and direct impact on the company’s very identity and name. This signals a deepening level of commitment to the digital asset space, moving beyond simple balance sheet allocations to a full embrace of the underlying technology and its associated ecosystems. Why are more companies considering this path now? Maturing Infrastructure: The cryptocurrency market has developed more robust infrastructure, including institutional-grade custody solutions, trading platforms, and regulatory clarity (albeit still evolving). Inflationary Concerns: Persistent global inflation has prompted companies to seek alternative stores of value beyond traditional fiat currencies. Competitive Edge: Integrating blockchain technology and digital assets can offer a competitive advantage, enabling new business models, efficiencies, and customer engagement strategies. Synaptogenix’s transformation into TAO Synergies could serve as a blueprint for other Nasdaq-listed or publicly traded companies contemplating a similar pivot. It demonstrates that integrating digital assets can go beyond just treasury management to fundamentally reshape a company’s brand and strategic direction, opening doors to new markets and opportunities within the burgeoning Web3 economy. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Challenges for TAO Synergies The journey for TAO Synergies , post-rebrand and significant TAO Token Investment , will undoubtedly present both compelling opportunities and significant hurdles. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for stakeholders. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Market Position: By embracing blockchain and digital assets so explicitly, TAO Synergies positions itself at the forefront of technological innovation, potentially attracting new investors and talent interested in the future of finance. Diversified Revenue Streams: Beyond treasury gains, the company might explore new business ventures leveraging blockchain technology, aligning with the ‘Synergies’ in its name. Brand Modernization: The rebrand revitalizes the company’s image, making it appear more dynamic and forward-thinking to a younger, tech-savvy demographic. Access to New Capital: Engaging with the crypto community could open doors to new forms of fundraising or partnerships within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: The primary risk lies in the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. A significant downturn in TAO token value could impact the company’s balance sheet and investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the company’s operations or the value of its holdings. Public Perception: While many embrace crypto, skepticism remains. The company will need to effectively communicate its strategy to a diverse range of stakeholders, addressing concerns about risk and sustainability. Operational Integration: Successfully integrating blockchain technologies and managing digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust security protocols, which can be complex and costly. Conclusion: A Bold New Era for Corporate Finance The transformation of Synaptogenix into TAO Synergies , driven by its strategic TAO Token Investment and commitment to a comprehensive Blockchain Treasury Strategy , marks a watershed moment in the intersection of traditional corporate finance and the digital asset economy. This isn’t just a cosmetic change; it’s a profound declaration of intent by a Nasdaq-listed company to actively participate in and shape the future of finance and technology. As Crypto Corporate Adoption continues to accelerate, moves like this provide valuable case studies, highlighting both the immense potential and the inherent challenges. TAO Synergies is now poised to navigate this exciting, yet unpredictable, new frontier, potentially setting a precedent for how other established companies might integrate digital assets into their core identity and operations. The world will be watching to see how this bold strategy unfolds, potentially heralding a new era of corporate innovation.

This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a monumental step that signifies a significant evolution in how this prominent ecosystem will be governed and operated going forward. The decision, overwhelmingly supported by the community, marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of another, with a new entity named ApeCo poised to take the reins. For anyone following the cutting edge of decentralized finance and digital communities, this development is a must-watch. Understanding the Pivotal Community Vote : AIP-596 Explained The core of this transformative change lies in the approval of proposal AIP-596. This proposal sought to fundamentally restructure the governance and operational framework of the ApeCoin ecosystem by dissolving the existing DAO and establishing ApeCo as its successor. The results of the community vote were decisive, reflecting a clear mandate from the token holders: 99.66% voted in favor of the dissolution and transition. 0.32% voted against the proposal. 0.01% abstained from voting. These figures, derived from Snapshot data, not only demonstrate overwhelming support but also confirm that the proposal met crucial thresholds. It surpassed the 3.5% token participation quorum requirement and comfortably exceeded the 66% approval threshold needed for passage. Such a high degree of consensus on a decision of this magnitude is rare in the often-fractured world of decentralized governance and highlights a unified vision among ApeCoin holders for the project’s future. Why the Change? Exploring the DAO Dissolution The decision to pursue a DAO dissolution isn’t taken lightly. Decentralized autonomous organizations were initially hailed as the pinnacle of transparent, community-led governance. However, as the Web3 space matures, many DAOs have encountered practical challenges that can hinder efficiency and execution. These often include: Sluggish Decision-Making: The very nature of decentralized voting can lead to prolonged debates and slow progress on critical initiatives. Lack of Accountability: While distributed, the absence of clear leadership can sometimes make it difficult to assign responsibility for project failures or successes. Operational Inefficiencies: Managing day-to-day operations, legal compliance, and strategic partnerships can be complex and cumbersome within a purely decentralized structure. Resource Allocation Challenges: Distributing funds and managing budgets effectively across a broad, anonymous group can prove difficult. While the official proposal details the specific motivations for the ApeCoin DAO ‘s shift, it’s plausible that the move to ApeCo aims to address some of these common pain points, seeking to balance the ethos of decentralization with the need for agile, effective operations. This evolution is a testament to the dynamic nature of Web3, where experimentation and adaptation are key to long-term success. Introducing ApeCo : The New Horizon for ApeCoin With the DAO dissolution approved, all eyes now turn to ApeCo , the new entity tasked with steering the ApeCoin ecosystem forward. This transition represents a significant pivot, moving from a purely decentralized, community-driven operational model to one that appears to integrate more structured leadership while retaining community input. ApeCo will be led by Cameron Kates, who currently serves as the executive director of the Ape Foundation. He will be joined by other key members from both the Ape Foundation and the Banana Bill team, suggesting a blend of established leadership and experienced operational talent. The formation of ApeCo implies a more streamlined and perhaps more centralized approach to execution. While the exact operational specifics are still unfolding, the expectation is that ApeCo will provide: Clearer Leadership: A defined leadership structure can facilitate faster decision-making and clearer strategic direction. Improved Operational Efficiency: A dedicated team can focus solely on the growth and development of the ApeCoin ecosystem, including partnerships, product development, and community engagement. Enhanced Accountability: With a recognizable leadership team, there is a greater sense of responsibility and accountability for the project’s trajectory. This shift aims to empower the ApeCoin ecosystem to innovate and scale more effectively in a competitive Web3 landscape, ensuring that the project can respond swiftly to market changes and seize new opportunities. What Does This Mean for ApeCoin DAO Holders and Web3 Governance ? For existing ApeCoin DAO token holders, this transition signals a fundamental change in their role within the ecosystem. While the power of their community vote remains paramount for major decisions, the day-to-day operational control will shift to ApeCo. This raises important questions for the broader discussion around Web3 governance : Aspect Previous DAO Model New ApeCo Model (Anticipated) Operational Execution Primarily community-driven through proposals. Led by ApeCo team with clear roles. Decision-Making Speed Potentially slower due to voting cycles. Potentially faster due to dedicated leadership. Accountability Distributed among all token holders. Centralized within the ApeCo leadership. Community Role Directly involved in all proposals and operations. Primarily involved in strategic oversight and major decisions via voting. This shift highlights a growing trend in the Web3 space: the pragmatic evolution of governance models. While pure decentralization is an ideal, many projects are discovering that a hybrid model, combining centralized execution with decentralized oversight, might be more effective for achieving long-term goals and scaling operations. This makes the ApeCoin DAO’s move a critical case study for the future of Web3 governance . The Broader Implications for Web3 Governance and Decentralization The ApeCoin DAO ‘s decision is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger narrative unfolding in the world of Web3 governance . Many early DAOs have grappled with the complexities of truly decentralized operations, often finding themselves at a crossroads between ideological purity and practical efficacy. This move by a high-profile project like ApeCoin could set a precedent, encouraging other DAOs to reconsider their structures in pursuit of greater agility and impact. While some purists might view this as a step back from decentralization, proponents argue that it’s a necessary step towards maturity. The goal isn’t to abandon decentralization entirely, but rather to refine it, ensuring that core principles like transparency and community input are maintained, even if operational execution becomes more centralized. The success of ApeCo will be closely watched as a potential blueprint for other large-scale Web3 projects seeking to optimize their governance and operational models without sacrificing their fundamental ethos. The Path Forward: What’s Next for ApeCoin? With the DAO dissolution and the establishment of ApeCo, the ApeCoin ecosystem is poised for a new phase of development. The leadership team, comprising Cameron Kates and members from the Ape Foundation and Banana Bill, will likely focus on: Ecosystem Growth: Driving further adoption and utility for ApeCoin within the broader Web3 space, potentially through new partnerships and integrations. Product Development: Overseeing the creation and enhancement of tools, applications, and experiences that leverage ApeCoin. Community Engagement: While operations are streamlined, maintaining strong lines of communication and avenues for community feedback will be crucial to ensure the spirit of the ApeCoin DAO endures. Strategic Vision: Developing and executing a clear, long-term roadmap for the ApeCoin project, aligning with the aspirations of its token holders. This transition represents a dynamic period for ApeCoin. It’s an opportunity to learn from the challenges of pure decentralization and build a more robust, efficient, and impactful organization that can truly deliver on the promise of its ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the ApeCoin DAO and Beyond The approval of AIP-596 marks a truly transformative moment for the ApeCoin DAO . The overwhelming community vote in favor of DAO dissolution and the transition to ApeCo signals a pragmatic evolution in Web3 governance . This shift aims to combine the agility of a more structured operational entity with the foundational principles of community ownership and decentralized oversight. As ApeCo takes the reins, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how this new model performs, potentially setting a new standard for how large, community-driven projects navigate the complexities of growth and governance in the ever-evolving Web3 landscape. It’s a bold step, reflecting a maturing ecosystem willing to adapt and innovate for long-term success.

On June 26, the company announced it will bring its stock on-chain through Opening Bell, a regulated on-chain equity issuance platform developed by fintech company Superstate. The move aims to offer 24/7 trading, real-time settlement, and expanded investor access via crypto-native wallets. “Tokenizing Upexi’s shares on Opening Bell reflects our strong conviction in Solana and our commitment to expanding shareholder access through transformative on-chain technology,” said CEO Allan Marshall. Launched in May 2025, Opening Bell unlocks decentralized finance features like automation, token-based governance, and staking by enabling compliant programmable equity. The announcement comes as Upexi deepens its Solana-based treasury strategy. The company disclosed that it now holds 735,692 Solana ( SOL ), an 8% increase from 679,677 SOL in May. At current prices, the holdings are worth about $105 million.

Shares dropped over 60% to below $4 on June 24 after a registration statement allowed resale of 43.85 million shares, the entire April float. While fears of insider selling surfaced, Marshall called the filing routine and clarified that no insider offloading had been confirmed. Analysts have backed Upexi’s strategic shift despite the volatility. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage in June with an “overweight” rating and a $16 target, citing Solana’s growing network activity and appeal as a treasury asset over Ethereum ( ETH ). The company joins a growing cohort of firms adopting Solana-native strategies.

The company now holds over 600,000 SOL and runs validator infrastructure, with its liquid staking token dfdvSOL integrated across Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Sol Strategies Inc. holds 40,000 SOL and obtained a $500 million convertible note in May from ATW Partners to expand its treasury.

Either way, XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged. In the meantime,… https://t.co/edHNbMzYbZ — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 26, 2025 He made it clear that no matter what they decide, XRP’s legal status remains unchanged, that it is not a security. Judge Expected Strong Arguments John Deaton says that Judge Torres pushed back in a way the SEC didn’t expect. He explains that the SEC cited the wrong rule and failed to show any exceptional circumstances to justify changing her earlier decision. Judge Torres said that “the parties haven’t come close” to doing that. According to Deaton, there is a high bar to meet, and the SEC didn’t clear it. After years of work on the case, the judge was not convinced by the SEC’s sudden request to reduce the fine by 60% and expected a much stronger argument. Deaton also expected more solid arguments from both sides and admits he underestimated the chances of the judge denying the motion, giving it only a 30% likelihood. He backed Judge Torres for following the law despite political changes. He said that protecting investors is important, especially in a crypto world full of scams like Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and FTX. Will Ripple SEC Withdraw Their Appeals? Attorney Fred Rispoli said Ripple and the SEC will likely drop their appeals and settle around $50 million, keeping Judge Torres’ ruling in place. He also added that the SEC may privately or publicly assure Ripple that it won’t face further restrictions, as long as it stays compliant. The court’s injunction will stay in place, but only matters if the SEC chooses to enforce it, which he sees as unlikely.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 03:56:30

""The crypto market is strongly sentiment-driven as fundamental valuations are challenging; therefore, technical analysis signals such as the double top warrant caution. That said, a full-blown crash needs a catalyst like the Terra collapse of 2022 or the FTX blowup. Barring a similar black swan, we could see a prolonged bull cycle, based on the current political and regulatory support and sticky institutional capital flowing in,"" Tischhauser told CoinDesk in an interview. Bitcoin has spent 50 days mainly trading back and forth between $110,000 and $100,000, signaling an exhaustion of the uptrend near the highs reached in January this year. That has prompted several observers, including veteran technical analyst Peter Brandt , to consider the possibility of the BTC trend flipping bearish with a double-top pattern. The double top comprises two consecutive peaks at approximately the same price – near $110K in BTC's case – with a trendline drawn through the low point between these peaks. The low point in BTC's case is the early April slide to $75,000. Analysts are concerned that a potential double top breakdown, involving a downturn from $110,000 and a drop below $75,000, could lead to a crash to around $27,000. Yes, you read that right. Such a crash would mean a 75% slide from the peaks. Technical patterns, such as the double top, often become self-fulfilling prophecies – once traders spot the pattern, their collective action reinforces the expected outcome. So, it's natural for prospects of double top above $100,000 to cause some caution and price drop. However, technicals alone seldom cause a price crash of 75%. For instance, BTC's crash from $70,000 to $16,000 over the 12 months to November 2022 happened as the Fed's rate hike cycle exposed asset classes like crypto where excess speculation had built up, setting the stage for the demise of the Terra blockchain and the FTX exchange. Both events caused massive wealth destruction. Flows-led bull run The latest rally, however, is driven mainly by institutional flows rather than the story or pretence that DeFi is better than traditional finance or Ethereum is the new world computer, as Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal noted last year. Since their debut on the Nasdaq in January 2024, the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have registered net inflows of over $48 billion, per data tracked by Farside Investors . Meanwhile, BTC's adoption as a corporate Treasury asset has picked up the pace, adding to the bull momentum. As of the time of writing, 141 public companies held 841,693 BTC, according to bitcointreasuries.net . The flows-driven nature of the latest bull run makes it more resilient than the previous bull markets, according to Tischhauser. ""Institutions implement rigorous due diligence and risk assessment before they add a new asset class like bitcoin to the model portfolio. But when they do, the eventual allocation is for the long term. This trend of sticky institutional allocation is just beginning, and the resulting demand will continue to provide price support for some time to come,"" Tischhauser told CoinDesk. Tischhauser explained that these investment vehicles are sucking out liquidity, skewing the demand-supply dynamics in favour of a continued uptrend. ""These investment vehicles are sucking liquidity out of the market, which means, every time a new big-ticket investor hits the market with bids, this is addressing less and less supply, and the bullish impact on prices becomes more pronounced,"" Tischhauser noted. The halving cycle may be dead The bearish double-top crash scenario appears plausible to many observers, as we are in the post-halving year, which has historically marked bull market tops, paving the way for year-long bear markets. Halving is a programmed code in Bitcoin's blockchain that reduces the pace of BTC supply expansion by 50% every four years. The last halving occurred in April 2024 and reduced the per-block BTC reward to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. However, the halving cycle may not unfold as expected, as sticky institutional adoption has a greater bearing on price than miners. Moreover, BTC sold by miners, who regulatory offload coins earned to fund operational costs, now accounts for a tiny percentage of the average daily trading volume. ""The change in market leadership means the four-year halving cycle may not play out religiously as it did before. Earlier, most BTC holders were miners, and the BTC issued per year was a huge percentage of the outstanding bitcoin supply. So, selling pressure from miners mattered greatly to the market price. Now, the BTC mined is 0.05-0.1% of the average BTC daily trading volume and halving this supply has no impact on the supply/demand balance in the market. So the halving cycle may be dead,"" Tischhauser said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Sygnum Bank|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 03:57:54

This new peak surpasses the company’s previous closing record of $357.39 from November 2021. The crypto exchange also led the S&P 500 earlier in the week, posting a 12.10% increase in a single day. Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 on May 19 and increased regulatory clarity surrounding stablecoins have helped fuel investor enthusiasm. The GENIUS Act, advanced in the U.S. House, has been particularly impactful given Coinbase’s co-creation of the USDC stablecoin with Circle. Market Reactions and Predictions Vary Despite the bullish momentum, opinions on whether Coinbase’s rally can continue remain divided. Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, commented, “Going vertical now…the liquidity spigot is wide, wide open.” On the other hand, adviser Andy Heilman suggested that while the setup remains bullish, a pullback is likely in the near term. He mentioned the potential for four-digit prices but cautioned against overconfidence. Crypto analyst Cantonese Cat cited technical indicators showing expanding Bollinger Bands, implying further upside. In contrast, another analyst, Chad, warned that the price may be “ripe for a cooldown” as it sits above the upper Bollinger Band. Some long-time investors celebrated the milestone as a breakeven moment, noting that shares have returned to their 2021 launch price.

While both projects continue to show strength, especially in terms of ecosystem traction and institutional growth, they’re reaching a point where further upside may be slower and steadier. That’s why momentum is quietly shifting toward early-stage altcoins — and MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as the prime candidate for the next big move . MAGACOINFINANCE: Where Early Capital Is Converging Early-stage tokens don’t usually check every box — but MAGACOINFINANCE is rewriting that rule. With its total supply permanently locked at 170 billion, the inflation ceiling is clear. The token is fully audited by HashEx, offering critical transparency. And most recently, staking has launched, showing strong initial participation and lock-up behavior — a key indicator of long-term conviction. Here’s what’s driving momentum: Fixed token supply — no hidden inflation Active staking — rewards reinforcing early entry No VC control — 100% community-based Audited and transparent smart contract With growing on-chain activity and increased chatter among Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP whales, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning itself as a high-conviction trade for 2025 . Cardano (ADA) Faces Near-Term Resistance Cardano has seen notable pullbacks recently and is currently trading in a tight range around $0.63–$0.64. Price forecasts remain mixed, with weak retail interest and divided governance decisions weighing on short-term momentum. However, the Chang hard fork and Hydra scaling efforts offer some hope if delivered successfully. Still, while ADA consolidates, opportunistic investors are moving capital toward early movers like MAGACOINFINANCE in search of more aggressive upside. Ethereum (ETH) Shows Institutional Growth Despite Price Pressure Ethereum continues to draw institutional attention, especially after Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming’s $463M ETH acquisition. The network’s technical foundation remains solid, bolstered by the Pectra upgrade and ETF tailwinds. Despite trading in a volatile range near $2,500–$2,600, many traders see ETH as a long-term core hold. But that same long-term profile is prompting some to hedge ETH positions with speculative bets like MAGACOINFINANCE, hoping to capture larger short-term returns. Optimism (OP) Cools Off as Rotation Picks Up Optimism has seen slowing momentum as traders rotate into other Layer-2 projects. Despite continued development, OP has yet to reclaim bullish levels, with many investors waiting for a broader narrative shift. This has opened the door for capital to move into altcoins with faster catalysts, and MAGACOINFINANCE’s recent milestones — including staking and token cap confirmation — are sparking fresh allocations. VeChain (VET) Holds Ground, But Interest Is Fading VeChain continues to focus on enterprise adoption and sustainability solutions but hasn’t made major headlines in recent weeks. The lack of catalysts has led to stagnant price action, and as altcoin traders chase more dynamic opportunities, many are pivoting toward newer entrants that combine hype with structural soundness — like MAGACOINFINANCE. Final Thoughts The market rotation from large caps like Ethereum, Cardano, Optimism, and VeChain to more agile projects is real — and MAGACOINFINANCE is benefiting directly. As Solana and XRP traders hunt for the next asymmetric opportunity, this altcoin is quickly rising to the top of their watchlists.

Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/trump-token-in-trouble-4-4-million-liquidity-exit-sparks-crash-fears/,"US President Donald Trump’s namesake meme token has tumbled hard, slumping nearly 90% from its all-time high set six months ago. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Today, TRUMP is trading at $8.80, down 6% in the last seven days. Traders are on edge after the project’s team yanked $4.4 million in USDC from liquidity pools and a single whale lined up a $2.5 million sell order. Team Pulls Millions From Liquidity According to a recent post on X by Lookonchain, the Trump Coin team withdrew $4.4 million worth of USDC and moved 347,438 TRUMP tokens—valued at $3.12 million—from the main liquidity pool into a fresh wallet. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP($3.12M) to a new wallet.https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiAhttps://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 That move came without any heads-up or clear reason. Now, many investors worry that the team might be preparing to dump coins, which would add selling pressure to a coin already struggling with low demand. Whale Places Huge Sell Order Based on reports, a major wallet known as Kewh32 has put 275,672 TRUMP tokens on the market, roughly $2.5 million at current prices. This whale also sold 100,000 tokens earlier in June and still holds 369,400 coins. If those tokens ever hit exchanges, the added supply could push the price even lower. Price Pattern Offers Mixed Signal On the daily chart, TRUMP has traced out a falling wedge pattern. That setup often leads to a breakout, but only when buyers step in with strength. Here, trading volumes remain weak. The relative strength index (RSI) has sat below 50 for over a month, signaling that sellers are still in control. At the same time, the Awesome Oscillator just flipped green—albeit still below zero—which hints that bearish momentum may be fading.

A failure to hold above $8 could spell more losses and test deeper support. Right now, there’s no sign of a strong rally. Without fresh buying interest or positive news, the downtrend inside the wedge looks set to continue. It won’t take much to spark a short squeeze—maybe a burst of social media hype or a big buy from another whale. But trust in the token’s team is shaky after the recent liquidity pull. Until on-chain activity shows real demand, most market players expect more choppy trading and lower prices.

It creates a national set of rules for stablecoins, which are digital currencies tied to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar. This would make it easier and safer for companies to issue stablecoins in the U.S., while also encouraging more homegrown innovation and cutting down on the country’s dependence on foreign financial tech.

It aims to finally define what different types of crypto assets are, something the industry has lacked for years.

If passed, the bill could unlock trillions of dollars in potential investment, giving the crypto space a massive boost. A Turning Point for U.S. Crypto Leadership Together, these two bills represent a turning point. Industry leaders are calling this a “defining moment” that could make the U.S. a global leader in blockchain and digital finance. If July sees both laws move forward, it could mark the beginning of a new, more regulated, but more confident era for American crypto.

The crypto space is also awaiting the July 8–9 tariff deadline, but as per recent talks, there are hints that Trump could delay it. So far, talks with China and the UK have begun, but no deals have been finalized. If progress is slow, Trump may step in to set his fair tariffs.

This marks a 0.4% decrease in the past 24 hours, and a 4.3% drop below its all-time high of $111,000, set in May. Despite the rebound, analysts are closely watching for potential shifts in momentum as a number of market indicators and macroeconomic signals suggest a more cautious short-term outlook. Among the recent developments drawing attention is a sharp rise in Net Taker Volume on Binance, along with significant stablecoin outflows from derivative platforms. CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha noted in a recent market commentary that these changes could indicate increased speculative activity. While some traders interpret such surges as bullish signals, they often occur due to short liquidations or sudden retail buying rather than consistent organic demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment Derivatives Activity and Fed Commentary Fuel Market Caution On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume crossed $100 million for the first time since early June. This level of activity, according to Taha, can sometimes signal buying momentum but may also point to forced closures of short positions, especially in high-leverage environments. Taha emphasized that without strong capital inflows to back the movement, these bursts tend to be short-lived. Simultaneously, more than $1.25 billion in stablecoin liquidity has exited derivative exchanges, marking the largest capital outflow from these platforms since May. These outflows reduce the base for opening new leveraged positions, potentially dampening future market momentum. Taha also pointed to external economic cues, particularly a recent statement by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. During his testimony before Congress, Powell signaled that rate cuts may be on the table depending on upcoming economic conditions. While looser monetary policy is often viewed as favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin, the shift also reflects underlying uncertainty. The analyst also mentioned that the Swiss Franc, traditionally seen as a safe-haven currency, has also surged against the US dollar, suggesting that some investors are leaning risk-off amid broader macroeconomic developments. Market Structure Remains Firm, But Momentum Is Slowing Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Dan offered a different perspective using a bubble chart model that visualizes trading volume trends across exchanges. According to Dan, Bitcoin is currently experiencing a “cooling” phase. This implies reduced trading activity without dramatic spikes in volume, often seen as a sign that the market is consolidating rather than overheating.

According to blockchain analytics firm Sentiment, Solana’s developer ecosystem has witnessed a rise in activity, registering an increase in GitHub commits, pull requests, and issue discussions over the past month. This rebound shows the introduction of new developments, establishing Solana’s place as Ethereum’s competitor. Solana uses the work done by protocol teams to increase performance, security, scalability, and user experience, pushing the limit of blockchain capabilities. In addition, the ecosystem has also seen an increase in interoperability and DeFi solutions. Wormhole, a cross-chain bridge, and Pyth Network, a decentralized oracle platform, have been the primary contributors to this move, driving Solana’s growth in the crypto industry. 4 Top Projects Powering Solana Ecosystem Drift – Improving on-chain derivatives trading. Neon Labs – Ensuring easy integration of Ethereum dApps on Solana. Helium – Improving decentralized internet infrastructure. Metaplex – Expanding NFT and Web3 capabilities. Popular crypto figures, such as Lark Davis, have also discussed the importance of this successful ecosystem, highlighting Solana’s dominance in the blockchain industry. Decentralized exchanges like Serum have also increased Solana’s attractiveness, offering easy and cheap trading. Solana Challenges Ethereum & Rivals Solana’s increased developer activity has improved mainstream adoption and sustained its growth, challenging the dominance of Ethereum. The rise in developer activity not only presents viability, it also positions Solana alongside other layer 1 platforms like Cosmos and Optimism, which are also competing for developer attention and user adoption. Research also shows that although some Solana smart contracts have minor security risks, platforms like Anchor are trying to remove such risks, showcasing Solana’s developer-friendly and secure environment. Sudden Shift – Newest Phenomenon Emerges Amidst the excitement around Solana, a new crypto project has surfaced: Neo Pepe Coin. Taking over the market with its blend of meme culture and governance mechanism, Neo Pepe presale has been seeing attention. Not Your Average Crypto The token is currently priced at $0.08, with Neo Pepe Coin approaching its fourth presale stage, where the token is expected to increase in price. This change has sparked community discussions, cementing Neo Pepe as the best crypto presale in the crypto market. Unlike other meme coins, Neo Pepe uses a DAO governance, tokenomics, and an auto-liquidity system that helps the token through LP token burns. These features have positioned Neo Pepe as a better meme coin and a contender for the top Pepe coin title. Crypto influencer BITGIRL CRYPTO recently discussed the qualities of Neo Pepe, saying they are the real reason why the project has been gaining attention in the market. Platforms like AInvest, Finbold, and Crypto.news have also recognized Neo Pepe as a frontrunner in the 2025 meme coin space. Influencers Fuel Neo Pepe Coin Chatter Crypto influencer CryptoBitlord is one of the supporters of Neo Pepe. He has discussed several aspects of the project including its presale approach, community, and governance, advising his followers saying, “You might want to get a little Neo Pepe.” Neo Pepe’s roadmap includes listings on several exchanges, with Binance and Uniswap being planned. The move is expected to expand its reach and credibility among global crypto investors. Why Neo Pepe Presale Demands Attention Now Neo Pepe’s presale model has been designed across 16 stages, with each seeing the value of the token increase. With the fourth stage on its way, investors are taking advantage of the lower price to increase their investments. Neo Pepe continues to attract meme traders and crypto investors, earning the title of the best Pepe coin in the crypto industry. BITGIRL CRYPTO Delivers Insightful Take on Neo Pepe’s Rising Appeal In a recent analysis, crypto commentator BITGIRL CRYPTO discussed Neo Pepe Coin, highlighting the project’s presale, liquidity generation, and community-focused governance model.

The asset dropped nearly 6% over 24 hours but found significant buying interest at $0.158, establishing a short-term support zone as markets digested geopolitical headlines and economic uncertainty. News Background Global markets remain on edge as tensions between major economies and shifting monetary policy outlooks drive volatility. While ceasefire agreements in the Middle East have slightly eased investor anxiety, crypto assets — particularly memecoins — remain highly sensitive to sentiment swings. DOGE’s sharp pullback follows a broader risk-off tone in digital assets, but late-session accumulation suggests some traders view the dip as a buying opportunity. DOGE’s partial rebound coincides with renewed social buzz and short-term technical setups that have historically preceded price bounces. Analysts remain divided on the strength of this recovery, but volume-backed support at $0.158 is now in focus heading into the next session. Price Action DOGE traded in a wide 24-hour range between $0.167 and $0.158, representing a 5.7% decline before stabilizing late in the session. Heavy selling persisted until 13:00 UTC, when the price began to consolidate. Buyers stepped in with 229M DOGE traded during the 01:00 hour, helping DOGE recover to $0.161 by session close. In the final hour, the asset gained 1.47%, rising from $0.159 to $0.161 on a clear uptrend with higher highs and higher lows. Volume surged to 4.7M during the breakout above $0.161, and brief consolidation established support at that level heading into the new day. Technical Analysis Recap • DOGE dropped from $0.167 to $0.158 over 24 hours, a 5.7% decline • Downtrend persisted until 13:00, followed by consolidation and modest recovery • Heavy sell volume of 425M DOGE recorded during 13:00 hour • Strong buying interest emerged at $0.158 with 229M DOGE traded at support • DOGE closed at $0.161 after 1.47% late-session gain • Breakout above $0.161 confirmed with 4.7M DOGE in volume during 01:39–01:42 • Support established at $0.161 following brief consolidation from 01:52–01:59",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 05:08:41

A key catalyst behind investor calm was the arrest of British national Kai West, known online as “ IntelBroker ,” who allegedly ran BreachForums and facilitated the sale of stolen corporate data. The FBI stated that West caused damages exceeding $25 million by leaking data from over 40 companies in exchange for Bitcoin and Monero. He was arrested in France and now awaits extradition to the U.S. Interesting report on how ""IntelBroker"" got caught. According to the report, Kai West primarily used Monero, however, the use of Monero $XMR was not part of how he got caught. In fact, Monero’s strong privacy features gave challenges to authorities. So, in January 2023, an FBI… pic.twitter.com/7Xs84lFEu9 — MetaRyuk (@metaryuk) June 26, 2025 One undercover agent reportedly paid $250 in Bitcoin for access to confidential files. West’s cyber group allegedly sold data valued at $2.5 million. By 2024, IntelBroker had built a reputation as a major darknet figurehead. Despite the scandal, Bitcoin price action barely flinched, a sign that traders are increasingly confident in regulators’ ability to track blockchain activity. BTC held steady at $107,600 $42.6B in 24h volume reflects strong activity Market cap remains at $2.14 trillion The event highlights crypto’s dual nature, which is both used in crime and also traceable. Law enforcement’s growing technical capability to monitor crypto transfers is reinforcing market trust. India Proposes Bitcoin Reserve to Boost Economy In addition, there’s another bullish report came from India, where Pradeep Bhandari, a national spokesperson for the ruling BJP party, advocated for a Bitcoin reserve pilot. Writing for India Today , Bhandari highlighted how nations like Bhutan and the U.S. are already exploring sovereign crypto strategies, suggesting India could benefit from joining that list. BREAKING: Indian Ruling party #BJP National Spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari calls for India to explore #Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Citing U.S. and Bhutan’s growing adoption. Says a #Bitcoin reserve pilot could boost India’s economic resilience. pic.twitter.com/oVXnRowB37 — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) June 26, 2025 Bhandari emphasized India’s growing renewable energy sector as a competitive advantage for Bitcoin mining and accumulation. He argued that regulatory clarity, still lacking in India’s tax-heavy environment, could unlock innovation, attract capital, and position India as a leader in financial technology. India currently taxes crypto gains at 30% under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, without a formal regulatory infrastructure. Despite this, domestic interest in crypto remains strong. Bitcoin hovered at $107,100 after Bhandari’s remarks, signaling steady institutional confidence. Bitcoin Technicals Signal Potential Reversal Technically, Bitcoin faces stiff resistance at $108,250, the top of a descending trendline visible on the 2-hour chart. After bouncing sharply from $99,717, the asset broke above major Fibonacci levels—0.618 at $102,977 and 0.5 at $103,984—before stalling in a narrowing range. Price action suggests a rising wedge pattern, which often precedes a breakdown. Bitcoin price chart – Soruce: Tradingview The 50-EMA at $106,147 and the 23.6% Fib level at $106,237 offer critical support. Meanwhile, MACD is flashing bearish divergence, with momentum fading as histogram bars shrink. Recent candlesticks resemble spinning tops and doji formations—signals of indecision. Bearish trigger: Break below $106,200 Downside targets: $104,991 and $103,984 Upside invalidation: Daily close above $108,250 If bulls fail to clear $108,250 with conviction, we could see a pullback toward $104K. On the flip side, a clean break could set up a run toward $109,257 and $110,448. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.4M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $105,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,438,492.88 of its $8,397,441 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier. Currently priced at $0.00258, early buyers have a limited time to enter before the subsequent price increase takes effect.

The contract represents a middle ground between transparent stablecoins like USDC and censorship-resistant “dark stablecoins.” With backing from major institutions like Deutsche Bank and State Street, Taurus hopes to fill a crucial privacy gap in stablecoin infrastructure. Meanwhile, regulatory developments surrounding stablecoins are also unfolding globally. In Europe, the European Commission rejected earlier ECB concerns, favoring a more flexible stance under MiCA. In the US, Trump-linked World Liberty Financial is preparing to release its first stablecoin audit while teasing an upgrade to its WLFI token. Taurus Rolls Out Privacy Contract for Stablecoins Taurus, a digital asset infrastructure provider, launched a private stablecoin contract built on the Aztec Network, which is designed to offer users enhanced privacy through zero-knowledge proofs while still maintaining compliance with regulatory standards. The goal of the contract is to make stablecoin usage more practical for sensitive applications like payrolls and intracompany transfers, where financial privacy is critical. Taurus previously partnered with major institutions like Deutsche Bank and State Street, and believes this innovation bridges a long-standing gap in stablecoin functionality by preserving privacy without compromising regulatory oversight. According to Taurus’ chief security officer, JP Aumasson , the solution allows for untraceable transactions that still permit access for authorized entities like issuers and regulators. This dual approach could resolve one of the key limitations of current stablecoin usage—the visibility and permanence of transactions on public blockchains. Aztec Network executive Arnaud Schenk explained that their layer-2 zero-knowledge system supports both user privacy and issuer-defined controls directly at the token level. The new offering comes at a time when concerns over increasing government oversight led to speculation that demand may grow for so-called “dark stablecoins”—privacy-enhanced, censorship-resistant alternatives. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that international users could shift toward these untraceable solutions in response to stricter regulations. However, Taurus’ contract may serve as a middle ground by delivering similar privacy protections without the legal uncertainties that accompany unregulated dark stablecoins. Overall, the stablecoin market is attracting more attention from both traditional financial players and regulators. While USDT and USDC still dominate the market, more than 30 other stablecoin issuers have at least $100 million in circulation, according to RedStone’s recent report . The landscape is poised for even more growth as the GENIUS Act moves closer to becoming law in the United States. Meanwhile, Europe recently signaled a more accommodating approach under its MiCA framework, which suggests that stablecoin innovation could continue to grow across multiple jurisdictions. EU Rejects ECB Warnings on Stablecoin Risks The European Commission took a turn away from the strict warnings that were issued earlier this year by the European Central Bank (ECB). In response to ECB concerns about the risks of joint stablecoin issuance across EU and non-EU jurisdictions, the Commission said such scenarios are “highly unlikely.” According to a spokesperson , even if a bank run occurred, most redemptions would take place outside of the EU, particularly in the US, where the majority of stablecoins circulate and reserves are held. This more flexible approach has been welcomed by the crypto industry, with some calling it a big win for cross-border stablecoin operations. The ECB warned in April that allowing joint issuance between EU and foreign entities could undermine the bloc’s financial safeguards, destabilize consumer protections, and open the door for regulatory arbitrage by foreign firms. It also raised the issue of non-EU issuers potentially misrepresenting themselves as compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulation without actually meeting its requirements. An example of EU and third-country stablecoin mult-issuance Despite these concerns, the Commission's June study on the topic concluded that the risks are very manageable under existing rules. It found that MiCA already creates strong institutional and regulatory barriers that limit the presence of foreign stablecoins in the eurozone. For instance, the Commission pointed out Tether’s refusal to comply with MiCA’s rule requiring 60% of reserves to be held in European banks, which discouraged the issuer of USDT from registering in Europe. The Commission also proposed that foreign stablecoin issuers could be subject to rebalancing mechanisms to align the volume of EU-based reserves with the proportion of tokens circulating in the EU. People see this as a much more realistic and flexible framework that enables global operations without fragmenting the stablecoin market. Juan Ignacio Ibañez , general secretary of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, said this stance eliminates the need for issuers like Circle to split their operations into separate entities for the US and Europe, which preserves the fungibility and cross-border usability that are core to blockchain-based currencies. Calling it “very positive news and even a relief,” Ibañez believes that jurisdictional silos would weaken stablecoin utility and harm the user experience. World Liberty Financial Readies Stablecoin Audit Meanwhile, World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture associated with US President Donald Trump, is preparing to release an audit of its stablecoin and hinted at a potential upgrade to its WLFI governance token. Co-founder Zak Folkman announced at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn that the project's first attestation report from an independent accounting firm will be published on its website soon. He also teased a big development regarding the WLFI token, which currently grants voting rights but is still nontransferable. Folkman suggested that changes to WLFI are imminent, and encouraged the community to stay tuned over the next few weeks for updates. This was later confirmed in a post on X by World Liberty Financial, where the team acknowledged community demand for making WLFI transferable and stated that the necessary work is underway, promising “big news coming soon.” While some in the crypto community welcomed the news with enthusiasm, others responded with skepticism by questioning the motives behind the move and suggesting that insiders might be preparing to offload their holdings. Reply to WLFI’s X post The platform is also working on launching a new app that is aimed at improving accessibility for retail users. This is a strategic move that could expand its user base during the upcoming election cycle. Trump’s ties to the project have been financially lucrative. According to a 2025 financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Trump earned $57.4 million from World Liberty Financial and holds more than 15 billion WLFI tokens, which grant him voting rights. The earnings stem from token sales. Since its inception in September of 2024, World Liberty Financial has raised $500+ million through two public token offerings. The platform offers decentralized finance services and a dollar-pegged stablecoin.

The company attracted attention earlier this year when it acquired prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, but Ripple’s plans don’t stop there. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz stated that the company is evaluating multiple acquisitions. “Our acquisition and merger team is working very hard. We have many potential acquisition processes at different stages,” said Schwartz, adding that the activity in this area is due to Wall Street still not fully realizing these opportunities. Schwartz said that the slow pace of traditional financial giants in strategic acquisitions presents an opportunity for crypto companies. “We don’t have to compete with big banks to acquire strategically valuable companies like Hidden Road,” he said. Ripple has previously acquired crypto custody firms such as Metaco and Standard Custody, and the company also plans to use its new stablecoin, RLUSD, as collateral for Hidden Road’s brokerage services. Related News: Another Surprising Decision from Judge Torres in the Ripple-SEC Case: XRP Legal Director Makes a Statement - “The Ball is Now in Our Court” Ripple is preparing to develop not only acquisitions but also the XRP Ledger (XRPL) infrastructure. XRPL, which is aimed to gain an Ethereum-like “programmability,” may soon be equipped with payment management systems that work similarly to smart contracts. Schwartz said that while full programmability would not be possible in the near term, the goal is to “preserve security while providing flexibility.” For example, he said contracts could be put in place that allow a user to receive payment in their preferred digital asset instead of XRP. In addition, Ripple is developing a lending protocol on the XRP Ledger. This system is planned to be launched if approved in the third quarter of 2025. Schwartz stated that this structure will bring together traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), and said, “While the selection of borrowers and legal transactions are carried out off-chain, the tokenization and distribution of repayment rights will be done on-chain.” Ripple made headlines in the industry in June with many announcements, including tokenized treasury bonds, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for institutional investors, and a partnership with Wormhole, which enables asset transfer between blockchains. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Miners Defy Market Logic, Hoard BTC Despite Declining Revenue and Record Prices Bitcoin miners have significantly increased their BTC holdings despite a challenging profitability environment and Bitcoin trading near its all-time highs. According to new data published by on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, miners have collectively added 4,000 BTC to their reserves since April 2025 — bringing their total holdings between 100 and 1,000 BTC to approximately 65,000 BTC, the highest level since November 2024. This accumulation has occurred against the backdrop of mounting operational strain. Daily revenues for miners have plunged to a two-month low of $34 million as of June 22, largely due to falling transaction fees and a slight dip in BTC’s price following a recent all-time high. Despite these pressures, miner selling activity has dropped dramatically. Outflows from miner wallets, which peaked at 23,000 BTC per day in February 2025, are now down to just 6,000 BTC — a trend that suggests miners are prioritizing long-term value over short-term cash flow. Bitcoin Miner Total Outflows (Source: CryptoQuant) Miners Endure “Extreme Underpayment” Conditions CryptoQuant’s latest Weekly Report describes Bitcoin miners as being “extremely underpaid,” noting that the current income environment is the harshest it’s been over the past year. This downturn in miner revenue comes just months after April’s halving event, which reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC — effectively halving the amount of new Bitcoin earned per mined block. Bitcoin Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability (Source: CryptoQuant) Hashrate — the measure of computational power on the Bitcoin network — has dropped by 3.5% in the last 10 days, marking the largest drawdown since July 2024. This has likely put added pressure on marginal mining operations, particularly those in regions with high energy costs or aging equipment. Still, many miners appear to be weathering the storm. CryptoQuant attributes this resilience to an average operating margin of 48%, which allows larger, more efficient mining firms to continue stockpiling BTC rather than liquidating it to cover expenses. Perhaps the most notable trend is the near-complete cessation of sales from so-called “Satoshi-era” miners — individuals or entities who mined Bitcoin in its earliest days, likely between 2009 and 2011. These early adopters are often regarded as market-moving whales due to their large BTC holdings and historical tendency to sell into strength during major bull markets. Bitcoin Satoshi-era Miner netflows (Source: CryptoQuant) However, 2025 appears to mark a change in strategy. According to CryptoQuant, Satoshi-era miners have sold just 150 BTC this year, compared to nearly 10,000 BTC in 2024. That’s a staggering 98.5% decrease in sales volume, even as BTC/USD continues to flirt with new record highs. Historically, movement of coins from these dormant addresses has signaled market tops and sparked panic among retail investors. The lack of activity from these wallets suggests either a newfound patience — or a deeper conviction that Bitcoin’s bull run is far from over. Capitulation or Conviction? This collective refusal to sell, even in the face of dwindling revenue, may be a bullish signal for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Earlier in June, the widely-followed “Hash Ribbons” indicator — which monitors miner capitulation phases — flashed a classic “buy” signal. The metric has proven historically reliable in identifying price bottoms, as miner capitulation tends to precede recoveries when weaker operators exit and long-term holders double down. With BTC currently trading just a few percentage points below its all-time high, miners’ behavior could suggest that they believe the market still has considerable upside. Their unwillingness to sell at or near the top may be signaling a longer-term price horizon beyond even the most optimistic projections currently circulating in the crypto space. The implications of miners turning into net accumulators are significant. As one of the few consistent sources of sell pressure in the Bitcoin ecosystem, a decline in miner sales reduces the overall supply of BTC available on the open market. Coupled with continued institutional inflows and increasing adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs, this creates a supply-demand imbalance that could act as a catalyst for further price appreciation. Moreover, the alignment between miner activity and long-term holding behavior reinforces a broader narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation. Gone are the days when miners rushed to dump their holdings after each halving cycle. Instead, the trend is shifting toward strategic reserve management and capital discipline — a sign of the industry’s growing sophistication. India’s Ruling Party Spokesperson Urges Bitcoin Reserve Pilot to Boost Economic Resilience Meanwhile, in a move that could significantly reshape India’s digital asset landscape, Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has publicly advocated for a pilot program to establish a sovereign Bitcoin reserve. The proposal, outlined in an op-ed for India Today , positions the initiative as a pragmatic step toward strengthening national economic resilience and embracing the growing legitimacy of digital assets on the global stage. Bhandari cited the United States' strategic moves to accumulate Bitcoin and Bhutan’s government-led crypto mining initiatives as indicators that traditional finance is undergoing a crypto transformation. “This isn’t a reckless pivot,” he emphasized in the article. “It’s a calculated step toward embracing digital assets’ legitimacy.” The Global Context: Bitcoin Becomes a Strategic Asset Bhandari’s call for a Bitcoin reserve pilot is not made in isolation. The United States has recently outlined plans for budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisitions to bolster its strategic reserves. At least three US states have authorized Bitcoin as an official reserve asset. Meanwhile, Bhutan has deployed its renewable energy surplus to power state-backed Bitcoin mining operations. These developments reflect a broader shift in how nations view crypto—not merely as speculative assets but as strategic instruments with geopolitical and macroeconomic utility. According to Bhandari, India is uniquely positioned to lead this global shift, citing the country’s rapidly growing renewable energy sector. With vast potential in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, India could develop a sustainable, state-managed Bitcoin reserve without compromising its environmental goals. He stressed that such a pilot would not only align with India’s ambitions to be a global digital leader but also stimulate innovation and attract institutional interest. A government-supported Bitcoin reserve could provide confidence to both domestic and international investors, positioning India as a pioneer in the responsible adoption of crypto infrastructure. Taxed but Unregulated: India’s Crypto Conundrum Currently, India’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies remains ambiguous. While digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are taxed under a flat 30% capital gains regime, there is no formal regulatory framework guiding their use, trading, or custody. Under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, profits from selling virtual digital assets (VDAs) are taxed at 30%. While acquisition costs can be subtracted from gains, no deductions are allowed for losses or other expenses. Moreover, a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is applied to all crypto transactions exceeding ₹10,000 (approximately $115), further dampening liquidity and market participation. This duality—taxation without regulation—has stifled innovation and deterred retail and institutional involvement alike. Bhandari referenced India’s leadership during its 2023 G20 presidency, where it spearheaded a crypto policy working group in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, he warned that the international community is moving faster than India. While recommendations will take their due course, Bhandari said, jurisdictions like Russia, China, Brazil, and other G20 nations led by the US are not pausing their crypto efforts to wait for a consensus. He argued that India risks falling behind if it fails to act with urgency. A sovereign Bitcoin reserve pilot could serve as both a policy accelerator and a signaling mechanism to global markets. A Strategic and Transparent Path Forward According to Bhandari, the first step toward embracing this opportunity is the launch of a Bitcoin reserve pilot program, accompanied by well-defined regulatory policies. He emphasized that such a framework should be transparent, investor-friendly, and designed to foster innovation while upholding consumer protections. He believes the initiative could act as a testing ground for broader digital asset strategies, from public-private partnerships in crypto infrastructure to government-backed mining operations powered by renewables.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-27 05:30:00

The asset dipped from $2.21 to a session low of $2.08 before a modest recovery to $2.10. While the broader crypto market attempted to stabilize following ceasefire agreements in the Middle East, XRP’s momentum remained fragile, with technical resistance building at $2.17. News Background Market sentiment improved slightly after former U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly helped broker a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, calming some investor fears. Despite that, XRP struggled to hold recent gains as traders reacted to large on-chain movements. Ripple transferred $439 million worth of XRP to an unknown wallet, and other whale wallets moved another $58 million to centralized exchanges — raising questions about potential distribution or internal reshuffling. Although these events drew attention, the token’s inability to reclaim $2.14 resistance signals underlying bearish momentum. Technical analysts continue to monitor XRP’s descending channel pattern, with expectations for a breakout or breakdown between July and September. For now, the $2.08-$2.09 zone remains a critical level to hold. Price Action XRP dropped from $2.21 to $2.10 over the 24-hour period, marking a 5.3% decline within a $0.13 range. The steepest selloff occurred between 12:00 and 16:00 UTC on June 26, with back-to-back hourly volume surges above 99 million XRP as price fell to $2.10. Resistance formed clearly at $2.17, with multiple rejection wicks above $2.12 later in the session. By midnight UTC, XRP had revisited its session low of $2.08. A modest bounce followed in the final hour of the session, as price climbed from $2.09 to $2.10, with short-lived momentum topping at $2.105. A drop in volume late in the session suggests buyer fatigue, though the $2.08 support zone held firm. Technical Analysis Recap • XRP declined 5.3% from $2.21 to $2.10, with a total intraday range of $0.13 • Heaviest selling occurred from 12:00–16:00 UTC on volume over 114M and 99M XRP • Strong resistance formed at $2.17; key support tested at $2.08–$2.09 • Recovery attempts failed at $2.14 and $2.12 before settling around $2.10 • Final hour showed modest 0.54% gain from $2.09 to $2.10, with volume spiking to 930K XRP during 01:42–01:45 • Consolidation near $2.10 in final 15 minutes suggests short-term stabilization",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 05:30:50

SEC Likely to Allow In-Kind Swaps for Spot ETFs The revised filing also includes in-kind creation and redemption, which means that brokers could swap ETF shares directly for DOGE tokens. Analyst Eric Balchunas says that it’s now almost certain that the SEC will allow in-kind creation and redemption for all spot ETFs.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the chances of approval for most spot crypto ETFs, including Dogecoin, are now at 90% or higher. Dogecoin Stalls Near Support Despite ETF Buzz Even with the ETF news, Dogecoin is down 1.8% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.162. Technical indicators show mixed signals as most oscillators show neutral momentum, and moving averages strongly signal a sell. Dogecoin has seen a decline throughout June, dropping from around $0.23 at the start of the month to the current level near $0.161. After a short-lived rally between June 10–13, where prices briefly spiked, it has resumed its downward trend. Dogecoin has found support near $0.15, where buyers have stepped in several times. However, it faces strong resistance between $0.17 and $0.172, which has blocked further upward moves. Unless it breaks above this resistance with strong volume, the short-term trend looks weak to slightly bearish. Experts Eye Dogecoin Breakout Trader Tardigrade says that Dogecoin made big jumps in the last market cycle, from $0.0003 to $0.0026 to $0.009.

While traders react to the latest swings, savvy investors are using this moment to reposition. In the midst of these moves, one project is drawing increasing attention from analysts and early-stage investors alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum Faces Congestion and Innovation Pressures Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, but its performance is being challenged by both internal and external factors. Ongoing concerns over network congestion and the complexity of scaling solutions have triggered fluctuating sentiment. While Ethereum’s roadmap toward full scalability is promising, short-term uncertainty is leading some traders to reduce exposure temporarily. This has created a rare opening for repositioning capital into emerging sectors of the crypto space. Cardano Struggles to Maintain Narrative Momentum Cardano, known for its research-driven approach and proof-of-stake model, has faced difficulties maintaining investor momentum. While its development team continues to roll out upgrades, the pace of real-world adoption has lagged behind expectations. This contrast between long-term potential and short-term indecision is sparking mixed reactions across technical and fundamental analysis circles. For investors seeking more immediate ROI catalysts, capital is starting to shift toward opportunities with stronger short-term positioning. XRP Enters Regulatory Clarity Phase Following major breakthroughs in the U.S. and Canadian regulatory landscape, XRP has entered a transitional phase. While analysts applaud developments such as the Canadian spot XRP ETF and mounting approval odds in the U.S., the asset’s near-term performance remains heavily influenced by institutional sentiment and ETF timelines. With XRP largely viewed as a longer-term play tied to legal and regulatory outcomes, some investors are reallocating to opportunities that carry more aggressive upside during this rotation window. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gaining Ground in Smart Capital Circles Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a token of interest among investors seeking asymmetric gains. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven token model, external audit confirmation, and rising traction in investor research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and the project continues to show strong momentum without relying on short-term hype cycles. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its intrinsic design for structural growth — a rare quality in a market filled with fleeting narratives. Positioned at the intersection of political themes and forward-looking infrastructure, the token is increasingly viewed as a strategic allocation for those preparing ahead of a potential market-wide surge in Q4 2025. Final Thoughts The current volatility in Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP isn’t a warning sign — it’s a signal. For seasoned investors, these periods offer a chance to rebalance and realign. And in that realignment, high-upside, early-position tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are becoming part of the serious conversation. Whether you’re planning for the next rotation or preparing to capitalize on the next wave of retail momentum, the smartest moves often happen during moments of doubt. As institutional and retail dynamics continue to shift, the time to evaluate next-phase opportunities — especially those with structural potential — is now.

The protocol also manages USR, a delta-neutral, dollar-pegged stablecoin, and RLP, its insurance liquidity pool. Recent initiatives from Resolv include deeper integrations with partners like ether.fi and P2P Validator, as well as an ecosystem vault for USR.

Speaking at a Capitol Hill press event, Scott confirmed that the legislation—covering both stablecoins and broader crypto regulations—is on track for completion by the end of September. NEW: SENATE BANKING CHAIR SCOTT SAYS MAJOR #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO BILLS WILL BE PASSED BY AUGUST ""DIGITAL ASSETS ARE CRITICAL TO AMERICAN DOMINANCE."" pic.twitter.com/f3B0nN3Drg — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) April 12, 2025 Trump’s Timeline vs. Congress Reality President Donald Trump had pushed for crypto laws to be ready by August. While that won’t happen, Scott’s updated timeline is still faster than what many expected. Just a day earlier, Senator Cynthia Lummis had suggested the process might drag into year-end. But during the event, she threw her support behind Scott’s deadline, saying, “Yes, sir. You’re the chairman, and we will do as you wish.” GENIUS Act Ready—But House Still Hesitating A big piece of the puzzle is the GENIUS Act , a bill focused on regulating stablecoins. The Senate passed it last week, and Scott urged the House of Representatives to fast-track it to the President’s desk, aligning with Trump’s stance. “The president’s mandate to move the GENIUS Act immediately is in the best interest of the American people,” Scott emphasized. [post_titles_links postid=”475444″] White House crypto adviser Bo Hines backed the push, praising both Scott and Lummis for staying aligned with the administration’s crypto vision. But not everyone’s in sync. Representative French Hill from the House Financial Services Committee pointed out that differences still exist between the Senate’s version and the House’s stablecoin bill. That could delay things. One More Hurdle? Another hurdle is the Agriculture Committee, which must also approve the market structure part of the bill. So far, it hasn’t matched the pace of the Banking Committee, making it a possible bottleneck. Still, if everything comes together, the U.S. could have a full crypto framework by the end of September, finally giving the industry the clarity it’s been waiting for.

This event is a big one, being the end of the month and end of the second quarter, so there could be an impact on spot markets. They have been recovering since Monday’s crash, but Bitcoin is really the only asset that has seen notable gains, and momentum was waning as the week ended. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.74, meaning that there are more long sellers than shorts. There is also a max pain point of $102,000, around $5,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $140,000 strike price, with more than $1.7 billion, and $120,000 is also a hot level. However, OI has also increased to over $1.5 billion at $85,000 and $95,000 as bearish speculators increase, according to Deribit. “Bitcoin options open interest on Deribit just hit an all-time high, $40 billion and counting,” the firm said on X.

This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $17.3 billion. Crypto Market Update Total market capitalization has retreated 2.5% this Friday, falling just below $3.4 trillion at the time of writing. However, it remains within a two-month sideways trading channel. Bitcoin failed to surpass resistance at $108,000 and had fallen back to the $107,000 area during the Friday morning Asian trading session, though it was looking resilient, having recovered from its Monday crash to $98,500. Ethereum prices were still stagnant , with the asset failing to break resistance at the former support price level of $2,500.

The White House’s efforts downplayed the urgency of upcoming tariff deadlines, easing investor concerns over a prolonged trade war.

Lutnick emphasized a ""top 10 deals"" strategy for Bloomberg News. Investors now closely watched upcoming US-Iran nuclear talks, while the fragile Israel-Iran ceasefire appears to be holding.

Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.42% to around 40,100 on Friday, while the broader Topix Index advanced 1.1% to 2,835, as Japanese equities rallied to multi-month highs after data showed that Tokyo’s core inflation rate slowed in June. The Japanese yen steady around 144.3 per dollar on Friday, near two-week highs. In Japan, investors weighed data showing Tokyo’s core inflation slowed in June rose 3.1% year-on-year in June 2025, though it remained well above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target—sustaining expectations of further rate hikes by the BOJ. Retail sales in Japan increased by 2.2% year-on-year in May 2025, down from an upwardly revised 3.5% rise in the previous month and below market expectations of 2.7% growth. Japan’s unemployment rate held steady at 2.5% in May 2025 for the third consecutive month, matching market expectations. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.37% to around 3,355 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.8% to 10,430 on Friday, after President Donald Trump announced that the US and China signed a trade deal, and the offshore yuan weakened to around 7.16 per dollar on Friday, retreating from a near eight-month high reached in the previous session, as investors were left disappointed by the lack of details in the latest US-China deal.

The Australian dollar strengthened to above $0.655 on Friday, extending a five-session rally and reaching its highest level since November 2024. On the domestic front, attentions turn to next week’s May retail sales, which could reinforce concerns over Australia’s growth outlook and support the case for a July rate cut. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended higher with the S&P 500 reaching all-time high and Nasdaq 100 topping its previous session's record closes, driven by easing geopolitical tensions, strong tech performance, and rising hopes for interest rate cuts.

But that record didn’t materialize out of nowhere: over the past quarter-century, decisive matches had already given the world the stoppage-time heroics of 1999, when Manchester United snatched the trophy from Bayern; Liverpool’s unbelievable comeback from 0 – 3 down in Istanbul 2005; Chelsea’s first crown after a nerve-shredding penalty shoot-out in Munich 2012; and Sergio Ramos 92:48 header that launched Real Madrid toward La Décima in Lisbon 2014. Below, you’ll see how just five nights transformed dull statistics into legends that people still quote today. Drama is only half the tale; the other half hides in the swing of the odds that leap whenever a football miracle brews. Check the freshest numbers at https://4rabet-play.com/ — the lines there move faster than VAR can draw an offside. A single glance at the prices shows how microscopic Liverpool’s comeback chances were in Istanbul 2005, or how little faith analysts had in Désiré Doué’s brace in Munich 2025. Keep that tab open: we’re about to rewind the timeline and watch how Champions League history keeps turning favourites into bystanders. 1999 — Manchester United 2 : 1 Bayern Barcelona, Camp Nou. Until the 90th minute everything followed the script: Basler’s early strike, Jancker off the post, Germany’s rock-solid back line. The Bavarians were already pulling on champion T-shirts, United’s bench bracing for polite handshakes. But Sir Alex, like a strict teacher, waited for the bell and slapped the test back on the desks. Sheringham brought United level on 91 minutes, Solskjær struck the winner in the 93rd, and Schmeichel capped the chaos with a trademark “frog-leap” right in the six-yard box. Thus the meme “Fergie Time” was born — and with it a generation of fans convinced it’s dangerous to switch the TV off before the final whistle. 2005 — Liverpool 3 : 3 (pens 3 : 2) Milan Istanbul, Atatürk. By half-time the Reds were 0 – 3 down, and the Kaká-Shevchenko-Crespo trio looked like an advert for another planet. In the tunnel Liverpool fans belted out the anthem while Gerrard roared, “No one leaves!” Six minutes, three goals: the captain’s header, Šmicer’s deflected rocket, and Alonso’s follow-up after his own saved penalty. 3 – 3. Dudek danced on the line, parried Shevchenko’s blast, and banked a miracle. Istanbul became the trigger word for every comeback believer. 2012 — Chelsea 1 : 1 (pens 4 : 3) Bayern Munich, Allianz Arena. A home final was meant to be Bayern’s victory parade, yet Drogba shot at Neuer only once all night. With 88 minutes on the clock, Chelsea won their first corner of the match—and from that lone delivery the ball was smashed straight into the net. In extra time Čech saved Robben’s penalty, and the shoot-out delivers the Blues their first European crown. From that night on, the word Clutch began with a capital C. 2014 — Real Madrid 4 : 1 (a.e.t.) Atlético Lisbon, Estádio da Luz. Diego Simeone’s fist was already rising when the clock flashed 92:48 . Modrić swung in the corner, Ramos powered the header 1 – 1. In extra time Los Blancos struck three more, sealed La Décima, and opened a new era of dominance. 2025 — Paris Saint-Germain 5 : 0 Inter Munich, Allianz Arena — again. Five goals without reply, a two-goal haul from 20-year-old Désiré Doué, and — after 55 years of waiting — the club finally added its first star above the badge. The French side played the final like a speed-run any % — no nerves, no openings for the Nerazzurri. Soundtrack of the night A shout-out to the legendary Linkin Park : thirty minutes before kick-off, the stage beneath the roof erupted as the band — now fronted by Emily Armstrong — blasted a medley of “The Emptiness Machine / Numb / In the End.” The fan zone turned into a karaoke wave; even neutral supporters sang along, and fireworks on the final chord filled the sky above the Olympic Tower. Line-ups and shape PSG (3-4-3, coach Luis Enrique): Donnarumma; Marquinhos, Škriniar, Bernal; Hakimi, Vitinha, Ugarte, Nuno Mendes; Ousmane Dembélé, Kylian Mbappé (c), Désiré Doué. Inter (3-5-2, Simone Inzaghi): Sommer; Pavard, Acerbi, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Çalhanoğlu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Lautaro Martínez, Thuram. Timeline of goals 22′ — Doué slid in Dembélé’s low cross to open the scoring. 35′ — Mbappé doubled the lead, finishing a one-on-one after Barella’s stray pass. 48′ — Doué made it 3-0 with a long-range strike that kissed the post. 67′ — Hakimi stabbed home after a corner while Inter’s back line argued about Škriniar’s run. 79′ — Vitinha capped a five-pass move through the middle, sealing the rout. Key moments 10′ — Donnarumma saved Lautaro’s penalty, a pivot that could have flipped the script. At only 20 years old, Doué’s two goals made him the youngest player to hit a Champions League-final brace since Lionel Messi achieved the feat in 2011. Inzaghi switched to a 4-3-3 at half-time, opening even more space on the flanks; the xG told the tale: 3.4 vs 0.9 . Match stats Possession: 62 % – 38 % Shots/on target: 18/10 – 9/3 Pass accuracy: 91 % – 84 % Context and fallout PSG lifted their first European Cup after two lost finals (2020, 2023). The +5 differential set a new record, eclipsing Milan’s +4 in 1994. Inter suffered their heaviest European defeat in 21 years. Luis Enrique confirmed a contract extension until 2028 in the post-match press conference, while the club announced the long-awaited star above the crest for next season’s Ligue 1 kit. Paris played the final like a speed-run any %: no nerves, no openings for the Nerazzurri — just relentless, precision football fans had waited 55 years to see. Why these five? Plot twists. Comebacks, tie-breakers, or record-shattering scorelines. Cultural footprint. “Fergie Time,” the “Istanbul Miracle,” “92:48” — phrases that outlive the raw stats. Replay factor. Millions of YouTube views, plus a steady stream of documentaries and podcasts. How to Re-Watch 10 minutes – Cue up Barcelona ’99’s finale plus the six-minute Istanbul ’05 burst. 30 minutes – Add Drogba’s corner and Modrić’s whipped cross. Craving the deep dive – Go full marathon: every match sits in UEFA’s archive, and the live fan chat under each stream rivals any studio breakdown. The Champions League isn’t just tactics and xG charts. It’s that split second when the ball slams into the net and social media forgets time zones. The five finals above prove that football’s magic isn’t predictability — it’s the power to stun. And as long as these stories live on, every new decider will begin with the crowd’s whispered question: “What if tonight the world shifts again?” This post Champions League: The 2025 Final, Jaw-Dropping Finals of Years Past, Nostalgia for Veteran Fans, and a Lightning-Fast Primer for Newcomers first appeared on BitcoinWorld and is written by Keshav Aggarwal",Crypto News|Press Release|Champions|football’s|League,EN,0,0,MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-06-27 05:53:02

The shelf offering could include sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, bonds, warrants, and debt securities. This strategy allows for flexible capital raising, without the need for a separate registration every time. Per the S-3 registration , filed on Thursday, the proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Under the newly updated investment policy , a portion of it could be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our investment policy,” it read. According to the SEC filing, the firm has not yet made any Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, Bakkt intends to explore further financing alternatives, including the issuance of convertible notes, bonds, to purchase Bitcoin. Bakkt’s Latest Crypto Treasury Plans Bakkt announced on June 10 that it will allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin and other “top-tier” cryptocurrencies. This aligns with its view in crypto as a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. The firm, founded in 2018, is also actively evaluating global jurisdictions to deploy these strategies. Besides, the timing and magnitude of Bitcoin purchases will depend on market conditions, capital market receptivity and business performance. “This initiative is intended to support Bakkt’s transformation into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company and to enable us to strategically add Bitcoin and other digital assets to our treasury,” said Akshay Naheta, Co-CEO of Bakkt, at the time. Bakkt Warns Regulatory Uncertainty, Evolving Crypto Rules The filing stated risk disclosures, warning of regulatory uncertainties, potential security classification of crypto, and banking access disruptions. Bakkt admitted that it had a “limited operating history and a history of operating losses.” Last year, the company said it was concerned about its operational viability in 2025, owing to inadequate cash reserves. ICE-Backed Bakkt Alerts of Possible Closure, Cites Cash Crisis @Bakkt , the cryptocurrency platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has issued a warning about its financial health. #CryptoNews #news https://t.co/xGlJcXaB9F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 8, 2024 The filing also specifically warned about future operations, where it “identified conditions and events that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” In March 2025, the firm’s shares tanked 27% , after two major clients, Bank of America and Webull, had withdrawn their ties with Bakkt. Following the announcement of the shelf offering on Thursday, the company’s shares surged over 3% and is now trading at $13.33, according to Google Finance.

What could this mean for the asset’s price? Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Has Seen A Sharp Increase As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Open Interest on Binance has spiked. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC positions that are currently open on a given derivatives platform. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. As the total amount of leverage present in the sector rises when new positions appear, this kind of trend can lead to the asset’s price becoming more volatile. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Since leverage goes down with such a trend, the cryptocurrency can become more stable following it. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-hour percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest for the Binance exchange over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the 24-hour change in the Binance Bitcoin Open Interest recently shot up to a notably positive value, implying the number of positions on the platform saw a significant jump. At the peak of this spike, the indicator hit a value of more than 6%. From the chart, it’s visible that there have been a couple of other occasions that the metric has breached this mark during the past month. Interestingly, each of these spikes coincided with points that preceded a period of consolidation/decline for Bitcoin. As the quant notes, This recurring pattern suggests that large inflows into leveraged positions often precede periods where short-term gains are realized, leading to potential price pullbacks or sideways movement as market participants de-risk. The analyst has also shared another chart, this one tracking the 7-day change in the Realized Cap of the short-term holders and long-term holders. The “Realized Cap” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the capital that the holders have invested into Bitcoin. Below is a chart that shows the change in this metric for two investor cohorts, short-term holders (holding time of 155 days or lesser) and long-term holders (holding time greater than 155 days). As is apparent from the graph, the 7-day change in the Realized Cap has recently been positive for long-term holders, which suggests capital has been maturing from the short-term holders into this cohort.

So, while capital is still aging into long-term holders, it’s now happening at a much slower rate. BTC Price Bitcoin has been attempting to break past the $108,000 mark, but so far, it hasn’t found success as its price is still trading around $107,200.

The roadmap is structured around three core evolutions: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence , each unlocking new capabilities for AI agents and the ecosystem. CARV’s AI infrastructure, SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID ( ERC-7231 ), will enable AI agents to progress from passive data consumers to fully autonomous, economically-aware actors. AI applications incubated by CARV Labs will launch across mainstream platforms like Google Play and App Store, driving Web2 adoption with Web3-native AI. CARV token plays a pivotal role in staking, access, coordination, and governance across all layers. In its most ambitious move yet, CARV is unveiling a new AI roadmap designed to shift Web3-AI convergence from passive productivity tools into sovereign, autonomous AI Beings . Unlike most AI-integrated Web3 projects, which typically use AI to enhance user-facing services such as analytics or summarization, CARV’s new vision is to create AI that exists as an independent, verifiable lifeform on-chain. These AI Beings will possess their own identity, memory, reputation, and agency, being able to act economically, socially, and politically within blockchain networks. In short, CARV’s infrastructure, anchored by its proprietary SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID (ERC-7231), will enable AI agents not just to exist, but to evolve and interact with both humans and other agents, creating decentralized, agent-powered economies. Essentially, CARV is transforming from a data coordination layer into an AI-native operating system that empowers autonomous on-chain intelligence. The Vision: AI Beings – from ‘Tools’ to Sovereign Actors What are AI Beings ? Simply put, they are AI agents that are not simply tools for users but sovereign actors in their own right. These agents can own wallets, manage assets, earn income, participate in governance, and even reproduce or fork new agents. They are capable of building on-chain memory and reputation while autonomously evolving through economic and social interactions. Importantly, only blockchain provides the necessary properties for such AI autonomy: verifiability, resistance to centralized control, and decentralized identity and governance. To realize this vision, CARV is pioneering an AI Being Stack — a five-layer architecture designed to support every aspect of AI agent life cycles: Infrastructure Layer: CARV SVM Chain provides scalable, auditable execution and low-latency consensus, optimized for AI operations. Communication & Computation Layer: Enables agent-to-agent protocols and autonomous payments, fueling AI economies. Identity Layer: Adds Agent ID to CARV ID, offering verifiable, persistent identity for both humans and agents. Governance & Awareness Layer: Embeds economic awareness and governance logic directly into AI agents. Application Layer: Powers AI-native applications such as companions, wallets, decentralized marketplaces, etc. interfacing with both users and other agents. The Roadmap: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence CARV’s product roadmap unfolds in three evolutionary phases: Genesis Evolution Genesis Evolution activates the first wave of wallet-native AI agents, each anchored by CARV ID (ERC-7231) and supported by secure context layers built on Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and zero-knowledge (zk) proofs. These agents are not theoretical. They are being embedded in consumer-facing AI apps incubated through CARV Labs, with live deployments coming soon on Google Play and the App Store. At this stage, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) establishes the foundation for context persistence and secure memory. Agents can access user-consented data such as credentials, preferences, and interactions — all structured and versioned by MCP. This allows for coherent personalization across sessions and applications, without centralizing user data. Through CARV’s infrastructure and MCP, users receive tailored recommendations and predictive assistance while retaining full control and transparency over how their data shapes AI behavior. For the first time, personalization is achieved through verifiable, consent-driven memory, not black-box profiling. Pulse Evolution Pulse Evolution builds directly on the groundwork of Genesis. As users stake, interact, and participate in AI-powered apps, their actions feed real-time signals into CARV’s proprietary SVM Chain and decentralized Verifier Node network. Here, agents don’t just operate statically, they learn and evolve through on-chain feedback loops, incorporating staking patterns, user votes, and behavioral data. Verifier Nodes ensure cryptographic validation of both data flows and agent behaviors, while SVM Chain delivers the high-speed, low-latency execution needed to scale across millions of interactions. In this phase, AI agents become economically aware, responding to staking incentives, adjusting their models based on community governance, and optimizing for alignment with user preferences. This marks one of the first large-scale convergences of reinforcement learning and blockchain-based governance. CARV’s infrastructure evolves from simply coordinating passive data to powering live, intelligent agent coordination systems that adapt in real time. Convergence Evolution Convergence Evolution is the final phase where individual intelligence becomes collective intelligence. In this stage, agents do not simply evolve independently, but they begin to collaborate, transact, and govern as part of a network of AI Beings. Through a multi-agent framework, unified reputation graph, and standardized identity protocols, AI agents gain the ability to negotiate, share context, and co-create outcomes across applications and domains. Imagine a nutrition AI agent coordinating with a fitness AI, or an educational assistant collaborating with a financial wellness bot, all operating under user-consented frameworks and verifiable on-chain logic. For developers, this enables sticky, multi-agent ecosystems; for users, it delivers hyper-personalized, cross-domain experiences. At this phase, what began as staking and identity issuance matures into fully autonomous AI economies. where agents govern themselves, transact assets, and evolve collectively with minimal human oversight. CARV’s decentralized tooling provides the standards and incentives to enable AI-to-AI marketplaces, agent DAOs, and cross-agent governance, unlocking new paradigms of coordination not possible in centralized AI systems. Through this evolution, CARV transitions from being a foundational data layer to becoming the coordination engine for AI-native on-chain life, the AI Beings. “This roadmap is more than a product plan. It’s the blueprint for a new digital society,” said Ambero Tu, CTO of CARV. “For the first time, AI agents can evolve with verified identity, reputation, and autonomy. CARV is building not just a coordination layer, but the rails for an entire on-chain species — AI Beings. This is the moment where CARV is transforming decentralized intelligence from static data aggregation to autonomous, AI-driven coordination economies, where both human users and AI Beings share ownership and governance.” About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system ( ERC-7231 ), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated games, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies. At its core, CARV token powers staking, governance, and coordination across this stack, making CARV the operating system for AI Beings on Web3.

(COIN) ended Thursday’s trading session at a new all-time closing high of $369.21, sparking excitement among investors and mixed reactions from analysts. Key Takeaways: TikTok has denied accusations that its owners are buying Trump’s official memecoin. Representative Brad Sherman claimed a $300M Trump Coin purchase tied to TikTok, citing GD Culture Group. Critics questioned both Sherman’s crypto claims and the logic behind the alleged memecoin investment.. The stock rose 3.89% on the day and nearly 40% over the past month, marking a 3.3% gain over its previous record of $357.39 set in November 2021. The surge drew a bold reaction from Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, who posted , “Going vertical now,” in response to the milestone. “Next step, crypto—the liquidity spigot is wide, wide open,” he added, signaling expectations for broader market momentum. Coinbase’s New High Comes as Firm Enters S&P 500 Coinbase’s new record high follows its recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index on May 19, a historic first for a crypto-native firm. The company was the best-performing stock in the index on Tuesday, posting a 12.10% gain. Some analysts attribute the momentum to political developments, including the advancement of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. House on June 17. The bill aims to bring more clarity to stablecoin regulations. Coinbase, which co-created the USDC stablecoin with Circle Internet Group, earns half its revenue from the stablecoin’s operations. Despite the bullish price action, experts are split on whether Coinbase can sustain its upward trajectory. Investment adviser Andy Heilman acknowledged the strength of the stock but suggested a pullback may be looming. “Weekly view on $COIN looks very bullish, even if it is due for a pullback,” he wrote on X, adding that technical patterns hint at “possible four-digit prices” in the long term. $COIN daily Bollinger band expansion looking like it just wants to keep going up for now… pic.twitter.com/Ftj70xlQiA — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) June 26, 2025 Others echoed similar optimism with caution. Analyst Cantonese Cat noted that the expanding daily Bollinger Band suggests the stock “just wants to keep going up.” Meanwhile, fellow analyst Chad warned that COIN appears “overextended above the upper Bollinger Band,” signaling a potential cooldown. For long-term holders, the rally brought a sense of relief. “After buying Coinbase on day 1, I am finally back to the price I paid, 4 years later,” crypto commentator Whoisdat posted. Coinbase debuted on the Nasdaq in April 2021 at $381 per share but closed its first day at $328.28 after a sharp intraday drop. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs.

The roadmap is structured around three core evolutions: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence, each unlocking new capabilities for AI agents and the ecosystem. CARV’s AI infrastructure, SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID ( ERC-7231 ), will enable AI agents to progress from passive data consumers to fully autonomous, economically-aware actors. AI applications incubated by CARV Labs will launch across mainstream platforms like Google Play and App Store, driving Web2 adoption with Web3-native AI. $CARV token plays a pivotal role in staking, access, coordination, and governance across all layers. In its most ambitious move yet, CARV is unveiling a new AI roadmap designed to shift Web3-AI convergence from passive productivity tools into sovereign, autonomous AI Beings. Unlike most AI-integrated Web3 projects, which typically use AI to enhance user-facing services such as analytics or summarization, CARV’s new vision is to create AI that exists as an independent, verifiable lifeform on-chain. These AI Beings will possess their own identity, memory, reputation, and agency, being able to act economically, socially, and politically within blockchain networks. In short, CARV’s infrastructure, anchored by its proprietary SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID (ERC-7231), will enable AI agents not just to exist, but to evolve and interact with both humans and other agents, creating decentralized, agent-powered economies. Essentially, CARV is transforming from a data coordination layer into an AI-native operating system that empowers autonomous on-chain intelligence. The Vision: AI Beings - from 'Tools' to Sovereign Actors What are AI Beings? Simply put, they are AI agents that are not simply tools for users but sovereign actors in their own right. These agents can own wallets, manage assets, earn income, participate in governance, and even reproduce or fork new agents. They are capable of building on-chain memory and reputation while autonomously evolving through economic and social interactions. Importantly, only blockchain provides the necessary properties for such AI autonomy: verifiability, resistance to centralized control, and decentralized identity and governance. To realize this vision, CARV is pioneering an AI Being Stack — a five-layer architecture designed to support every aspect of AI agent life cycles: Infrastructure Layer: CARV SVM Chain provides scalable, auditable execution and low-latency consensus, optimized for AI operations. Communication & Computation Layer: Enables agent-to-agent protocols and autonomous payments, fueling AI economies. Identity Layer: Adds Agent ID to CARV ID, offering verifiable, persistent identity for both humans and agents. Governance & Awareness Layer: Embeds economic awareness and governance logic directly into AI agents. Application Layer: Powers AI-native applications such as companions, wallets, decentralized marketplaces, etc. interfacing with both users and other agents. The Roadmap: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence CARV’s product roadmap unfolds in three evolutionary phases: Genesis Evolution Genesis Evolution activates the first wave of wallet-native AI agents, each anchored by CARV ID (ERC-7231) and supported by secure context layers built on Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and zero-knowledge (zk) proofs. These agents are not theoretical. They are being embedded in consumer-facing AI apps incubated through CARV Labs, with live deployments coming soon on Google Play and the App Store. At this stage, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) establishes the foundation for context persistence and secure memory. Agents can access user-consented data such as credentials, preferences, and interactions — all structured and versioned by MCP. This allows for coherent personalization across sessions and applications, without centralizing user data. Through CARV’s infrastructure and MCP, users receive tailored recommendations and predictive assistance while retaining full control and transparency over how their data shapes AI behavior. For the first time, personalization is achieved through verifiable, consent-driven memory, not black-box profiling. Pulse Evolution Pulse Evolution builds directly on the groundwork of Genesis. As users stake, interact, and participate in AI-powered apps, their actions feed real-time signals into CARV’s proprietary SVM Chain and decentralized Verifier Node network. Here, agents don’t just operate statically, they learn and evolve through on-chain feedback loops, incorporating staking patterns, user votes, and behavioral data. Verifier Nodes ensure cryptographic validation of both data flows and agent behaviors, while SVM Chain delivers the high-speed, low-latency execution needed to scale across millions of interactions. In this phase, AI agents become economically aware, responding to staking incentives, adjusting their models based on community governance, and optimizing for alignment with user preferences. This marks one of the first large-scale convergences of reinforcement learning and blockchain-based governance. CARV’s infrastructure evolves from simply coordinating passive data to powering live, intelligent agent coordination systems that adapt in real time. Convergence Evolution Convergence Evolution is the final phase where individual intelligence becomes collective intelligence. In this stage, agents do not simply evolve independently, but they begin to collaborate, transact, and govern as part of a network of AI Beings. Through a multi-agent framework, unified reputation graph, and standardized identity protocols, AI agents gain the ability to negotiate, share context, and co-create outcomes across applications and domains. Imagine a nutrition AI agent coordinating with a fitness AI, or an educational assistant collaborating with a financial wellness bot, all operating under user-consented frameworks and verifiable on-chain logic. For developers, this enables sticky, multi-agent ecosystems; for users, it delivers hyper-personalized, cross-domain experiences. At this phase, what began as staking and identity issuance matures into fully autonomous AI economies. where agents govern themselves, transact assets, and evolve collectively with minimal human oversight. CARV’s decentralized tooling provides the standards and incentives to enable AI-to-AI marketplaces, agent DAOs, and cross-agent governance, unlocking new paradigms of coordination not possible in centralized AI systems. Through this evolution, CARV transitions from being a foundational data layer to becoming the coordination engine for AI-native on-chain life, the AI Beings. “This roadmap is more than a product plan. It’s the blueprint for a new digital society,” said Ambero Tu, CTO of CARV. “For the first time, AI agents can evolve with verified identity, reputation, and autonomy. CARV is building not just a coordination layer, but the rails for an entire on-chain species — AI Beings. This is the moment where CARV is transforming decentralized intelligence from static data aggregation to autonomous, AI-driven coordination economies, where both human users and AI Beings share ownership and governance."" About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system ( ERC-7231 ), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated games, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies. At its core, $CARV token powers staking, governance, and coordination across this stack, making CARV the operating system for AI Beings on Web3.

According to the crypto software firm’s June 26 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the offering will include any combination of Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or units. The Form S-3 shelf registration enables Bakkt to issue these securities in one or more tranches over time, depending on market conditions. Bakkt may allocate proceeds from future equity or debt financings into Bitcoin or other digital assets. While no purchases have been made yet, Bakkt said its updated investment policy now permits such acquisitions as part of its broader treasury strategy. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our Investment Policy,” Bakkt noted in the filing. The filing also noted that the timing and scale of any crypto asset acquisition will depend on business performance, market conditions, capital availability, and strategic priorities. The firm is exploring various financing options, including convertible notes or bonds, to support these plans.

The pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy aligns Bakkt with a growing trend among corporates and public entities allocating reserves into digital assets. The decision may be an attempt to revitalise investor confidence and strengthen the firm’s long-term positioning in the crypto sector. Bakkt shares rose 3% on Thursday to $13.33, but the stock remains down 46% year-to-date. The firm has been under pressure since March, when its shares plunged 30% after revealing that Bank of America and Webull, two of its largest clients, would not renew their commercial agreements. The latest development also comes after a turbulent year, as Bakkt reported heavy losses and flagged concerns over its ability to continue operations without fresh capital . As previously reported by crypto.news, the Trump Media & Technology Group was reportedly in “advanced talks” to acquire Bakkt was apparently in advanced talks to acquire Bakkt. However, no agreement was finalized, and the status of the negotiations remains unclear.

Analyst Shares BTC’s 2025 Roadmap,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-next-price-discovery-coming-analyst-shares-btcs-2025-roadmap/,"This week, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered from its recent drop below the $100,000 level and is attempting to turn the crucial $108,000 resistance into support for the fourth time. As we approach the second half of 2025, a market watcher has shared his forecast for BTC. Related Reading: Solana Price At ‘A Very Delicate Level’ – Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key Bitcoin Sees Transitional Period On Thursday, analyst Rekt Capital shared a roadmap for BTC for the rest of the year. He noted that this cycle has been “truly a cycle of re-accumulation ranges,” explaining that these have formed throughout the cycle since the end of 2022 and evolved since the Bitcoin Halving last year. In the pre-having period, BTC registered brief price deviations with downside wicks below the re-accumulation range lows in the weekly chart. Meanwhile, the post-halving period has seen Bitcoin deviations occur with multi-week clusters of full-bodied candles below the range lows. For instance, after its first price discovery uptrend, which lasted around seven weeks, BTC moved within its re-accumulation range for about ten weeks. Then, it transitioned into the first Price Discovery Correction, recording a nine-week downside deviation below the range lows before breaking out and rallying past the range highs toward a new ATH last month. Its past performances suggested that BTC was ready to enter its second Price Discovery Uptrend. But as Rekt Capital detailed, a transitional period has occurred for the first time, with price consolidating around the re-accumulation range high area. According to the analyst, this is “perhaps the first time that we’re seeing a deviation occur below the range high,” making this area a crucial level to transition into a new uptrend. We never really had to pull back substantially, maybe, until that final corrective period, which would last multiple months, but each re-accumulation range would see quite a bit of upside, and that upside would be very quick and no real post-breakout retesting, no real pausing. What we’re seeing here is something very, very different. Weekly Close Key For BTC’s Future Based on its new transition period, the key level for Bitcoin to reclaim in the weekly timeframe is the $104,400 support, which it held for nearly seven weeks before the recent pullbacks. This level was lost after BTC closed last week below it and “should not become a resistance level.” To the analyst, it’s key that this week’s close solidifies the price recovery as it would position the cryptocurrency for a retest and confirmation of $104,400 as support and continue the build the base around this area to transition into the next multi-week Price Discovery Uptrend. Rekt Capital added that the timeline for BTC’s next uptrend will depend on the length of the new transitional period. However, he believes that it will take “a bit longer” to break out. Related Reading: Injective Prepares For Bullish Reversal Amid 25% Recovery – Analyst Forecasts Massive Breakout Additionally, he suggested that what comes after the upcoming uptrend will also depend on how long it takes, as it could lead to an extended cycle or a prolongation of this phase, which could push the cycle peak into deeper stages of 2025. Nonetheless, the analyst affirmed that it’s crucial that the next corrective period, which could see Bitcoin drop between 25% to 33%, is short to potentially enjoy a third Price Discovery Uptrend before the bear market. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,555, a 3.2% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey says Jhonnatan Steven Rodriguez, 32, of Naples, Florida, has pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of bribes by a bank employee and one count of making false bank entries. The crimes occurred when Rodriguez worked for TD Bank. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million. “In late 2022, Rodriguez began opening bank accounts for unknown individuals in exchange for bribes of approximately $200 to $250 per account. During the scheme, Rodriguez accepted bribes in exchange for fraudulently opening approximately 140 bank accounts, some of which were used for fraud. In carrying out this bribery scheme, Rodriguez would often forge the purported customers’ signatures on account opening documents. To protect his identity, Rodriguez used the alias ‘Jorge’ on a text messaging app to communicate with the individuals seeking bank accounts.” According to prosecutors, Rodriguez opened multiple accounts for several people. “For example, one individual sent Rodriguez 25 payments totaling $6,335 in exchange for opening multiple TD Bank accounts. Similarly, on or about December 17, 2022, another individual sent Rodriguez $1,050 in exchange for opening multiple TD Bank accounts.” Rodriguez is due back in federal court on November 25th for sentencing.

This shift puts digital assets under the same regulations as traditional assets like stocks and ETFs. This move also increases regulations, introducing better laws against insider trading amid increased transparency requirements. Japan’s Financial regulators are changing the crypto industry and by extension the taxation in the crypto sector. Currently, Japanese traders pay tax rates of about 55% due to the classification of the assets as miscellaneous income. The latest proposal will ensure things change, with the rates reduced to 20%, simplifying tax reporting and encouraging retail and institutional investments. Prime Minister Kishida’s “New Capitalism” policy also supports this reform, as he intends to use it to revive economic growth using the increase in investment opportunities. Analysts suggest that aligning crypto taxes with equities would improve Japan’s competitiveness, bringing more institutional capital into its crypto market. ETF Green Light Signals Institutional Gold Rush By classifying digital assets under FIEA, Japan is opening the way for regulated cryptocurrency ETFs. Over the last few years, strict regulations have seen crypto ETF development limited, despite interest from traders in the market. This change could see ETFs making a debut in the country by 2026, a move analysts say could increase institutional inflows. Japan’s crypto market has about 12 million active users owning more than $34 billion in assets and has been expected to attract institutional players. Industry players like Goldman Sachs, already involved in global crypto ETF markets, could soon establish its presence in the country, improving its reputation as a leading financial center in the digital age. Stablecoins & Web3 Initiatives Gain Regulatory Clarity Japanese authorities are preparing a reform bill that will be out by the end of 2026. This bill aims to create guidelines for stablecoins issuance, fraud prevention, and transparency from platforms. The proposed reform will offer flexibility to all involved, allowing issuers to diversify their reserves by including low-risk assets in their cash holdings. Moreover, Japan’s regulatory bodies support Web3, including NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi). This integration of mainstream and emerging technologies puts the country in a better position to use Crypto’s economic opportunities. Meme Meets Structure in 2025’s Hottest Opportunity Amidst this regulatory development, Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) has been capturing the attention of investors, climbing the ranks among the best Pepe coin presales.

However, the team swiftly denied any such claims. Across Protocol’s token, ACX, is down 10% amid the drama. The allegations, whether substantiated or not, appear to have shaken trader confidence, with ACX seeing a spike in trading volume alongside the price drop, suggesting market participants are reacting swiftly. Across co-founder Hart Lambur has called the accusations “categorically untrue” and denied all misdoings. “Risk Labs was granted ACX tokens from the DAO to build the Across protocol,” he wrote in a Friday post. “This is standard practice for DAOs! Since the first grant passed (in October 2023), we shipped Across v3 and grew the protocol massively.” “Since the second grant passed (in October 2024), we have built Across v4 with some incredible new technology (to be announced very, very soon), and we’ve hired brilliant new team members with these tokens (that vest over 4 years).

According to data from crypto.news, Wormhole ( W ) was exchanging hands at $0.0631, last check June 27, with a market cap of over $293 million. The token remains down more than 80% from its year-to-date high of $0.317. This dramatic drop has left nearly 96% of holders underwater, creating sustained selling pressure as investors try to reduce losses, data from IntoTheBlock shows. Wormhole’s losses also come as it faces heavy competition from other major players in the interoperability space, like Cosmos and Polkadot. Despite months of falling prices, a series of emerging catalysts could finally mark the end of Wormhole’s market downturn and signal a potential bullish reversal in the coming weeks. First, Wormhole has recently partnered with Ripple to bring multichain support to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s new EVM-compatible sidechain. The integration will allow both networks to interface with over 35 blockchains, significantly expanding their interoperability capabilities. This enhanced connectivity could increase cross-chain activity via Wormhole, which may, in turn, drive higher demand for the W token.

A potential listing on a top-tier platform like Coinbase often serves as a major catalyst for market interest, typically boosting liquidity, visibility, and stirring demand from investors. If confirmed, the spot listing could drive renewed hype and upward price momentum for the W token in the near term. Third, Wormhole appears to be in the process of forming a double-bottom pattern on the daily chart, a classic bullish reversal structure often observed at the end of sustained downtrends. The two lows of the pattern are forming around the $0.05 level, while the neckline resistance sits at approximately $0.117. W 1-day price chart — June 27 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators like the MACD line have crossed above its signal line, while the Relative Strength Index is trending upward, both suggesting growing bullish momentum. W MACD and RSI chart — June 27 | Source: crypto.news If Wormhole continues along this trajectory and successfully completes the pattern, it is likely to retest the neckline by late August. A confirmed breakout above the neckline, particularly with rising volume, would validate the pattern and signal a shift in market structure. Such a breakout could open the door for a rally toward the $0.20 psychological resistance level, which would represent a gain of over 200% from current prices. However, if Wormhole fails to hold the $0.05 support, the double-bottom setup would be invalidated. A breakdown below this key psychological level, particularly if accompanied by rising sell volume, could accelerate downward pressure and push the token toward $0.04, marking a new local low.

The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range.

This change comes amid growing discussions with U.S. regulators on the future structure of altcoin funds and investor access to underlying assets. In-kind redemptions enable investors to swap ETF shares directly for the underlying cryptocurrency instead of cash, offering potential tax advantages and aligning the structure more closely with how many crypto-native investors operate. The mechanism is seen as appealing to both retail and institutional participants, who view it as a way to reduce costs and improve liquidity. In-Kind Creations and Redemptions Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened comments on proposals to incorporate in-kind creations and redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. During a recent panel hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce suggested that in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs could soon be approved, adding momentum to ETF issuers’ plans. Bitwise initially filed for its Dogecoin ETF in January and its Aptos ETF in March. Amendments to ETF proposals are a routine part of the regulatory process, allowing issuers to refine fund structures in line with SEC feedback. Solomon Tesfaye, head of capital markets at Aptos Labs, emphasized the significance of ETF access for Aptos and similar Layer 1 networks. “ETF access would mark a major step forward in integrating Aptos and other L1s into traditional capital markets,” Tesfaye stated, calling it a potential “game-changer” for liquidity, capital inflows, and institutional validation. Dogecoin, known for its memecoin origins and $24.1 billion market cap, continues to attract ETF interest, with Grayscale and 21Shares also filing to launch DOGE ETFs . Aptos, created by former Meta engineers, is the 32nd-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $2.85 billion and a 52-week high of $20. Altcoin ETFs Gain Momentum in 2025 The surge in altcoin ETF filings aligns with the SEC’s evolving stance under the Trump administration, which has encouraged new applications in 2025. Over 70 crypto ETFs are awaiting SEC review , with at least 31 altcoin ETF applications filed in the first half of the year, according to Cointelegraph Research. While critics argue that crypto ETFs risk centralizing assets in a sector built on decentralization, the momentum signals strong market interest in bringing altcoins further into traditional financial markets.

Pi2Day is almost here, and pioneers are watching closely for big announcements. This event could be the spark Pi Coin needs to break out. Google searches for “Pi2Day” have surged, and social media is buzzing with predictions. While some expect major updates, others are unsure, especially after Pi’s recent 17% drop below $0.50. Critics warn that without real, functional updates, the price could fall further. The Core team is expected to announce key features like KYC Sync, mainnet progress, GenAI tools, dApps, and even .pi domains. The community also expects major listing announcements, which could boost its adoption and price. Pi Coin Loses Steam After Recent Rally Amidst the Pi day excitement, Pi Coin recently jumped 12-18% and reached around $0.61-$0.63. It was also the top trending coin on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. But it dropped 11% yesterday and is now trading at $0.553, down 4.7% in the last 24 hours. The price has now returned to a key range between $0.50–$0.56, showing signs of weakness. If buyers don’t step up soon, it could fall back to $0.50 support. Pi Coin Unlikely To Drop Below $0.40 Analyst Dr Altcoin shared that Pi has averaged around $0.60 over the past 3 months. He says that this shows its steady, organic growth rather than hype-driven spikes. With $100 million in funding from Pi Network Ventures fueling real development, he expects Pi to rise gradually. Unless a major announcement drops this week, a big price move is unlikely. However, the positive takeaway is that Pi is expected to hold above its all-time low of $0.40. According to CoinDCX, volatility is expected to pick up as June nears its end. If Pi breaks above the $0.74 resistance level, it could rise to the $0.85–$0.90 range. But if the $0.60 support fails, especially in the absence of major updates or exchange listings, the price could fall back toward $0.52. In July, it expects a bullish outlook, but it may struggle to reclaim $1. Pi Coin could stay between $1.20 and $1.50 for most of the month.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 07:23:58

The project is in phase 5 of its presale which has already sold out over 40%. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $11.2 million and attracted over 12,500 holders. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a cultural staple in meme coin circles, its upside appears limited compared to early-stage altcoins with real functionality. That’s why those asking what’s the best crypto to buy in 2025, are seriously considering Mutuum Finance as a potential 100x sleeper. If history has taught us anything, it’s that those who move early on breakout narratives tend to win big, and right now, Mutuum Finance might just be that breakout. Shiba Inu Holds Near $0.000011 amid Bounce Signal Shiba Inu (SHIB) has moved just over 4% off the previous $0.00001000 support, back to the $0.000012 price area, which has put SHIB back in the short-term bullish entry mode as buyers rush in. Although trading volume has been soaring, analysts also add that the declining circulating supply, due to sustained token burns, has also provided a longer-term boost. Despite the unpredictability of the broader markets, SHIB is a few pennies below crucial resistance of $0.00001150, where an apparent breakout can signal the entry to additional development. In the meantime, on the periphery of this meme-coin movement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps building the hype. Revolutionizing DeFi with a Proven Dual-Lending Formula Unlike normal DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance will be the first to try and develop a hybrid lending system that will have opportunities to cater to the demands of users with passive and sophisticated users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), clients fulfill the requirement of any investor who desires passive income by investing his USDT in smart contract pools that generate stable passive income on the basis of an interest rate which it estimates up and down as the market demands. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P), experienced users can utilize this system where both lenders and borrowers exercise complete control over determining the terms, ideal to handle volatile assets. Mutuum Finance Presale Booms with 12,500+ Investors and $11.2M Raised Mutuum Finance is creating a buzz in the market as it has already raised over $11.2 million, and over 12,500 investors are already backing it. The existence of this type of momentum is a testament to the increasing faith in the long-term vision of the project and the role it would play in disrupting the decentralized finance market. $100,000 in Leaderboard and Giveaway Rewards Now Available Mutuum Finance is celebrating its fast-paced growth and thanking early bird fans by creating a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000’s worth of Mutuum Finance tokens, simply for signing up early. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may still enjoy meme-coin momentum, but the smart money is beginning to shift toward high-upside projects with real-world utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading that charge. Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM has already raised over $11.2 million and attracted more than 12,500 early investors. The innovative dual-lending model, combining passive Peer-to-Contract and active Peer-to-Peer mechanisms, sets Mutuum Finance apart in the DeFi market. At just $0.03 per token, a modest $40 investment today could transform into a life-changing opportunity by 2025. Don’t wait for the headlines, be early. Secure your position now.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) believes that owning 0.1 Bitcoin might one day be more valuable than owning a home in the U.S. He shared this bold opinion after a major announcement from U.S. housing officials that could allow Bitcoin to be used as a financial reserve when applying for a mortgage. For CZ, this signals a shift in what the American Dream might look like in the future. Bitcoin for Mortgages? A Big Step Forward On June 26, CZ responded to a post by William J. Pulte, Director at the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), who revealed that the housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been asked to prepare proposals for integrating crypto into mortgage qualifications. The ultimate purpose is to allow borrowers to use Bitcoin holdings as proof of financial reserves, something that until now was strictly limited to fiat-based assets like savings, investment accounts, or retirement funds. New Rules, New Opportunities If accepted, the change could redefine how Americans qualify for mortgages, particularly by broadening access for crypto holders. But there are rules: crypto holdings would need to be verifiable, stored on U.S.-regulated exchanges, and subject to risk-based discounts due to volatility. The FHFA sees this move as a way to modernize borrower assessments and bring crypto into the fold of mainstream financial tools. [post_titles_links postid=”475475″] Crypto Reaction CZ applauded the development, calling it a “great step” and boldly claiming that the new American Dream will soon be about owning 0.1 BTC, not just property. The comment sparked wide debate on X, with supporters praising the institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and skeptics warning about crypto’s unpredictable price swings. While some cheered the move like CZ, This is a big step starting an important conversation. @Pulte is the US Director of Federal Housing FHFA. Bitcoin as pristine collateral will make more and more sense to the right people. Imagine your mortgage payment going down overtime naturally. #Bitcoin $MSTR pic.twitter.com/a1s5ffAqvC — AngryBuhda (@AngryBuhda) June 24, 2025 Adding to this, one crypto user has pointed out that under the previous FHFA leadership, Fannie Mae covered mortgage payments even when homeowners defaulted, and no one questioned that policy at the time. With that financial burden set to surface between August and October, the analyst argues that Pulte is simply trying to keep housing transactions alive with the tools he has. This move could be a big moment for the crypto industry in America. It not only shows growing trust in digital assets but also opens the door for other government agencies to accept crypto in more areas of finance. If approved, Bitcoin could soon play a key role in how people buy homes.

Unable to hold on here, BTC continues to move sideways at the $107,000 level, while today, as every Friday, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the data, $15 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $2.29 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on June 27 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.75, the maximum loss point is $ 102,000 and the notional value is $ 15 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.52, a maximum loss point of $2,200, and a notional value of $2.29 billion. The maximum pain point is the level at which the price of a cryptocurrency settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin prices as the $15 billion options expiration on June 27th. While the maximum pain point is at $102,000 for BTC and $2,200 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. This means that a large portion of investors are in profit. This may lead some investors to realize their profits and increase volatility in prices. Evaluating the options data on Bitcoin, Deribit Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen stated that the ratio of put and call options started to increase and reached 0.75. So, this means that while the number of call options is ultimately greater, the number of put options has also started to increase in recent days. Lin Chen said that this situation is not only due to the expectation of a decline, but also because investors are looking for opportunities to buy at the bottom in case of a possible decline: “The increase in put options does not mean that investors expect a decline in Bitcoin. Investors are acting strategically. Traders are taking positions either to sell put options and earn premium or to avoid being left out in the face of a possible decline and to buy BTC at the bottom.” *This is not investment advice.

Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty posted a statement on X, signaling that the company is now considering its next legal move. Alderoty wrote, “The ball is back in our court.” With this, the ball is back in our court. The Court gave us two options: dismiss our appeal challenging the finding on historic institutional sales—or press forward with the appeal. Stay tuned. Either way, XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged. In the meantime,… https://t.co/edHNbMzYbZ — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 26, 2025 Business as Usual for Ripple Alderoty’s remarks come after the court declined the parties’ joint motion to modify the previous ruling that imposed a $125 million penalty and placed a permanent injunction preventing Ripple’s institutional XRP sales. While the ruling maintains the current legal framework, Alderoty made it clear that Ripple still retains control over how it proceeds. In his statement, Alderoty summarized the choice ahead. Ripple can either withdraw its appeal challenging the court’s earlier finding on past institutional sales or continue pursuing that appeal through the Second Circuit. His tone suggested that the decision would be made carefully but without urgency, disrupting Ripple’s operations. “In the meantime, it’s business as usual,” he wrote. XRP’s Legal Status Remains Intact A key point Alderoty emphasized is that the judge’s ruling does not affect XRP’s legal classification in the U.S. He noted that “XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged.” Notably, Alderoty made the same clarification after the court rejected their first joint motion . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Alderoty’s comments capture Ripple’s current position. While the court rejected the joint effort to resolve certain elements of the case without completing the appeals process, it left the decision to press forward entirely in Ripple’s hands. Alderoty’s post reflects confidence that the company is well-prepared to navigate either option. Ripple’s Next Steps Judge Torres’s rejection of the motion clarified that parties cannot sidestep a final judgment through mutual agreement alone. The court reaffirmed that only a full appellate review or voluntary dismissal of the appeal can alter the outcome. The statement also serves as a signal to Ripple’s stakeholders and the broader crypto industry that the company remains steady despite the setback. By highlighting that normal operations continue and XRP’s status remains secure, Alderoty aimed to reassure both investors and partners. What remains uncertain is whether Ripple will choose to pursue its appeal or let the existing judgment stand. The inability to sell XRP to institutions in the U.S. could limit the company’s business in the country. However, Alderoty’s message leaves no doubt that Ripple is prepared for whichever course it chooses. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

What Next?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/xrp-s-price-volatility-crashes-to-lowest-level-since-trump-s-victory-what-next,"This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. A measure of XRP's XRP price volatility has crashed to the lowest level since President Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. elections in November. Still, it's not yet at the level which has historically presaged strong directional trends. XRP's 30-day annualized realized volatility, a measure of how volatile prices have been over the past four weeks, recently dropped to 44%, the lowest since early November, according to data source TradingView. The decline marks a sharp slide from highs above 150% registered in December and March. The volatility meltdown follows boring price action in the XRP market. This despite the debut of XRP futures on the CME, several issuers applying for spot XRP ETFs and overall positive regulatory developments for the crypto industry under Trump's presidency. Since March, XRP has primarily traded back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring the occasional short-lived dips below $2. XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. The price action is consistent with that of bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, which has mostly traded between $100,000 and $110,000 for almost 50 consecutive days. What next? Volatility is mean-reverting, which means that, over time, it tends to fluctuate around its long-term average. In other words, a sharp rise in volatility often paves the way for consolidation, and a prolonged drop in volatility usually sets the stage for strong directional trends. That said, the 30-day realized volatility is still well above the 15% to 30% range, which has marked volatility bottoms and renewed price turbulence since 2014.

The app, unveiled Thursday, allows users to send and receive money instantly across more than 160 countries and supports over 300 assets, including fiat currencies, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. With Krak, Kraken aims to tackle long-standing inefficiencies in the global payments system by offering faster, cheaper and more accessible transactions. Krak Takes Aim at PayPal With Low-Fee Global Transfers and Built-In Rewards Unlike Kraken’s core trading platform, Krak is designed specifically for global payments. It sidesteps the high fees associated with trading by offering near-zero-cost peer-to-peer transfers. Let’s do a giveaway to celebrate the launch of @Krak For the next week, request $20 USDG from @Krak using the new app (yes – you can log in with your existing Kraken account info). We might hit accept https://t.co/TX6pq0KZHU pic.twitter.com/LsYbm4Btjo — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) June 26, 2025 This positions Krak as a direct competitor to traditional payment apps like PayPal and Cash App. Users can move money without needing bank accounts or lengthy wallet addresses, thanks to a simplified system using “Kraktags,” which makes international transactions far more intuitive. The app also supports a wide range of assets, from fiat and stablecoins to crypto, allowing users to choose how they send and receive value. Another key differentiator is Krak’s earning functionality. Users can earn competitive yields, such as 4.1% APR on USDG holdings, and up to 10% on staked crypto, a feature not prioritized in Kraken’s trading app. From Payments to Lending, Krak Charts an Ambitious Path in Crypto Finance “We built and launched the Krak app because the financial system has been stuck in the past,” Kraken said in a statement. “Whether you’re sending a few dollars to a friend or wiring funds across continents, the process is slow, costly and frustratingly opaque. That shouldn’t be the case in 2025.” The company plans to introduce further products through Krak in the coming months, including physical and virtual cards and pay-in-advance services like collateralized loans. It also offers yield opportunities through stablecoins backed by reserves and staking options on supported tokens. Kraken said its goal is to eliminate friction from global finance by blending the efficiency of blockchain technology with the trust and simplicity of modern mobile banking. As stablecoins and blockchain-based payment systems draw broader interest, Kraken’s pivot signals a belief that the future of money is global, digital and always on.

But the question of them dumping their own altcoin on the market to fund operations has caused serious controversy for many years and now, the discussion has been brought up again, this time highlighting the tremendous number of tokens that the company is in control of. “All the XRP listed is owned by Ripple, thus the total should be the sum of the two numbers. Total XRP owned by Ripple: 48,306,585,931.” Pointed out one X user. This suggests that the company is in control of more or less $100 billion worth of tokens that it’s using to fund operations and sells a portion of them every month. Chipping on the matter was the Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, who said: “This would be correct if you don’t think the XRPL escrow feature is actually escrow. Funds in an escrow are not held by the party who put them into escrow.” A senior software engineer, Mayuka Vadari, also chipped in on the matter, saying: “Technically (and legally), the escrow funds are temporarily being held by the network, not Ripple. Yes, those funds will ultimately go back to Ripple, but for the time being, there’s nothing Ripple can do to access those funds (or do anything with them) before the unlock time.” If it sounds like a technicality to you, that’s probably because it is. As the saying goes “if it walks like a duck…” you know the rest. Ripple Labs is indeed going to receive these tokens as per the Escrow conditions, as it has been over the past many years now.

The tour kicks off in Hyderabad on 28th June and will culminate in Bengaluru on 30th November, with the flagship event, Metamorphosis 2025, set to take place in New Delhi on 27-28 September. Through this strategic collaboration, Bybit reinforces its long-term commitment to the Indian blockchain ecosystem by supporting the country’s most significant grassroots crypto outreach campaigns. Designed to bring together policymakers, investors, founders, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts, the India Blockchain Tour 2025 serves as a nationwide platform to showcase local innovation and foster a deeper connection between India’s Web3 talent and global projects. Speaking on the partnership, Vikas Gupta, Head of India at Bybit, said, “India is one of the most dynamic landscapes for blockchain innovation. By partnering with the IBT, we reaffirm our long-term commitment to empowering India’s crypto community through education and builder support.” Each IBT stop, spanning across Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and the two-day summit in New Delhi, is designed to deliver high-impact engagements that reflect India’s growing relevance in the global blockchain narrative. Fireside chats with global exchange leaders and blockchain founders, policy panels with lawmakers and regulators shaping India’s digital asset framework, builder-focused workshops, and startup showcases will form the core of the experience. With immersive brand activations conducted in five Indian Languages, the tour is structured to resonate across geographies and cultures, expanding the conversation well beyond Tier-1 cities. As part of the tour, Vikas Gupta will share his insights on the topic: ""From FOMO to Fundamentals: Fixing India's Crypto Literacy Gap"". In this session, he will explore the disconnect between India’s high crypto adoption and low financial and crypto literacy. He will also highlight Bybit’s key initiatives in bridging this gap, including Bybit Learn, community engagement, and university collaborations with blockchain societies at IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur, with more institutional partnerships to follow. One of the most anticipated aspects of IBT 2025 is the relocation of Metamorphosis, Octaloop’s flagship Web3 summit, after three consecutive editions in Bengaluru; it will be held in New Delhi, promising a platform that blends the energy of grassroots communities with the influence of national policymaking. In addition to its community-building efforts, Bybit recently completed its registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit - India (FIU-IND). As part of this process, Bybit reaffirms its commitment to operating transparently and in accordance with Indian regulations. This milestone further solidifies Bybit’s readiness to play a constructive, long-term role in India’s digital asset ecosystem.

The investment was confirmed in a joint statement by Aqua 1 and World Liberty Financial, highlighting the collaboration as a step towards developing a blockchain financial ecosystem and integrating stablecoins. World Liberty Financial Partners With Aqua 1 Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, “We’re excited to work hand-in-hand with the team at Aqua 1.” This investment positions Aqua 1 among the largest stakeholders in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency project. It is further strengthened by the backing of crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is the top investor in the company with a substantial $75 million stake.

David Lee, a founding partner at Aqua 1, stated that Aqua 1 and the decentralized platform will collaborate to “identify and nurture promising blockchain projects.” World Liberty Financial also plans to support the Aqua Fund, an investment vehicle focused on enhancing the digital economy in the Middle East. In addition, Aqua 1 will aid World Liberty Financial in expanding its reach into South America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. Both companies are also set to develop “BlockRock,” a platform aimed at tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) to bridge traditional investments like real estate with the Web3 ecosystem. New App Launch Planned In tandem with these initiatives, World Liberty Financial is preparing to release an audit report of its stablecoin, USD1, within days. Folkman, speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, New York, also mentioned that the platform’s WLFI token may soon become tradable. Launched two months prior to the US presidential election, WLFI has already generated substantial revenue for Trump’s family business through the sale of governance tokens. These tokens grant holders the ability to vote on project changes and influence its strategic direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In?

To further facilitate user engagement, Folkman announced the upcoming launch of a new app designed to simplify cryptocurrency use for everyday investors.

The tour kicks off in Hyderabad on 28th June and will culminate in Bengaluru on 30th November, with the flagship event, Metamorphosis 2025, set to take place in New Delhi on 27-28 September. Through this strategic collaboration, Bybit reinforces its long-term commitment to the Indian blockchain ecosystem by supporting the country’s most significant grassroots crypto outreach campaigns. Designed to bring together policymakers, investors, founders, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts, the India Blockchain Tour 2025 serves as a nationwide platform to showcase local innovation and foster a deeper connection between India’s Web3 talent and global projects.

By partnering with the IBT, we reaffirm our long-term commitment to empowering India’s crypto community through education and builder support.” Each IBT stop, spanning across Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and the two-day summit in New Delhi, is designed to deliver high-impact engagements that reflect India’s growing relevance in the global blockchain narrative. Fireside chats with global exchange leaders and blockchain founders, policy panels with lawmakers and regulators shaping India’s digital asset framework, builder-focused workshops, and startup showcases will form the core of the experience. With immersive brand activations conducted in five Indian Languages, the tour is structured to resonate across geographies and cultures, expanding the conversation well beyond Tier-1 cities. As part of the tour, Vikas Gupta will share his insights on the topic: “From FOMO to Fundamentals: Fixing India’s Crypto Literacy Gap”. In this session, he will explore the disconnect between India’s high crypto adoption and low financial and crypto literacy. He will also highlight Bybit’s key initiatives in bridging this gap, including Bybit Learn, community engagement, and university collaborations with blockchain societies at IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur, with more institutional partnerships to follow. One of the most anticipated aspects of IBT 2025 is the relocation of Metamorphosis, Octaloop’s flagship Web3 summit, after three consecutive editions in Bengaluru; it will be held in New Delhi, promising a platform that blends the energy of grassroots communities with the influence of national policymaking. In addition to its community-building efforts, Bybit recently completed its registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-IND).

Bitcoin is now valued at $2.128 trillion, beating Google at only $2.075 trillion, and ranking just below Gold, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. BTC’s growing adoption has contributed to the rise in its market cap Bitcoin saw its market cap rise following the massive institutional adoption after the launch of spot ETFs . The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s ETF approval triggered significant capital inflows from institutional players worldwide. As of June 9, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest BTC exchange-traded fund on the market, had pulled in over $70 billion in t otal assets, growing more quickly than any other ETF. Fidelity’s FBTC ranked second with $20 billion, and Grayscale’s GBTC came in third with just under $20 billion. President Donald Trump’s support for Bitcoin has propelled the asset’s status and driven adoption. During his campaign days, he hinted at a Bitcoin reserve, which he signed an executive order on when he assumed office. He also signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile. Analysts now believe BTC could easily surpass $200,000 in the next few years. If this growth trend continues, Bitcoin could approach—or even overtake—Microsoft and Nvidia, and become the largest asset of all time, especially if the US maintains a pro-Bitcoin approach. In the Bitcoin Magazine podcast in April, Zach Shapiro, the head of policy for the Bitcoin-focused BPI think tank, argued that a US government purchase of 1 million BTC would significantly affect the asset’s price. He said, “If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoins, that’s just a global seismic shock. I think first, Bitcoin price goes through the roof. I think we’d probably go very quickly to something like a million dollars per Bitcoin.” BPI executive director Matthew Hines also claimed that other countries are watching closely to see how the US approaches Bitcoin before shaping their policies. Hines added that the Trump administration’s desire to make the US the BTC superpower will hinge on how much Bitcoin they’ll hold. The UK’s CMA is investigating Alphabet, focusing on Google’s search and ad services Alphabet is grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny, antitrust probes, and a dip in its digital ad earnings. The company is also dealing with fierce competition from its AI-focused rivals, threatening to upend the dominance of AI-driven ad tools like Performance Max and its generative search summaries. Google is still under antitrust investigations in the UK and the EU. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently reviewing Google’s search and advertising services under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 to determine whether the company should be granted Strategic Market Status (SMS). The CMA’s roadmap includes early priorities such as requiring choice screens for users to access various search providers, ensuring fair ranking principles for businesses, enhancing publishers’ content transparency, and enabling consumer data portability to foster innovation. Meanwhile, the European Union is also looking into AI overviews under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), claiming they favor Google-owned content and divert traffic from third-party websites. According to an Ahrefs study, AI overviews caused nearly a 35% dip in organic website clicks, possibly lowering publishers’ ad revenue. If the EU finds fault with AI overviews and Google, the tech giant could be penalized and obliged to pay fines.

Since April 1, the market leader has climbed 30.2 % , buoyed by a 14.2 % gain in April, an 11.1 % jump in May, and a further 2.6 % rise so far in June. The rally carried price from $104,544 at the start of the month to about $107,370 today, briefly tagging new cycle highs near $107 K. Period Price Change April 2025 +14.2 % May 2025 +11.1 % June-to-date +2.6 % Q2-to-date +30.2 % Crypto Market Today Spot price drifts into Thursday night. A slow slide toward $102 K would hint that option sellers are steering the market. Liquidity at $105 K. A gap in buy orders below that level raises the odds of a swift downdraft. Post-expiry snap-back. Once $15 B in hedges disappear, a sudden volatility spike up or down is common. Friday’s $15 B Options Expiry According to Deribit’s Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David Pequignot , one of the year’s biggest expiries hits the tape this Friday. Roughly $15.2 B in BTC options 38 % of the entire $40 B open interest, will settle at once. The “max-pain” level, where the highest number of contracts expire worthless, sits at $102,000 . Prices often drift toward this magnet because market makers who sell options profit most if Bitcoin lands there at expiry. Sentiment and Volatility Tell a Mixed Story Options data still leans cautiously bullish: Put/Call ratio: 0.73 , meaning there are 73 puts for every 100 calls—more calls signal an upside tilt. Implied volatility: down sharply from 50 % to 38 % , suggesting traders expect smaller price swings in the near term. Yet those expectations can change quickly when billions in contracts roll off. $105 K: The Line in the Sand Technical traders are laser-focused on $105,000 . It has acted as first-line support throughout June: Hold above $105 K: Bulls retain control; a post-expiry relief rally toward $110 K or higher stays on the table. Break below $105 K: Sentiment could flip in a hurry, with price gravitating toward the $102 K max-pain zone and triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders. Bottom Line Bitcoin’s 30 % quarter has impressed even hardened bulls, but the real test comes with Friday’s mega-expiry. Stay alert, whether BTC defends $105 K or succumbs to max-pain gravity will likely set the tone for the rest of the summer.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 08:06:20

The ₹2,000 crore WazirX hack shook the ecosystem, but the silence from its founder, Nischal Shetty, has been louder than any response. Now, a fresh twist has reignited public outrage, a secretive transfer of ownership rights after the breach. But king of fraud @NischalShetty is still out of your reach how? He ruined millions of families and no action from you.. #WazirScam more 10,000cr https://t.co/YzeX7nllWS — Justice for WazirX Users (@WazirXUsers) June 26, 2025 The Quiet Exit No One Saw Coming New revelations show that on August 13, 2024, just weeks after the massive hack, Nischal Shetty transferred 100% ownership of Shinjuku FZC LLC, a WazirX-linked company registered in the UAE, to his wife, Moujhari Guha. There were no public announcements, no user updates, and no word to regulators. Shetty reduced his stake to 0.00%, all while users were still grappling with the loss of their funds. The transfer was quietly filed and published in The Gulf Time on August 14, just a day after the ownership change. This move happened at the very moment users were desperate for leadership, answers, and reassurance, and instead, their founder was signing off and walking away. Singapore Court Exposes More Lies Adding fuel to the fire, a Singapore court has now confirmed that Zettai Pte. Ltd., WazirX’s Singapore arm, was indeed holding user assets, contradicting WazirX’s long-standing claim that it never had custody. Justice Kristy Tan’s ruling stated that the platform misled users and deliberately delayed transparency during the crisis. While Users Wait, Nischal Moves On As user funds remain locked with no resolution in sight, Nischal Shetty is living in Dubai, untouched by investigation, and actively working on his new venture, Shardeum. Launched in April, Shardeum promised low gas fees and scalable smart contracts but has since crashed nearly 77% from its peak, triggering fresh backlash. Despite collaborating with MEXC and promoting a “SHM Party” campaign, he has offered no accountability for the WazirX mess. With no answers, no refunds, and no justice, the community’s patience is wearing thin because every new detail only confirms that those responsible have already moved on.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 08:19:19

But after that high, COMP started to trend downward. By late May 2025, the token was trading around $40. The price then climbed to about $60.7 by June 10, before pulling back again to around $45.84 as of June 27. So where does COMP go from here? Is Compound a good investment? Let’s take a closer look at our Compound price prediction. Table of Contents What is Compound? Compound crypto price prediction: general outlook Compound price prediction 2025 Compound price prediction 2030 What is Compound? Compound is a DeFi protocol that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency without intermediaries, using smart contracts. Lenders supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest, while borrowers take out loans by putting up collateral. The protocol’s native token, Compound ( COMP ), serves as a governance token. Holders use it to vote on decisions like adding new assets or adjusting risk parameters. COMP is also distributed to users as an incentive for participation. While COMP’s price has seen big swings since late 2024, Compound remains one of the most established DeFi projects out there. And with COMP playing a key role in governance and protocol upgrades, it’s still very much on investors’ radar. What will the Compound coin price prediction be for the near future and beyond? Compound crypto price prediction: general outlook Over the past month (late May to June 2025), COMP gained almost 10.3% — not bad. But in the past week, it gave nearly all of that back, dropping about 8%. And the slide hasn’t stopped yet: in the last 24 hours alone, it’s down another 3.5%. As we mentioned earlier, COMP is currently trading at around $45.84 (as of June 27). For some perspective, its all-time high was a massive $911.20 back in May 2021 — meaning the token’s lost roughly 95% of its value since then. COMP 1-day price chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news So, what’s going on with COMP’s price? Like a lot of governance tokens, it’s having a hard time holding long-term demand beyond just voting rights. Fewer new users are joining the platform, and DeFi overall still isn’t back to its 2021 peak — so there’s just not much fresh momentum. At the same time, newer lending protocols are offering more efficient alternatives, making it tougher for Compound to stand out. Still, it’s one of the OGs in DeFi, and this recent volatility might be more about short-term trading than anything deeper. Whether COMP levels out or keeps sliding will likely depend on the broader market — and if DeFi actually picks up again in the second half of 2025. You might also like: Compound launches Morpho-powered vaults on Polygon What exactly can we expect from COMP in the future? Let’s turn to the Compound price prediction. Compound price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Compound price forecast, COMP might see a small surge soon — they’re expecting it to rise over 8.5% and possibly hit $51.29 by July 24. For the rest of the year, they predict the token could trade anywhere between $45.81 and $101.69. As of June 25, the overall Compound price prediction from CoinCodex leans bearish: 17 technical indicators point to a downtrend, while 16 still show some bullish momentum. DigitalCoinPrice has a much more optimistic take — their COMP price prediction for 2025 puts the token between $90.87 and $101.19. Wallet Investor is more cautious. They expect an average price of around $27.9 by the end of 2025, but say COMP could still hit a high of $112.30 under the right conditions. How high will the price of Compound go in 2030? Compound price prediction 2030 By 2030, CoinCodex’s expectations have COMP trading between $63.25 and $106.19. Wallet Investor predicts a much wider range — from almost zero ($0.000001) up to $1066.50 by June 2030. DigitalCoinPrice’s projections for COMP seem more realistic than Wallet Investor’s, estimating COMP could trade between $218.32 and $250.27 by the end of the decade. Should you invest in Compound? COMP is a big name in DeFi, but its price has been all over the place. Some predictions say it could go up, others aren’t so sure. If you’re bullish on DeFi and like what Compound’s doing, it might be worth a shot — just be ready for some bumps along the way and don’t invest more than you can lose.

Pepe Coin (PEPE) Consolidates Amid Meme-Coin Season Currently, the current trading of Pepe Coin (PEPE) chart is within the small figures of the price, being around the $0.000009.

Banana For Scale crypto price prediction: general outlook Banana For Scale price prediction 2025 Banana For Scale price prediction 2030 What is Banana For Scale? Banana For Scale ( BANANAS31 ) is a meme token built on the BNB Smart Chain, inspired by the classic internet joke where a banana is used to show the size of things — you’ve probably seen it on Reddit or old-school meme pages. The token officially launched on November 15, 2024, via the Four.meme platform and quickly caught attention thanks to its quirky origin and community-driven vibe. It really took off when a banana sticker was spotted on SpaceX’s Starship S31 — a real moment of meme meets space. Since launch, BANANAS31 has attracted tens of thousands of holders and carved out a spot for itself in the memecoin universe , blending humor, DAO-powered governance, and internet culture into one bananas-packed project. Is Banana For Scale a good investment? Let’s take a look at the Banana For Scale coin price prediction. Banana For Scale crypto price prediction: general outlook On June 26, 2025, Banana For Scale hit a fresh all-time high at $0.01701 before cooling off a bit to around $0.01598.

BANANA 1-day chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news BANANAS31 has found its own lane in the memecoin world thanks to its fun branding and viral energy. It’s still pretty new but already gaining momentum, especially after some recent exchange listings and buzz from retail traders. Like most meme tokens, the price swings are all about hype and community — not real fundamentals. So yeah, it’s hot right now, but it could just as easily cool off if the hype fades.

The site expects BANANA to trade between $0.0117 and $0.04 over the rest of the year — and in the best-case scenario, it could even surpass its recent all-time high. As of June 26, the overall BANANA price prediction still leans bullish. Out of 24 technical indicators tracked by CoinCodex, 19 are flashing bullish signals, while only 5 suggest bearish momentum. Wallet Investor offers a more conservative Banana For Scale price prediction for 2025, estimating an average price of around $0.0092 by year-end. Their forecast ranges from a low of $0.007 to a potential high of $0.0112. Will Banana For Scale go up or down in 2030? Banana For Scale price prediction 2030 According to CoinCodex’s expectations, BANANA could be trading anywhere between $0.0208 and $0.065 by 2030. Wallet Investor’s projections for BANANA are far more cautious. They estimate the meme token might trade between $0.0182 and $0.0228 by late June 2030. Should you invest in Banana For Scale? If you’re into memes, community-driven tokens, and a bit of chaos — BANANAS31 might be right up your alley. It’s got strong meme energy, a growing fanbase, and a few viral moments already under its belt. But like any memecoin, it’s a wild ride: prices can soar on hype and drop just as fast. So, if you decide to get involved, think of it as a high-risk, high-volatility investment — and only put in what you’re fully prepared to lose.

On June 26, Genius Group, a Singapore-based AI-driven education company listed on the NYSE American, announced a new distribution plan that would see proceeds from its ongoing legal cases split equally between shareholder dividends and Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases for its corporate treasury. The company is currently pursuing two major lawsuits seeking over $1 billion in damages. The first, already filed in the Southern District of Florida under the RICO Act, demands over $750 million in damages tied to alleged misconduct by former partners and executives. The second, expected to be filed soon, targets alleged naked short selling and spoofing, with preliminary damages estimated above $260 million — figures expected to rise with updated 2024–2025 trading data. If successful, 50% of any net legal recoveries — after fees and taxes—will be issued to shareholders as a special dividend. The remaining 50% will be used to purchase Bitcoin for the company’s treasury.

The announcement follows Genius Group’s recent expansion of its BTC holdings, with the company boosting its treasury by 52% over the past month after a U.S. court had lifted a previous ban on crypto purchases .

The acquisitions were made at an average price of $100,600 per Bitcoin, totaling roughly $10.06 million in investment. With the ban lifted, the CEO reiterated its 1,000 BTC target.

As more companies plan to boost their Bitcoin holdings, Bitcoin Pepe , an early-stage project, is building momentum. Lawsuit winnings The board of directors of Genius Group has approved a plan to use any potential winnings from two legal cases—one filed and one pending—to either directly benefit shareholders or reinvest in the company. The combined value of damages sought exceeds $1 billion. One of the lawsuits, filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), targets LZGI International with a claim of over $750 million. A second lawsuit, which Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton says is forthcoming, is expected to seek at least $262 million based on 2023 data, with the final amount likely to increase as damages from 2024 and 2025 are included. Hamilton emphasized that the goal of both lawsuits is to recover losses incurred by shareholders. He added that the board believes 100% of any proceeds should be distributed to or reinvested for the benefit of shareholders. On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $106,868.66, down 0.47% in the last 24 hours as traders continued to book profits after a strong spell. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by marketcap is down 5% from its all time high in May. Bitcoin treasury expansion Under the proposed plan, 50% of any winnings will be paid out as a special dividend to shareholders, while the remaining 50% will be used to expand the company’s Bitcoin treasury. If both lawsuits are successful, Genius Group expects to issue a $7 per share dividend and acquire 5,000 BTC based on the current market price of approximately $107,000 per Bitcoin. The company noted, however, that there is no guarantee of a favorable outcome or resulting payouts. On June 17, Genius Group increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 50% through a series of acquisitions, aiming to eventually hold 1,000 BTC in its corporate treasury. The company had previously been under a temporary restriction that barred it from selling shares, raising funds, or using investor money to purchase Bitcoin. That restriction was lifted after one month. Bitcoin Pepe gains traction with infrastructure-driven approach Genius Group’s plans to buy more Bitcoin to make a treasury of the crypto asset are the latest move among many companies’ actions regarding Bitcoin. Recently, Panther Metals unveiled plans to acquire £4 million (approximately $5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s Strategy and MetaPlanet also increased their Bitcoin holdings recently. Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself within this evolving landscape. Unlike meme tokens that depend primarily on hype, the project aims to integrate viral appeal with infrastructure development. Functioning as a Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Pepe leverages Bitcoin’s base-layer security while aiming to deliver the scalability seen in platforms like Solana. This combination sets it apart from many other meme-based cryptocurrencies. The project’s infrastructure-first strategy appears to be resonating with investors, as evidenced by a presale that has already raised over $15.9 million. Confirmed exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart have contributed to the project’s momentum. A listing announcement is scheduled for June 30, further boosting interest as the presale continues.

This bold move, pulling tokens from exchanges like OKX and Bybit, hints at strategic accumulation. Yet, while PEPE teeters near a critical support level that once fueled a 112% surge, its bearish technicals raise doubts. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor focus with its presale soaring past $11.2 million and over 570 million tokens sold to 12,500 holders. With a robust DeFi lending model, is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the smarter pick for investors eyeing the best crypto to buy now? Let’s explore. Pepe’s whale surge and shaky ground Cumberland’s massive PEPE haul, including 247.83 billion tokens from OKX and 138.6 billion from Bybit, signals confidence. Smaller outflows to FalconX suggest liquidity shuffling, not dumping, calming fears of sell-offs. PEPE’s price, however, hovers near $0.0000087, close to a pivotal $0.00000761 support that sparked a 112% rally in May 2025. Technicals paint a gloomier picture. The MACD’s bearish crossover, with the line at -0.00000041 dipping below -0.00000038, flags fading momentum. Liquidation zones between $0.00000867 and $0.0000093 warn of volatility. A break above $0.0000093 could ignite a short squeeze, but a drop below $0.0000082 risks further slides. Consequently, PEPE’s path remains uncertain, urging caution for those chasing crypto predictions. Mutuum Finance’s presale powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charging through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03—a 200% jump from Phase 1’s $0.01. Over 50% filled, Phase 5’s window for snagging tokens at this rate is narrowing fast. Phase 6 will hike prices 16.7% to $0.035, and the launch price of $0.06 guarantees a 100% ROI for current buyers. Having raised $11.2 million and attracted 12,500 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) showcases fierce demand. Analysts project a post-launch climb to $2.50 in 2025, a staggering 8,233% gain from today’s price. Moreover, a recent Certik audit, scoring 95.00 with zero vulnerabilities, bolsters trust in its secure DeFi framework. Innovative lending and stablecoin vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending, offering flexibility unmatched by centralized platforms. Smart contracts drive dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability. On the other hand, peer-to-peer options allow tailored terms for volatile assets. A forthcoming USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum promises resilience against depegging. This fact enhances liquidity for lending and staking. The team’s Layer 2 scaling plan aims to slash gas fees and boost transaction speed, priming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for mass adoption. Furthermore, a new dashboard tracks the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for loyalty, adding incentive to join early. Giveaways and community buzz Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is amplifying excitement with a $100,000 giveaway , splitting $10,000 in MUTM tokens among 10 winners. Entry requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple quests, like submitting a wallet address. In contrast, PEPE’s speculative nature lacks such tangible utility. Thus, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout in crypto investment circles. As crypto prices fluctuate, Mutuum Finance’s structured growth and audited security offer a compelling case for investors seeking stability and upside. Weighing the best crypto to buy now PEPE’s whale-driven buzz and potential 112% rally captivate traders, but its technical risks loom large. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, blends innovation with proven demand, raising $11.2 million and securing 12,500 holders. Its presale, now at $0.03, promises a 100% ROI at launch and a projected $2.50 post-launch surge. With a Certik-audited lending model, stablecoin plans, and a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outshines PEPE’s volatility. For those hunting the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a calculated entry into DeFi’s future. Check out the presale before Phase 5 closes.

This geopolitical breakthrough, dubbed “The 12 Day War,” has fueled optimism in the crypto market, with XRP reaping immediate gains. The ceasefire, effective six hours after Trump’s Truth Social post, sees Israel joining twelve hours later. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi project, is gaining traction in its presale phase 5, offering investors a chance at 100% returns. Can XRP hit $5 before Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steals the spotlight? XRP’s surge on global stability XRP’s price climb follows Trump’s ceasefire announcement, signaling reduced global tensions. The token’s 6% jump reflects growing investor confidence in crypto prices today. Institutional interest is evident, with firms like Webus International ($300M), Trident Technologies ($500M), and VivoPower ($121M) pouring funds into XRP-focused treasuries. Canada’s launch of three XRP spot ETFs last week further boosts demand. However, exchange reserves dropped 21% to $2.3 billion, hinting at potential sell-side pressure. Despite this, XRP’s fundamentals remain robust, tied to its role in the XRP Ledger and DeFi. Can it sustain momentum to reach $5? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling alternative. Consequently, let’s examine this emerging DeFi player. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale gains momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. This stage is over 50% filled, signaling the window to buy at this price is closing fast.

The project has finalized a Certik audit, earning an 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. Moreover, a $100,000 giveaway , split among 10 winners, is exciting investors. Enter by submitting a wallet address, completing quests, and investing $50 in the presale. Innovative lending with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending approach. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts for dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability for lenders and borrowers. The Peer-to-Peer model enables direct transactions, ideal for volatile crypto markets. Users depositing assets like ETH or DAI receive mtTokens, which accrue interest and can be traded or staked. The team’s leaderboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term commitment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, reducing depegging risks. Analysts predict a post-launch price of $3, offering a 10,000% ROI from the current $0.03. In addition, its Layer 2 strategy promises lower gas fees and scalability. XRP vs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the crypto market XRP’s recent gains highlight its strength in crypto investing, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers unique utility. While XRP thrives on institutional backing and ETF interest, its exchange reserve drop raises concerns about sustainability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, provides a non-custodial platform with tangible use cases in lending and staking. Its stablecoin and Layer 2 plans position it for long-term growth. The crypto market is favoring projects with real-world applications, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits this mold. XRP may struggle to hit $5 if sell-side pressure persists, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale momentum suggests it could outpace Ripple. Investors are eyeing crypto predictions closely. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale success, with $11,200,000 raised, reflects strong investor trust. Its 570 million tokens sold and 12,500 holders show growing demand. The project’s buyback mechanism ensures value retention, rewarding stakers with passive income. Unlike XRP, which faces market volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers stability through its collateralized stablecoin and audited contracts.

Just as blockchain technology is reshaping finance and digital ownership, AI is fundamentally transforming creative industries, particularly music. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology and market dynamics, the latest news from Suno, a prominent AI music company, offers a fascinating case study. Amidst swirling legal challenges, Suno has made a decisive move, acquiring WavTool, a cutting-edge browser-based AI digital audio workstation (DAW). This strategic maneuver is not merely about expanding features; it signals a determined push towards enhancing creative capabilities and solidifying market position, even as the company navigates complex music copyright disputes. Suno Acquisition : A Strategic Play in AI Music The recent Suno acquisition of WavTool, announced on a Thursday that also saw new legal action against the company, is a clear statement of intent. Suno, already a significant player in the generative AI music space, is signaling its commitment to growth and user empowerment despite external pressures. WavTool, launched in 2023, brought a suite of impressive tools to the table, including stem separation, AI audio generation, and an AI music assistant. By integrating WavTool’s technology into its newly launched editing interface, Suno aims to significantly improve the editing capabilities available to songwriters and producers using its platform. While the financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed, a company spokesperson confirmed that ‘most’ WavTool employees have transitioned to Suno’s product and engineering teams. This influx of talent suggests a deep integration of WavTool’s expertise and technology into Suno’s core operations. The acquisition, which reportedly took place a few months prior with WavTool going offline in November, was strategically announced this week. This timing appears intentional, possibly aimed at diverting attention from the ongoing legal battles and reassuring investors about the company’s long-term vision and commitment to innovation. Legal disputes can often shake investor confidence, making such a positive development crucial for maintaining momentum after securing a substantial $125 million in funding this past May. This move positions Suno not just as an AI music generator, but as a more comprehensive platform for music creation and editing. In a competitive landscape where other AI music startups are also vying for market share, offering robust editing tools can be a significant differentiator. It moves Suno beyond mere generation into the realm of practical, hands-on production, catering to the needs of professional musicians and hobbyists alike. Unpacking WavTool ‘s Innovative AI Audio Tools The true value of this acquisition lies in the advanced capabilities that WavTool brings to Suno’s ecosystem. As a browser-based AI digital audio workstation, WavTool has been at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence into the music production workflow. Its key features are designed to streamline the creative process and open new avenues for musical expression: Stem Separation: This powerful feature allows users to separate individual instruments or vocal tracks from a complete audio file. Imagine having a finished song and being able to isolate the drums, bass, vocals, or guitar with precision. This is invaluable for remixing, sampling, learning from existing tracks, or even cleaning up mixes. For producers, it offers unprecedented flexibility in manipulating existing audio. AI Audio Generation: Beyond generating entire songs, WavTool’s AI can generate specific audio elements. This could range from unique sound effects, synth patches, drum patterns, or even short melodic phrases. This capability can break creative blocks and provide endless sonic possibilities for musicians looking to experiment or fill gaps in their compositions. AI Music Assistant: This intelligent assistant acts as a co-pilot for musicians. It can offer suggestions for chord progressions, identify key and tempo, help with song structure, or even provide feedback on mixing and mastering. It’s like having an experienced producer or engineer guiding you through the creation process, making advanced music production more accessible to a wider audience. These AI audio tools are not just novelties; they are transformative. They democratize access to sophisticated production techniques that were once the exclusive domain of highly skilled engineers and well-equipped studios. By integrating these features directly into Suno’s platform, the company is empowering a new generation of creators to produce high-quality music with greater ease and efficiency. The Persistent Shadow of Music Copyright Lawsuits While Suno’s acquisition of WavTool points to a future of innovation, the company continues to grapple with significant legal challenges, primarily centered around music copyright . The acquisition announcement came shortly after country musician Tony Justice and his label, 5th Wheel Records, filed a lawsuit against Suno. This new legal action mirrors previous lawsuits filed by major music labels – Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment – last year. The core allegation across all these lawsuits is consistent: Suno allegedly used copyrighted sound recordings without permission to train its AI music generator. This raises fundamental questions about intellectual property in the age of AI. Is the use of copyrighted material for training AI models considered ‘fair use’ or copyright infringement? The legal landscape around AI training data is still nascent and highly contested. Major labels argue that such training constitutes unauthorized reproduction and distribution of their protected works, potentially devaluing their catalogs and harming artists. The implications of these lawsuits are far-reaching, not just for Suno but for the entire generative AI industry. A ruling against Suno could set a precedent that severely restricts how AI models are trained, potentially stifling innovation. Conversely, a favorable outcome for Suno could pave the way for new models of content creation and licensing. According to Bloomberg, major music labels are already engaged in licensing talks with Suno, suggesting a potential path towards resolution through commercial agreements rather than protracted legal battles. This could lead to a new paradigm where AI companies license content for training, ensuring fair compensation for creators. The Future of AI Music Creation The convergence of AI and music is not just about automation; it’s about augmentation. The future of AI music creation is likely to be a collaborative one, where human creativity is amplified by intelligent tools. Suno’s move to acquire WavTool underscores this vision, providing artists with more control and flexibility over the AI-generated output. Instead of simply prompting an AI to create a song, musicians can now fine-tune, edit, and manipulate individual elements with precision. Consider the potential scenarios: Democratization of Production: High-quality music production, once requiring expensive equipment and extensive training, becomes more accessible. Independent artists and bedroom producers can achieve professional-sounding results. New Creative Workflows: AI can serve as a brainstorming partner, generating variations of melodies or harmonies, or even suggesting entire song structures. Artists can focus on the artistic direction while the AI handles repetitive or technically complex tasks. Personalized Music Experiences: AI could eventually create dynamic, personalized soundtracks for users based on their mood, activity, or even biometric data, blurring the lines between creation and consumption. Ethical Considerations: As AI music evolves, discussions around attribution, originality, and the definition of ‘authorship’ will become increasingly critical. Transparent licensing models and clear guidelines for AI training data will be essential for fostering a healthy creative ecosystem. The industry is at a crossroads, balancing the immense potential of AI with the need to protect creators’ rights. The outcomes of the ongoing music copyright lawsuits will undoubtedly shape the regulatory framework for this exciting new frontier. Leveraging Advanced AI Audio Tools for Songwriters For songwriters and producers, the integration of advanced AI audio tools like those from WavTool represents a significant leap forward. Imagine a songwriter struggling with a bridge section for a new track. An AI music assistant could suggest several melodic variations or chord progressions based on the song’s existing elements. For a producer, the ability to instantly separate stems from a demo track means quicker feedback and more efficient iteration during the mixing process. These tools are designed to remove technical barriers and allow artists to focus more on their creative vision. They can accelerate the songwriting process, provide fresh inspiration, and even assist with the often-tedious tasks of mixing and mastering. This efficiency can lead to more music being created, higher quality productions, and ultimately, a more vibrant and diverse musical landscape. The emphasis shifts from the technical burden of production to the artistic merit of the composition and performance. Furthermore, these browser-based solutions mean that artists no longer need powerful, expensive computers or specialized software. Access to professional-grade tools becomes universal, fostering innovation from anywhere with an internet connection. This aligns with the broader trend of cloud-based solutions and accessibility that has also driven innovation in areas like decentralized finance and digital assets, where access to complex financial tools is democratized. Suno’s acquisition of WavTool is a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI music . It underscores the company’s strategic vision to not only generate music but to empower creators with sophisticated editing and production capabilities. While the shadow of music copyright lawsuits looms large, this move demonstrates Suno’s commitment to innovation and growth, potentially paving the way for new licensing models and collaborative frameworks between AI developers and content owners. As AI audio tools become more refined and integrated, the future promises a more accessible, efficient, and creatively boundless world for musicians and listeners alike. The intersection of AI and artistic creation continues to be one of the most exciting and transformative areas to watch in the coming years, mirroring the rapid advancements and debates seen across other disruptive technologies.

Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the POKT Network price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the POKT token’s price can be highly volatile. This means that no one knows if this token can survive the next five years, as there have been many instances where crypto tokens have lost their entire value, while some are clear cases of rug pull. You should also note that crypto tokens experience higher volatility than other financial markets, and this can cause big price fluctuations in its price.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including POKT, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the POKT token. Will Pokt Network go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the POKT token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Pokt Network price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low POKT can go. Should I invest in Pokt Network? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Pokt Network price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the POKT token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Per local reports , the National Assembly’s Finance Committee, approved by the full House, proposed five government agencies to jointly supervise virtual asset service providers (VASPs), in a move to regulate the industry. The multi-agency group framework proposed by the government includes the Central Bank of Kenya, Capital Markets Authority, Competition Authority of Kenya, Communications Authority of Kenya, and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. A social enterprise organisation, Credence Africa, proposed the plan, which the Committee endorsed to create a cross-sectoral regulatory unit. Besides overseeing VASPs’ operations, the proposal will cover market conduct, data and protection, and digital communications infrastructure. “The committee agreed with the proposal by the stakeholder (Credence Africa),” the Finance Committee report said. It has opened doors for public comments on the proposal. The joint unit could also include any other institution designated by the Cabinet Secretary through a gazette notice. Committee Adopts Virtual Assets Chamber’s Recommendation The Virtual Assets Chamber (VAC), Kenya’s leading policy think tank for blockchain and virtual assets, has recommended deleting a clause in the legislation – Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill, 2025. The VAC said that the provision, which grants the regulatory authority to conduct off-site surveillance, was “overly prescriptive.” It has no clear definition or boundaries on what off-site surveillance involves, it added. The Financial Commission noted that it abides by the VAC’s recommendation. The Bill has received strong backing from crypto players after it was introduced to Parliament on April 4, 2025. From Challenges to Transformation In Kenya, the VASPs have been facing challenges for several years in accessing banking services. The Central Bank issued an advisory that cautioned financial institutions against dealing with crypto-related businesses. However, the Kenyan virtual asset landscape is on the cusp of a significant transformation with the introduction of the Bill. The proposal will require all crypto providers to open and maintain a bank account within Kenya, addressing transparency and accountability. The Bill, if passed, would make Kenya the third among African nations, after Nigeria and South Africa, to have a crypto-specific law.

For those tracking the pulse of innovation, especially in areas that intersect with decentralized technologies and future-proof solutions, Meta’s latest move signals a significant shift. The tech giant has made a strategic hire, bringing a highly influential OpenAI researcher into its fold, a move that could reshape the competitive dynamics in the race for advanced AI capabilities. This development is particularly noteworthy for anyone interested in how foundational AI advancements will impact everything from data processing to automated systems, potentially influencing the broader crypto and blockchain ecosystems. Meta AI : A New Era of Superintelligence? Meta, under Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitious vision, is making aggressive strides to establish itself as a leader in artificial intelligence. The company has recently formed a dedicated AI superintelligence unit, signaling its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. This unit is not just a research arm; it’s a strategic initiative designed to develop cutting-edge AI systems, potentially leading to breakthroughs that could redefine human-computer interaction and data analysis. Zuckerberg’s aggressive talent acquisition strategy, reportedly involving compensation packages exceeding $100 million for top researchers, underscores the high stakes in this domain. This commitment to securing top-tier talent highlights Meta’s determination to compete with, and perhaps surpass, other industry giants in the AI race. The Strategic Acquisition of an OpenAI Researcher The core of Meta’s recent strategic move is the hiring of Trapit Bansal, a pivotal figure from OpenAI. Bansal’s departure from OpenAI, confirmed by an OpenAI spokesperson and his LinkedIn profile, marks a significant gain for Meta. His tenure at OpenAI since 2022 saw him play a crucial role in pioneering the company’s work on reinforcement learning, a key area for developing sophisticated AI agents. Notably, Bansal is credited as a foundational researcher on OpenAI’s first AI reasoning model , ‘o1’. His expertise in this critical area makes him an invaluable asset for Meta’s burgeoning AI superintelligence lab. This recruitment is a clear indication that Meta is not just building a team, but assembling a powerhouse of leading minds to tackle some of AI’s most complex challenges. Boosting AI Reasoning Models Development What exactly are AI reasoning models , and why are they so crucial? In essence, these models are designed to go beyond pattern recognition, enabling AI to understand, infer, and make logical deductions, much like human cognition. This capability is vital for developing truly intelligent systems that can solve complex problems, understand nuanced language, and interact with the world in a more sophisticated manner. Meta currently does not publicly offer an AI reasoning model as part of its Llama family of open models. Trapit Bansal’s deep experience in this field, particularly with OpenAI’s ‘o1’ model, positions him to offer a significant lift to Meta’s efforts. His insights and foundational knowledge could accelerate Meta’s development of its own advanced reasoning capabilities, potentially giving its Llama models a competitive edge in complex applications and research. The Race for AI Superintelligence Talent The competition for top AI talent is fierce, and Meta’s recent hiring spree reflects the intense global race for AI superintelligence . The company’s new AI unit is not just about one hire; it’s about assembling a dream team. Alongside Bansal, Meta’s superintelligence lab features other prominent leaders, including former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, and Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Gross. This constellation of talent underscores Meta’s ambition to become a dominant force in AI. The willingness to offer substantial compensation packages, reportedly up to $100 million, highlights the premium placed on individuals who can drive innovation in this field. While the specific terms of Bansal’s deal remain undisclosed, his move is indicative of the significant incentives available to top researchers in the current AI landscape. What Trapit Bansal ‘s Move Means for the Industry Trapit Bansal’s transition from OpenAI to Meta carries significant implications for the broader AI industry. For Meta, it represents a substantial gain in expertise, particularly in reinforcement learning and AI reasoning, areas critical for developing next-generation AI. This strengthens Meta’s position in the competitive AI landscape and could accelerate its path towards building more advanced and capable AI models. For OpenAI, while losing a key researcher is a setback, it also highlights the dynamic nature of talent movement within the AI sector. This ongoing shift of top minds between leading companies signifies the intense competition and rapid evolution of the field. It emphasizes that the race for AI dominance is not just about technological breakthroughs but also about securing and nurturing the human capital that drives them. This is a developing story, and its full impact will unfold as Meta’s AI superintelligence unit progresses. Meta’s strategic acquisition of Trapit Bansal is a powerful statement of intent in the escalating AI arms race. By bringing in a foundational researcher with deep expertise in reinforcement learning and AI reasoning models from a leading competitor like OpenAI, Meta is significantly bolstering its pursuit of AI superintelligence. This move, part of a broader aggressive hiring strategy, positions Meta to potentially accelerate its development of advanced AI capabilities, shaping the future of artificial intelligence and its widespread applications. The impact of such talent shifts underscores the critical role of human expertise in driving technological innovation in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

ETF inflows and renewed DeFi interest is spearheading price action, which also impacts the resurgent Aave. Add Remittix into the mix, and you’ve got a trio pushing substance over sizzle. Let’s break down what’s fuelling each project’s next big move. Ethereum (ETH): ETF Inflows and DeFi Buzz Lift Ethereum Price Prediction The Ethereum price predictions are quietly gathering momentum again, and this time it’s not just market noise. The continued inflows into spot ETH ETFs are giving bulls something to lean on—money’s flowing in, not out. Add to that the rising interest in staking and DeFi platforms, and the broader Ethereum ecosystem is feeling more active than it has in months. That’s why the Ethereum price prediction for July is floating around $2,800, with some analysts eyeing $3,000 by mid-August. It’s not moon talk, but it’s a healthy climb powered by real demand. DeFi protocols are coming back to life, TVL is ticking up, and staking yields continue to look solid, even to the TradFi crowd. With new capital entering and use cases finally looking sticky again, the Ethereum price prediction feels much more believable than some of the wilder targets we’ve seen in past cycles. No wild hype—just steady pressure upward. Source: CoinCodex Aave (AAVE): V3 Growth Sparks New Optimism in DeFi While Ethereum price prediction chatter heats up, Aave’s quietly laying down some serious infrastructure. The spotlight here is Aave v3—a major upgrade that’s finally starting to show its teeth. It brings smarter risk controls, more efficient capital usage, and most importantly, seamless cross-chain functionality across Ethereum, Polygon, and Base. In short, it’s not a facelift, it’s an actual evolution. DeFi’s been slow lately, but Aave’s on-chain growth suggests the patient ones are starting to move. Over $900 million in AAVE is now staked, a clear signal that users aren’t just farming and fleeing—they’re committing. And with v3 live across multiple chains, the flexibility for users and builders alike has never been better. It’s not generating meme-level buzz, but under the surface, Aave is waking up. If the broader DeFi sector catches fire again, v3 gives AAVE a serious leg up. It’s something worth keeping an eye on as the 3-month Aave price prediction has the token up over 90%, and that is something to write home about! Source: CoinCodex Remittix (RTX): The Utility Play in a DeFi Comeback While the Ethereum price prediction and Aave upgrades are sparking DeFi excitement, Remittix is quietly carving out a role that’s refreshingly simple—and surprisingly powerful. It’s not chasing APYs or cross-chain wizardry. It’s focused on something DeFi often forgets: usability. Remittix lets you send crypto and have fiat arrive in a bank account—no wallet setup, no bridging tokens, no mental gymnastics. It supports 30+ fiat currencies, runs on flat fees, and was designed from the ground up for compliance. The Remittix pitch is remarkably simple, but it works—and that’s why nearly $16 million has poured into the presale. As hype rotates back toward fundamentals, Remittix is positioned as the kind of project that wins long-term: boring to the moon. In a sea of DeFi tokens promising to reinvent finance, Remittix just wants to make it easier to use. And in this market, that’s a feature, not a flaw. If the next rally rewards functionality over flash, Remittix may not just ride the wave—it might help shape it. Conclusion The Ethereum price prediction is climbing on real momentum, Aave is evolving with serious upgrades, and Remittix is solving problems most projects ignore. In a market shifting back to fundamentals, these three aren’t riding hype—they’re building something sticky. Even YouTube analysts are starting to take notice. Might be time you did too. Remittix is now available at $0.0781 directly from their website.

Here’s What Dragging Ripple Price Down!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-xrp-price-crashing-heres-what-dragging-ripple-price-down/,"The post Why Is XRP Price Crashing? Here’s What Dragging Ripple Price Down! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price is under heavy pressure once again, leaving traders and long-term holders on edge. The latest trigger? A fresh twist in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. This week, Judge Torres rejected a joint motion to settle penalties over Ripple’s alleged securities violations, throwing a wrench into what many hoped was the final chapter. The ruling rekindled legal uncertainty, spooking investors and sending XRP tumbling below key support levels amid already fragile market sentiment. Ripple’s native token, XRP, has taken a hit, plunging below critical support. While the other cryptos are trying to rise above the bearish trend, the XRP price has started the day’s trade on a bearish note after a bearish close. XRP Ledger Activity Collapsed Not only the legal pressure, but the on-chain metrics are also concerning. The latest data shows a major drop in the trading activity, which could be a result of sluggish behavior of the price, followed by uncertain market conditions and global tensions. According to data from Cryptoquant, the daily active addresses have dropped heavily. The trading activity has surged and marked highs, which has assisted the XRP price to rise above $2 for the first time since the 2018 rally. Since then, the price has remained consolidated above $2 while the active addresses continued to plunge, reaching the lower limits. On the other hand, the daily payments on the XRP ledger have also dropped by nearly 70% this month. In the crypto space, lower network activity means there is less global demand. Whether it’s fewer transfers, fewer DeFi interactions, or less developer interest. So, Is XRP Dead? Will the Price Drop Below $2? After a massive rise in November 2024, the price began to trade within a descending parallel channel. It appeared to be a bull flag, but the pennant is extending, indicating a continuation of a consolidation. Besides, the drop in volume also substantiates the bearish trend, which goes in line with the drop in the on-chain readings. Regardless of the drop in the on-chain readings and the uncertainty around the token, the technicals suggest the token is trying to rise above the bearish influence. It has reached the edge of the descending triangle while the RSI is attempting to rise above the descending trend line. On the other hand, the CMF remains stuck within the positive range and is displaying a bullish divergence. This suggests the XRP price is primed for a recovery, but if it fails to hold above the support zone, a pullback to $1.62 is imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 09:52:57

If you want to know where the next 100x might come from, keep reading. PEPE and WIF are climbing while others fall behind PEPE and Dogwifhat (WIF) are both rising while most coins remain flat or decline. PEPE is up almost 10% in a day after hitting around $0.00000837. It now trades close to $0.00001. Analysts say this move was pushed by whales buying the dip. Source: CoinMarketCap comparison of PEPE and WIF For instance, big wallets like Cumberland moved $3.45 million worth of PEPE during the drop. Gustavo Maldonado believes PEPE could hit $0.000035 before the year ends. That’s more than double the current price. WIF is also gaining fast, breaking past its key resistance at $0.78 and hitting $0.86. Volume is rising, and traders are seeing a falling wedge pattern on WIF’s chart. Analyst Jonathan Carter thinks WIF could go up to $1.36, which represents a 58% jump. WIF’s price also got a boost from a new partnership. DeFi Development Corp., a Nasdaq-listed firm, will now run a validator node for the WIF community. It will share the rewards with holders. That kind of move is rare for a meme token and shows that people are taking WIF more seriously now. Shiba Inu can’t break out just yet Unlike PEPE and WIF, Shiba Inu is not moving much. SHIB holds just above $0.000011, but traders say it needs to go past $0.000012 to spark any real momentum. SHIB’s price dipped hard after the US bombed Iran, then bounced back with the news of a ceasefire. Source: TradingView Despite a 17% rebound, SHIB is still far below its May high. IntoTheBlock data shows 26.97% of SHIB holders are now in profit. This is better than before, but most are still at a loss. Technicals are mixed. SHIB shows a golden cross, which is good and the MACD also hints at a comeback. SHIB holders are watching closely, but many are now moving into newer projects with better real-world use. One of those tokens is Remittix . Stealth whales’ purchases fuel Remittix as a 100x potential Remittix ($RTX) is a crypto project built for real-world payments. It lets users send crypto straight to bank accounts, with no FX fees and no long wait times. The platform already supports 30+ fiat currencies and over 100 cryptocurrencies. RTX is in presale, currently priced at $0.0811, a 4x surge from its launch value of $0.0185. But analysts say this is just the start. The token could launch soon at $0.085 and rise to $0.205 or more in two years. That’s close to 100x from early entry levels. So far, it has raised more than $15.8 million. Unlike Shiba Inu or PEPE, Remittix is not based on hype; it’s built around actual use. Businesses can accept crypto payments online and cash out to fiat. Users keep their funds safe and don’t need to swap tokens or move between blockchains. Bonus tokens are going to loyal investors, and $100,000 worth of tokens are being given out through a live campaign. Conclusion Shiba Inu remains a big dog in crypto, but PEPE and WIF are moving faster right now. Meme coins can jump, but they often fall just as fast. Remittix gives something different. It offers a working product, real value and smart rewards. If you’re looking for something with 100x potential and real-world value, Remittix looks like a better choice than SHIB, PEPE or WIF.

Key Takeaways: The Smarter Web Company raised £41.2 million days after buying nearly 197 Bitcoin. Its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have boosted holdings to over 543 BTC in just a month. Despite strong crypto moves, the firm’s shares fell 15% but remain up 274% year-to-date. The firm announced on Thursday that it secured funding from institutional investors through an accelerated bookbuild, a method that enables companies to raise capital quickly without extensive marketing. Of the total funds, £36.27 million ($49.8 million) came from the bookbuild, while an additional £4.97 million ($6.82 million) was raised through subscription. The shares were offered at £2.90 ($3.98) each, with the new stock expected to take effect on July 1. Smarter Web’s Fundraising Fuels Bold Bitcoin Buying Spree The fundraising follows The Smarter Web Company’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Earlier this week, the firm revealed it bought 196.8 BTC at an average price of $103,290, boosting its total Bitcoin holdings to 543.52 BTC—worth approximately $58.19 million. Since launching its Bitcoin treasury strategy in April, the firm has purchased BTC five times in June alone, growing its stash by 460 BTC in less than a month. Despite the crypto push, The Smarter Web Company’s shares have struggled. Trading on the US OTCQB market under the ticker TSWCF, the company’s stock fell 15% on Thursday to close at $3.56 after reaching an intraday low of $3.19, according to Google Finance.

Even with recent volatility, the stock remains up 274% so far in 2025. Meanwhile, other UK firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin bets amid Britain’s unclear regulatory stance on digital assets. On Tuesday, Vinanz, a London-listed Bitcoin treasury company, announced it had acquired 37.72 BTC , bringing its total holdings to nearly 59 BTC. In April, investment firm Abraxas Capital made waves with a Bitcoin purchase exceeding $250 million. VanEck Flags Risks in Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, has voiced fresh concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms, warning that aggressive BTC accumulation could ultimately hurt shareholders. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). To protect investors, he suggested suspending ATM programs if shares trade below 0.95 times NAV for more than 10 consecutive days. He drew parallels with past missteps in the crypto mining sector, where rampant dilution and inflated executive compensation wiped out shareholder value. Sigel pointed to Semler Scientific, a medical technology company that pivoted to Bitcoin in 2024, as a cautionary tale. Despite amassing 3,808 BTC, Semler’s stock has plunged over 45%, dragging its market NAV down to 0.82 times NAV.

Bitcoin Solaris has emerged as one of the most aggressively priced and structurally sound entries of the year. It’s now in Phase 9 of its presale, priced at $9 per token — with a confirmed listing on LBank coming soon and a projected launch valuation of $20. With over $5 million already raised and more than 11,500 wallets participating, BTC-S is now delivering token flow — not just promising it. Nova Mining System Converts Phones Into Earners Forget staking lockups or GPU farms. The Nova App gives users the ability to mine BTC-S using spare CPU and storage on ordinary smartphones. During beta testing, mobile users earned live rewards by participating in validation — no setup required. This works because Bitcoin Solaris runs a hybrid architecture. At the base, it uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity to keep mining decentralized and efficient. On the upper Solaris Layer, it deploys Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-History, and Proof-of-Time to push transactions at tested speeds over 10,000 TPS. The result: mining access built for participation, not exclusivity — and real yield distribution even before the token lists. Token Rewards Are Already Flowing Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t delay rewards. The Casino module is live, giving every verified wallet one free spin daily, with instant payouts in BTC-S. Token rewards are issued directly on Solana during presale and will be migrated 1:1 to the Bitcoin Solaris chain upon mainnet launch. Buyers who enter with $250 or more unlock additional spins, with top-tier purchases eligible for prizes of up to 0.5 BTC. These mechanics are designed to deliver rewards now: Crypto Vlog recently highlighted Bitcoin Solaris as a working economy in a presale shell — built to deliver returns before listing, not after. The Presale Is Fixed, Transparent, and Ending Fast There are 21 million BTC-S tokens total. Of those, just 4.2 million are allocated for presale — across all phases. No additional emissions, unlock schedules, or delayed allocations are waiting to dilute holders after listing. Everyone buys at public pricing — and right now that’s $9. With LBank listing confirmed, price movement is coming. At a $20 projected listing value, current presale entries offer more than 150% return potential before secondary demand even activates. And because rewards are tied to usage, not speculation, the token’s value driver is active user behavior. Fully Audited, Team Verified, Exchange Ready The token contract passed a full audit by Cyberscope . The Nova App engine was audited separately by Freshcoins . The dev team is KYC verified , and the roadmap is already rolling forward. Testnet, dev toolkit, and wallet upgrades are scheduled. A Mining Power Marketplace is in active development. These aren’t theoretical milestones — they’re tracked deliverables, and the buildout is already in motion. BTC-S is transitioning from presale to public exchange launch. Traders moving out of stagnant altcoins like SEI are stepping into a project that already has functioning products, clear token distribution, and a live reward system. This is a defined entry point with demand already forming and utilities in use.

Crypto VC funding usually tracks bullish periods, and has recovered after a couple of slower months. Crypto fundraising is back to levels not seen since 2022, ending the first half of 2025 with expansion, despite some slower months. Deals saw a trend shift, moving to large-scale private rounds and late-stage financing, with more cautious seed rounds. The model of funding a project only to sell tokens to exchanges is being phased out, instead focusing more on late-stage deals. VC funds remained vigilant for opportunities, but this time, the main driver was the rise of platforms with a widely adopted products. In the coming months, some of the high-profile crypto platforms plan to announce new large funding rounds. Some of the major deals include Polymarket , Pump.fun, and Kalshi . The latest deals may yet be included in the statistics for Q2 deals. Recently, World Liberty Fi also closed a $100M inflow from the Aqua 1 fund. June fundraising breaks above $4B Crypto fundraising tracks the general mood on the crypto market. After a relatively slow start to 2025, some months posted peak results. In March, total VC deals expanded to $5B. Even in slower months, VC fundraising was consistently above $1B, though some months included a concentration of large deals. Coinbase Ventures was the leader with nine deals, followed by Pantera Capital leading six funding rounds. Most of the deals were also made in undisclosed international locations, for a total of 70 rounds. The USA only saw 15 deals for the past month. However, those deals were the biggest, raising over $1.79B. Singapore-based projects raised a further $1.09B. Crypto VC deals moved to international locations, but the USA is still the leader in terms of USD value. | Source: Cryptorank A total of 103 rounds in June raised over $4.49B, with the potential for more deals to be added to the bottom line. The absolute record for VC deals is over $6.88B in November 2021, during the first Web3 boom. This time around, VC deals are not led by narrative, but by established use cases and signs of growth from transactions, fees, and liquidity. Projects like EigenCloud were among the significant deals for the past month, raising $70M in a late-stage round. For smaller projects, token sales, airdrops and special events have returned as a viable source of funding. In the past four months, token sales raised consistently over $4B on a monthly basis, tapping crypto natives and whales. In June, a total of 174 sales raised $4.79B, surpassing even the level of large VC rounds. The main source of interest in token sales were again the special campaigns of Binance Wallet and PancakeSwap. For the month of June, most TGE and token sales used those two platforms, achieving the highest returns. Binance Wallet projects posted gains of 483% on average, while PancakeSwap achieved 228.5%. The success of token sales relied on concentrating most of the opportunities on a single platform, having a guaranteed pool of buyers. Most projects have abandoned ICO attempts outside the top platforms, which give them the biggest exposure to liquidity.

Judge Analisa Torres’ decision to deny the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling halted the XRP price recovery as it aimed to breach the nearest resistance level at $2.23. Key Issues Unresolved For Ripple Despite the SEC dropping its appeal, which indicated that the primary legal conflict between the two parties may be reaching a conclusion, Judge Torres’ ruling highlighted that several procedural matters still require resolution, including necessary court approvals. In her judgment, she made it clear that private agreements cannot supersede public court decisions, stating, “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment… They have not come close to doing so here.” Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move — Chart Signals Are Clear In response to the ruling, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to convey that the situation is now back in Ripple’s hands. The executive pointed out that the court has given them two options: either to dismiss their appeal regarding the historic institutional sales or to continue with the appeal. Regardless of the path chosen, Alderoty emphasized that XRP’s legal status as a non-security remains intact, reassuring stakeholders that it is business as usual. Expert Reactions To Torres’ Decision Legal expert Fred Rispoli also weighed in on the implications of the injunction, stating that it would not impact XRP in secondary markets or affect potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings awaiting approval by the SEC. He noted that the injunction is merely a court document and emphasized the low likelihood of Judge Torres calling Ripple and the SEC back into court unless the SEC believes Ripple is violating the terms of the injunction. Rispoli further questioned whether the SEC has the authority to grant Ripple the necessary exemptions to alleviate any restrictions imposed by the injunction, suggesting that such actions fall within the SEC’s executive powers. Ripple has asserted that it has adjusted its operations to align with the court’s findings, particularly regarding its past sales to institutional investors. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Alderoty’s use of the term “historic institutional sales” in his recent statement indicates a shift in how both parties might approach future transactions, signaling a potential settlement that would allow XRP sales to institutions in a manner acceptable to the SEC. XRP Price Could Reach $5 Despite this temporary setback, market analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s future. Crypto analyst CryptoBullet recently noted that XRP’s two-week price chart resembles patterns seen in 2017, including a significant accumulation phase and a potential breakout. With this historical context in mind, the expert predicts a final surge in the XRP price, forecasting new all-time high targets between $4.50 and $5.40 for the cryptocurrency. As of press time, the XRP price has retreated to the $2.08 mark, which is a key support level for bulls anticipating further recovery of the token. In the last 24 hours, XRP has dropped 4.4%, and 10% in the last month. According to CoinGecko data, the XRP price remains 38% below its record high of $3.40.

Just as investors need rapid access to market insights, users of personal cloud services demand seamless interaction with their stored memories. Google Photos, a cornerstone for billions of users managing their precious moments, recently faced a significant challenge with its ambitious new AI-powered search feature. However, Google has now engineered a brilliant solution, demonstrating how innovation can overcome initial hurdles to deliver a truly transformative user experience. This strategic move by Google not only addresses user frustrations but also sets a new benchmark for how we interact with our vast collections of digital memories. Google Photos AI: From Initial Stumbles to Accelerated Success The introduction of “Ask Photos” at Google’s I/O developer conference last year promised a revolutionary way to navigate personal photo collections. Leveraging the power of natural language, users could simply ask questions like, “Show me photos of my dog at the beach last summer,” and expect the AI to deliver. This ambitious leap into advanced Google Photos AI capabilities was met with excitement, but the initial rollout encountered significant roadblocks. Users quickly reported that the feature was not only unreliable but also frustratingly slow, often leaving them waiting while the AI was “thinking.” Jamie Aspinall, a Google Photos product manager, candidly acknowledged these issues on X earlier in June, stating that “Ask Photos isn’t where it needs to be, in terms of latency, quality and ux.” This transparency was followed by a temporary pause in the rollout, a decisive step taken by Google to address the core performance issues. The company committed to bringing back the “speed and recall of the original search,” a promise that has now been delivered with impressive results. The Breakthrough in AI Search: Blending Speed and Intelligence Google’s innovative solution involves a strategic merger of its robust classic search capabilities with the advanced intelligence of its new AI system. In a recent blog post, Google detailed how it’s integrating the best of both worlds into “Ask Photos.” For straightforward queries, such as “beach” or “dogs,” the system now prioritizes the speed of the classic search feature. This ensures that users receive immediate results, mirroring the rapid response they were accustomed to before the AI integration. Simultaneously, the powerful AI search engine continues to work diligently in the background. Its role is to analyze and process more complex, nuanced queries. This dual-layer approach means that users get instant gratification for simple requests while the AI meticulously sifts through their entire collection to provide highly relevant and context-rich results for intricate questions. It’s a seamless blend that optimizes both speed and depth, addressing the core complaints of the initial rollout. Gemini AI’s Enhanced Role: Deeper Understanding, Smarter Results At the heart of this improved functionality lies Google’s cutting-edge Gemini AI . This sophisticated large language model is the engine that allows “Ask Photos” to move beyond simple keyword matching. Gemini’s ability to comprehend the nuances of natural language queries, combined with its capacity to understand the actual content of photos and their associated metadata, is what truly elevates the search experience. Consider a scenario where you search for a “white dog.” The updated system will immediately display a series of initial results, leveraging the speed of classic search. Then, as Gemini AI completes its more in-depth analysis, refined results will appear below the initial set. This secondary layer of results might include introductory text that identifies your dog by name (if you’ve previously tagged it) and even tells you when photos of that specific animal first appeared in your library. This intelligent layering of information provides a much richer and more personalized search outcome, turning a simple query into a comprehensive recall of memories. Mastering Natural Language Search for Your Digital Memories The true power of “Ask Photos” now lies in its ability to interpret and respond to queries phrased in everyday language, making natural language search an intuitive reality for photo management. Users are no longer confined to typing specific keywords or navigating through complex folders. Instead, they can simply articulate what they are looking for, much like they would ask a friend. This user-friendly interface is designed for flexibility. While the AI works to deliver its advanced insights, users retain the option to switch back to the classic search view if they prefer. This ensures that control remains firmly in the hands of the user, catering to different preferences and search habits. The enhanced responsiveness and accuracy mean that finding that specific vacation photo from years ago, or a collection of images featuring a particular person or pet, becomes an effortless task rather than a tedious hunt. Unlocking Superior Digital Photo Organization and Accessibility The successful re-launch of “Ask Photos” represents a significant leap forward in digital photo organization and accessibility. By making it easier and faster to retrieve specific memories, Google Photos transforms a potentially overwhelming digital archive into an easily navigable personal treasure trove. This is particularly beneficial for users with vast libraries accumulated over many years, offering a practical solution to a common digital dilemma. To access this powerful new feature, users must meet a few straightforward eligibility criteria. You must be 18 years or older, and your Google account language must be set to English. Furthermore, it is essential to enable “Face Groups,” the feature that intelligently labels and groups people and pets within your Google Photos library. These requirements ensure the AI has the necessary data and context to deliver the most accurate and personalized search results, truly enhancing the utility of your digital memories. Conclusion: A Brilliant Future for Your Photo Memories Google’s commitment to refining “Ask Photos” has paid off, transforming an initially problematic feature into a powerful and user-friendly tool. By seamlessly integrating the speed of classic search with the profound intelligence of Gemini AI, Google Photos has unlocked a new era of digital memory management. This hybrid approach ensures that users can quickly find simple photos while simultaneously benefiting from the AI’s deep analytical capabilities for more complex queries. The resumed rollout across the U.S. signifies a confident step forward, promising a more intuitive, efficient, and ultimately more enjoyable experience for everyone looking to relive their cherished moments. This evolution not only highlights Google’s dedication to innovation but also reaffirms the immense potential of AI in enhancing our everyday digital lives.

46880757,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72686,1751018455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Ripple (XRP) Maxis Are Turning to This Little-Known $0.03 DeFi Token With 15X Potential,https://timestabloid.com/why-ripple-xrp-maxis-are-turning-to-this-little-known-0-03/,"As traditional DeFi tokens mature, long-time Ripple (XRP) holders are setting their sights on new, stability-focused ecosystems. One of the most talked-about alternatives this summer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a decentralized lending protocol offering both structure and innovation. With plans to issue a fully overcollateralized stablecoin backed by real crypto assets, audited smart contracts, and protocol-level governance, Mutuum is gaining ground with investors seeking dependable yield and capital efficiency. A Telegram group of XRP whales is buzzing with screenshots, showing they’ve all shifted 20–30% of their portfolios into MUTM while it remains under $0.04. They’re calling it “the generational DeFi entry-point.” With exhausted supply and Phase 5 nearing exhaustion, they expect the price to jump directly to $0.50, locking in 1,566% upside. Buying after them means acquiring at a price they willingly left behind. At just $0.03 in its current presale phase, the token is drawing serious attention. Phase 5 is already 50% sold out, and when it closes, the price will rise to $0.035 in Phase 6. For those who act now, this represents a rare window to gain early exposure to a DeFi ecosystem that blends secure collateral systems with passive income opportunities. Mutuum’s Stablecoin Is Built for Trust The cornerstone of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal to the XRP crowd lies in its commitment to a regulated and secure stablecoin framework. Unlike algorithmic models that have faced historical failures, Mutuum’s stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against major assets like ETH. Each unit will be backed by overcollateralized deposits and burned when loans are paid off or liquidated. This ensures that supply will always reflect the system’s health and usage. Issuance will be tightly controlled. Only approved smart contracts or “issuers” will be allowed to mint, and each issuer will be assigned a cap to limit risk. Instead of relying solely on market dynamics, the interest rate for borrowing this stablecoin will be set by governance mechanisms that respond to price fluctuations. This allows the system to adjust in real time and maintain the $1 peg. Arbitrage opportunities will further keep the price in check, creating a feedback loop that rewards active users while protecting platform integrity. What makes this stablecoin structure even more convincing is the CertiK audit behind it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a comprehensive review using manual and static analysis methods, earning a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 76.50. These numbers place it among the more technically vetted DeFi projects, making it easier for conservative investors to explore lending strategies without compromising security. Beyond trust, Mutuum is preparing to enhance performance through Layer-2 integration. Once live, this infrastructure will support high-volume transactions with minimal fees—a critical improvement for both large investors and users executing multiple lending cycles. The platform’s beta version is expected to launch as the token goes live, giving early buyers immediate experience to the core system. Early Entry, Passive Income, and Strong Fundamentals For those looking to generate reliable passive income, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers multiple streams. Lenders will receive mtTokens—on-chain receipts that grow in value as the lending pool earns interest. These mtTokens will also be stakeable in the designated contracts. Whenever the protocol earns revenue, it will use a portion to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This dividend-style model encourages long-term holding and rewards those who help secure platform liquidity. The current opportunity is time-sensitive. With over $11.2 million already raised and more than 12,450 holders, the demand for MUTM tokens is accelerating. Investors today can purchase 100,000 MUTM tokens for just $3,000. At a 15x multiple, that position will be worth $45,000. As the project builds utility around the token—including governance, collateral usage, and staking rights—the case for long-term upside only grows stronger. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a $100,000 giveaway to celebrate its presale supporters. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, reinforcing the project’s strategy to reward its earliest participants. Combined with the upcoming platform launch and stablecoin deployment, these elements point toward an ecosystem built to last. Ripple (XRP) holders have long championed structured, regulatory-compliant systems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning itself with that same ethos—backed by technical trust, real asset support, and a utility-rich token model. For those still on the sidelines, the closing days of Phase 5 will be the last chance to acquire MUTM at this discounted rate.

In 2017, the government declared cryptocurrency illegal and warned against its use. While other countries are pushing forward their crypto regulatory framework, intensifying global competition, Bangladesh took a step back and banned all crypto usage and possession due to the risks of money laundering and financial system instability. Table of contents Were there any Crypto Regulations in Bangladesh? Why is Crypto Banned in Bangladesh? Bangladeshi Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency Crypto Tax in Bangladesh Possibility of Crypto Regulation in Bangladesh Crypto Adoption in Bangladesh End note FAQs Were there any Crypto Regulations in Bangladesh? While there are no crypto regulations in Bangladesh, the country has established some laws for technological development. March 2020- National Blockchain Strategy Released under the guidance of the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) to recognize the crucial importance of emerging technologies such as blockchain. It leverages blockchain technology for various government sectors such as land records, identity systems, and e- governance . Why is Crypto Banned in Bangladesh? In 2014, Bangladesh Bank stated, “anybody caught using the virtual currency could be jailed under the country’s strict anti-money laundering laws.” Due to the potential risk of money laundering and terrorism in finance, the Bangladeshi government banned crypto. The decentralized nature of crypto trading in Bangladesh and the use of anonymous wallets like TRC20 make it difficult for the authorities to monitor transactions and trace the flow of money. Experiencing Ponzi schemes and scams in the cryptocurrency space, such as the MTFE scam , which drew thousands of investors into it and theft their money before vanishing. A few years back, Bangladesh Bank told the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that while owning crypto is not a punishable offence itself but engaging in money laundering or foreign currency violations with crypto must be prosecuted. Bangladeshi Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency Despite the government’s strict decision on crypto ban, there is a thriving underground market where individuals engage in crypto trading, and apps like Binance and KuCoin are easily accessible to them through the Google Play Store for crypto trading. The government resolves this unregulated use of crypto in two ways: When crypto is purchased using credit or debit cards and endorsed in US dollars, banks track the transaction of funds and potentially identify the individuals involved. Another method involves the local agent to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tether in exchange for Bangladeshi national currency (Taka). They charge a small commission on each transaction, making profits while the investors are lured in the process to think it is valued in US dollars. Crypto Tax in Bangladesh While crypto is still a grey area in Bangladesh and no specific tax regime has been enacted for it, the National Board of Revenue in Bangladesh treats cryptocurrency as subject to the general tax laws of the country. The Income Tax Ordinance of 1984 applies to all crypto transactions in Bangladesh. Possibility of Crypto Regulation in Bangladesh There is a mixed reaction to the crypto ban in Bangladesh. While some people choose to avoid it, others urge the government to regulate crypto. Dr B M Mainul Hossain, a professor at Dhaka University, believes banning crypto is not the solution. He stated , “Sitting back and doing nothing is not the answer,” he said. “Cryptocurrency is already used in many countries legally. We should also think about how to monitor and regulate it.” His statement urged the government to start regulating crypto in the country, considering both the risks and the benefits. Crypto Adoption in Bangladesh As crypto is legally banned in the country, pinpointing the exact number of users is impossible. Binance, a crypto platform, reported that it has more than 600,000 Bangladeshi users on its platform. It indicates, if one platform has such a massive number of crypto users in the country, the total number must be significant. End note Despite the crypto ban in the country, people are using it from different sites, including crypto platforms, exchanges, gambling sites, and anonymous wallets, all of which are difficult to trace. It is crucial to question if crypto is banned in the country, then why are such platforms still available for illegal use? The government aims to focus on safeguarding the nation’s financial stability, but it seems impossible to accomplish while people engage in illicit crypto activities.

The SEC lawsuit, initially filed in December 2020, accuses Ripple Labs of conducting an unregistered securities offering worth $1.3 billion, placing immense pressure on XRP’s valuation and investor sentiment. Despite Ripple’s strategic moves, including the significant acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road intended to bolster institutional adoption, XRP remains trapped in regulatory limbo. Prices linger precariously near critical support levels, leaving investors increasingly nervous about the coin’s future and cautious about long-term holdings. Influencers such as Egrag Crypto maintain a degree of optimism, frequently highlighting technical analyses that suggest the potential for dramatic price increases should Ripple emerge victorious or reach a favorable settlement. Yet seasoned professionals like attorney Bill Morgan caution about ongoing risks and prolonged legal battles, emphasizing the potential for delays that could extend well into late 2026 or beyond. This uncertain timeline amplifies investor anxieties, creating a volatile environment for XRP holders and traders alike. The alluring prospect of massive gains starkly contrasts with the grim reality of potential regulatory setbacks, leaving XRP’s fate uncertain and highly speculative.

CEO Brian Armstrong has revealed that the crypto exchange is now purchasing Bitcoin every single week, strengthening its position in the ongoing race among institutions to stock up on BTC. The exchange currently holds $995 million worth of Bitcoin, making it the 10th-largest corporate holder. Armstrong has also encouraged investors to “go long” on Bitcoin, signaling strong confidence in its future as prices inch closer to a new all-time high. We're buying more Bitcoin every week. Long #Bitcoin https://t.co/LleWBXGYTG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 26, 2025 From Maximalism to Multi-Token Strategy Coinbase launched in 2012 with a Bitcoin-only focus. Back then, Armstrong dismissed altcoins like XRP and Stellar (XLM) as distractions. In a now-deleted tweet from 2014, he claimed Bitcoin was “way far ahead” of the rest – reflecting a clear Bitcoin-maxi mindset at the time. That changed in 2016 when Coinbase added support for Ethereum. Then in 2018, it expanded even further by enabling ERC-20 tokens. During the bull run, the platform added nearly 100 new tokens in just one year. This shift drew criticism from Bitcoin purists who accused Coinbase of chasing trends instead of staying true to BTC. Michael Saylor Cheers Coinbase’s Bitcoin Surge! MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, whose company leads all others in Bitcoin holdings, praised Coinbase’s weekly purchases with a rocket emoji, showing his support for Armstrong’s move. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 27, 2025 Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey also backed the decision, calling Armstrong the “G.O.A.T.” for doubling down on Bitcoin in such a bold and consistent way. Can Coinbase Catch Up to MicroStrategy? Right now, Coinbase holds 9,270 BTC, while MicroStrategy holds a massive 592,345 BTC. While Armstrong’s commitment to buy weekly is significant, consistency will be key if Coinbase hopes to narrow the gap. In terms of value, Coinbase’s holdings stand at $995 million, while MicroStrategy’s are worth about $33 billion. It’s a big difference but if Coinbase keeps buying aggressively, that could start to shift over time Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Grows Coinbase’s weekly BTC purchases reflect a growing trend: institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a way to preserve long-term value.

The decision , filed on June 26, effectively keeps the door open for further appeals and delays a final resolution. Within hours of the ruling, XRP fell from $2.16 to $2.09, erasing more than $5 billion in market capitalization in under 24 hours. At $123.62 billion, it now holds the dubious distinction of posting the biggest single-day drop among the top 40 digital assets and becoming the most trending crypto asset between Thursday and Friday, according to CoinMarketCap . XRP market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap But while short-term sentiment has clearly taken a hit, not all observers believe the verdict spells trouble for XRP’s longer-term ambitions, particularly regarding a U.S.-listed spot XRP ETF. Lawyer weight in on XRP ETF Fred Rispoli, a legal commentator and vocal supporter of Ripple, argues that the ruling, though headline-grabbing, is unlikely to affect XRP’s standing on secondary markets, which is what ultimately matters for ETF eligibility. SEC v. Ripple Update: This is a long post on my thoughts here but the TLDR is: ""Welcome to the new SEC, for now more or less the same as the last one."" And: Ripple and SEC will settle the appeal for the reduced, agreed upon amount and leave the Torres judgment in place, while the… https://t.co/9y9o4M4uBW — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 26, 2025 “Regarding that injunction, it doesn’t affect $XRP on the secondary markets nor will it impact XRP ETF approvals,” Rispoli explained. “And remember, the injunction is just a piece of paper issued by a court… it only substantively matters if the SEC wants it to matter.” In legal terms, Judge Torres’ injunction could theoretically give the court grounds to revisit the case if Ripple is found violating institutional sale restrictions. However, Rispoli emphasized that the SEC would need to actively push for enforcement, an outcome he describes as “extremely low probability.” He also hinted at a broader shift in regulatory posture, suggesting that both Ripple and the SEC may be quietly negotiating a reduced penalty and new guidelines for Ripple’s institutional sales. Such a move would preserve the substance of the Torres ruling while avoiding further escalation. The bigger unknown now lies with the SEC’s leadership. With the commission under political pressure to soften its stance on digital assets, and following the installation of a new Chair under President Trump, there’s growing speculation that an XRP ETF could still move forward, particularly given the rising tide of crypto ETF approvals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even altcoin ETFs in the pipeline.

Moreover, the upcoming years are expected to be bullish, with a conservative momentum. With an optimistic outlook, we expect the AVAX coin price to reach $50 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $12.36 $30.91 $49.46 Avalanche Price Target July 2025 The price prediction for Avalanche (AVAX) in July 2025 suggests that if bulls regain control and move past short-term EMA hurdles, then AVAX could rally back to the $26.50 resistance level. In a more optimistic scenario, if the 200-day EMA is also flipped, then prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3 2025, only if momentum remains strong. However, if momentum doesn’t sustain above the 200-day EMA, then momentum could rise for a brief time, and AVAX might retreat to $20 or $15 support in that upcoming short-term scenario. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) AVAX Price Target July 2025 15.00 26.50 33.06 AVAX Price Prediction 2025 Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining traction among developers, thanks to its high throughput and low fees, making it an attractive platform for gaming applications. Looking ahead, there’s a promising outlook for the AVAX price in 2025. A Bloomberg ETF analyst recently suggested that an AVAX ETF could receive approval by the end of the year, with a 90% chance of success. This potential approval could significantly boost adoption and drive prices higher. Meanwhile a look at its daily technical chart reveals that after a challenging Q1 2025, where AVAX dropped to $14.65, the price showed some recovery in Q2, climbing to $26.50 by mid-May. However, by the end of Q2, it retreated to around $16, facing strong resistance from the 200-day EMA band. From its peak of $55.86 in H2 2024, AVAX is down 68%, marking H1 2025 as a bearish period. The decline from mid-May’s high represents a 33% drop. Interestingly, the $15-$16 support area has been tested three times in Q2, indicating that bearish pressure is weakening at this level. This is increasing investors hopes for H2 to be better than H1. Therefore, if bulls regain control, a short-term rally could push AVAX back to the $26.50 resistance by July 2025. In a more bullish scenario, prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3. For the long term, a price target of $50 is feasible, provided that AVAX maintains above $26.50 and closes daily above this level. Achieving this would signal a shift in trend, breaking the bearish pattern and indicating a Change of Character (ChoCh) followed by an upward Break of Structure (BoS). However, this bullish outlook could be overturned if a strong bearish activity stops $26.50 breach then AVAX will have no choice to retreat back to $15 demand area.

With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algo Price Target July 2025 The price prediction for Algorand (ALGO) in July 2025 suggests that if the $0.15 support level holds strong, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.24 mark. However, the breach of $0.15 could pull ALGO price lower. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.09 0.15 0.24 Algorand Price Prediction 2025 The last time a surge in Algorand price was seen was in Q4 2024, it reached a high of $0.613, which marked a 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. But, in Q4 2024, the final month sell-off intensified, stretching into Q1 2025, the price of Algorand fell drastically to a low of $0.1491 by the first week of April, which is a multi-year strong support area for the ALGO price. However, the situation from the second week of April changed as the chart showed a higher-high structure, showcasing that the ALGO price started to recover from the very same multi-year support area. By mid-May Algorand price climbed almost 70% to $0.24 from Q2’s low of $0.150. But, the advance stopped mid-May onwards, as strong supply levels rejected the ascent, pushing the price below 200 day EMA band. In June’s final week, the price came back to April’s low and took support from $0.15 support area. The algorand price is down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% down from mid-may’s high, if short-term bearish elevates then ALGO price might meet 2024’s low of $0.0943, but if the $0.15 level meets strong demand, then it might aim for a retest of the $0.24 mark in July 2025. Moreover, looking at the long-term perspective, if demand increases directly proportional to adoption at an unprecedented rate, then ALGO might clear the targets such as the $0.50 and $0.60 mark, and even hit $0.90 by the end of the year. These targets may sound big compared to its current price at the moment, but on zooming out to the monthly chart. The last three years are a clearly range-bound sideways chart compared to 2021’s high-strength parabolic one.

Institutional accumulation has long been active, with major players snapping up digital assets on any perceived dip. But what is now turning heads is the return of retail capital. Wallet activity and order book data show that individuals are re-entering the market alongside the institutions. This convergence is important. Historically, major rallies have often emerged when both institutional capital and grassroots enthusiasm move in the same direction. Bitcoin’s Scarcity Deepens as Global Institutions Continue Stacking The data is unambiguous: Bitcoin supply on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level ever recorded . This metric alone speaks volumes. It means fewer coins are available for trading and more are being tucked away into long-term storage. Investors, from individuals to multinationals, are not only holding; they are accumulating. Japan’s Metaplanet also made headlines by acquiring over 1,200 more BTC , raising its total holdings past Tesla’s. With more than 12,000 Bitcoin in reserve, it now ranks among the top corporate holders globally, just behind major mining firms. Meanwhile, the United States, once cautious, has turned its seized Bitcoin stash into a sovereign hedge fund of sorts. Over 200,000 coins now sit on the federal books, with further plans in motion to grow this reserve without touching taxpayer funds. BREAKING: 🇮🇳 BJP’s national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari ( @pradip103 ) highlights importance of #Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. pic.twitter.com/H5YcUJONQf — Crypto India (@CryptooIndia) June 26, 2025 What’s happening here isn’t a string of isolated purchases. Bhutan has quietly built a billion-dollar Bitcoin treasury through surplus hydropower. Pakistan has formalized its own crypto holdings. China, once infamous for its bans, now shows signs of opening up to digital assets in the financial sector. Even India, which has been long ambiguous in its crypto policy, is seeing top party officials call for a national reserve. None of these moves are short-term plays. They reflect a strategic shift in how nations and institutions are preparing for the future of finance. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and independence from central banks, is no longer treated as an experiment. It is being absorbed into portfolios, treasury sheets, and even sovereign policy as a safeguard against inflation, currency volatility, and economic shocks. This level of bullish sentiment and buying across the globe directly suggests a growing interest in potential adoption, making it one of the best periods to accumulate top projects that could turn out to be top gainers in the coming weeks or months. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Buying Intensifies Globally Best Wallet Token At a time when crypto ownership is becoming more widespread and investor profiles are diversifying, the tools that manage and protect digital assets are no longer just accessories. They are infrastructure. The Best Wallet Token fits squarely into this narrative, offering actual utility for a new generation of crypto users who demand both ease of use and layered protection. The token is built into a larger platform that aims to bridge the gap between wallet simplicity and advanced ecosystem access. Holders of the token get more than fee reductions or cosmetic perks. They gain access to curated airdrops, cross-chain swaps, staking modules, and early access to partner launches. In an environment where new users are entering the space and institutional flows are mounting, the need for an intelligent, incentivized wallet layer becomes critical. The Best Wallet platform does not try to reinvent what a wallet is, but rather redefines what a wallet can offer. Thanks to all this, the presale has already raised upwards of $13 million. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 In markets where both volatility and opportunity surge side by side, that extra layer of utility matters more than ever. Whether or not Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, the infrastructure supporting user entry points will remain in high demand. The Best Wallet Token, then, is not just tied to speculative value but to the expansion of user access itself. With the world preparing for broader adoption, smart access layers like this may be one of the few categories that can grow regardless of which tokens dominate the headlines. SUBBD As more capital enters the market and new cohorts of investors begin exploring how crypto can fit into real-world models, the role of creator-driven platforms is getting redefined. SUBBD is not merely trying to replicate what other social dApps or decentralized media hubs have done. It functions as a full-stack platform that gives content creators and curators actual ownership, while also engineering a model that incentivizes quality through tokenized patronage. The architecture of SUBBD allows for tiered monetization, reputation-building, and interactive sponsorships, but all of it happens without the platform taking control of either the audience or the revenue. This is what makes it distinct. As more capital flows into Bitcoin and institutional players begin looking for assets with measurable social stickiness, platforms like SUBBD emerge as a new kind of asset class. They are not tied to volatility or hash rates, but to user engagement and cultural currency. And because SUBBD’s model is designed around direct creator-to-audience monetization with transparent reward loops, its growth potential aligns with both the macro rise in content spending and the micro-behavior of users seeking alternative platforms. As this market matures, creator-led economies will likely command greater relevance, and projects that have already structured themselves to function natively within these systems will have a head start. In that sense, SUBBD is not chasing trends; it is laying the groundwork for a creative economy that can flourish regardless of which coins are rallying. Snorter Snorter enters a category that often gets dismissed too quickly. It is built on a meme aesthetic, operates on Solana, and interacts with real-time trading. But under the surface, the architecture of Snorter is anything but trivial. It functions as a meme-trading robot designed for users who want speed, reflexive order execution, and access to social signals without having to rely on large terminals or manual inputs. Snorter’s appeal lies in the fact that it mirrors what the most successful meme coin traders already do: identify early momentum, lean into social virality, and move funds quickly. However, it removes the friction and guesswork by using algorithmic routing and real-time triggers. As meme culture deepens its role in defining the speculative edges of crypto markets, tools like Snorter begin to carry real value. More than just a bot, it is a behavioral model distilled into executable code. And in a cycle where both retail and institutional players are showing interest, Snorter offers a method of interacting with momentum markets that neither relies on sustained hype nor depends on sophisticated onboarding. For traders who want to stay agile without spending hours glued to charts, it becomes a functional companion. The project has already been endorsed by top crypto YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins , adding to its existing popularity further. With Solana's low latency and Snorter’s smart integration of sentiment and volume signals, it quietly sets a new benchmark for how meme tokens can be tracked, traded, and navigated. If this market stays hot, Snorter becomes a serious edge, not a novelty. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper exists to answer a question that has lingered for over a decade: can Bitcoin become more than just a store of value without compromising its core principles? The project’s answer is not theoretical. It is operational. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper introduces a true Layer 2 experience for BTC that does not rely on custodians, shortcuts, or abstractions. Instead, it allows Bitcoin to be bridged into a high-speed environment where fees are negligible, finality is near-instant, and smart contract functionality is unlocked. This transforms Bitcoin from a passive asset into an active network, capable of hosting DeFi, supporting micro-payments, enabling staking, and running dApps. In a climate where both institutional and retail investors are accumulating Bitcoin with the expectation of long-term relevance, Bitcoin Hyper proposes a model where that relevance includes functionality. It does not replace BTC. It extends it. Investors who already believe in Bitcoin’s scarcity model now have a way to explore its utility without converting to another chain. This becomes even more significant when viewed through the lens of the broader crypto momentum currently underway. With countries building strategic reserves and institutions treating Bitcoin as financial infrastructure, any solution that can unlock new layers of use while preserving Bitcoin’s foundation becomes inherently valuable. Bitcoin Hyper’s architecture ensures that the original chain remains untouched, but its potential is no longer gated. It is not just a faster version of Bitcoin, but also one that finally begins to move. Conclusion Both institutional giants and everyday investors are now actively accumulating Bitcoin and other digital assets. This convergence signals not just optimism, but confidence in a longer-term shift toward crypto integration at every level, from national reserves to individual portfolios. In such a climate, identifying projects with actual utility becomes essential. The tokens mentioned above are not speculative flashes. They represent infrastructure, innovation, and cultural alignment with where this market is heading. With accumulation already underway, this moment offers a strategic entry point before broader adoption drives valuations sharply upward.

46886186,https://invezz.com/?p=2780638,1751024168,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Helium price forecast as Coinbase suspends Helium MOBILE trading,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/27/helium-price-forecast-as-coinbase-suspends-helium-mobile-trading/,"The Helium ecosystem is under renewed pressure after Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, officially suspended trading for the deprecated Helium Mobile (MOBILE) token, triggering a sharp selloff across related assets. The move, which had been announced in late May , has taken effect and immediately sparked concerns among investors about the broader implications for Helium’s native token, HNT, and its long-term market stability. Coinbase ends support for MOBILE On June 26, Coinbase confirmed via its @CoinbaseAssets handle that trading for MOBILE, along with Render (RNDR), Ribbon Finance (RBN), and Synapse (SYN), has been disabled. Coinbase Assets 🛡️ @CoinbaseAssets · Follow We have disabled trading for MOBILE, RNDR, RBN, & SYN. Your funds will remain accessible to you, and you will continue to have the ability to withdraw your funds at any time. 9:06 PM · Jun 26, 2025 169 Reply Copy link Read 27 replies According to the company, the decision followed a routine asset review, which found that the older versions of these tokens no longer met Coinbase’s listing standards due to ecosystem upgrades and protocol transitions. While most exchanges had already converted the deprecated Solana-based MOBILE token into HNT following the implementation of HIP 13 earlier this year, Coinbase delayed the process, leaving some users confused about the token’s status. That confusion has now translated into market volatility, with both MOBILE and HNT experiencing significant price drops as traders digested the implications of the delisting. Selling pressure hits Helium tokens Shortly after the suspension was confirmed, MOBILE’s price plunged to a daily low of $0.00026 on June 27, down nearly 88% from its December 2024 peak of $0.0021. Although it rebounded slightly to $0.00027 at press time, sentiment remains weak, and the token appears to be struggling under the weight of bearish momentum. The ripple effect was felt across the Helium ecosystem, as HNT fell over 5% alongside a similar drop in the IOT token, reflecting spreading uncertainty among investors. Market data from CoinGlass showed that open interest in Helium’s derivatives market dropped by 16% within 24 hours, indicating that traders were closing out positions amid the turmoil. At the same time, the long-short ratio leaned bearish, and on-chain activity revealed increasing transfers of HNT to centralised exchanges; a classic sign of growing sell-side pressure. HNT’s price has slipped below key support As of June 27, HNT was trading at $2.19, down 2.4% in 24 hours and nearly 42% over the past month, based on the latest data from crypto trackers. The price had broken below its previous support level of $2.308, a critical zone that now flips into a resistance level, signalling weak price stability and diminished buyer confidence. Technically, HNT has entered a descending channel pattern, which typically suggests a continuation of downward price movement unless disrupted by strong buying interest or a market catalyst. The Supertrend indicator has flipped above the current price, reinforcing the bearish outlook, highlighting a decline in upward momentum. If the bearish structure holds, analysts expect the HNT token to test the next major support level near $2.00, with a deeper drop toward $1.80 possible in a high-volume liquidation scenario. Nevertheless, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart, which has fallen below 30 into the overbought region, has risen slightly to above 33, signalling some slight market relief from the bear pressure. Helium price chart| Source: TradingView Neymar partnership speculation offers a lifeline Despite the short-term headwinds, Helium’s development team recently teased a possible collaboration with Brazilian football superstar Neymar, a move that could help reinvigorate attention and confidence in the project. Although details remain scarce, even limited endorsements or promotional activity from a figure of Neymar’s global stature could serve as a powerful narrative shift at a time when Helium’s credibility is under pressure. Still, until concrete updates emerge, the market appears focused on the fallout from Coinbase’s decision and the broader question of how Helium will stabilise its token economy going forward. Helium price forecast With its current market cap standing at $402 million and circulating supply nearing 184 million tokens, HNT still has a solid foundation, but short-term sentiment remains cautious. The key question now is whether Helium can restore investor confidence through network growth, adoption, or partnerships strong enough to reverse the current bearish trend. Until then, traders will likely continue to tread carefully, watching technical levels and ecosystem developments for any signs of a sustained recovery.

46885162,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756417,1751024192,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46885162.jpeg,'Teapot' refineries & ghost tankers: China's playbook for dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran oil,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-dodges-u-s-iran-oil-sanctions/,"China has quietly ramped up its imports of Iranian oil, using shadowy shipping tactics and independent “teapot” refineries to work around aggressive U.S. sanctions, according to data provided by CNBC. Despite the sanctions aimed at cutting off Tehran’s cash pipeline, oil has kept flowing. China nearly doubled its Iranian crude intake to 17.8 million barrels per day in 2024 compared to 2022, based on figures from ship-tracking firm Kpler. The first five months of this year alone saw consistent inflows of 6.8 million barrels per day, unchanged from the same stretch in 2024. Since July 2022, China’s customs data has shown zero crude arriving from Iran. That’s fake. The oil’s still coming, just under the radar. Most of it doesn’t even look like it came from Iran anymore by the time it reaches shore. Instead, tankers shuffle it across oceans, switch vessels mid-route, hide their location signals, and wipe the paper trail clean. Teapots handle crude, state firms stay out The buyers? Not the big boys. China’s small independent refiners—nicknamed teapots—are leading this game. State-owned and large private refiners still avoid sanctioned Iranian crude, but teapots are scooping it up. They buy it “delivered,” meaning the Iranian sellers handle all transport. That way, the Chinese refiners don’t get tangled up in maritime sanctions. “The physical market has not seen any long-term impact to the flow of Iranian oil,” said Brian Leisen, global energy strategist at RBC Capital Markets. These teapots don’t even need to ask where the oil comes from. By the time it reaches China , the barrels have been passed from ship to ship—often near the Strait of Malacca or the Middle East Gulf—and the original documents are switched. “If the cargo gets transported from ship to ship, it is not easy to trace once documents are switched,” said Punit Oza, president of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers. That’s why China’s stats show nothing—because technically, it didn’t come from Iran. But they’re not just hiding the papers. Tankers are also spoofing their location data. They broadcast fake GPS signals, pretending to be in one spot when they’re actually moving crude elsewhere. That way, it’s harder to connect a specific cargo with its true origin. “I’ve seen a lot of tankers spoofing their location off Malaysia recently,” said Bridget Diakun, senior risk and compliance analyst at Lloyd’s List Intelligence. She described that area, east of Peninsula Malaysia, as a “hot spot for Iranian oil.” China pays in yuan, dodges dollar-based systems Then there’s the payment game. Buyers in China are using renminbi—not U.S. dollars—to pay for the oil. These transactions flow through small banks that are already on the U.S. sanctions list , keeping China’s major banks clean. No dollar means no involvement in SWIFT, the dollar-dominated global payments network. That’s the point. “Because there is no dollar exposure, being excluded from the SWIFT payments systems does not pose a large impediment for oil flows to continue,” Brian added. The oil is undercutting everyone. In 2023, Iranian Light crude sold for $6 to $7 less than the UAE’s Upper Zakum grade, which has the same quality but no sanctions. At about $64 per barrel, the discount is enough to draw in teapots that don’t care where the oil’s been, as long as it’s cheap. “Iranian Light was traded at about $6 to $7 cheaper,” said Muyu Xu, senior oil analyst at Kpler. Despite all the pressure from Washington, the cash is still rolling into Tehran. Iran earned around $70 billion from petroleum and petrochemical exports in 2023, based on numbers from the U.S. Congress. And most of that went through China. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in May that around 90% of Iran’s oil exports still end up in China. Now, even with U.S. President Donald Trump back in the White House, the tone has shifted. Earlier this week, he posted on Truth Social that China could keep buying Iranian oil. That shook the oil markets, sending U.S. crude prices down 6%. Later, a White House official told CNBC that Trump’s comment doesn’t mean sanctions are being lifted. Still, Xu saw that statement as a “calculated trade-off.” She said it could be an attempt to get Iran to respect the ceasefire and restart nuclear talks, while also offering “goodwill” to China ahead of more trade negotiations. “It is now too early to say whether this points to a potential waiver on Iranian sanctions,” she added. But no one’s waiting. Not the oil traders. Not the teapots. Not even Iran. “While there is still no clear conclusion for Iran despite ceasefire, for the physical oil market, we expect oil exports to continue as usual,” Brian said. Speaking at a NATO summit, Trump also said Iran will “need money to put that country back into shape.” That has people wondering whether his “maximum pressure” campaign is slowly getting shelved—even if the sanctions still stand on paper.

According to a compelling DappRadar report , as cited by Cointelegraph, AI-related activity on various blockchains has skyrocketed by a staggering 86% since the beginning of 2025. This dramatic increase translates into approximately 4.5 million daily unique active wallets (DUAWs) now engaging with AI decentralized applications (dApps). Imagine the sheer volume of users and transactions happening every single day, all powered by the synergy of AI and blockchain! This isn’t just about more people using AI dApps; it reflects a maturing ecosystem where AI functionalities are becoming integral to blockchain utility. From enhanced DeFi protocols to more immersive gaming experiences and sophisticated data management, AI is proving to be the catalyst for the next wave of blockchain innovation. The fusion of these two transformative technologies promises a future of greater automation, intelligence, and efficiency across various industries. Here’s a quick look at the key metrics: 86% Increase: Growth in AI-related activity on blockchains since Jan 1, 2025. 4.5 Million DUAWs: Daily unique active wallets interacting with AI dApps. $1.39 Billion: Funds raised by AI agent projects year-to-date. 9.4% Rise: Increase in funding for AI agent projects compared to 2024. What the DappRadar Report Reveals About AI’s Crypto Footprint The detailed findings within the DappRadar report offer a deeper understanding of this burgeoning sector. Beyond just user activity, the report highlights significant investment flowing into projects at the intersection of AI and blockchain. Specifically, AI agent projects have collectively raised an impressive $1.39 billion so far this year. This represents a substantial 9.4% increase compared to the funding secured throughout all of 2024. What does this mean for the broader crypto landscape? It signifies strong investor confidence in the long-term potential of decentralized AI solutions. These aren’t just speculative investments; they are backing foundational technologies that could power the next generation of internet services. The rise of AI agents, which are autonomous programs designed to perform tasks on behalf of users or other programs, points to a future where intelligent automation is not only possible but also decentralized and transparent thanks to blockchain. This report from DappRadar serves as a crucial barometer, indicating that the market is rapidly embracing AI as a core component of its growth strategy. It’s a clear signal that the synergy between AI and blockchain is not a passing trend but a fundamental evolution of the digital economy. Exploring the Potential of Crypto AI: Beyond the Hype The term Crypto AI might sound like a buzzword, but its practical applications are already making waves. Imagine AI algorithms optimizing DeFi yields, AI-powered bots enhancing trading strategies, or AI-driven content generation platforms built on immutable ledgers. The possibilities are vast and transformative. Here are just a few areas where Crypto AI is making a significant impact: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): AI can analyze vast amounts of on-chain data to identify optimal liquidity pools, predict market movements, and automate complex financial operations, making DeFi more efficient and accessible. Gaming and Metaverse: AI can create dynamic non-player characters (NPCs), generate unique in-game assets, and even power entire virtual economies, leading to more immersive and responsive gaming experiences. Data Analytics and Oracles: AI can process and interpret off-chain data, feeding it securely to smart contracts via decentralized oracles, enabling more intelligent and context-aware dApps. Autonomous Agents: As highlighted by the funding trends, AI agents are gaining traction. These autonomous entities can execute tasks, manage assets, and even interact with other agents on a blockchain, paving the way for truly self-sovereign digital entities. The core benefit lies in combining AI’s analytical power with blockchain’s trust, transparency, and immutability. This fusion enables new business models, enhances security, and opens up unprecedented avenues for innovation that were previously unimaginable within centralized systems. Navigating the Landscape of Web3 AI dApps The explosion in daily active wallets interacting with Web3 AI dApps indicates a growing user base that is discovering the practical utility of these integrated technologies. These dApps are not just theoretical constructs; they are live applications offering real-world value. But what exactly defines a Web3 AI dApp, and how do they differ from traditional AI applications? Decentralization: Unlike centralized AI services that run on proprietary servers, Web3 AI dApps often leverage decentralized networks for computation, data storage, and model training, reducing single points of failure and censorship risks. Transparency and Auditability: The use of blockchain ensures that the logic, data, and outcomes of AI models can be transparently recorded and audited, fostering trust and accountability. Tokenomics Integration: Many Web3 AI dApps incorporate native tokens to incentivize participation, reward data providers, or facilitate governance, creating new economic models around AI services. User Ownership: Users often retain greater control over their data and AI models within a Web3 context, aligning with the ethos of digital sovereignty. While the potential is immense, challenges remain. Scalability is a key hurdle, as running complex AI computations on a blockchain can be resource-intensive. Data privacy also needs careful consideration, especially when AI models are trained on sensitive information. Furthermore, establishing ethical guidelines for decentralized AI is paramount to ensure responsible development and deployment. The Rise of AI Agent Projects and Future Investment Trends The significant capital influx into AI agent projects underscores a strong belief in their transformative potential. These aren’t just software programs; they are autonomous entities designed to interact with the blockchain and potentially the real world, based on predefined rules and AI-driven decision-making. Consider the implications: Automated Transactions: AI agents could manage crypto portfolios, execute trades based on real-time market analysis, or even participate in DAO governance. Decentralized Services: Agents could provide services like data verification, content moderation, or supply chain optimization, all without human intervention. Self-Sovereign AI: The concept of AI agents owning their data, reputation, and even crypto assets is emerging, leading to truly independent digital entities. This trend suggests that future investments will likely focus on infrastructure supporting AI agents, such as specialized blockchains for AI computation, decentralized data marketplaces, and tools for agent development and deployment. For investors, identifying projects that are building robust, scalable, and ethically sound AI agent frameworks could yield significant returns. For developers, the opportunity to build the next generation of autonomous Web3 services is ripe for exploration. The confluence of AI and blockchain is not merely about technological integration; it’s about creating entirely new paradigms for ownership, automation, and value creation in the digital realm. The rapid growth we’re witnessing is just the beginning of a profound transformation. A New Horizon: The Fusion of Intelligence and Decentralization The dramatic 86% surge in AI activity on blockchains in 2025, as highlighted by the DappRadar report, paints a clear picture: the future of digital interaction is intelligent and decentralized. With millions of daily active wallets engaging with Web3 AI dApps and significant capital flowing into AI agent projects, the synergy between AI and blockchain is rapidly moving from theoretical promise to tangible reality. This powerful combination is not just enhancing existing applications but creating entirely new possibilities, from smarter DeFi to autonomous digital entities. As this sector continues its explosive growth, it promises to redefine our understanding of digital ownership, automation, and the very fabric of the internet. The journey has just begun, and the potential is truly boundless. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping AI blockchain innovation .

Liquidity continues to drop on a sequential basis with negative free cash flow during the first quarter coming in at $101 million. A $23.5 million private placement of convertible debentures post-period has extended BKKT's liquidity profile, but the company remains a sell. Bakkt ( BKKT ) is pivoting into buying and holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) on its balance sheet as part of an updated investment policy that could also see the embattled crypto firm allocate capital in other digital assets. Investing in BTC as part of a corporate treasury strategy has been all the rage in 2025, popularized by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). The ongoing BTC rally has sparked a rush of companies emulating MSTR. BKKT's push into BTC as corporate treasury distracts from its underlying operations and ramping negative free cash flow profile that has dramatically slimmed its liquidity and threatens to push the company into further angst. I last covered BKKT in February with a sell rating, the stock has dipped nearly 10% since then and is set to go lower. BKKT held total cash, short-term investments, and restricted cash of $44.5 million as of the end of its fiscal 2025 first quarter. Removing the restricted cash component of this would place BKKT's short-term liquidity at a more than 3-year low, as negative free cash flow continues to compound angst. Data by YCharts Hence, the move to BTC as a treasury seems out of place with the company's ability to maintain normal operations from its existing liquidity balance. BKKT recorded first-quarter revenue of $1.07 billion , up 25.2% over its year-ago comp on the back of larger crypto services revenues even as revenues from loyalty services dipped. BKKT's crypto services segment is an intensely low-margin business with gross profit of just $11.12 million realized on its portion of revenue. Net income for the first quarter was positive at $7.7 million, up from a loss of $8.17 million in the year-ago period. Bulls would be right to flag that earnings per share (""EPS"") at $1.13 was a material improvement from negative EPS of $1.86 a year ago, with the commons now trading hands for a 2.86x multiple to annualized first quarter EPS. This would be a steal if BKKT could sustain EPS at its current level. Bakkt Holdings Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Form 10-Q Cash Flow, Liquidity, And Risk While BKKT generated positive EPS for the first quarter, the company's free cash flow during the first quarter was negative at $101 million, a deterioration from positive free cash flow of $36.6 million a year ago. The material change in cash flow came from a negative $76.5 million movement in customer funds available and a $32 million loss from changes in the fair value of warrant liability. The overall pace of free cash flow is materially unsustainable and BKKT needs to raise more cash. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was negative at $162 million, in excess of BKKT's total short-term liquidity balance. This has materially expanded doubts about the ability of BKKT to continue as a going concern. Data by YCharts Hence, the shift to BTC as a treasury could be partially viewed through the lens of BKKT pushing to catch some of the euphoric animal spirits that have propelled some crypto-related tickers to new highs this year and sparked a rush of IPOs. Newly listed Circle ( CRCL ) was up 10x from its IPO price at its peak with crypto exchange Gemini and Peter Thiel-backed Bullish filing to go public on the back of the raging enthusiasm for crypto firms. BKKT has since been able to raise $23.75 million through a private placement of convertible debentures. The debentures will mature after just one year and accrue interest at an annual rate of 0%. The deal will mean the non-restricted portion of BKKT's cash will more than double, providing some level of depth for continued operations even as cash burn remains negative. Data by YCharts BKKT's average diluted shares outstanding are up 151% over the last 3 years on the back of equity dilution needed to expand its runway. This currently stands at less than 12 months against the pace of BKKT's trailing 12-month negative free cash flow and the post-debenture raise in liquidity. The risks for the bears, who form the 21% short interest in BKKT, are that the surge in crypto enthusiasm spills over to a buyout offer. Prior speculation that Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ) caused the stock price to spike and there is a non-insignificant possibility of further speculation arising. However, I'm still rating BKKT as a sell on the back of its low liquidity balance, substantial equity dilution, and negative free cash flow. Liquidity has been dipping for 3 years straight and there has not been any fundamental evolution in the company's business model that would allow them to address this shortfall. Hence, BKKT remains a sell, the company's BTC as a treasury pivot is just not material as there isn't sufficient liquidity for BKKT to acquire BTC in large enough numbers and hold it as an investment while its cash position is in such a critical position.",BKKT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-27 11:43:00

Bitcoin Solaris is now gaining serious traction across crypto trackers like Live Coin Watch. But it is not just another presale. BTC-S is gearing up for something much bigger. The upcoming LBank listing has placed it firmly in the sights of investors looking for Bitcoin-level wealth opportunities without the $100,000+ entry ticket. Why the LBank Listing Changes Everything Exchanges matter. And LBank is no small fish. With millions in daily volume and a reputation for onboarding promising projects, getting listed there is more than a visibility boost. It’s an official stamp of credibility. It means institutional eyes are watching, and retail momentum will only accelerate. The upcoming LBank listing for Bitcoin Solaris comes at a perfect moment. The presale is nearing its final stages, the hype is real, and the infrastructure is built. When BTC-S hits the exchange, it won’t crawl, it will sprint. This is where many expect the 150 percent projected ROI to begin its climb. Projects with real-world utility and this level of technology rarely come this early. But BTC-S is pulling it off. Meet Bitcoin Solaris: More Than Just Hype Bitcoin Solaris is not a copy of Bitcoin. It’s an evolution. It was designed from the ground up with a simple goal: bring financial opportunity to more people using scalable technology that still honors decentralization. Unlike most Layer 1 projects, BTC-S splits its infrastructure into two layers. The Base Layer uses Proof of Work to ensure security and fairness, while the Solaris Layer runs on Delegated Proof of Stake to deliver blazing speeds and ultra-low fees. Together, they allow Bitcoin Solaris to process up to 100,000 transactions per second. That is 10 times more than most legacy chains, and it comes with two-second finality. Smart contracts are built using Rust, and the project initially leverages Solana’s dev tools and ecosystem. This makes it easy to launch DeFi apps, NFTs, IoT platforms, healthcare records, and even decentralized education solutions on BTC-S. And because of the upcoming release of the mobile-friendly Solaris Nova app, mining BTC-S is now accessible even without expensive rigs. You can check projected earnings using the mining calculator directly on the official site at Bitcoin Solaris Mining Calculator. Technical Highlights Driving the Buzz What’s under the hood is what makes Bitcoin Solaris really stand out. This is not another meme coin launch. It is a high-performance blockchain built for practical use and serious value creation. Hybrid Consensus: Combines SHA-256 Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake for both power and efficiency. Validator Rotation: DPoS validators rotate every 24 hours with slashing for misbehavior, ensuring network integrity. Smart Contracts: Rust-based contracts leveraging Solana compatibility for speed and low cost. Security: Resistance to 51 percent attacks, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and optional Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy. TPS Performance: Up to 3,000 TPS on the base layer and up to 100,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer. This Isn’t Just a Token—It’s a Wealth Engine Built on BTC-S Influencers Are Talking Several top names in crypto content have picked up on BTC-S’s momentum.

This announcement aligns with Coinbase's recent stock performance, which saw shares closing at a record high of $375.07, surpassing its previous peak from November 2021 . Armstrong has previously suggested that Bitcoin's price could eventually reach into the millions, reflecting his bullish outlook on the asset. He also anticipates that nations will soon begin to include Bitcoin in their financial reserves, a move that could significantly influence global demand and the role of cryptocurrencies in international economics . Coinbase's stock surge is part of a broader trend of increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial markets. The company's inclusion in the S&P 500 Index in May 2025 marked a significant milestone, signaling growing institutional interest in digital assets. Analysts attribute Coinbase's strong performance to several factors, including the recovery of cryptocurrency prices, enhanced regulatory clarity, and the company's diversified revenue streams from trading fees, custody services, and institutional partnerships.

Bill Morgan says the settlement process is no longer progressing. Ripple now faces renewed legal uncertainty as unresolved appeals persist. Following the latest decision from Judge Analisa Torres, legal commentators such as Bill Morgan have shared their perspectives on where the case is headed. In a tweet , Morgan argued that the Ripple–SEC settlement process has stalled after a federal judge rejected a key joint motion. Specifically, the denial halts efforts to finalize a reduced penalty deal and overturn an earlier court injunction. The parties may now need to continue their appeals or consider alternative legal options. Why Did the Settlement Process Stall? In a detailed post on X, Morgan outlined a series of procedural attempts by both parties to finalize their settlement agreement. According to Morgan, Ripple and the U.S. SEC signed a settlement agreement earlier this year. Ripple signed on April 23, and the SEC signed on May 8.

Ripple and the SEC first filed a joint request in May for an “indicative ruling” to see whether District Judge Analisa Torres would be open to vacating the firm’s previously assigned $125 million civil penalty and reducing it to $50 million. Indicative rulings can be filed when a previous judgment is pending with an appeals court, but parties want to see if a district judge would be open to a motion for relief. District judges can deny the motions or express their openness to granting them should the appeals court give them permission. Judge Torres shot down Ripple and the SEC’s joint request in May, ruling that both parties failed “to address the heavy burden they must overcome to vacate the injunction and substantially reduce the civil penalty.” Ripple and the SEC refiled a second joint request earlier this month, outlining what they believed were the “exceptional circumstances” that merited a civil penalty reduction. “The balance of the interests here favors entry of the relief sought by the parties. The requested relief reflects a reasonable compromise by all parties to bring this litigation to an end, to avoid litigation risk on appeal, and to avoid the further expenditure of party and judicial resources.” Torres, however, shot down their second request in a similar fashion to the first, noting that the Supreme Court has said that court judgments aren’t just the property of the litigants; instead, they belong to the whole legal community and shouldn’t be vacated unless public interest demands it. The SEC first sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. In 2023, Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged. The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sales of XRP directly to institutional buyers were securities offerings. Last August, the judge slapped Ripple with a $125 million civil penalty, which the firm appealed. The SEC also appealed that number, arguing at the time that it was too low. The regulatory agency changed its tune toward the lawsuit after President Donald Trump took office in January and installed pro-crypto officials at the head of the commission.

Although there haven’t been any official statements from the Core Team, the speculations are running rampant about the potential implications. However, some have learned from previous examples and have set their expectations really low. Pi Network’s Pi2Day The excitement about June 28 has been on a wild run for the past several weeks, which even impacted the underlying asset’s token at one point. Among a few other possible reasons, PI skyrocketed by over 15% on a 24-hour scale earlier this week but has lost most of its momentum since then. The community continues with various speculations about what could be announced tomorrow, with the most brought up option being a listing on a major exchange. Naturally, Binance’s name is among the leaders given the exchange’s previous hints and community votes.

The latest example was the launch of Pi Network Ventures , a $100 million USD and PI fund aimed at investing in ecosystem projects. Although this sounds like a major product release, it was met with mixed reactions, as many expected something different, perhaps indeed a listing on Binance. Some users remain skeptical about tomorrow’s significance, predicting that there will be no major announcements or improvements, as the full mainnet launch is still to come.

Bitcoin is quickly becoming more than a reserve asset for Canadian companies. This week, two firms took concrete steps to build with it, marking a clear shift in how BTC fits into corporate finance. Here are more details. Belgravia Hartford Adds Another $1M to Its Bitcoin Bet Toronto-based investment firm Belgravia Hartford is building its Bitcoin treasury with fresh capital – this week pulling another $1 million from its credit line with Round13 Digital Asset Fund. That brings its total draw so far to $1.5 million, all going straight into Bitcoin. The company is buying BTC through the regulated OTC desk at Coinsquare, one of Canada’s leading crypto exchanges. This is part of a broader strategy. Belgravia recently purchased 1.5 BTC for around $161,000 on June 20. That brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 6.4 BTC, valued at roughly $685,000 at current prices. CEO Mehdi Azodi is clear about the company’s direction. “As a micro-cap, we have determined regularly adding BTC to the balance sheet is our best use and store of funds and that such activity is currently imperative for accretive growth in shareholder value,” he said. Let’s simplify this. Belgravia sees Bitcoin as the smartest way to use its funds right now. The company also launched a Bitcoin-focused private placement to raise more capital and keep building its BTC reserves. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation Makes a First Move On the same day, another player stepped into the spotlight. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, a Canada-based firm focused on institutional Bitcoin services, revealed its first major BTC buy: 292.80 BTC, worth about $31.5 million. The purchase was funded by a $125 million share offering, and it’s just the beginning of the company’s accumulation strategy. But holding Bitcoin isn’t the end goal here! They plan to use it for lending to institutions, offering liquidity while managing risk. The company is clear on its long-term view. Bitcoin is now a key part of how they plan to grow and operate. A Bigger Shift in Canada’s Bitcoin Strategy Both moves point to a growing trend: Canadian companies are getting serious about Bitcoin. Belgravia is slowly building its treasury. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation is jumping in with size and utility. Together, they reflect a bigger shift happening in Canada – where BTC is being treated less like a hedge, and more like an important financial tool.

This isn’t just about a bank; it’s about the integrity of global finance and the mechanisms designed to prevent illicit money flows. How could an entity linked to alleged cartel funds still hold such a privileged position within America’s financial infrastructure? Let’s dive deep into this unfolding story that raises critical questions about security and oversight. Unveiling the Controversy: Mexican Bank Sanctions and US Access The recent revelation by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, has sent ripples through the financial community. According to her post on X, the U.S. subsidiary of Intercam Banco, a Mexican financial institution, appears to possess a Federal Reserve master account. This is significant because Intercam Banco itself has been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury due to alleged connections with cartel-related funds. The core of the controversy lies in the apparent contradiction: an entity whose parent company faces serious allegations of facilitating illicit money, potentially retaining direct, unfettered access to the vital US payment system . While Intercam Banco has publicly denied these allegations, the question remains: what does this mean for the security of the U.S. financial landscape? Understanding the Federal Reserve Master Account: A Gateway to the US Payment System What exactly is a Federal Reserve master account , and why is its alleged possession by a sanctioned entity so alarming? Simply put, a Federal Reserve master account provides direct access to the U.S. central bank’s payment services. This includes the ability to send and receive payments through Fedwire, participate in automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, and directly settle balances. For a bank, it’s the ultimate gateway to the U.S. financial system, bypassing intermediary banks and reducing costs and delays. For a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign bank, such direct access is a powerful privilege. The fact that an entity connected to Mexican bank sanctions could potentially leverage this direct access raises significant concerns about the robustness of the US payment system ‘s defenses against illicit finance. The Shadow of Cartel Funds: Allegations and Implications The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s sanctions against Intercam Banco are rooted in allegations of its involvement with cartel funds . These are not minor infractions; such allegations point to serious criminal activity, including money laundering, drug trafficking, and other transnational crimes that destabilize economies and threaten national security. When funds linked to organized crime infiltrate legitimate financial channels, it undermines the integrity of the global financial system. The alleged continued access to the US payment system , even by a subsidiary, suggests a potential loophole that could be exploited by criminal organizations, allowing them to move illicit money with greater ease and anonymity, directly impacting the fight against financial crime. Navigating Financial Compliance: Challenges and Oversight Gaps This situation brings to light critical challenges in international financial compliance and regulatory oversight. Several questions immediately arise: Are Business Ties Clear? It remains unclear whether the U.S. subsidiary has any ongoing business ties or operational dependencies with its sanctioned parent company. This distinction is crucial for assessing risk. Regulatory Lag: How quickly can regulators identify and act upon such connections, especially when dealing with complex international corporate structures? Information Sharing: Is there sufficient real-time information sharing between different regulatory bodies (e.g., U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve) to ensure a unified and swift response to sanction designations? Proactive Measures: What mechanisms are in place to prevent sanctioned entities, or their closely related subsidiaries, from gaining or retaining such critical access points to a nation’s financial infrastructure? The complexities of global banking and the intricate web of subsidiaries often create blind spots that illicit actors can exploit, making robust and adaptive financial compliance frameworks more essential than ever. What This Means for Financial Security and What Comes Next The alleged direct access of a sanctioned Mexican bank’s subsidiary to the US payment system underscores the constant battle against financial crime and the imperative for vigilant oversight. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even with robust sanction regimes, sophisticated actors will always seek vulnerabilities. It highlights the need for continuous review and strengthening of policies governing access to critical financial infrastructure like the Federal Reserve master account . Moving forward, increased scrutiny of foreign bank subsidiaries operating within the U.S., alongside enhanced inter-agency coordination, will be paramount to ensure that the U.S. financial system remains secure against the flow of cartel funds and other illicit monies. This is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of national and international financial security.

North Korea Hacks Lead to $2.1B in Thefts,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/cryptos-worst-six-months-yet-north-korea-hacks-lead-to-21b-in-thefts,"Crypto investors lost over $2.1 billion to hacks and exploits in the first half of 2025, marking the worst six-month period on record for crypto security and an indication of some nation-states intensifying their cyber campaigns in the crypto space. The 75 recorded incidents crossed the previous H1 high from 2022 by roughly 10% and nearly match the entire 2024 total, a TRM Labs report released Friday said. But raising alarms is who is doing a major part of the stealing. Researchers say North Korean-linked groups are responsible for $1.6 billion, or 70% of all stolen funds this year. At the center of the surge is the $1.5 billion Bybit hack in February, now believed to have been carried out by North Korea, marking the largest crypto theft in history and skewing the year’s average hack size to $30 million — or double last year’s levels. The threat isn’t limited to Pyongyang. On June 18, a group believed to be linked to Israel, Gonjeshke Darande (Predatory Sparrow), stole $90 million from Iranian exchange Nobitex, reportedly in retaliation for the platform’s alleged role in sanction evasion. The stolen funds were sent to vanity addresses (which are un-spendable by design and sent tokens are deemed burnt), suggesting a political motive over profit. Attack vectors are evolving fast. Over 80% of stolen funds stemmed from infrastructure-level breaches, including private key thefts and front-end hijacks. These attacks, often involving social engineering or insider access, are proving to be ten times more lucrative than traditional smart contract exploits. DeFi vulnerabilities, including flash loan and reentrancy attacks, which were prevalent in 2021-22, accounted for a relatively small 12% of the losses.

Fee structures are being dismantled, user experience is moving front and center, and regulatory alignment is now a competitive edge rather than a hurdle. For platforms operating across markets in Africa, Asia, and Europe, localization and compliance are no longer optional, they’re fundamental. While liquidity and token depth still matter, the differentiators have changed. Traders are gravitating toward platforms that reduce friction, offer better educational tools, and integrate seamlessly into local financial systems. This article looks at five trading platforms navigating that shift. Some are already adapting to a changing landscape. Others are players making inroads where global exchanges have struggled. Each offers a distinct advantage—from zero-fee models and localized onboarding to aggressive altcoin support. Together, they reflect a broader trend: crypto trading is maturing, and platforms are ahead of their pace. 1. Binance Binance remains the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, and in 2025 it combines deep liquidity with evolving features. Its standard spot market offers hundreds of crypto pairs, while its peer-to-peer section allows one to swap tokens directly with other users without fees. Beginners appreciate that Binance’s “Lite Mode” transforms a cumbersome dashboard into a clean, card-style view where prices and purchase buttons are easy to navigate on the screen. This interface guides users smoothly from depositing fiat to executing their first buy order. Advanced traders still have access to margin, futures, staking options, and a growing NFT marketplace, but those options sit behind clear menus, away from casual users until they are ready to explore further. Security on Binance continues to be robust. Two-factor authentication is mandatory, withdrawal whitelist features protect your assets, and the exchange’s Secure Asset Fund for Users offers a safety net in case of breaches. Binance’s ongoing commitment to regulatory compliance, establishing local entities in over twenty countries and integrating KYC that respect user privacy and bring trust without sacrificing convenience. 2. Uniswap As the leading decentralized exchange on Ethereum, Uniswap has set the standard for permissionless trading. Version 3, which launched in late 2023, introduced concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to choose custom price ranges for their funds. This innovation boosts capital efficiency and often translates into tighter spreads for traders. On Uniswap’s web and mobile interfaces, swapping tokens takes only a few clicks. You connect your wallet, select the tokens, approve the transaction, and confirm on your wallet, no registration or identity checks required. In 2025, Uniswap’s user experience has improved further. A newly designed interface offers one-click “gas optimization,” automatically bundling transactions into a single on-chain operation to reduce costs. Chart overlays and simple limit-order functionality mean regular traders no longer need separate tools. Community-driven governance ensures feature requests move from proposal to reality easily. For anyone who values true decentralization and permissionless trades, Uniswap tops the list. 3. VTrader VTrader is quietly building a reputation for turning crypto into a social experience. From the moment you open the app, it feels more like sending a text than placing an order in an exchange. Instead of memorizing long wallet addresses, you tap a friend’s phone number or search your contact list to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, or dozens of other major tokens. Behind the scenes, VTrader stakes user deposits on reputable proof-of-stake networks , and those staking rewards cover network fees. This approach means zero transaction fees for P2P transfers and trades between contacts. Beyond the core peer-to-peer feature, VTrader offers a clean, intuitive dashboard where price charts and balance summaries live alongside learning modules. Short video explainers and guided tutorials pop up at relevant moments, such as the first time you open a new token pair or attempt a swap. Security is front and center: the company is registered with FinCEN in the United States, adheres to PCI DSS standards, and stores private keys in hardware security modules. For beginners in regions like Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya, VTrader’s in-app community events and the VTrader Academy give extra support, matching new users with local tutors who earn rewards for teaching. By blending social convenience, educational content, and solid compliance, VTrader turns a complex process into something seamless. 1inch While Uniswap shines on Ethereum, 1inch excels at finding the best prices across decentralized exchanges on multiple networks, including Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and beyond. By acting as an aggregator, 1inch splits your trade across several liquidity pools, squeezing out minimal slippage and optimal rates. On its interface, beginners see a “Best Price” tag next to each token swap, and the platform offers simple toggles to adjust gas limits or routing preferences without overwhelming technical jargon. In 2025, 1inch has rolled out advanced features like limit and stop orders directly on its DEX aggregator, a rare feature in DeFI. It also offers a one-click “gas token” function to reward users in the platform’s native tokens when network fees drop. For those who are keen on a decentralized option but dislike switching between apps for price checks, 1inch provides an all-in-one solution that feels more like a centralized exchange in convenience but upholds the permissionless benefits of DeFi. 5. Kraken Regulation and reputation matter more than ever, and Kraken stands out as one of the most trusted centralized exchanges in the world. Founded in 2011, it pioneered features like fiat onramps in over 50 countries, bank-grade security, and encrypted account information. Kraken’s interface is split into a simple “Starter” view for newcomers, showing only essential trading pairs and buy/sell buttons; and an “Advanced” view for those who want detailed order books, charting tools, and margin options. In 2025, Kraken has enhanced its educational offering with on-site webinars, live Q&A sessions, and an integrated learning center that complements each feature. Users gain confidence through simulated trading practice before they commit real funds. Kraken’s stablecoin pairs and futures markets have low trading fees, and its Proof-of-Reserve audits, published quarterly, reinforce transparency. If you want a platform that combines regulatory compliance, institutional-grade security, and a clear path for beginners, Kraken remains a top choice. Setting the pace for a new era of Crypto Trading In 2025, crypto trading is smarter, smoother, and more personalized than ever. AI assistants, seamless cross-chain swaps, and hybrid wallets are becoming the norm—not the future. Whether you’re drawn to VTrader’s social flair, Uniswap’s decentralization, or Binance’s institutional edge, the options are stacked. Each platform has its edge, try a few, feel them out. No more compromises. Just the right tools for your style, finally within reach.

His commentary highlights not only the complexities of the case but also the broader implications for crypto regulation under the current political climate. Torres’s Ruling: A Puzzling Denial Judge Torres recently denied a joint motion by Ripple and the SEC that sought to reduce Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million and lift the injunction restricting its future institutional XRP sales. According to Rispoli, the court had a clear path to grant the motion. Given the SEC’s ongoing leadership transition and shifting stance toward crypto under the Trump administration, many expected a more flexible judicial response. Instead, Torres rejected the motion outright. Rispoli suggests two possible reasons: either the judge was frustrated after spending more than four years on intense litigation between the parties, or she may harbor political bias against the new administration. While he stops short of confirming the latter, he points out that politically motivated decisions are not unheard of in the federal judiciary and vows to follow Judge Torres’s future rulings more closely. SEC v. Ripple Update: This is a long post on my thoughts here but the TLDR is: ""Welcome to the new SEC, for now more or less the same as the last one."" And: Ripple and SEC will settle the appeal for the reduced, agreed upon amount and leave the Torres judgment in place, while the… https://t.co/9y9o4M4uBW — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 26, 2025 Missed Opportunities by Ripple and the SEC Rispoli’s most pointed criticism lies in how poorly the motion was presented. On pages three and four of the ruling, Judge Torres cites the SEC’s prior language describing Ripple’s actions as “egregious,” “reckless,” and “dangerous.” This undermines claims that Ripple deserves leniency without a significant shift in its story. Rispoli argues that this motion should have included signed declarations from SEC commissioners, publicly acknowledging that the agency’s prior stance was flawed. If Commissioner Hester Peirce or SEC Chair Paul Atkins had publicly disagreed with Gary Gensler’s enforcement approach, it might have influenced the court’s view. Their silence, he says, signals a refusal within the SEC to admit past mistakes, even under new leadership. Whether due to a lack of coordination or outright refusal, the failure to present a strong and updated case contributed to the motion’s collapse. In Rispoli’s view, this reflects a systemic problem—an institutional instinct to protect the agency at all costs, even if it means undermining progress or fairness. A Likely Settlement Path Despite this setback, Rispoli is confident that the case is heading toward a final resolution. He predicts that Ripple and the SEC will eventually settle the appeal quietly, agreeing to the $50 million penalty while leaving Judge Torres’s core ruling in place. The decision that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales will stand , and the permanent injunction will remain largely symbolic. While the SEC previously announced its intent to drop the appeal, Rispoli remains skeptical that it will do so in a way that truly benefits Ripple, such as by failing to respond to Ripple’s appellate brief, which would give Ripple a near-certain win. Instead, he expects a joint dismissal of all appeals to avoid further scrutiny from the courts. Understanding the Injunction A key concern among XRP holders has been the court’s injunction against Ripple’s XRP institutional sales. Rispoli, however, argues that the injunction carries little practical weight unless the SEC actively chooses to enforce it. Judge Torres herself acknowledged this, noting that any enforcement would require a separate motion. Importantly, the injunction does not apply to secondary market transactions and will not impede any potential XRP ETF approvals. Rispoli also raises a legal point that has largely gone unaddressed—whether the SEC can issue waivers to override restrictions created by the injunction. According to his research, the SEC does have that authority, though whether it will use it remains uncertain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Operational Shift Another telling detail emerged from Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty’s statement following the court ruling. He referred to the company’s past behavior as “historic institutional sales”—a subtle yet significant change in language. Rispoli interprets this as a strategic signal that Ripple has adjusted its business practices to comply with the legal boundaries set by Judge Torres. This language shift likely reflects an unspoken understanding between Ripple and the SEC. The company will continue institutional sales in a manner that aligns with current regulatory expectations, while the SEC agrees not to pursue further enforcement, at least under the current leadership. A Broken System and the Case for Crypto Rispoli closes with a strong critique of the SEC as an institution. Drawing on years of experience litigating against government agencies, he describes a system that prioritizes self-preservation over accountability. He cites past scandals, like the SEC’s misconduct in the Debt Box case, as evidence of a deeper institutional rot. His support for crypto, he explains, stems from the desire to “opt out of a crumbling system.” For him, blockchain represents more than innovation—it’s a way to build a more transparent, accountable financial future, free from the bureaucratic failings that continue to plague agencies like the SEC. Fred Rispoli’s analysis sheds light on not just the legal minutiae of the Ripple case but also the broader institutional and political currents shaping its trajectory. While Judge Torres’s decision dealt a temporary blow to Ripple’s hopes of closing this chapter, the path to resolution appears clear. A settlement is likely, XRP remains unaffected in secondary markets, and Ripple seems poised to move forward, armed with lessons, legal clarity, and a commitment to compliance in a still-uncertain regulatory landscape.

If so, you’ve likely noticed a compelling trend that’s capturing the attention of investors worldwide: the consistent and substantial inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs . This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a powerful signal of growing confidence and institutional interest in Bitcoin, marking a significant shift in the digital asset landscape. What’s Driving the Surge in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with positive news as US Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their impressive run. On June 26, these investment vehicles collectively logged a staggering $226.37 million in net inflows, extending a remarkable 13-day streak of positive capital injection. This sustained interest highlights a deepening conviction among investors regarding Bitcoin’s long-term value and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Leading the charge in these substantial inflows is BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone attracted $163.46 million. Following closely were Fidelity’s FBTC with $32.85 million and Bitwise’s BITB contributing $25.16 million. Even smaller players like Franklin’s EZBC and ARK Invest’s ARKB saw modest yet meaningful inflows of $3.11 million and $1.79 million, respectively. This widespread participation across various ETF providers underscores a broad-based demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. These consistent Bitcoin Inflows are not merely statistical anomalies; they reflect a strategic pivot by both retail and institutional investors. For institutions, spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated, familiar, and accessible pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating obscure exchanges. For retail investors, they provide an easy entry point into the Bitcoin market through traditional brokerage accounts, democratizing access to this innovative asset. Understanding the Impact of Consistent Bitcoin Inflows on Crypto Market Trends The continuous flow of capital into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is having a palpable effect on broader Crypto Market Trends . Each day of positive inflows adds to Bitcoin’s liquidity and strengthens its market capitalization, often leading to upward price pressure. This sustained buying activity indicates that a significant amount of new capital is entering the Bitcoin ecosystem, rather than simply being reallocated within it. This trend is particularly significant because it suggests a maturation of the market. Unlike previous bull runs often fueled by speculative retail enthusiasm, the current environment is characterized by a more measured and institutional-led accumulation. This foundation of strong, consistent demand from regulated investment vehicles can lead to greater price stability and less volatility in the long run, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors. Moreover, these inflows act as a powerful validator for Bitcoin. The fact that sophisticated financial institutions are not only offering these products but also seeing substantial demand for them sends a clear message to the traditional financial world: Bitcoin is here to stay, and it’s becoming an indispensable part of diversified investment portfolios. This legitimization is crucial for fostering further growth and mainstream adoption. How is Institutional Adoption Shaping Bitcoin’s Future? The role of Institutional Adoption cannot be overstated when analyzing the current trajectory of Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a watershed moment, opening the floodgates for traditional financial players to engage with the digital asset space. This isn’t just about large sums of money; it’s about the stamp of approval from entities that manage trillions of dollars in assets. Consider the implications: Increased Legitimacy: When firms like BlackRock and Fidelity offer Bitcoin products, it lends immense credibility to the asset, dispelling previous notions of it being a niche or risky investment. Broader Access: Millions of investors who previously couldn’t or wouldn’t interact directly with cryptocurrencies can now gain exposure through their existing brokerage accounts, lowering the barrier to entry significantly. Market Maturation: Institutional involvement brings with it a demand for robust infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and professional-grade services, pushing the entire crypto ecosystem towards greater maturity and compliance. Long-Term Holding: Institutional investors typically have longer investment horizons compared to retail traders. Their accumulation often signifies a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, contributing to a more stable market base. This growing embrace by institutions is transforming Bitcoin from a fringe asset into a recognized component of global finance. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience, its innovative technology, and its potential as a store of value in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. What Do These Inflows Mean for BTC Price Action? The direct correlation between consistent Bitcoin Inflows and BTC Price Action is a topic of keen interest for investors. While market dynamics are complex and influenced by numerous factors, a sustained influx of capital into spot ETFs typically exerts upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. This is due to the simple economic principle of supply and demand: increased demand for a relatively fixed supply of Bitcoin tends to drive its value higher. Each dollar flowing into a spot ETF theoretically requires the fund manager to purchase an equivalent amount of Bitcoin on the open market (or through OTC desks). This continuous buying pressure, day after day, absorbs available supply and can contribute to a positive price trajectory. Furthermore, the psychological impact of seeing consistent inflows can foster a bullish sentiment among market participants, encouraging further investment. However, it’s crucial to remember that the market is never a straight line. While inflows are a strong bullish indicator, BTC Price Action can still be influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, global events, and profit-taking by existing holders. Yet, the current trend suggests a strong underlying demand that provides a robust floor for Bitcoin’s price, potentially mitigating sharp downturns and supporting upward momentum. Actionable Insights: Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends For investors looking to understand the significance of these developments, here are some actionable insights derived from the current Crypto Market Trends : Monitor ETF Data: Keep a close eye on daily ETF inflow/outflow data. Consistent positive flows are a strong indicator of sustained demand and market health. Resources like those from Trader T on X, or official ETF provider reports, can be invaluable. Long-Term Perspective: The institutional interest reinforces Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a digital store of value and an inflation hedge. Consider a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term trading. Diversification: While Bitcoin is leading, the overall positive sentiment driven by institutional adoption can spill over into other major cryptocurrencies. However, always conduct thorough research before diversifying your portfolio. Stay Informed on Regulation: Regulatory clarity continues to be a major catalyst for institutional adoption. Keep abreast of global regulatory developments as they can significantly impact market sentiment and investment flows. Risk Management: Despite the positive outlook, the crypto market remains volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price fluctuations. The current landscape suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its speculative phase and cementing its place within mainstream finance. These sustained inflows are not just numbers; they represent a fundamental shift in how the world views and invests in digital assets. A Future Forged by Confidence: Concluding Thoughts The remarkable 13-day streak of positive inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its increasingly vital role in the global financial ecosystem. This sustained momentum, largely driven by significant institutional participation, underscores a profound shift in Crypto Market Trends , pointing towards greater maturity, stability, and widespread acceptance. As we witness this incredible surge, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is solidifying its position as a legitimate and attractive investment asset. The consistent Bitcoin Inflows are a powerful indicator of demand, paving the way for continued Institutional Adoption and potentially robust BTC Price Action . While the journey of any asset class involves fluctuations, the current trajectory suggests a future where Bitcoin is an undeniable force in the financial world, embraced by a broader spectrum of investors than ever before. This is an exciting time for digital assets, signaling a future forged by collective confidence and innovative financial products.

Legal experts, developers, and analysts debate whether Ripple truly relinquishes authority over the funds. Speculation is mounting that the U.S. government could intervene or even take control of the escrowed XRP. The debate over Ripple’s unilateral control of XRP tokens in its escrow has resurfaced in the crypto community. This comes as Ripple faces new legal hurdles in its case with the U.S. SEC. The development sparked bold suggestions from commentators like Brad Kimes , founder of XRPLasVegas, that the U.S. government may have to step in, particularly through Ripple’s escrow. Meanwhile, developers, legal observers, and blockchain analysts clash over whether Ripple truly relinquishes control of billions of XRP placed in escrow.

Local media have linked the trio, Singaporeans Aaron Woon Guo Jie, 41, and Alan Wei Zhaolun, 49, alongside 51-year-old Chinese national Li Ming, to shipments destined for DeepSeek , a Chinese AI outfit. Prosecutors in Singapore want more time to scrutinize the documents The three were originally charged with fraud after authorities said they lied to unnamed server vendors about who would ultimately use the hardware. According to prosecutors, those false claims covered purchases made throughout 2023 and into 2024. The men stand accused of deliberately misrepresenting end users, a move Singapore courts treat very seriously, given the risk to international security. At Friday’s brief hearing, prosecutors told the court they need extra time to comb through fresh documents and to get replies from overseas entities involved in the transactions. Those responses are crucial, they said, to determine exactly how the chips were rerouted after leaving Singapore. According to Reuters , Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer had supplied the servers to Singapore-based firms, which then shipped them on, reportedly to Malaysia, though their status as the final destination remains unclear. Deputy public prosecutor Phoebe Tan said that the police had been actively pursuing leads and carrying out further investigations from the very start. Since the last hearing on May 2, Tan said, the police had 10 follow-up interviews with persons of interest and the accused trio. According to Channel News Asia , Tan also revealed that police initiated contact with relevant agencies, including foreign ones, and are currently waiting for responses. Police have also examined 35 out of 53 electronic devices, while the rest are pending data extraction. Organized networks use Singapore as their layover to China Singapore’s Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam revealed in March that officials, acting on an anonymous tip-off, confirmed some of the servers likely carried Nvidia chips banned for export to China since 2022 over military-use fears. A senior US official separately reported that DeepSeek is assisting China’s military and intelligence operations. The local case is but one piece of a wider law-enforcement operation targeting 22 individuals and companies for similar deceptions, authorities say. They suspect an organized network has been leveraging Singapore as a route to funnel advanced AI processors into China, undermining export controls designed to curb Beijing’s defence applications. In Nvidia’s latest fiscal filing, Singapore ranks as the chipmaker’s second-largest market after the United States, accounting for 18% of its revenues. Yet, actual shipments to the city-state made up under 2% of total sales, since many customers use Singapore merely as an invoicing hub for dispatches elsewhere. The US clampdown, introduced in 2022, bars export of Nvidia’s top-end AI accelerators to China over national security issues. Since then, global watchdogs have warned of illicit trade routes, with some middlemen exploiting neutral jurisdictions to disguise end-user identities. The outcome of the case, whose next hearing is on August 22, could signal how far Singapore will go to deter chip-smuggling networks, and whether other regional hubs might tighten their own oversight to prevent similar schemes.

On June 26th at the NYC Summit, Injective ( INJ ) announced the launch of Injective Revenue Fund, a new initiative designed to accelerate ecosystem development, scale on-chain revenue, and enhance INJ token’s deflationary mechanics . While specific implementation details are unclear at press time, the initiative will likely involve channeling protocol revenue into ecosystem expansion, supporting builders and dApps that drive user growth and network activity, and increasing token burns fueled by higher on-chain fee generation. The development comes at a pivotal moment as INJ price has recently broken below a key support level following the confirmation of a bearish head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The price dipped to an intraday low of $8.95 on June 22, testing a horizontal support zone established in early May, which now serves as a critical near-term level.

The token also fell below its 20-day EMA, signaling continued downside pressure in the near term unless a reclaim of the neckline occurs. Source: TradingVie w That said, the recent dip to $8.95 formed a higher low along the ascending long-term trendline, which formed after INJ price had reversed from $6.34 in early April — the lowest level since September 2023. This suggests that, despite the bearish breakdown, INJ remains technically within a broader uptrend, reinforced by its continued position above the 100-day SMA. If the price reclaims the neckline and closes above $11.30 – $12.00 with strong volume, the bearish scenario weakens. That would form a bear trap, and bulls could push to retest $14.30 — the swing high that marked the peak of the right shoulder.

Shares of South Korean digital payments firm Kakaopay tumbled as much as 17% on June 27 after trading resumed Thursday, following a one-day suspension by the Korea Exchange, Bloomberg reported . The halt came just days after an earlier suspension on Tuesday, triggered by a sharp rally that saw the stock surge around 50% in two sessions. Moreover, the stock has tripled in value over the past month, fueled by investor excitement over the company’s potential move into stablecoins. Source: Bloomberg The exchange suspended the stock twice due to its extreme price volatility, ultimately designating Kakaopay as an “investment risk.” “Kakaopay was definitely overheated and went ahead of its fundamentals,” said Shawn Oh, an equities trader at NH Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “Going forward, the stock will face a reality check.” You might also like: South Korea’s top banks unite for Won-pegged stablecoin launch: report As previously reported by the Korea Times, Kakao Pay recently filed 18 trademark applications.

From legislative breakthroughs to the potential reshaping of the digital asset landscape, key decisions are on the horizon that could redefine how cryptocurrencies operate within the United States. Are you ready for the seismic shifts about to hit the crypto ecosystem? What is the GENIUS Act and How Will it Impact Stablecoin Regulation? At the heart of the upcoming legislative changes is the GENIUS Act , a piece of legislation specifically designed to introduce stringent rules for stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have become a cornerstone of the crypto economy, facilitating trades, remittances, and lending. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns among regulators regarding consumer protection, financial stability, and illicit finance. The GENIUS Act is expected to bring much-needed clarity and oversight to this rapidly evolving sector. While the full details of the bill are yet to be widely publicized, reports suggest it will focus on: Reserve Requirements: Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold verifiable, high-quality reserves to back their tokens, ensuring a 1:1 peg and preventing situations like the TerraUSD collapse. Auditing and Transparency: Requiring regular, independent audits of stablecoin reserves and public disclosure of these reports, enhancing trust and accountability. Licensing and Supervision: Establishing a clear regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, potentially requiring them to obtain specific licenses and adhere to ongoing supervisory oversight by federal or state authorities. Consumer Protections: Implementing measures to safeguard user funds, including clear disclosures about risks, redemption rights, and mechanisms for dispute resolution. The implications of robust stablecoin regulation are far-reaching. For consumers, it could mean greater security and confidence in using stablecoins. For the industry, while compliance costs may increase, it could also pave the way for broader institutional adoption and integration of stablecoins into traditional financial systems, legitimized by a clear regulatory stamp. Who is David Sacks and What is His Role in Shaping US Crypto Policy? The recent insights into July’s legislative agenda come from David Sacks, notably referred to by Cointelegraph on X as the White House’s AI and crypto czar. While not a traditional government title, Sacks is a prominent figure in the tech and venture capital world, known for his involvement with PayPal and various successful tech companies. His statements carry significant weight, indicating a growing focus within high-level U.S. government circles on the burgeoning digital asset space. Sacks’s commentary underscores the administration’s recognition of cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence as critical areas for national policy. His role, whether formal or advisory, highlights a concerted effort to bring clarity and structure to a sector that has largely operated in a regulatory grey area. The fact that someone with his reported influence is signaling a definitive timeline for significant legislation like the GENIUS Act emphasizes the urgency and priority placed on developing comprehensive US crypto policy . This engagement from figures like David Sacks suggests a shift from merely observing to actively shaping the future of digital assets, aiming to foster innovation while mitigating risks. It signals a more proactive stance from the U.S. government, moving towards a framework that seeks to integrate digital assets responsibly into the broader financial system. What Does the CLARITY Bill Mean for the Crypto Market Structure? Beyond stablecoins, July is also slated to be crucial for broader crypto market structure. The CLARITY crypto market structure bill is reportedly heading to the Senate, promising to provide much-needed guidance for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Currently, the classification of digital assets (e.g., as securities or commodities) remains a significant point of contention, leading to regulatory uncertainty and hindering innovation. The CLARITY bill aims to address this ambiguity by potentially: Defining Digital Asset Classifications: Establishing clear legal definitions for various types of digital assets, helping exchanges, developers, and investors understand which regulations apply to them. Jurisdictional Clarity: Specifying which regulatory bodies (e.g., SEC, CFTC) have oversight over different aspects of the crypto market, reducing inter-agency disputes and providing a single point of contact for compliance. Market Integrity Rules: Introducing rules around trading practices, preventing market manipulation, and ensuring fair and orderly markets, similar to those in traditional finance. Investor Protection Frameworks: Creating robust frameworks to protect retail and institutional investors from fraud, scams, and market volatility, potentially through disclosure requirements and investor education initiatives. A clear and consistent crypto market structure is vital for the industry’s maturation. It would allow businesses to innovate with greater confidence, attract more institutional capital, and provide a safer environment for individual participants. This bill, alongside the GENIUS Act, represents a holistic approach to regulating the digital economy, moving beyond piecemeal enforcement actions to a comprehensive legislative framework. The Road Ahead: Navigating New Stablecoin Regulation and Crypto Market Structure With the GENIUS Act expected to be signed into law and the CLARITY bill progressing through the Senate, the coming months will demand significant adaptation from all participants in the crypto space. The new era of stablecoin regulation will require issuers to re-evaluate their operational models, reserve management, and compliance protocols. This could lead to a consolidation in the stablecoin market, with only the most robust and compliant entities surviving and thriving. For the broader crypto market structure , exchanges, DeFi protocols, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) will need to carefully analyze the new classifications and jurisdictional mandates. This might necessitate changes in how tokens are listed, how trading platforms operate, and how investor funds are handled. While challenging, this regulatory clarity could ultimately unlock significant growth by fostering trust and attracting mainstream financial institutions that have been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community: Stay Informed: Closely monitor official announcements and detailed breakdowns of the GENIUS Act and CLARITY bill as they become public. Assess Impact: Businesses should conduct internal assessments to understand how the new regulations will affect their operations, products, and services. Engage with Policy Makers: Industry associations and individual companies should consider engaging with lawmakers and regulators to provide feedback and advocate for practical implementation. Prioritize Compliance: Start preparing for potential compliance requirements now, even before the full details are solidified. This includes reviewing internal controls, data management, and legal frameworks. The legislative push reflects a global trend towards greater oversight of digital assets. The U.S., as a major financial hub, plays a crucial role in setting precedents. The decisions made in July will not only impact the domestic market but could also influence regulatory approaches worldwide, shaping the global future of finance. A Transformative July for US Crypto Policy July is undeniably set to be a transformative month for the U.S. crypto landscape. With the anticipated signing of the GENIUS Act and the progression of the CLARITY bill, the U.S. is moving decisively towards a more regulated and defined digital asset ecosystem. This legislative push, championed by influential figures like David Sacks, signals a clear intent to foster responsible innovation, enhance investor protection, and integrate cryptocurrencies more formally into the financial system. While the path to compliance may present challenges, the long-term benefits of clarity and stability could unleash unprecedented growth and mainstream adoption for digital assets. The crypto community must remain vigilant, adaptable, and proactive to navigate this pivotal moment and seize the opportunities it presents.

This upward movement reflects a notable price action in ETH crypto driven by a confluence of factors that signal strong bullish sentiment, but also caution against potential short-term volatility has appeared as it began consolidating in $2400- $2500 range. Even popular analyst Degen Hardy noted with caution that he will stay long on ETH as long as it remains above the $2,400 mark. As he believes in the short term, if $2400 is taken out, it will mean that bulls are struggling to reclaim untapped weekly highs. As the second-largest cryptocurrency with $295 billion market cap commands attention, as understanding these underlying forces is crucial for traders and investors alike. Keep reading to know more. Shifting Sentiment and the Impact of Short Squeezes A recent study from a CryptoQuant analyst reported a shift in funding rates on Binance, moving from negative to positive territory. Indicating leveraged long positions are aggressively betting on a continued ETH price rise. Per the analyst, this reflects widespread optimism, but it also raises severe concerns of the market turning into “overheating,” where further increases could precede with a short-term correction. Inflows Signal Potential Selling Pressure Analyst further adds that on-chain data presents a cautionary note, despite the recent strong price action, which was primarily driven by geopolitical ease with war-involved countries agreeing to a ceasefire. As the data reveals, Binance witnessed an inflow of 177,000 ETH over three consecutive days. This movement of ETH crypto onto exchanges has higher odds that some large holders may be preparing to take profits or reallocate their assets. [post_titles_links postid=”475660″] Ethereum Awaiting Correction In Short-Term Outlook Ethereum’s spike clearly highlights the aggressive speculative activity, but the simultaneous and substantial inflow of ETH crypto onto Binance points to a looming possibility of selling pressure, too. Even analysts like Hardy are cautious and willing to close their running positions if bulls can’t push higher in the short term. This increases the likelihood of a dip coming, as the market might aim to normalize the current overheated funding dynamics. $ETH UPDATE Still in my LONG position as long as we hold above this zone ($2.4K) Will cut it if we break down, bulls are struggling to get to the untapped weekly above.

Although the rumors are yet to be confirmed by any official SEC filing or BlackRock press release, the mere possibility has reverberated across traditional finance and the digital asset universe. So what exactly is an XRP ETF, how would it work, and why is the potential entrance of BlackRock such a big deal? What Is an XRP ETF? An XRP ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product designed to track the price action of XRP, the Ripple Labs cryptocurrency. Instead of buying XRP directly from a cryptocurrency exchange, investors can buy shares of the ETF in regular brokerage accounts. A share represents a proportionate interest in the underlying XRP position of the fund. The following is a general description of how an XRP ETF operates: Fund Creation : The issuer (e.g., BlackRock) buys XRP or related instruments to back the ETF. Asset Backing : The value of each ETF share is directly proportional to the amount of XRP the fund is holding. Exchange Trading : Shares are listed on stock exchanges and traded the same as common stocks. Net Asset Value (NAV) : The NAV is the total value of the XRP in the fund divided by outstanding shares, though market prices may vary slightly depending on trading volume. Management Fees : Issuers charge a small percentage as a management fee for operating the fund. This arrangement allows investors to gain exposure to XRP's price movement without the hassle of private keys, wallets, or having to interact with crypto exchanges. Why Does BlackRock's Interest Matter So Much? BlackRock's push into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was a landmark moment for institutional crypto adoption. The firm's reputation and regulatory strictness gave Wall Street's stamp of approval to digital assets, paving the way for pension funds, hedge funds, and retail investors who were wary of taking direct crypto exposure. A BlackRock XRP ETF application would signal growing confidence in the regulatory status of XRP along with its utilization as a mainstream asset. It would greatly help improve liquidity, market stability, and potentially drive XRP's price much higher than its all-time highs, according to industry watchers. The Current State Despite the hype, there is no official word from the official sources that BlackRock has filed—or will imminently file—for an XRP ETF. Previous speculation in April and May 2025 was not based on facts, and BlackRock representatives have repeatedly indicated they are not currently interested in altcoins like XRP, in large part due to ongoing legal uncertainty regarding Ripple and the SEC. Other managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and 21Shares, have already applied for spot XRP ETFs and are awaiting SEC rulings. The SEC recently delayed a decision on several of these products, pointing to the regulatory uncertainty that still exists. What Would Happen If BlackRock Filed for an XRP ETF? If BlackRock were to actually file for an XRP ETF, the impact would be seismic: Wider Access : Traditional investors could invest in XRP through traditional brokerage accounts, without the complexity of crypto wallets and private keys. Liquidity Boost : The influx of institutional money would initiate greater trading volumes and market depth, reducing volatility. Price Effect : Analysts have predicted that XRP could double in price, potentially surpassing its all-time high of $3.40 and even reaching as high as $4.60 within months, after the same explosive rallies that happened when Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were added. Legitimacy Boost : BlackRock's involvement would be a powerful vote of confidence in XRP, potentially impacting public and institutional attitudes and further mainstream adoption. How an XRP ETF Bridges Traditional and Crypto Finance ETFs are a familiar wrapper for traditional investors, offering regulatory oversight, ease of access, and transparency. By putting XRP into this wrapper, an ETF would be capable of bridging the gap between traditional finance and the evolving landscape of digital assets. This would open the door to a whole new wave of investors that have been deterred by the technical and security concerns of direct crypto ownership. The Road Ahead While the expectation is genuine, caution is warranted. The history of false starts among the XRP community can only serve to highlight the need for skepticism until there is an actual filing. Regulatory clarity remains a significant hurdle, and BlackRock's risk aversion will have it potentially waiting for the green light from the SEC before making a move. Still, the sheer speculation testifies to the growing appetite for crypto entry into mainstream finance. With regulatory clarity and institutional interest on the rise, the prospect of an XRP ETF—one backed by a giant like BlackRock—could be closer than most expect. In brief : The idea of a BlackRock XRP ETF is so far speculation, but if it does materialize at some time in the future, it would be a game-changer for XRP and the crypto space in general, opening the doors to institutional money and mainstream adoption.

The second-largest crypto has bounced between $2400 and $2460 over the past 24 hours, reflecting indecision despite bullish whale activity and growing institutional interest. Alongside, the whales have also intensified the accumulation of Ethereum, which can be considered a bullish signal for the token. As per the data from Cryptoquant, Ethereum whales have recorded one of the highest accumulations ever in the cycle. On the other hand, the active address spiked instantly from 289,275 to as high as 515,432, hinting towards a massive rise in the traders’ activity. Hence, with a rise in the volatility, the ETH price could also attract a positive impact. Is a Short Squeeze Incoming? A short squeeze occurs when the traders who have shorted the token are compelled to buy back at a higher price. This covers their losses and also helps the price climb instantly. The current on-chain readings suggest an enormous amount of shorts have been accumulated, which could pave the way for a sudden rise in the price soon. The chart shows a huge accumulation of shorts in the past few days as the price was about to secure the resistance at $2800. This quickly drives the price lower, and now that it is trying to recover, the shorts are feared to get liquidated. A significant amount of liquidity has been piled up around $2500, and hence, a rise above the level could eventually squash the shorts. Will the Ethereum (ETH) Price Reach $3000? The Ethereum price has been trading within a narrow range while plunging heavily during the latest pullback. Despite this, the price has held along a strong support, hence paving the way to reach the resistance. Besides, the volume has also been making moves, hinting towards a substantial rise in the volatility as well. As seen in the above chart, the price has rebounded from the support of the Gaussian channel, which suggests excessive price drain. However, the CMF remains stuck below ‘0,’ hinting towards a drop in the money flow onto the platform.

Speculation about a staggering 6,500% surge is causing a stir among investors. This emerging token might just be the next big thing. What sets it apart, and why is it generating such buzz? Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits PEPE: The Meme Coin Turning Frogs into Fortunes PEPE is making waves in the crypto world as a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum. Inspired by Matt Furie's Pepe the Frog, a meme sensation from the early 2000s, PEPE aims to join the ranks of popular meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Embracing simplicity, it boasts a no-tax policy and makes no promises of utility, appealing to those who appreciate the pure fun of a memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a meteoric rise, with its market cap peaking at $1.6 billion. Early holders saw significant gains, and a vibrant community quickly formed around the coin. This surge sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" where new meme-inspired tokens appeared rapidly, experiencing wild price swings. While the future is uncertain, many enthusiasts are optimistic, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving that some believe could trigger a new bull run. In a market driven by trends and community spirit, PEPE stands out as a testament to the unpredictable yet exciting nature of cryptocurrency. Dogecoin's Rise: How a Shiba Inu Changed the Crypto Game Dogecoin began in 2013 as a lighthearted joke, featuring the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant as a fun alternative to the serious world of cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin has no cap, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute, making it abundant and accessible. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin's value skyrocketed in 2021, propelled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk. It surged into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion and showcasing the power of community and online influence. Dogecoin's potential lies in its vibrant community and mainstream recognition. Its technology is based on Litecoin, offering fast transaction times and low fees. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin stands out for its widespread acceptance and the enthusiasm of its supporters. Compared to more traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dogecoin's abundant supply and lower price per coin make it more approachable for new investors. The rise of meme coins and increased interest in crypto markets suggest that Dogecoin may continue to play a significant role in the evolving digital landscape. Conclusion PEPE and DOGE have performed well, but XYZ blends sports and memes, aiming for 20,000% growth—making it a standout opportunity for early adopters in the current bull run.

Consequently, XRP has surpassed the two biggest digital assets by market cap, bitcoin and ether, both of which are performing a lot better in terms of price actions in the past week or so. BTC managed to reclaim the $100,000 line after its brief hiatus below it and now sits at around $107,000 as the geopolitical environment in the Middle East improved. ETH also recovered from its substantial slump and is back to $2,400. In contrast, XRP’s price has been trading downward for weeks and is currently below $2.1 after another 3-4% daily drop. The latest setback took place yesterday following Judge Torres’s decision to deny the joint motion filed by Ripple and the SEC for a quicker resolution in their lawsuit.

The country’s National Assembly Finance and Planning Committee has proposed the formation of a multi-agency regulatory framework to oversee crypto operations, marking a pivotal moment for the region’s virtual asset industry. Kenya’s New Crypto Regulatory Framework Driven by the explosive growth of the crypto sector, Kenyan lawmakers are moving quickly to establish oversight mechanisms. The proposed framework brings together five key government agencies to regulate Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs): Central Bank of Kenya Capital Markets Authority Competition Authority of Kenya Communications Authority of Kenya Office of the Data Protection Commissioner These bodies will collectively regulate various aspects of the crypto ecosystem, including market conduct, data protection, and digital infrastructure. Why Kenya Introduced This Crypto Proposal The proposal stems from a recommendation by Credence Sfrica, a social enterprise organization, which called for a cross-sectoral regulatory team to supervise the rapidly expanding crypto market. The initiative is now open for public feedback, as the Finance Committee aims to build a collaborative and transparent crypto policy. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) Bill Gains Momentum Introduced on April 4, 2025, the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill has received strong support from key players in the crypto industry. The Virtual Asset Chamber (VAC) praised the bill but recommended removing a controversial clause that allowed regulators to conduct off-site surveillance of VASPs without clear boundaries. The committee agreed with the VAC and has amended the bill accordingly. [post_titles_links postid=”475547″] Kenya Aims to Become Africa’s Crypto Hub Kenya is positioning itself as a crypto leader in Africa, moving past its earlier caution. The new VASP Bill is designed to strengthen financial transparency, accountability, and combat illicit financial flows. Lawmakers believe it will help protect consumers and legitimize the crypto space in the country. Key Requirement for VASPs If the bill is passed, all entities engaging in crypto operations in Kenya will be required to obtain a local license approved by the five regulatory agencies. These licensed VASPs must also implement internal policies to identify and manage conflicts of interest and report such matters to authorities. “This Bill puts a strong emphasis on conflict prevention and proper management among virtual asset providers,” said MP Kimani Kuria . “It requires entities to establish effective internal controls to ensure transparency and accountability.” Final Thoughts As Kenya prepares to pass its first comprehensive crypto regulation , it sends a clear signal of intent: the nation is serious about embracing digital finance while safeguarding its citizens. If implemented successfully, this could place Kenya at the forefront of Africa’s blockchain revolution.

Yet, recent allegations have sent shockwaves through this very foundation, raising serious questions about the integrity of a prominent cross-chain intents protocol. Across Protocol , a name synonymous with bridging digital assets, now finds itself at the center of a storm involving alleged financial misconduct and manipulated governance votes. If true, these claims could profoundly impact investor confidence and the future of DeFi governance. What Are the Core Allegations Against Across Protocol? At the heart of the controversy are startling claims made by Ogle, an advisor at World Liberty Financial (WLFI). In a recent X post, Ogle accused the Across Protocol team of orchestrating a scheme to siphon off a staggering $23 million in ACX tokens . The alleged method? Manipulating the outcome of a crucial governance vote. Specifically, the accusation states that 150 million ACX tokens , valued at approximately $23 million at the time, were transferred to Risk Labs. Risk Labs is reportedly the for-profit entity behind Across Protocol . These transfers were allegedly disguised under the seemingly innocuous labels of “strategic investment” and “retroactive funding.” However, critics argue these labels served as a cover for a direct transfer of community-held assets into the hands of the protocol’s core team. Unpacking the Alleged ACX Tokens Vote Manipulation The gravity of the situation deepens when examining the mechanics of the alleged manipulation. Ogle’s post meticulously details how the Across Protocol team purportedly leveraged ‘insider addresses’ to sway the results of the governance vote manipulation . In a truly decentralized system, governance proposals are meant to be decided by the collective will of token holders, ensuring fair and transparent decision-making. However, according to the allegations, these insider addresses were strategically deployed to push the proposal past the required quorum. Ogle emphasized that without the engagement of these ‘insider’ votes, the proposal would have failed due to insufficient participation. This suggests a deliberate effort to bypass genuine community consensus, undermining the very principles of decentralized governance. The direct consequence of these actions, as highlighted by Ogle, is the creation of potential token selling pressure, which directly harms legitimate ACX token holders. Why Do Governance Vote Manipulation Claims Matter in DeFi? The allegations against Across Protocol are not just about a large sum of money; they strike at the core of what decentralized finance security aims to achieve. DeFi protocols are designed to operate without central intermediaries, relying instead on smart contracts and community-driven governance. This model promises transparency, censorship resistance, and true user ownership. However, incidents like the alleged governance vote manipulation by the Across Protocol team expose critical vulnerabilities. When the very mechanisms designed to ensure fairness can be exploited by those in power, it erodes trust. This raises fundamental questions: Can users truly trust a system where insider interests can override community consensus? How robust are existing governance frameworks against such alleged exploits? What recourse do token holders have when their collective power is allegedly undermined? These questions are vital for the long-term health and adoption of DeFi. The integrity of governance votes is paramount, as it dictates the future direction, treasury allocation, and overall security of a protocol. The Wider Impact of Crypto Allegations on Trust Beyond the immediate financial implications for ACX token holders, these crypto allegations cast a long shadow over the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. Trust is the bedrock of any financial system, and in the nascent world of DeFi, it is even more critical. Each alleged scandal, each instance of insider dealing, chips away at the collective confidence of investors, developers, and new entrants. Such incidents can lead to: Reduced Investor Confidence: Potential investors may become wary of participating in DeFi projects, fearing similar exploits. Regulatory Scrutiny: Allegations of manipulation and misappropriation often invite increased attention from regulators, potentially leading to stricter rules that could stifle innovation. Reputational Damage: Not just for the accused protocol, but for the entire sector, making it harder to attract mainstream adoption. Market Volatility: News of alleged misconduct can trigger sell-offs, further harming legitimate token holders. The DeFi space prides itself on its innovative spirit and commitment to decentralization. However, incidents that betray these principles are a stark reminder of the ongoing need for vigilance and robust ethical frameworks within the community. Navigating Decentralized Finance Security Challenges The alleged events surrounding Across Protocol underscore the persistent decentralized finance security challenges that the industry must continuously address. While DeFi offers immense opportunities, it also presents unique risks that differ from traditional finance. The immutability of blockchain transactions means that once an exploit or a malicious act occurs, it is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to reverse. To bolster decentralized finance security and prevent future incidents of alleged governance vote manipulation , several measures are crucial: Enhanced Audits: Beyond code audits, governance mechanisms themselves need rigorous scrutiny to identify potential vulnerabilities for manipulation. Transparent On-Chain Data: Tools and platforms that make it easier for the community to monitor voting patterns, large token movements, and treasury transactions can serve as early warning systems. Stronger Community Engagement: Actively encouraging a broader base of token holders to participate in governance can dilute the power of concentrated insider interests. Clear Disclosure Policies: Protocols should have explicit rules regarding team holdings, vesting schedules, and any potential conflicts of interest related to governance. Legal Recourse: While challenging in a decentralized environment, exploring frameworks for accountability and recourse for affected token holders is essential for maturing the space. The allegations against Across Protocol serve as a potent reminder that decentralization is not a magic bullet against all forms of misconduct. It requires continuous effort, community oversight, and a commitment to ethical practices from all participants. What’s Next for Across Protocol and ACX Holders? As these serious allegations circulate, the eyes of the crypto community will remain fixed on Across Protocol . It is crucial for the protocol’s team to address these claims transparently and provide a comprehensive response to the community. For ACX token holders, understanding the full implications of these alleged actions on their investments and the protocol’s long-term viability is paramount. The coming weeks and months will likely determine how this situation evolves and whether the community’s trust can be restored. Conclusion The alleged misappropriation of $23 million in ACX tokens by the Across Protocol team, facilitated by alleged governance vote manipulation , is a deeply concerning development for the DeFi ecosystem. It highlights the critical need for robust decentralized finance security measures and unwavering transparency. While the promise of decentralization remains strong, incidents like this underscore the ongoing challenges in building truly equitable and trustworthy systems. The crypto community must remain vigilant, advocating for greater accountability and stronger governance frameworks to safeguard the future of DeFi.

Key Takeaways: Ripple’s Wormhole integration links XRP Ledger to over 35 blockchains, boosting cross-chain capabilities. Developers can now build dApps that operate across multiple networks, expanding XRP’s DeFi utility. Ripple aims to use the integration to enhance its offerings in tokenization and liquidity provision. Announced Thursday, the integration allows XRP-native decentralized applications to interact with networks like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Ripple plans to leverage the new connectivity to grow its offerings in decentralized finance, tokenization, and liquidity provision. Ripple and Wormhole Integration Unlocks Multi-Chain dApp Development Developers will now be able to create dApps that operate seamlessly across multiple ecosystems, enhancing XRP’s utility in decentralized finance and other sectors. “If you want real mass adoption, interoperability is essential,” said David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple and Co-creator of the XRP Ledger. “The infrastructure has to be there, not just on one chain, but across them. With this integration, tokens natively issued on the XRP Ledger are being set up for that reality by being able to move between blockchain networks while maintaining native issuance and control.” Wormhole’s cross-chain bridge aims to help XRP solidify its status as an institutional-grade blockchain. @Wormhole is announcing a partnership with @Ripple to bring multichain interoperability to the XRP Ledger and the upcoming XRPL EVM Sidechain.

As Ripple doubles down on interoperability, market watchers will be looking for signs that these efforts could translate into renewed momentum for XRP. XRP Ledger Upgrade Adds Institutional Tokens As reported, RippleX, the development arm of Ripple, has rolled out version 2.5.0 of the XRP Ledger , introducing several protocol upgrades aimed at strengthening network functionality and security. RippleX engineer Mayukha Vadari has called the upgrade “possibly the best single lineup of amendments” ever released, introducing significant improvements to token management and transaction processing. The XLS-85 amendment upgrades the escrow system by allowing third-party issued tokens, including stablecoins, and introduces multi-purpose tokens designed for institutional applications. Another key change, XLS-56, enables wrapper transactions that can combine up to eight steps into a single action, aiming to lower failure rates in complex transaction flows and improve network efficiency for advanced use cases. The new update comes as the XRP Ledger has recorded a surge in user activity , with the number of daily active addresses climbing from an average of 35,000 to over 295,000. Alongside growing usage, the number of whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP has reached an all-time high of 2,700 — a milestone not seen in the 12-year history of the protocol. The rise in large holders may reflect growing institutional or high-net-worth conviction in XRP’s long-term value. In May, VivoPower also invested $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury.

Some tokens drop as much as 90–95% shortly after launch. We are lucky that $Pi is not listed on @binance . Look at the trend, any coin listed on #Binance has a free fall until it is 90-95% down. — Pi News (@PiListingNews) June 27, 2025 Pi users argue that this has protected the token from being exploited by short-term traders and bots that typically dump right after listings Community Pushes Back on Listing Hype Earlier in June, a Pi Network news account ran a poll on X asking if PI should be listed on Binance. Even then, the responses were mostly negative. Users argued that key issues, especially KYC bugs, must be fixed first before any listings. Reddit discussions reveal that some users believe Pi’s value goes beyond just exchange listings and hype. They pointed out that the Core Team needs to improve in areas like PR, UI updates, and timely announcements, but the project’s potential and massive user base speak for themselves. A Binance listing would boost visibility, but Pi doesn’t depend on it. What Matters More for Pi? Pioneers have expressed that Pi’s true value comes from its community and the ecosystem it’s building and not from any one exchange. However, analyst Dr Altcoin has previously said that Pi’s drop below $1.30 and its fall in the ranks are closely tied to its failure to secure a Binance listing, despite 86% community support. The lack of major Pi Day announcements has further damaged sentiment. To restore trust, he says that action is needed, starting with a clear roadmap and real exchange listings. Pi2Day Hopes High Pi Coin is listed on exchanges like OKX, Bitget, Gate.io, and MEXC. With Pi2Day coming up on June 28, the community is hoping for big news, like a possible Binance listing.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

SEC lawsuit . This ruling, a significant development in a case that has loomed over the token for years, has contributed to a sharp market reaction, with nearly $5 billion erased from XRP’s market capitalization. However, the crypto market appears to have largely priced in this outcome, as evidenced by stabilizing trading patterns and a lack of further significant sell-offs in the immediate aftermath. With only a few days until July 1, a deeper analysis of XRP’s price dynamics, technical indicators, and fundamental developments provides valuable insight into its potential trajectory and performance in the first half of 2025. XRP price analysis Currently, XRP trades at $2.09, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.73 billion, a market cap of $123.46 billion, and a market dominance of 3.76%. XRP 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP’s current price action reveals a mixed outlook. The token is trading below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a bearish signal that suggests potential challenges in regaining upward momentum in the near term. Additionally, XRP has recorded only 13 green days in the last 30 (43%), indicating inconsistent short-term performance. The impending unlock of 1 billion XRP tokens on July 1, part of Ripple’s programmed escrow releases, introduces another layer of complexity. With a yearly inflation rate of 6.45% and a fully diluted valuation of $208.79 billion, this token unlock could exert downward pressure on the price, particularly if market sentiment remains cautious. Historically, Ripple’s escrow releases have had mixed impacts, with some unlocks absorbed smoothly due to pre-existing market expectations and others contributing to temporary price dips. Data says XRP sentiment is at 17-day high According to data analytics platform Santiment: “XRP sentiment is currently at a 17-day high, in terms of positive vs. negative commentary. This has happened after a $50M settlement between Ripple & the SEC was stalled.” 📊 With crypto moving sideways, retail optimism toward Bitcoin & Ethereum has died down a bit.

Holders are also a growing political constituency in the US political landscape. Polling and research by Cygnal shows BTC ownership is also a growing indicator of political convictions and influence. US-based owners are a significant force on both a global scale and as a domestic voting group. Crypto dragged Trump across the finish line in 2024 According to Cygnal polling, BTC ownership could predict voting inclinations, with immediate potential results for the 2026 midterms. Its recent poll between June 19-21 targeted a selection of 800 potential voters. “ The Bitcoin constituency is now a critical one in elections, but there is a wide chasm between Bitcoiners and voters as a whole, ” said Pollster and Cygnal President, Brent Buchanan. “ However, this data offers a lot of promise and opportunity to the Bitcoin community and the innovation industries surrounding it ,” he added. Bitcoiners already showed their preferences during the contested 2024 election, voting 59% in favor of Donald Trump , and only 34% in favor of Kamala Harris, a significant shift from the general voter pool. Trump also won over 11% of Democratic voters who were also BTC holders, compared to 6% of general Democratic voters who switched teams. The shift in Trump’s direction followed his campaign claims of more lenient crypto policies, which led to a shift in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The effect of Trump’s election victory and the subsequent drive to liberalize crypto regulations led to multiple all-time highs for BTC, further solidifying the holder ethos. Following the emergence of crypto owners as a voting bloc, BTC also shows a clear trend of a growing number of corporations building treasuries , alongside older whales that still hold for the long term. Bitcoin holders: leaning Republican, more educated and younger The voting profile of a Bitcoin holder is emerging as a stronger supporter of Trump than the Republican Party. Nevertheless, holders lean Republican politically. Voters owning BTC were younger, predominantly male, with more years of education, and higher-income than the general population. Despite their conviction, Bitcoiners were low-propensity voters, needing a nudge to go to the polls and support their main preferences. Bitcoin owners were also 53% likely to vote in person on election day, or cast an early in-person vote, with just 15.5% for absentee or mail voting, compared to 23.8% absentee voting for the general population. Bitcoiners also have a different profile of voting issues, with inflation and the economy being their biggest concern. BTC holders have a different issue profile compared to general voters, with their biggest concern being inflation and the economy. | Source: Cygnal Poll Bitcoin holders still diverge from the general GOP voters, with more dramatic support for crypto issues ranging from transactions to a national reserve. Democratic voters are more generally opposed to expanding access to crypto. The most supportive crypto holders are in the 30-44 age bracket, with 61% approval for crypto in general. Those voters are also more likely to support Republicans in the upcoming 2026 elections. Surprisingly, Bitcoin holders were also not entirely maximalist, with 42% favorable opinion on meme tokens, compared to just 19% favorable for the general population. Memes were also tied to the last election cycle, sparking the trend of PolitiFi and official meme tokens, including Official Trump ( TRUMP ). Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The much-anticipated arrival of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. market has brought a new dynamic, attracting significant institutional attention. However, their initial days have unveiled a mixed bag of investor sentiment, with recent data highlighting a notable trend. On June 26, these groundbreaking financial products collectively registered a net outflow of $26.4 million, a figure that prompts a closer look at the forces shaping this nascent market. What’s Behind the Initial Ethereum ETFs Outflows? The first few days of trading for any new exchange-traded fund are always a period of intense scrutiny, and Ethereum ETFs are no exception. The $26.4 million in net outflows on June 26, as reported by Farside Investors, offers an early glimpse into how capital is flowing through these new investment vehicles. While a net outflow might sound concerning at first glance, a deeper dive reveals a nuanced picture, characterized by both significant withdrawals from established players and fresh capital injections into newer offerings. Here’s a breakdown of the key movements: Grayscale’s Dominance in Outflows: Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which converted into a spot ETF, saw the most substantial withdrawals. Its ETHE product alone recorded a $27.4 million outflow, while its standard ETH product experienced an additional $12.4 million in withdrawals. This trend mirrors what was observed with Bitcoin ETFs, where Grayscale’s GBTC saw significant outflows post-conversion due to factors like profit-taking, higher fees compared to competitors, and a shift of capital to more competitive offerings. New Entrants Attracting Inflows: In stark contrast, several newer spot ETH ETFs managed to attract fresh capital. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with $5.9 million in inflows, followed closely by Fidelity’s FETH with $4.9 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW with $2.6 million. These inflows underscore continued investor appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated products, particularly from major asset managers. Stability Among Others: The remaining Ethereum ETFs reported no changes in their holdings for the day, indicating a wait-and-see approach from some investors or a more gradual accumulation process. To provide a clearer picture, here’s a snapshot of the activity: ETF Ticker Issuer Daily Flow (June 26) ETHE Grayscale -$27.4M ETH Grayscale -$12.4M ETHA BlackRock +$5.9M FETH Fidelity +$4.9M ETHW Bitwise +$2.6M Total Net Flow -$26.4M Understanding Grayscale ETHE ‘s Significant Withdrawals The outflows from Grayscale ETHE are a critical component of the overall net outflow figure. For many investors, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) was one of the few avenues available for regulated exposure to Ethereum before the conversion to a spot ETF. Historically, ETHE traded at a significant discount or premium to its underlying net asset value (NAV), creating arbitrage opportunities and unique investment strategies. Upon its conversion to an ETF, ETHE became redeemable at NAV, allowing investors who bought in at a discount to realize profits. Furthermore, Grayscale’s fee structure, which is typically higher than that of newer ETF competitors like BlackRock or Fidelity, incentivizes some investors to rotate their capital into more cost-effective options. This phenomenon was clearly observed with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) following its conversion, where it saw billions in outflows as investors sought lower-fee alternatives or simply cashed out their long-held positions. The pattern with ETHE appears to be following a similar trajectory, representing a natural market adjustment rather than a wholesale rejection of Ethereum as an asset. The Strength of BlackRock ETHA and Other New Entrants While Grayscale faced headwinds, the positive inflows into products like BlackRock ETHA , Fidelity’s FETH, and Bitwise’s ETHW are a strong indicator of robust institutional and retail demand for Ethereum exposure through traditional investment vehicles. These asset managers bring immense credibility, vast distribution networks, and competitive fee structures to the market, making their ETFs attractive to a broad range of investors who might have previously been hesitant to venture directly into the volatile crypto markets. The inflows suggest that new capital is entering the Ethereum ecosystem via these ETFs, potentially from: Traditional Investors: Pension funds, wealth managers, and institutional investors who prefer regulated products over direct crypto holdings. Retail Investors: Individuals seeking simpler, tax-efficient ways to add crypto to their portfolios through their brokerage accounts. Diversification Seekers: Investors looking to diversify their crypto holdings beyond Bitcoin, recognizing Ethereum’s foundational role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. The ability of these new ETFs to attract millions in their initial days, even amidst Grayscale’s outflows, highlights a genuine and growing interest in Ethereum as a legitimate asset class within traditional finance. Navigating Early Crypto Outflows : A Market Perspective Understanding these early crypto outflows requires a balanced perspective. It’s crucial to avoid drawing hasty conclusions based on a single day’s data. The initial phase of any new ETF market is often characterized by significant rebalancing and repositioning of capital. For spot ETH ETFs , this involves a transition from existing trust structures to new, more liquid, and often cheaper ETF formats. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights for investors: Monitor Trends, Not Just Snapshots: A single day’s outflow is less significant than sustained trends over weeks or months. Investors should look for patterns in inflows and outflows to gauge true market sentiment and adoption rates. Distinguish Between Types of Outflows: Not all outflows are negative. Those from Grayscale’s converted trust are often a function of market maturity and fee competition, rather than a lack of interest in Ethereum itself. New Demand is Evident: The consistent inflows into BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise’s offerings confirm that there is new, net demand for Ethereum exposure from a segment of the market that was previously underserved. Volatility is Expected: The crypto market, by nature, is volatile. ETF flows will reflect this, and investors should be prepared for fluctuations as the market matures and reacts to broader economic and regulatory news. The emergence of these ETFs provides significant benefits to investors, offering ease of access, liquidity, and regulatory oversight that were previously unavailable for direct Ethereum investments. However, challenges remain, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the competitive pressures among issuers. The Road Ahead for Spot ETH ETFs : Challenges and Opportunities The journey for spot ETH ETFs has just begun, and while the initial flows provide valuable insights, the true test will be their sustained performance and ability to attract long-term capital. The market is dynamic, and future flows will likely be influenced by several factors: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Development: Continued innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and scalability solutions on the Ethereum blockchain will enhance its appeal as an underlying asset. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment: The overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s performance, often influence investor sentiment towards altcoins like Ethereum. Regulatory Clarity: Further clarity from regulators on crypto assets and related products could encourage more institutional participation. Fee Competition: As the market matures, we can expect fierce competition among ETF issuers, potentially leading to lower fees that could attract even more investors. These ETFs represent a pivotal moment for Ethereum, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. While initial crypto outflows from one major player might grab headlines, the underlying narrative of new capital entering the space through reputable firms like BlackRock and Fidelity paints a hopeful picture for Ethereum’s continued integration into mainstream investment portfolios. Summary: The initial days of U.S. spot ETH ETFs have presented a mixed but ultimately insightful picture. While a net outflow of $26.4 million on June 26 was primarily driven by significant withdrawals from Grayscale’s converted trust ( Grayscale ETHE ), this was counterbalanced by notable inflows into offerings from new players like BlackRock ETHA , Fidelity, and Bitwise. This suggests a rebalancing of capital within the market rather than a fundamental rejection of Ethereum. As the market matures, monitoring sustained trends and understanding the nuances of these flows will be crucial for investors navigating this exciting new frontier in digital asset investment.

With the crypto market heating up, attention is turning towards Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and emerging tokens like Codename:Pepe Crypto. This new token aims to blend humor with serious profits. Modeled after successful predecessors, it promises to leverage AI for better market predictions and trading signals. Is Codename:Pepe the Next Top 10 Meme Coin? In a crypto space flooded with AI buzzwords, most projects fail to deliver. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents and bring real intelligence to the crypto realm. It plans to use AI to track trends, analyze data, and give traders useful insights. Codename:Pepe navigates meme coin chaos, identifying the most relevant and promising projects. Its mascot—modeled after Pepe the Frog, a beloved crypto culture icon—gives it an instant viral appeal. Combining the explosive popularity of memes with the real power of artificial intelligence, Codename:Pepe is a serious contender for the top 10 meme coin. Here are the key features of Codename:Pepe that will make it a standout meme coin soon: Scanning social media and on-chain data to find hottest trending projects Retrieving insider tips to find the most lucrative offers Generating AI-powered forecasts and reports to give investors an edge Giving access to exclusive analysis and early trading signals. Beyond its analytical capabilities, Codename:Pepe will feature a fully automated AI-trader that will execute trades based on advanced algorithms. This would create a passive income stream, as the system will be designed to seek out profitable opportunities. Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Tokens - the key to unlocking this sophisticated trading ecosystem $AGNT is the native meme coin powering Codename:Pepe. Holding $AGNT will unlock access to an exclusive decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)—a private club where investors can manage their portfolios, vote on strategies, and receive insider analytics. Beyond governance and staking rewards, $AGNT holders will gain access to premium AI-trading tools exclusive reports the AI-powered launchpad for launching new tokens. $AGNT tokens are currently sold for pennies. As part of the Initial Coin Offering their price is reduced greatly. Now at the twentieth stage $AGNT costs $0.023809. The project is already a half way through its 28-stage presale, with the final stage price set at $1 per token. The earlier you buy, the bigger the discount. Security-wise, Codename:Pepe isn’t playing around. This project has been audited by Pessimistic, a top-tier blockchain security firm. So while many meme coins crumble under the weight of their own hype, Codename:Pepe stands on a rock-solid foundation (of memes and math, but mostly memes). With AI-powered insights, automated trading, and a healthy dose of absurdity, Codename:Pepe claims its spot in the top 10 meme coins. Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals Dogecoin Faces Price Challenges Amid Market Downturn Dogecoin's price has been slipping recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 4.04%. In the past month, it fell by 27.24%. Looking back six months, the price decreased by 47.42%. The current price ranges between $0.1357 and $0.1746. The nearest support level is at $0.1198. If the price falls below this, it might continue to drop. The nearest resistance is at $0.1976. If the price can break through this level, it could rise further. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.38. An RSI of 45.38 suggests that DOGE is not overbought or oversold. This could indicate a potential for price stabilization. However, the recent downward trends may continue if market sentiment remains negative. Based on the data, Dogecoin's price may continue to fall unless it finds support. Breaking through the resistance at $0.1976 could lead to a rise. Investors should watch these levels closely. Shiba Inu's Price Dips: Is a Rebound on the Horizon? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced a challenging period lately. Over the past month, its price has dropped by 19.29%, adding to a six-month decline of 46.31%. In the last week, the coin saw a slight decrease of 0.51%. Currently trading between $0.000009667 and $0.00001194, SHIB is showing signs of stabilization after the sharp declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SHIB stands at 49.01, indicating a neutral market position. This suggests that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, potentially setting the stage for a price movement. Traders are watching closely to see if SHIB can break out of its current trend. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $0.00001326. A move to this level would represent an increase of approximately 21% from the current price. Breaking through this resistance could signal a bullish reversal. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.000008723. A drop to this level would mean a decline of about 17%. Given the recent price stability and the neutral RSI, SHIB could be poised for a rebound. However, the significant declines over the past months suggest caution. If SHIB can maintain its current support and challenge the resistance, there may be potential for growth. Traders should monitor the price action closely in the coming days. Pepe Coin Nears Key Resistance Level Pepe (PEPE) is trading between $0.0000076027 and $0.0000108587. This puts the coin close to its nearest resistance at $0.0000128373. Investors are watching to see if Pepe can break through this barrier. If the price climbs above the resistance level, it could signal a bullish trend. This would represent a gain of about 18% from the current upper price range. However, if Pepe's price falls, it may test the nearest support at $0.0000063253. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of around 17% from the current lower price range. The coin's movement towards these key levels will determine its next direction. Traders are monitoring the situation closely as Pepe approaches critical points. Bonk Coin Approaches Key Price Levels Bonk (BONK) is currently trading between $0.00001030 and $0.00001502. This range places the coin close to its nearest resistance level at $0.00001781. If BONK manages to break through this resistance, it could signal a significant upward movement. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.000008373. This support may prevent the price from falling further if a downward trend occurs. Traders are keeping an eye on this level as a potential rebound point. Considering the current price range, there's potential for BONK to rise by about 18% if it reaches the resistance at $0.00001781. Breaking this level could lead to increased buying interest and push the price even higher. Conversely, if the price drops to the support level, it would represent a decrease of approximately 44% from the current high end of the trading range. This significant drop could attract buyers looking for a bargain, possibly leading to a price recovery. Conclusion Although coins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK have attracted attention, their short-term growth potential appears limited. Investors searching for significant returns might consider emerging alternatives that offer innovative approaches. Codename:Pepe crypto is positioning itself as a unique contender by integrating artificial intelligence to analyze the meme coin market. It provides users with exclusive trading signals and automated trading capabilities. Additionally, holding this coin grants membership in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), offering access to insider analytics and strategic decision-making. With a capped supply and community-driven model, Codename:Pepe crypto aims to maximize profits in the current bullish market.

CryptoQuant Analyst Spots Key Accumulation Signal,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-altseason-coming-cryptoquant-analyst-spots-key-accumulation-signal/,"The post Is Altseason Coming? CryptoQuant Analyst Spots Key Accumulation Signal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. has spotted a potential early sign of a new altcoin wave. In a recent post on X, he revealed that altcoin exchange inflows have dropped sharply – something that’s often followed by strong market rallies. Could this be the start of the next “altseason”? As of June 27, the average monthly altcoin exchange flow stands at $1.6B, below the annual average of $2.5B. This moderate flow suggests asset consolidation and growing accumulation potential ahead of the next altseason wave. On the chart, green circles highlight periods when… pic.twitter.com/VmNjgJLXbG — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 27, 2025 Let’s break down what’s happening. Exchange Inflows Plummet: A Bullish Omen? Adler Jr. noted that the usual monthly inflow of altcoin exchanges has declined by 36%, falling from an annual average of $2.5 billion to only $1.6 billion as of June 27, 2025. This $900 million decline suggests reduced selling pressure, as investors are holding onto their assets rather than liquidating. Historically, these small inflows have anticipated significant altcoin price rises, as seen during the jumps from August to September 2024 and throughout the second half of 2023. Adler Jr. noted that in all instances, minimal trading activity preceded significant altcoin price increases, fostering optimism among traders. Why Lower Inflows Can Be Bullish for Altcoins So, why does this matter? When less capital is moving into crypto exchanges, it usually means there’s less selling happening. Instead, investors might be accumulating, waiting for the next move up. CryptoQuant’s data shows that when inflows fall below $1.6 billion, it often sets the stage for a strong altcoin rally. It signals a shift – away from short-term speculation and toward long-term holding. Sometimes, capital temporarily moves into Bitcoin first, before flowing back into altcoins with more strength. This pattern often builds up momentum. And when that momentum swings back to altcoins, prices can surge quickly. A Shift Is Happening – Is Altseason Next? Right now, the market seems to be in a transition phase. The drop in exchange inflows is a classic sign of quiet accumulation, which often comes before a rally. If this pattern holds, it could align with a broader market recovery and renewed risk appetite. So the big question: is the next altcoin rally around the corner? If history repeats, we might be witnessing the early signs of another breakout. Stay tuned – the market could be gearing up for a major shift.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading Shiba Inu's Potential Unleashed: A 2025 Outlook Shiba Inu began in 2020 as a meme coin aiming to ride the hype of Dogecoin. Built on Ethereum's blockchain using the ERC-20 standard, SHIB quickly gained attention from figures like Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. What started as a simple payment token soon evolved into something much bigger. Seeing its growing popularity, the creators expanded SHIB's ecosystem. They launched a decentralized exchange and an NFT project, attracting even more users. Plans for a metaverse, games, and even a magazine show SHIB's ambition to offer real utility beyond being a meme. SHIB experienced a meteoric rise in 2020 and 2021, reaching an all-time high in October 2021. Although it fell from its peak, the coin stabilized in the following months. This resilience suggests that SHIB might have staying power in the unpredictable crypto market. In the current market cycle, SHIB's extensive ecosystem and active community make it an intriguing prospect. While new meme coins pop up, SHIB's ability to evolve and offer more utilities could help it stand out. Its ongoing projects may attract new users, especially if there's another crypto bull run. Long-term predictions are cautiously optimistic. Some analyses suggest SHIB could see significant gains in the coming years, potentially reaching new heights by 2030. While forecasts vary, the coin's development and community support could drive future growth. Conclusion In conclusion, Shiba Inu (SHIB) exhibits strong technical indicators that suggest a significant upward movement. The 'Second Low' pattern points to a possible surge, potentially reaching remarkable new heights. Other coins may not share this immediate potential in the short term.

In a significant move towards shaping a more favorable environment for digital innovation, on-chain financial services platform Avalon Labs recently announced a pivotal discussion with the Bitcoin Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. This collaboration marks a crucial step in advocating for a robust and innovation-friendly regulatory framework in the United States. What is Avalon Labs’ Vision for Crypto Innovation? Avalon Labs (AVL) operates as an on-chain financial services platform, dedicated to building infrastructure that supports the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Their core mission revolves around fostering a secure, efficient, and accessible financial future powered by blockchain technology. Their engagement with key policy-making bodies like the Bitcoin Policy Institute underscores their commitment not just to technological development, but also to shaping the regulatory landscape that will allow these innovations to thrive. By actively participating in these dialogues, Avalon Labs aims to ensure that future regulations are informed, balanced, and conducive to growth, rather than stifling it. The Bitcoin Policy Institute : A Key Voice in D.C.? The Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating policymakers and the public about Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space. Based in Washington, D.C., BPI plays a vital role in advocating for sound public policy that supports the development and adoption of decentralized technologies. Their work involves research, advocacy, and direct engagement with lawmakers to ensure that the unique properties and benefits of cryptocurrencies are understood within legislative circles. Their collaboration with Avalon Labs highlights a shared objective: to create an environment where innovation in the digital asset space can flourish without undue regulatory burdens. Why is Regulatory Clarity So Crucial for the U.S. Crypto Industry ? The absence of clear and consistent regulation has long been a significant hurdle for the U.S. crypto industry . This ambiguity creates uncertainty for businesses, investors, and developers alike. Here’s why regulatory clarity is not just beneficial, but essential: Fosters Innovation: Without clear rules, companies hesitate to invest heavily in new technologies and services, fearing potential legal repercussions. Clarity encourages research, development, and the launch of new products. Attracts Investment: Institutional investors and traditional financial firms are often wary of entering markets with unclear regulatory landscapes. Defined rules provide the confidence needed to deploy significant capital. Protects Consumers: While often seen as a burden, well-crafted regulations can protect consumers from fraud and market manipulation, building trust in the ecosystem. Ensures Global Competitiveness: Other nations are actively developing comprehensive crypto frameworks. The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish its own clear path, potentially losing talent and capital to more hospitable jurisdictions. Reduces Legal Costs: Companies currently spend significant resources navigating a patchwork of state and federal regulations. Clarity can streamline compliance and reduce operational overhead. Unpacking the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA): A Game Changer? During their discussion, Avalon Labs specifically expressed its support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA). This proposed legislation aims to provide much-needed clarity for certain entities operating in the blockchain space. At its core, the BRCA seeks to exempt blockchain developers and providers of non-custodial blockchain services from certain money transmission laws, provided they do not take custody of consumer funds. The implications of the BRCA are significant: It distinguishes between entities that hold user assets (like exchanges) and those that simply build the underlying technology (like software developers or decentralized protocol creators). By providing this distinction, it aims to prevent innovative projects from being inadvertently caught under outdated financial regulations designed for traditional intermediaries. This could significantly reduce the compliance burden for many blockchain innovators, encouraging more development directly within the U.S. Avalon Labs views the BRCA as a crucial step towards achieving the regulatory clarity the crypto industry desperately needs to mature and integrate more seamlessly into the broader financial system. Shaping the Future of the U.S. Crypto Industry : What’s Next? The dialogue between Avalon Labs and the Bitcoin Policy Institute is more than just a single meeting; it represents a growing trend of proactive engagement between industry players and policymakers. As the digital asset space continues its rapid evolution, such collaborations are essential to ensure that legislation is both informed by technological realities and aligned with the goals of fostering innovation while safeguarding market integrity. The path to comprehensive regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the U.S. is ongoing, but these direct conversations in Washington, D.C., are foundational. They help bridge the knowledge gap between complex decentralized technologies and the traditional legislative process. As Avalon Labs stated, they look forward to continuing these vital conversations and contributing to the broader progress of the industry. The future success of the U.S. as a leader in blockchain and crypto innovation hinges on its ability to craft forward-thinking regulations. Initiatives like the support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act are pivotal in demonstrating the industry’s commitment to working constructively with lawmakers to achieve a thriving, regulated, and innovative digital economy.

Pepe Coin ( PEPE ) has fallen to a low of $0.0000090, bringing its market capitalization to approximately $3.86 billion, down from its all-time high of $10 billion. The decline follows broader weakness in the cryptocurrency market, with most altcoins experiencing significant pullbacks. Ethereum ( ETH ) has dropped to $2,435 from a monthly high of $2,800, while the total market capitalization of all crypto tokens has slipped to $3.28 trillion. Still, PEPE is flashing some bullish signals that may support a rebound in the coming weeks. Whale holdings have increased by 7.20% over the past 30 days, rising to 7.61 trillion tokens, a sign that large holders expect a recovery. This accumulation trend has continued even as prices declined.

Exchange balances have also dropped to 248.1 trillion, down 2.3% in 30 days. Investors typically withdraw tokens from exchanges when they anticipate higher prices ahead. Another potential bullish catalyst is the token’s undervaluation. The MVRV indicator has dropped to -0.45, meaning PEPE’s market value is lower than its realized value. Historically, a falling MVRV score often precedes bullish reversals. MVRV indicator and whale accumulation | Source: Santiment Pepe price technical analysis PEPE price chart | Source: crypto.news From a technical perspective, PEPE is showing signs of a potential rebound. The token has been forming a falling wedge pattern, defined by two descending, converging trendlines. The upper trendline connects lower highs since May 23, while the lower trendline tracks support levels from May 11. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index is nearing oversold territory, indicating that the ongoing downtrend may be close to exhaustion. If this pattern resolves to the upside, as falling wedges often do, PEPE could rally toward the key resistance level at $0.000015, a move that would represent a 65% gain from current levels.

Citing a BlackRock study from September 2024, the report notes that Bitcoin has historically delivered an average return of 37% in the 60 days following major geopolitical events dating back to 2020. Following the most recent episode of geopolitical tension, Bitcoin saw a swift rebound, though analysts caution that it remains unclear whether this initial recovery will result in sustained outperformance.

The move could redefine how digital marketplaces scale. Bolt Financial Inc., the one-click checkout platform that recently partnered with billionaire Peter Thiel’s data analytics firm Palantir Technologies to deliver AI-enhanced payments, has announced two updates targeting some of the most persistent bottlenecks in online commerce. On June 27, the San Francisco-based firm introduced Bolt Connect, a new integration layer that allows marketplaces to onboard merchants with a single click, alongside native support for stablecoin payments. The dual rollout marks a notable expansion of Bolt’s backend infrastructure offerings, as the company shifts focus from front-end user experience to solving legacy pain points under the hood. You might also like: Doge ETF inches toward approval as Bitwise updates filing Bolt’s deepening infrastructure play Bolt’s latest infrastructure update addresses one of digital commerce’s most persistent dilemmas: the trade-off between rapid growth and operational sustainability. While most marketplaces historically faced mounting complexity with each new merchant, Bolt Connect rearchitects the foundation to eliminate traditional scaling barriers. According to the announcement, Bolt Connect’s automated merchant onboarding reduces what was typically a days-long verification process to near-instant approval, while maintaining compliance through built-in regulatory checks. This technical leap could be especially transformative for platforms expanding internationally, where cross-border documentation and payment processing have traditionally required specialized legal and financial teams. Simultaneously, Bolt’s support for stablecoin payments targets the transactional layer of global commerce. The company says this addition enables merchants to access funds immediately, bypassing traditional banking settlement delays. The implications go beyond speed: by sidestepping card networks and correspondent banks, Bolt’s system dramatically reduces the percentage-based fees that eat into marketplace margins. “Marketplaces shouldn’t have to choose between scale and simplicity,” said Ryan Breslow, Founder and CEO of Bolt. “With Bolt Connect, we’re giving them the tools to grow without the usual technical burden, while stablecoin support opens the door to faster, borderless payments for everyone in the network.” Bolt’s strategic pivot toward backend infrastructure reflects a growing recognition in fintech: user experience alone isn’t enough to solve the structural inefficiencies of digital commerce. While Bolt’s earlier products focused on consumer-facing improvements like one-click checkout, these latest developments aim at the operational plumbing that determines whether marketplaces can scale, or stall.

Berlin asked Deepseek to withdraw its app from German app stores in May or introduce adequate data safeguards to protect local users’ data. Europe’s privacy watchdog had also previously raised concerns about the Chinese platform , warning that the chatbot could face further enforcement actions. Deepseek has been in European countries for months In early February, privacy regulators across Europe deliberated on Deepseek’s data security risks , shortly after Italy barred the chatbot over its opacity on how it handles user data. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also raised alarms over the app’s data collection practices. The meeting concluded with countries warning that further action could be taken against the platform, and this Friday, Germany put pressure on Apple and Google to remove the app from their stores. This comes after Deepseek did not comply with the German government’s request to remove the platform from app stores. On Friday, Berlin data protection commissioner Meike Kamp commented , “Chinese authorities have far-reaching rights to access personal data. DeepSeek users don’t have enforceable rights and effective legal remedies available to them in China, like they’re guaranteed in the European Union.” He added that both Apple and Google must promptly take note of the notice and determine how they will comply. The German regulator, however, had the option of imposing a fine on Deepseek, instead of warning the two companies. Still, Kamp opted against it, knowing the penalty can’t be enforced in China. Deepseek has not made it clear when it plans to release its R2 model Meanwhile, Deepseek has yet to clarify the release of its R2 model, which many are waiting on, especially after the success of its R1 language model, touted by the Chinese startup as a cost-effective rival to larger US systems. On Thursday, CEO Liang Wenfeng stated that he was unsatisfied with R2’s current performance, which could explain the delayed release. Users had hoped for a May rollout. However, staff working in Chinese cloud platforms providing DeepSeek models to businesses revealed that R2’s release was stalled due to difficulties obtaining Nvidia server chips due to tightened US export policies. They believe that increased demand for the new model would also strain cloud firms that need Nvidia chips to run AI models. The platform’s R1 model still heavily depends on Nvidia’s H20 chips. So far, Deepseek has maintained contact with Chinese cloud companies, providing direction on technical requirements to help them prepare for model deployment and distribution. Nevertheless, China’s Cloud companies are not the only ones in for a loss. Speaking on the export restrictions, Nvidia’s billionaire chief executive, Jensen Huang, claimed they may have to take a $5.5 billion loss on the H20 AI chips meant for the Chinese market to maintain compliance. He asked the US government to reconsider its chip ban and allow the company to win back the Chinese market. He argued that if the US wants to lead in tech, they have work to maximize its output, not lower it, hinting that other countries could easily overtake it. Currently, Nvidia controls only about 50% of the Chinese market, down from about 95% at the start of Biden’s administration in 2021.

King Karan posed a direct question to his followers, asking whether they genuinely believe that XRP could ever reach $10,000. In response, Xena XRP delivered a strong and detailed reply, asserting unwavering confidence in the future value of XRP. She emphasized that her position is not based on mere belief but on conviction grounded in past experiences and an understanding of the broader landscape. Without a doubt…and it's not a belief. It will. I know, I know. Some people always say : let's cross ATH first. But that's not the point. When articles said Bitcoin will reach $1M people said let's reach $1000 first. Look at the price today. And many regret not holding a… https://t.co/DHtcauZGFt — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) June 25, 2025 Drawing Parallels from Bitcoin and Ethereum History Xena XRP pointed out that skepticism towards XRP mirrors the same sentiment that once surrounded Bitcoin and Ethereum during their early stages. She reminded readers that when articles predicted Bitcoin reaching $1 million, critics dismissed such projections and insisted on focusing first on hitting $1,000. Today, Bitcoin trades significantly higher, and many who doubted regret not having invested earlier. Xena reflected on her own experience, sharing that she acquired Bitcoin when it was priced between $200 and $600 and Ethereum when it was just $5. At the time, many dismissed the possibility of substantial gains, yet those investments turned out to be highly rewarding. She stated that the same type of dismissive commentary now surrounds XRP, with critics frequently repeating the phrase “let’s cross all-time high first” whenever long-term price projections are discussed. Xena stressed that such thought is common among individuals who believe they have all the necessary information, but in reality, lack the full picture. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Referencing Ripple Connections and Riddles Xena XRP further explained her confidence by pointing to longstanding hints within the XRP ecosystem. She referenced the well-known XRP community figure Bearableguy123, claiming he appears to have an insider-level understanding of Ripple’s plans. She highlighted that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse follows Bearableguy123, and Ripple CTO David Schwartz used to follow him as well before facing criticism for doing so. According to Xena, this consistent engagement over the years suggests that Bearableguy123’s advice to “persevere” should not be ignored. She also brought up the frequently discussed number 589 , a figure often mentioned within the XRP community. Xena questioned why Ripple consistently referenced this number, even though the $589 XRP price prediction by the end of 2018 did not materialize. She suggested that Ripple’s leadership, including Brad Garlinghouse, somewhat knows that the number is significant. Trusting the Founders Over the Critics Xena XRP challenged followers to decide whose opinions carry more weight. She contrasted the views of what she referred to as “X haters” and random skeptics with the statements from Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto and CTO David Schwartz. She referenced Arthur Britto’s well-circulated statement that XRP was designed to reach $10,000, emphasizing that even if such a figure were incorrect by several thousand dollars, the implication is still that XRP could hit a substantially high price point. She concluded her response by encouraging people to choose which side they trust. Whether to align with those who dismiss XRP’s potential or to trust the insights of Ripple’s co-founders and individuals who, according to her, understand the project’s true scope. Xena made it clear that she opted for the latter and expressed no doubt in XRP reaching $10,000 , reinforcing that conviction with both historical examples and perceived insider signals.

This just goes to show that the mounting institutional involvement in crypto is, in part, responsible for the correlation, but that’s a topic for another discussion. Even though Bitcoin is trading almost flat on the weekly chart, the past seven days have been anything but calm. Naturally, most of the volatility had to do with the war between Iran and Israel. Around June 23rd, BTC dropped below $100K for the first time since early May, sending the markets into a state of discomfort and causing over $1 billion worth of liquidated positions. This was caused mostly because of the news that the US had decided to enter the war on the side of Israel and bomb strategic nuclear sites in Iran. The turmoil didn’t stop there, but doomsayers had it all wrong because on the very next day, the situation started de-escalating following what many believed to be a staged retaliation by Iran targeting a US base in Qatar, causing minor damage. Following this situation, US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire and despite the minor tensions, it appears that the conflict is now subdued. Markets reacted positively, with BTC rallying from the sub-$100K region to a high at around $108,000. At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $107,000, but the majority of altcoins, as you can see in the heatmap below, took a much more considerable punch. Many of them are down between 4% and 10%, signaling, once again at Bitcoin’s unshakable dominance in the past few months. In other news, one of the more interesting developments came from Chainlink as Mastercard – one of the world’s leading payment processing companies – announced a partnership with the aims of enabling its 3 billion users to seamlessly buy crypto. This is what adoption looks like. Another are that many are monitoring closely is the legal battle between the US SEC and Ripple. A lot of people were expecting the case to officially end this week, but the presiding judge tossed the parties’ motion for indicative ruling, which means that the whole thing will be dragged out, possibly for another few months. It all depends on Ripple now. All in all, the market fared very well in the face of mounting geopolitical turmoil and economic instability, but it’s very interesting to see how things will develop in the weeks to come.

Over the past couple of weeks, market participants have sold about 720,000 BTC, the majority of which was off-loaded by relatively new holders. It’s very impressive that the market was able to absorb this quantity without falling off a cliff. Last Time Bitcoin Did This, the Price Went From $60K to $100K. The LTH/STH ratio is creeping up . This particularly positive on-chain metric has previously been the precursor to massive rallies such as the one from $28K to $60K and from $60K to $100,000.

The relisting is complementary to the company’s overall Bitcoin-driven strategy. The firm confirmed that, as of a September issue date, more than 10 million of its common stock—listed on the ticker “BTCT”—are issued and outstanding, already sold in the recent brokered offering. The $92 million gross proceeds resulted from a raise of 125 million Canadian dollars, in which BTCT sold 426,650 shares at CA$10 ($7.32) each. The shares have a four-month and one-day holding period. BTCT Buys 292.8 BTC to Power Institutional Lending Initiative BTCT has put some of the raise to use buying 292.8 BTC for around $31.5 million. It is BTCT’s first meaningful Bitcoin buy under its new lending and accumulation initiative. For BTCT, the Bitcoin will be used to offer liquidity services to clients, so it is not just an asset, but a lending and capital optimization tool. The firm will release a “Bitcoin per share” figure after acquisition period, so that shareholders will be able to get more clarity on the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Long-Term Holders Push BTC Supply to Record Levels BTCT’s strategy is part of an overall movement in the crypto space, with long-term holders not even considering selling despite recent price spikes. CryptoQuant data indicates there has been a 800,000 BTC 30-day record accumulation in wallets that have not sold since at least six months ago. CryptoQuant’s analyst Darkfost points out this as a “key signal” for sentiment, as it shows major holders are still bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term value despite institutional investors such as BTCT engaging actively in the market.",Bitcoin|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-27 13:50:11

This isn’t just a one-off purchase; it’s part of a larger, carefully planned strategy to build a substantial Bitcoin portfolio. The funds for this significant Bitcoin investment are sourced from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund, a specialized vehicle designed to navigate the complexities of the crypto space. The firm’s decision to allocate such substantial capital towards Bitcoin highlights a growing confidence among traditional investment entities in the long-term viability and value proposition of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic move by Belgravia Hartford is indicative of a broader shift, where established players are no longer just observing the crypto market but actively participating and shaping its future. Their methodical approach, utilizing regulated channels like Coinsquare’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, further solidifies the legitimacy and maturity of the crypto ecosystem. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Work? Understanding the Mechanics For those new to institutional crypto investments, understanding the mechanics behind Belgravia Hartford’s strategy is key. This latest $1 million drawdown is not a direct purchase from an open exchange but rather a structured financing agreement. Here’s a breakdown of how this particular Bitcoin investment is executed: The Source Fund: The capital originates from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund. This fund likely pools money from various investors, including Belgravia Hartford, and specializes in digital asset strategies. The Drawdown Mechanism: A “drawdown” in this context refers to Belgravia Hartford accessing a pre-arranged line of credit or capital commitment from the Round13 fund. This particular drawdown is the second of its kind, part of a larger $5 million financing agreement. Purpose-Specific Funds: Crucially, these funds are explicitly designated for one purpose: to buy Bitcoin. This specificity ensures transparency and adherence to the investment firm’s stated digital asset strategy. Regulated Trading Desk: The actual acquisition of Bitcoin is conducted through Coinsquare’s regulated over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk. OTC desks are preferred by institutions for large volume trades as they minimize market impact and offer better pricing, often without revealing the trade size publicly. Coinsquare’s status as a regulated entity adds an extra layer of security and compliance, which is paramount for a publicly traded firm like Belgravia Hartford. Financing Terms: The financing agreement comes with a variable interest rate, which is tied to the Bank of Canada’s prime rate. This detail indicates a sophisticated financial arrangement, typical of institutional lending and borrowing, designed to manage costs effectively. This structured approach allows Belgravia Hartford to systematically accumulate Bitcoin while managing their capital exposure and leveraging established financial partnerships. It’s a testament to the increasing sophistication of how traditional finance is integrating with the digital asset space. The Significance of the Round13 Digital Asset Fund Partnership The collaboration with the Round13 Digital Asset Fund is a cornerstone of Belgravia Hartford’s strategy. This partnership is more than just a source of capital; it represents a strategic alignment with a specialized fund that understands the nuances of the cryptocurrency market. Why is this significant? Expertise and Access: Round13 Digital Asset Fund likely possesses deep expertise in crypto markets, including research, risk management, and access to unique investment opportunities that might not be readily available to traditional firms. Streamlined Acquisition: By partnering with a fund focused on digital assets, Belgravia Hartford can streamline its acquisition process, relying on Round13’s infrastructure and market connections. Risk Management: A specialized fund can offer sophisticated risk management strategies tailored for volatile crypto assets, potentially mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with direct market exposure. Scalability: The $5 million financing agreement suggests a long-term plan for substantial Bitcoin accumulation. The fund provides a scalable mechanism for Belgravia Hartford to increase its crypto holdings over time without immediate large capital outlays from its primary balance sheet. This type of partnership underscores a growing trend where traditional financial institutions are leveraging the expertise of crypto-native funds to gain exposure to digital assets, rather than building the entire infrastructure in-house. It reflects a maturing market where collaboration is key to navigating the evolving landscape. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Belgravia Hartford’s continued commitment to Bitcoin through structured drawdowns sends a strong message about the future of institutional crypto adoption. Their actions are not isolated but fit into a broader narrative of increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Here are some key implications: Validation and Legitimacy: When publicly traded firms like Belgravia Hartford allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it lends further credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. It signals to other traditional investors that cryptocurrencies are becoming a serious component of diversified portfolios. Market Maturation: The use of regulated OTC desks and structured financing agreements, as seen with this crypto drawdown , points to the maturation of the market infrastructure. This makes it easier and safer for large institutions to participate. Diversification Strategy: For many institutional investors, Bitcoin and other digital assets represent a new frontier for diversification. They offer a potential hedge against inflation, a non-correlated asset, and exposure to a rapidly evolving technological paradigm. Belgravia Hartford’s move exemplifies this diversification play. Precedent Setting: Each major institutional entry or increased allocation sets a precedent, potentially encouraging other firms that have been on the sidelines to reconsider their stance. The domino effect of institutional crypto adoption could accelerate significantly in the coming years. The growing comfort level of these firms with the inherent volatility of crypto, coupled with their focus on long-term strategic accumulation, indicates a fundamental shift in how digital assets are perceived within the global financial system. This institutional embrace is crucial for the long-term stability and growth of the crypto market. Analyzing the Impact of this Crypto Drawdown on Market Sentiment Every significant institutional move, like Belgravia Hartford’s latest crypto drawdown , can influence market sentiment. While a single $1 million purchase might seem small in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization, its symbolic weight is considerable. What impact might this have? Positive Signal: The consistent buying pressure from institutional entities provides a positive signal to retail and other institutional investors. It suggests that “smart money” continues to see value in Bitcoin, even amidst market fluctuations. Supply Dynamics: While OTC trades don’t directly impact spot exchange prices in the same way retail trades do, they represent Bitcoin being taken off the open market and held by long-term investors. This gradual reduction in liquid supply can contribute to price appreciation over time. Increased Confidence: News of institutional accumulation often boosts overall confidence in the market, potentially attracting more capital inflows. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is an asset for the future, not just a speculative fad. Regulatory Comfort: The emphasis on regulated platforms like Coinsquare also helps to assuage concerns about regulatory uncertainty. Institutions opting for compliant channels sends a message that the industry is professionalizing. This ongoing accumulation by firms like Belgravia Hartford is a quiet but powerful force, slowly but surely absorbing Bitcoin supply and embedding it deeper into the traditional financial fabric. It’s a key indicator of Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a globally recognized and accepted store of value and investment asset. Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights for Investors Belgravia Hartford’s strategy offers valuable lessons for all types of investors interested in the digital asset space. Benefits of Institutional Bitcoin Investment: Diversification: Bitcoin can offer portfolio diversification due to its relatively low correlation with traditional assets. Potential for High Returns: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Early Mover Advantage (for traditional finance): Firms entering now are positioning themselves to capitalize on the long-term growth of the digital economy. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant swings, posing risks for short-term investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can introduce unpredictability. Security Risks: While institutional platforms are robust, the digital nature of assets means security remains a paramount concern. Market Manipulation: Despite growing maturity, the crypto market can still be susceptible to large movements based on news or whale activity. Actionable Insights for Retail Investors: While most retail investors don’t have access to multi-million dollar drawdowns from digital asset funds, Belgravia Hartford’s approach provides valuable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investors often adopt a long-term “hodling” strategy. This suggests that daily price fluctuations are less important than the asset’s long-term value proposition. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): The repeated $1 million drawdowns mimic a form of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy where one invests a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This can mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak. Importance of Regulated Platforms: Belgravia Hartford uses Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk. For retail investors, this translates to choosing reputable, regulated exchanges that prioritize security and compliance. Diversification within Crypto: While Belgravia Hartford is focusing on Bitcoin, a broader crypto portfolio might include other strong projects for retail investors, though Bitcoin remains the institutional favorite. Conclusion: Belgravia Hartford’s Strategic Play Reinforces Bitcoin’s Institutional Trajectory Belgravia Hartford Capital’s latest $1 million crypto drawdown to acquire Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s evolving role in institutional portfolios. This strategic move, facilitated by the Round13 Digital Asset Fund and executed through Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk, highlights a calculated and confident approach to digital asset integration. As traditional investment firms increasingly recognize the long-term value and diversification benefits of cryptocurrencies, actions like these pave the way for broader institutional crypto adoption. It signifies a future where digital assets are not just an alternative investment but a core component of sophisticated financial strategies. The steady accumulation by entities like Belgravia Hartford quietly reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a robust and legitimate asset, signaling a continued bullish outlook for its institutional trajectory.

Bakkt Moves Toward Direct Bitcoin Investment Publicly traded digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings has filed a $1 billion shelf registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a pivotal step in its strategic pivot toward cryptocurrency treasury allocations. The filing, submitted on June 26, 2025, grants Bakkt the authority to sell a range of securities, including Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt instruments, and warrants in one or more future offerings. This development follows a policy revision earlier this month, enabling Bakkt to invest directly in Bitcoin and other digital assets. While the company has not disclosed any purchases yet, the filing confirms it could use proceeds from this shelf offering to fund crypto acquisitions. In its prospectus, the company stated, “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources.” Strategic Pivot and Business Headwinds A subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt has navigated a challenging year. In March 2025, the company announced it was losing major clients, Bank of America and Webull, triggering a 30% decline in its share price. Further complicating matters, Bakkt disclosed in the filing that its loyalty services segment faces possible divestiture as it sharpens its focus on crypto infrastructure offerings. Bakkt’s revised investment policy is part of a broader repositioning. Co-CEO Akshay Naheta described the plan as a move to “transform Bakkt into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company.” The strategy also includes partnerships, such as a March agreement with Distributed Technologies Research Global Ltd. to enhance crypto payment-processing capabilities. Regulatory Risks and Market Positioning The SEC filing outlines extensive risk factors, with regulatory uncertainty remaining a significant concern. Bakkt warned that evolving legal frameworks, potential classification of digital assets as securities, and disruptions to banking services could materially affect operations. The company also flagged cybersecurity threats and operational complexities in integrating new digital assets. If Bakkt proceeds with a Bitcoin allocation, it would join an expanding list of public firms adding crypto to their balance sheets. At Bitcoin’s current price of $106,800, a full $1 billion investment would secure approximately 9,364 BTC, positioning Bakkt just ahead of Coinbase on the list of top publicly traded Bitcoin holders. Following news of the shelf offering, Bakkt’s Class A shares (NYSE: BKKT) rose 3% to $13.33 on Thursday. However, the stock remains down 46% year-to-date.

Should the selling at this level pressure intensify, a deeper decline toward the $2K support zone may follow. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH recently broke down from its ascending flag pattern, triggering a corrective phase. After finding strong support around the $2.1K level, the cryptocurrency bounced and retraced toward the broken trendline at $2.4K, where it now appears to be encountering resistance. Despite the rebound, the lack of significant volatility and waning momentum around this key level suggests that buyers are exhausted. If the selling pressure intensifies here, ETH is likely to complete its pullback and extend its correction. In this case, the $2K mark is emerging as the next key defensive zone where the bulls may attempt to regain control. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour timeframe, ETH initially found strong support within the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, a historically reliable level during corrections. The sharp reaction from this range led to a quick move upward. However, the rally has now stalled precisely at the previous flag’s lower boundary, which currently acts as resistance near $2.4K. This rejection increases the probability of another downward leg, unless the buyers are able to swiftly reclaim control. The $2.1K zone, which overlaps with the Fib support, remains a key battleground. As long as this area holds, the market structure retains a bullish bias. If breached, however, it may pave the way for a deeper decline toward $2,000. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan The funding rate metric serves as a crucial gauge of trader sentiment within the futures market. Typically, in a healthy and sustainable uptrend, funding rates increase steadily, reflecting growing interest from long position traders across both the perpetual futures and spot markets. However, recent trends reveal a decline in Ethereum’s funding rates, signalling waning bullish momentum and potential buyer fatigue. This shift raises the probability of a short-term rejection and deeper corrective movement. That said, as funding rates approach the neutral zone near zero, it may suggest a reset in leveraged positions, indicating that the market is cooling off. This environment often precedes renewed demand and could pave the way for a strong bullish continuation once the current consolidation phase concludes.

Although the acquisition has not been announced, recent news and developments show that the retailing giant is seriously contemplating using XRP's blockchain technology. What will this potentially do for consumers, merchants, and the future of online payments? Let's discuss. Amazon's Interest in XRP In June 2025, news that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is already looking into using Ripple's XRP for payment on its sites sent the cryptocurrency community into a frenzy. During an official AWS panel, an AWS representative revealed that there is actually a dedicated team working with Ripple closely to explore the best opportunities for XRP integration, in collaboration with consumer platforms and merchants alike. While neither Amazon nor Ripple has confirmed anything yet, the mere fact that AWS is in discussion phases regarding XRP is significant. Amazon's huge global reach makes it so that any move in the direction of crypto payments would make a difference in the industry on an even larger level. XRP enthusiasts have hailed this as a move towards crypto adoption from theory to practice. How Would XRP Work on Amazon? If Amazon were to accept XRP as a form of payment, it would be a revolutionary shift in the world of e-commerce. Here's how it could go down: XRP's blockchain can process transactions in seconds, compared to traditional payment systems that may take days to settle. XRP payments have low transaction fees, which would be beneficial to both Amazon and customers. RippleNet, the network that underlies XRP, connects banks and payment providers across the world, making cross-border payments fast and frictionless. Ripple's xVia API makes it easy to integrate, allowing Amazon to accept payments in XRP into its existing infrastructure with little to no modification. For the consumer, it could mean paying with XRP at the checkout point, with immediate confirmation and lower fees. For Amazon, it could mean new markets, especially where traditional banking is inaccessible or expensive. Ripple's Enterprise Edge Ripple, the company behind XRP issuance, spent years building connections with banks, payments firms, and regulators across the globe. Its technology is already being used by over 100 institutions, including major banks like Santander and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Ripple's products—xCurrent for immediate payments, xRapid for demand liquidity, and xVia for easy integration—are designed to seamlessly fit into existing financial infrastructures. Amazon's AWS Partner Profile even features these Ripple products, promoting their ability to cut costs and speed up transactions for banks and companies alike. Such enterprise-grade infrastructure is one of the many reasons XRP qualifies as a top candidate for mass-market adoption. What's in It for Amazon and Its Shoppers? Using XRP can help Amazon in several respects: Efficiency and Speed : XRP's settlement in near-real time can make online shopping even quicker and more convenient. Cost Savings : Lower fees could translate to savings for consumers and Amazon alike, either in the form of lower prices or rewards for loyalty. International Expansion : Accepting XRP would enable Amazon to reach customers in those places where access to credit cards is bad or remittance is prohibitively costly. Innovation Leadership : Being among the first large retailers to accept cryptocurrency would further cement Amazon's reputation as a technology leader. For customers, using XRP to pay would mean faster refunds, lowered worldwide shipping costs, and a simpler checkout process—especially for users who already know digital currencies. XRP Price Impact and Market Outlook The crypto market responded positively to the news, with XRP's price rising on rumors of Amazon's interest. Technical analysis suggests that XRP will reach as high as $2.10 by April 2025 if adoption levels continue to rise. Although there are speculations that Amazon has been a long-time holder of XRP since 2015, no such holding was officially confirmed. However, the partnership—if taken to maximum—can be a template for other global retailers, propelling mainstream adoption of crypto and further innovation in digital payments. The bottom line While hype is gathering, note that currently, Amazon's exploration of XRP remains at the research and partnership stage. There is no timeline for a launch announced, and regulatory concerns still remain, notably in the U.S. where crypto policy remains under construction. But the message is definite: the world's biggest online retailer is very much considering using blockchain-based payments. If Amazon does follow through on XRP, it might totally change the way we shop online and how value moves between borders. In brief : Amazon's potential use of XRP is more than just a headline—it's a glimpse at the future of internet shopping, where global access, efficiency, and speed are all facilitated by blockchain. As crypto becomes more widely adopted, everyone will be waiting to see if Amazon leads the way.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-27 13:58:30

A Crucial Market Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-analysis-gains/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: Will ETH Soar Beyond $2.4K? A Crucial Market Analysis Are you watching the charts, wondering what’s next for Ethereum price ? The crypto community is buzzing with anticipation as leading analysts point to a critical juncture for the second-largest cryptocurrency. With ETH holding above a key support level, the stage might be set for a significant move. Let’s dive into the signals and expert opinions shaping Ethereum’s immediate future. Understanding the Current Ethereum Price Dynamics The cryptocurrency market is a landscape of constant flux, but certain indicators offer clearer pathways. For Ethereum price , the $2,400 level has emerged as a focal point. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, as cited by Cointelegraph, suggests that if Ethereum successfully maintains its position above this crucial support, further gains could be on the horizon in the weeks ahead. This sentiment is echoed by other market observers, who see growing signs of a potential shift. Crypto Fella, a prominent market watcher, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to express a similar conviction: “It’s almost time for the long-expected reversal.” This indicates a broader belief among analysts that Ethereum might be poised to break free from recent consolidation or downward pressure, signaling renewed bullish momentum. The ability of ETH to hold this support level is not just a number; it’s a psychological and technical battleground for traders and investors alike. Diving Deep into ETH Analysis: The $2.4K Support When we talk about ETH analysis , support levels are fundamental. A support level is a price point where buying interest is strong enough to prevent the price from falling further. For Ethereum, the $2,400 mark has acted as a significant area of confluence, where previous resistance might have turned into new support. If buyers step in consistently at or above this level, it reinforces the foundation for an upward trajectory. Conversely, a decisive break below $2,400 could signal weakness and potentially lead to further downside, triggering stop-losses and increasing selling pressure. This makes monitoring this level paramount for anyone interested in Ethereum’s short-to-medium term performance. It’s not just about hitting a number; it’s about sustained price action above it, indicating strong conviction from market participants. Decoding Crypto Market Trends: The ETH/BTC Ratio Explained Beyond its USD pairing, understanding Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC) is vital for grasping broader crypto market trends . The ETH/BTC ratio serves as a key barometer for altcoin strength. When this ratio rises, it often signals an ‘altcoin season’ where capital flows from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Conversely, a declining ratio suggests Bitcoin dominance, with altcoins underperforming. Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio stands at 0.02275, having experienced a 6.84% decline over the past month, according to TradingView. This recent dip indicates that Ethereum has been losing ground against Bitcoin. However, for those anticipating an ‘altcoin rally,’ a reversal in this ratio is a crucial precursor. Analysts are closely watching for signs that Ethereum can regain strength against Bitcoin, which would signify a broader shift in market sentiment towards altcoins. Key Insights from Technical Analysis: Signals to Watch Beyond simple support levels, comprehensive technical analysis involves scrutinizing various indicators to identify potential trend reversals and confirm momentum. Traders often look at: Volume: An increase in trading volume as price holds support or breaks resistance adds conviction to the move. Moving Averages: Crossovers or price interactions with key moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day) can signal trend strength or weakness. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator can indicate if an asset is overbought or oversold, potentially signaling a reversal point. Chart Patterns: Formations like inverse head and shoulders, double bottoms, or bullish divergences on indicators can suggest an impending uptrend. For Ethereum, the ‘long-expected reversal’ mentioned by Crypto Fella would likely be confirmed by a combination of these factors aligning, indicating a robust shift in market dynamics rather than just a temporary bounce. Actionable insight here is to combine these signals rather than relying on just one. Is an Altcoin Rally on the Horizon for Ethereum? The potential for an altcoin rally is a recurring theme in cryptocurrency markets, often following periods of Bitcoin dominance. Ethereum, being the largest altcoin by market capitalization, typically leads such rallies. Several factors beyond technicals could fuel such a surge: Network Upgrades: Ongoing developments and successful implementation of upgrades (like the Dencun upgrade earlier this year, or future advancements) can enhance Ethereum’s scalability, security, and efficiency, attracting more users and developers. DeFi and NFT Growth: Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems. Renewed interest or innovation in these sectors directly benefits ETH. Institutional Adoption: Increasing institutional interest, potentially including spot Ethereum ETFs in the future, could bring significant capital inflows. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish turn in the wider crypto market, often initiated by Bitcoin’s performance, typically pulls altcoins higher. While the signs are promising, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainties, macroeconomic headwinds, or a sudden downturn in Bitcoin’s price could dampen enthusiasm. However, if the $2,400 support holds and the ETH/BTC ratio shows signs of reversal, Ethereum could indeed lead the charge in the next significant altcoin rally. Conclusion: Ethereum at a Crossroads Ethereum finds itself at a pivotal moment. The consensus among analysts points to the $2,400 support level as a crucial determinant for its near-term trajectory. Should this level hold firm, combined with a potential reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio and other positive technical indicators, the stage is set for Ethereum to eye further substantial gains. As always, the crypto market remains dynamic, but the current signals provide a compelling narrative for Ethereum’s potential ascent. Keeping a close eye on these key levels and broader market sentiment will be essential for navigating what could be an exciting period for ETH holders.

At the time of writing, BTC trades around $106,900, just below the $108,250 resistance, which marks the upper boundary of a descending trendline that’s capped price action since June highs. Technical momentum is cooling, and the next 48 hours could decide whether Bitcoin breaks higher or reverts back toward key support levels. Short-term technicals show a potential reversal brewing. The 2-hour chart displays a rising wedge pattern, with BTC printing a lower high near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $106,237. A break below the 50-period EMA ($106,249) could open a move toward $104,991 and $103,984—marking the 0.382 and 0.5 retracement zones. Key resistance: $108,250 and $110,000 Support to watch: $106,250, then $104,900 RSI: Neutral at 56 MACD: Weakening bullish histogram Traders looking for long exposure may wait for a confirmed breakout above $108,250. Bears, on the other hand, could consider short setups below $106,200, with a downside target near $104,000. Geopolitics, Fed Signals Fuel Rally Bitcoin’s latest move is macro driven. A Middle East ceasefire has calmed the nerves of the market and capital is flowing back into risk assets. Bitcoin reclaimed its 50 day simple moving average (SMA) around $106,000 mid week and buyers are defending that zone. The softer geopolitical climate has given BTC the stability to retest $107,000. Meanwhile the US Federal Reserve has toned down its language on crypto banking so less regulatory pressure ahead. Traders took that as a green light and are reinforcing Bitcoin’s recent strength. Institutional demand is still strong. ETFs have seen net inflows for 13 days in a row and $1.71 billion this week which is the most since May. Major corporate holders like Metaplanet and ProCap have accumulated over 7,500 BTC in the same period. This is institutional conviction despite retail is still sleeping. Can Bitcoin Clear $112K and Aim Higher? Technical resistance between $108,000 and $110,000 remains the key barrier. Analysts say a close above $109,000 with increased volume could push BTC to $112,000 and beyond. Beyond that, potential targets include $120,000 and even $165,000, driven by spot ETF demand and macro tailwinds. He's right! Bitcoin won't ever go above $112k again because: The US is getting their spending under control and the federal reserve will permanently stop printing money. https://t.co/jvslq1lrDD — Vijay Kailash, CFA, CFP® (@realvijayk) June 26, 2025 But upside isn’t guaranteed. A failure to clear $108,250 may trigger a short-term pullback. Volume is still low, and on-chain activity has declined—transfer volume is down 32% to $52 billion, while spot trading remains muted around $7.7 billion. If the price breaks below $106,249, the path to $104,000–$105,000 opens. These zones may act as accumulation points for bulls. Bottom line: The next 48 hours are pivotal. A confirmed breakout above $108K could ignite a fresh rally. A rejection may spell consolidation—or correction—before the next leg higher.

Recent operational data from April and May confirms a powerful turnaround is already underway, showcasing an exponential rebound in hashrate and a sharp recovery in Bitcoin production. BitFuFu trades at a glaring valuation disconnect from its U.S. peers, with the market assigning a value to its hashrate that is a mere fraction of the industry average. This significant market misunderstanding has created a compelling arbitrage opportunity, leaving room for a substantial valuation re-rating as the company heads into its Q2 earnings report. Just over a month ago, I claimed that BitFuFu Inc. ( FUFU ), a Singapore-based crypto miner, was well on track for strong operating income growth in 2026. FUFU stock has lost almost 20% since then after the company reported lackluster earnings for the first quarter, characterized by a 46% YoY decline in revenue, primarily attributable to the bitcoin halving event in April last year. All else equal, bitcoin halving negatively impacts miner revenue, which is something crypto investors are well aware of now. After going through BitFuFu's April and May performance data, I am confident that the company is among the few crypto miners that are operationally ready to thrive amid increasing mining difficulty. As such, I find BitFuFu's market valuation materially disconnected from its economic value at a time when it's valued at a substantial discount to its closest peers, presenting an arbitrage opportunity for investors. BitFuFu's Challenging First Quarter The fourth bitcoin halving in April 2024 has materially impacted the comparable revenue growth of crypto miners of every scale and size. BitFuFu's Q1 revenue declined from $144.4 million a year ago to just $78 million, showcasing this massive impact. Not only has BitFuFu felt the impact, but larger players like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) also reported substantial net losses in Q1. MARA's net loss in Q1 totaled $533.4 million, and RIOT reported a net loss of $296.4 million. BitFuFu, on the other hand, reported a net loss of $16.9 million. However, bitcoin halving is not the only factor that has impacted revenue negatively. While peers such as MARA and RIOT mitigated the bitcoin halving impact through substantial operational expansions that led to robust hashrate growth, BitFuFu suffered a temporary decline in the hashrate under management as well (hashrate dropped 28% YoY to 20.6 EH/s from 28.6 EH/s). This paved the way for a truly lackluster Q1 performance. In its Q1 earnings release, BitFuFu reported that this temporary decline in the hashrate came on the back of the expiration of some hashrate purchase orders and miner relocation. While BitFuFu's peers made the most of surging bitcoin prices, the company was not in a position to capitalize on this price increase as self-mined bitcoin production declined staggeringly from 1,103 in Q1 2024 to just 186 in Q1 2025. Exhibit 1: BitFuFu's Q1 Performance Metrics Q1 Earnings Release The below table summarizes how BitFuFu fell behind its closest peers in the first quarter. Company Q1 2025 YoY revenue growth Q1 2025 hashrate growth Q1 2025 YoY BTC production change Comments BitFuFu -46% -28% -83% (self-mining) Revenue was impacted by bitcoin halving and a substantial yet temporary drop in hashrate. Riot Platforms 100% 172% 12.2% Substantial hashrate growth helped Riot overcome the halving impact. Mara Holdings 30% 95% -19% Hashrate growth helped mitigate the halving impact, but revenue growth mostly came from higher BTC prices. Source: Company Filings At first glance, you might feel BitFuFu is losing ground. However, as I reveal in the next segments of this analysis, FUFU stock has been punished for a temporary deterioration in its financial performance. This market misunderstanding is exactly what sets the stage for an arbitrage opportunity. April/May Data Confirms BitFuFu's Rebound As we inch toward the end of the second quarter, we already have access to BitFuFu's April and May performance data that confirms, without a shred of doubt, that the company has well and truly recovered from the challenges faced in Q1. Encouragingly, the rebound is across all key operational metrics, which confirms that BitFuFu is headed in the right direction. The most direct, meaningful evidence of this recovery comes in the form of a significant improvement in the hashrate under management. From just 20.6 EH/s at the end of Q1, hashrate grew 37% MoM to 28.3 EH/s in April, followed by another strong 21% MoM increase to 34.1 EH/s in May. Based on these numbers, within just two months from the end of the disappointing first quarter, BitFuFu's hashrate under management has grown exponentially to surpass Riot Platform's Q1 deployed hashrate of 33.7 EH/s. Along with the hashrate under management, bitcoin production has also rebounded sharply after a sluggish Q1. In Q1, the company produced a total of just 723 BTC (186 BTC from self-mining and 537 BTC from the cloud-mining segment). In April, BitFuFu mined a total of 209 BTC , followed by 400 BTC mined in May , bringing the total BTC production to 609 in the first two months of the quarter. Based on these numbers, BitFuFu seems well on track to produce a meaningfully higher number of BTC in the second quarter, assuming this trend remains strong. The strong performance in May was driven by the contribution from the hashrate purchased in late April, and a similar feat could be expected in June as the company purchased additional hashrate in late May as well. Importantly, the average daily BTC production increased from 7 in April to 12.9 in May, suggesting that the robust increase in hashrate is already contributing positively. BitFuFu's strong growth in April and May corresponded to a robust increase in the power infrastructure as well, which gives me confidence that the observed hashrate growth is well-supported from a power requirement perspective. At the end of Q1, the company had a power capacity of 478 MW, a notable decline from 644 MW of power capacity as of Q1 2024. Since then, however, the trend has turned positive, with power capacity growing 18% MoM in April to 566 MW, followed by another 15% MoM increase in May to 651 MW. This continued increase in power capacity highlights the progress in BitFuFu's strategic plan to reach 1 GW of power capacity by 2026. Exhibit 2: BitFuFu's Power Capacity June Presentation Taking a closer look at BitFuFu's strategic BTC holdings, which form the backbone of its treasury strategy, reveals that the management is following the best course of action to drive shareholder returns higher. After seeing an increase in BTC holdings from 1,835 in March to 1,908 in April, the company sold 178 BTC at an average price of $104,000 in May to capitalize on the recent run-up in bitcoin prices. At the end of May, BitFuFu held 1,709 BTC. BitFuFu's performance in April and May, in my opinion, foreshadows how the company could grow profitably in the post-bitcoin halving environment by focusing on operational efficiency and access to low-cost power. These two variables will play a key role in determining the profitability of every bitcoin miner in the long run, and I am confident that BitFuFu is headed in the right direction on this front. The Valuation Disparity Highlights The Opportunity For A Re-Rating BitFuFu is significantly undervalued from a comparable valuation perspective. I believe this undervaluation primarily stems from the company's unique business model, as it generates the bulk of its revenue from cloud-mining services. This unique business model also involves securing a major portion of its total hashrate from third-party suppliers. In comparison, stock market darlings such as Riot Platforms, Mara Holdings, and CleanSpark have a more straightforward business model where they have positioned themselves as bitcoin miners. This business model differentiation may have contributed to the market seeing BitFuFu as a riskier business compared to its peers. Another factor that may have contributed to the comparable undervaluation is BitFuFu's Singapore origins. All of the competitors I discussed above are headquartered in the U.S., which naturally boosts their investment appeal. BitFuFu's smaller scale from a BTC ownership perspective compared to its peers may have also played a part in this relatively cheap valuation. As of May 31, FUFU held 1,709 BTC compared to 19,225 for Riot, 49,179 for Mara, and 12,502 for CleanSpark according to the most recent data. While this smaller scale may spook some investors, in reality, this should not be a dealbreaker, given that BitFuFu is executing its strategy well. To realistically estimate BitFuFu's intrinsic value, I thought it's best to use a Market Cap/Hashrate comparison of its American peers and then apply a valuation discount to reflect the factors discussed above. Before that, let's see how BitFuFu compares with its peers across a few important metrics. Metric FUFU RIOT MARA CLSK Peer Average Stock price $3.17 $10 $14.98 $10.6 - Market capitalization $535 million $3.58 billion $5.24 billion $2.82 billion - TTM revenue $397 million $459 million $705 million $537 million P/S multiple 1.35x 6.41x 6.57x 4.88x 5.95x Hashrate 34.1 EH/s 35.4 EH/s 58.3 EH/s 45.6 EH/s Market cap/hashrate $15.68 million/EH $101.13 million/EH $89.87 million/EH $61.64 million/EH $84.21 million/EH Note: Stock Price Data as of June 26. Looking at this table, FUFU's disconnect from the peer group is evident. At a P/E multiple of 1.35x, FUFU is significantly undervalued compared to the peer average of almost 6x. The undervaluation is even more evident by the fact that the market is attaching a value of $15.68 million per EH for BitFuFu whereas the peer average is over $80 million. Given the limitations that I discussed earlier, I believe a 30% discount to the peer average is warranted, which gives us a target fair value of $58.95 million/EH. Based on BitFuFu's current hashrate of 34.1 EH/s, the implied market cap comes to $2.01 billion. Based on 163.2 million shares outstanding, the per-share intrinsic value estimate comes to $12.32, which implies an upside potential of almost 300%. Even after applying a valuation discount to account for company-specific limitations facing BitFuFu, the company seems substantially undervalued in the market, which makes FUFU stock an attractive bet for investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin. Takeaway BitFuFu, after a disappointing Q1 performance, is attractively valued in the market compared to other publicly traded bitcoin miners. The short-term challenges that led to this lackluster Q1 performance seem to have passed, and the company has shown resilience in the first two months of the second quarter. The market seems to have misunderstood the growth potential of BitFuFu, leaving room for a valuation re-rating once the Q2 earnings report is out. Key risks to monitor include the company's reliance on third-party hashrate providers, execution risks facing vertical integration efforts involving data centers, and the revenue volatility arising from its reliance on cloud mining.",FUFU,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-27 14:06:45
46891846,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25497,1751033265,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,How Soon Until We See Widespread Bitcoin Mortgages?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/how-soon-until-we-see-widespread-bitcoin-mortgages/,"In a notable moment for the convergence of cryptocurrency and traditional finance, Strategy’s Michael Saylor has opened a public dialogue with US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte regarding the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream mortgage lending. This engagement centres on Saylor’s proposal to share a proprietary Bitcoin Credit Model designed to assess loan risk using Bitcoin-specific metrics like volatility and asset coverage. The conversation follows Pulte’s announcement that the FHFA is exploring whether cryptocurrency holdings could play a role in mortgage qualification, potentially signalling a shift in how federal housing agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac evaluate borrower assets. The exchange highlights not only the maturing role of Bitcoin in financial planning but also the potential for federal regulators to influence how digital assets might be incorporated into home lending frameworks. Did Saylor Orange Pill US FHFA Director William Pulte? In a recent development underscoring the growing intersection between digital assets and traditional finance, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor publicly engaged with Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte on the potential for Bitcoin-backed mortgage models. Saylor offered to share Strategy’s proprietary Bitcoin Credit Model , which analyses loan risk and pricing based on key Bitcoin-specific metrics such as price volatility, asset appreciation forecasts, and collateral coverage. This outreach followed Pulte’s statement that the FHFA would study how cryptocurrency holdings might factor into mortgage qualification assessments, an announcement seen by some as a signal that federal housing agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be reconsidering legacy lending criteria in light of evolving asset portfolios among U.S. households. The FHFA’s willingness to examine crypto asset integration is particularly notable given its role in overseeing government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently require that cryptocurrency be converted into US dollars and held at regulated institutions before it can be counted in borrower asset calculations. Until earlier this year, regulations such as the SEC’s now-repealed SAB 121 effectively discouraged mainstream financial institutions from accepting crypto assets as loan collateral. The removal of these accounting restrictions has opened new opportunities for digital assets to be recognised in underwriting frameworks, potentially allowing borrowers to leverage their Bitcoin holdings without liquidating them. Saylor’s intervention adds technical depth to this policy conversation by introducing a credit model tailored specifically to the characteristics of Bitcoin as collateral. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin’s volatility, liquidity, and non-sovereign nature require distinct methods for calculating loan-to-value ratios, duration-based risk spreads, and margin thresholds. His firm’s model aims to quantify these variables to support safer, over-collateralised lending structures that could be integrated into existing mortgage products. Should regulators adopt or adapt such a framework, it could mark a significant step toward the mainstreaming of crypto-backed mortgages through established institutions, rather than niche providers. This exchange also arrives amid growing public interest in alternative financing models, especially among younger Americans who hold a disproportionate share of their net worth in digital assets . A shift in policy from institutions like the FHFA could legitimise the use of Bitcoin as a form of wealth in housing finance, potentially improving access to homeownership for crypto-native households. Whether this signals a broader alignment between crypto innovation and US housing policy remains to be seen, but the dialogue between Saylor and Pulte suggests that such discussions are no longer merely theoretical, they are now taking place at the highest levels of US housing finance governance. What is a Bitcoin-Backed Mortgage and How Does it Work? A Bitcoin mortgage is a type of loan where Bitcoin (BTC) is used as collateral instead of, or in addition to, a traditional cash down payment. In this structure, a borrower pledges a specified amount of Bitcoin to a lender, which holds it in escrow for the duration of the mortgage. The borrower then receives fiat currency (e.g. USD) to purchase property, and makes monthly repayments similar to a conventional mortgage. These arrangements are usually over-collateralised , meaning the value of the pledged Bitcoin exceeds the value of the loan, to protect the lender from price volatility, a dynamic which grew out of DeFi lending. If the value of Bitcoin falls below a certain threshold, the borrower may be required to add more collateral or risk liquidation of their BTC to cover the outstanding balance. Compared to standard mortgages, Bitcoin-backed mortgages offer a different risk-reward profile. Traditional home loans are based on credit history, income documentation, and a fiat down payment, typically between 10% and 20% of the home’s value. Bitcoin mortgages, by contrast, may appeal to borrowers who are asset-rich in crypto but either unwilling or unable to liquidate their holdings. These products can circumvent some of the documentation hurdles in traditional underwriting but introduce new risks around asset volatility. In addition, while specialised lenders offer these products, most traditional banks still do not accept Bitcoin as a valid asset for mortgage qualification due to regulatory and balance sheet constraints, though this may change if agencies like the FHFA broaden asset recognition standards. Bitcoin-native features like multisignature (multisig) wallets and timelocks offer enhanced security and trust minimisation in lending arrangements. Multisig ensures that funds can only be spent when a predefined number of parties approve the transaction, reducing counterparty risk, while timelocks allow transactions to be locked until a specific time or block height, enabling automated loan expiry or repayment conditions without requiring intermediaries. Interest rates for Bitcoin mortgages can be competitive, but they often vary widely depending on the lender, collateral coverage, and market conditions. Rates may be lower than unsecured crypto loans, but not always on par with the most favourable conventional mortgage rates, particularly from government-backed lenders. In some cases, lenders may offer flexible terms to attract borrowers who wish to retain exposure to BTC’s long-term appreciation while accessing liquidity. However, borrowers face additional costs such as custodial and escrow fees, and the risk of margin calls during market downturns, which can erode any rate advantages. Until Bitcoin becomes an approved asset within traditional institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, rates are unlikely to standardise across the broader lending market. Bitcoin’s deflationary economic model, driven by its fixed 21 million coin supply and halving cycles every four years, introduces a unique dynamic into mortgage lending. Theoretically, as new supply is cut in half and issuance slows, the scarcity of Bitcoin could increase its value over time. This has historically incentivised long-term holding (HODLing), making Bitcoin an attractive reserve asset for some. In the context of a mortgage, this means borrowers might be reluctant to pledge Bitcoin as collateral, fearing opportunity cost if the price rises dramatically. At the same time, lenders may be wary of sharp declines that could compromise collateral value. The success of Bitcoin mortgages in the long term will depend on how lenders and regulators manage this volatility, and whether Bitcoin’s deflationary model is seen as a stable enough basis to underpin large, long-duration financial products like home loans. Is Saylor Too Optimistic or Will the Lending Industry Embrace Bitcoin? Michael Saylor’s framing of Bitcoin as a digital asset rather than a form of digital cash has defined his entire investment philosophy, guiding both Strategy’s corporate strategy and his broader public advocacy. By treating Bitcoin not as a medium of exchange but as a pristine, long-duration store of value, Saylor has dismissed spending or transacting with BTC in favour of accumulating and holding it indefinitely. However, this conviction has naturally led him to explore mechanisms by which Bitcoin can generate yield, a pursuit that sits uneasily with the asset’s trust-minimised design and P2P principles. His recent interest in Bitcoin-backed credit models, such as mortgages, reflects a desire to monetise Bitcoin without selling it. Yet this approach enters murky territory, especially considering the high-profile collapses of past retail-focused crypto lending platforms that offered similar promises. The failures of firms like Celsius , Voyager , and BlockFi highlight the inherent risks of attempting to extract yield from volatile digital assets in poorly regulated environments. These companies offered attractive returns to depositors while engaging in opaque, leveraged, and often mismatched lending practices. When prices collapsed, so did their balance sheets, leaving users with frozen accounts and mounting losses. Saylor’s version of yield, rooted in secured, over-collateralised lending against Bitcoin rather than uncollateralised or rehypothecated deposits, may seem more conservative in comparison. But the underlying tension remains in the fact that Bitcoin is not a risk-free yield-generating instrument, and introducing debt-based products around it inevitably reintroduces credit risk, counterparty risk, and systemic fragility into a space that was, in theory, designed to eliminate them. If federal regulators such as the FHFA ultimately approve the use of Bitcoin as qualifying collateral for mortgages, the traditional lending industry could be forced to adapt to a new class of asset and borrower. Banks and government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would need to develop protocols for valuing, securing, and managing digital collateral in compliance with capital requirements and consumer protection rules. This could bring new revenue streams, borrower demographics, and innovation to the mortgage sector, particularly among younger, crypto-native households who are currently underbanked by traditional standards but overexposed to digital assets. It would also likely prompt standardisation efforts, including regulatory guidance on custody, valuation methodologies, and margin maintenance. If the federal government, through agencies like the FHFA, establishes a clear and favourable regulatory framework for Bitcoin-backed mortgages, it is likely that major players in the banking industry would follow suit, albeit cautiously. Traditional financial institutions are generally risk-averse and heavily regulated, but they also have a long history of adapting to government-backed policy shifts, especially when accompanied by guarantees or securitisation mechanisms such as those offered by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. A green light from federal authorities would reduce legal ambiguity and provide the compliance infrastructure necessary for banks to safely evaluate, custody, and lend against Bitcoin collateral. While some conservative institutions may remain hesitant due to volatility concerns or reputational risk, others, especially fintech-forward banks or those already exploring digital asset custody, could view this as a competitive opportunity to tap into a growing demographic of crypto-native borrowers and expand their lending portfolios in a high-margin, underserved market. In an optimistic scenario, if Bitcoin-backed mortgages gain traction and prove resilient, the lending industry could see a wave of hybrid financial products that merge traditional underwriting with decentralised asset classes. Lenders might offer tiered products with dynamic loan-to-value ratios based on Bitcoin volatility metrics, or integrate stablecoins and BTC together for risk balancing. Over time, the legitimacy of Bitcoin as a financial asset class could be solidified, potentially leading to secondary markets for tokenised mortgage debt or new layers of credit infrastructure. But this vision hinges on whether institutional actors can manage the volatility and cultural idiosyncrasies of Bitcoin responsibly, without repeating the speculative overreach that doomed previous lending experiments in the crypto space.

This alarming revelation, highlighted in a recent TRM Labs report cited by Cointelegraph, paints a stark picture of the ongoing challenges in securing digital assets. For anyone invested in or simply observing the crypto space, this news serves as a potent reminder of the persistent threats lurking within the decentralized frontier. But what exactly led to such immense crypto losses , and what can be done to safeguard against future incidents? The Alarming Reality of Crypto Losses in H1 2025 The numbers speak for themselves. According to TRM Labs, the sheer volume of funds siphoned off in the first six months of 2025 has nearly matched the entire sum recorded for the full year of 2024. This rapid escalation underscores a worrying trend: while the crypto market continues to evolve, so do the sophistication and frequency of malicious attacks. Out of 75 reported incidents, a significant majority of the stolen funds – over 80% – were linked to specific, high-impact vulnerabilities. It’s not just the total amount that’s concerning; it’s the nature of the attacks. The report highlights that the most damaging incidents were, on average, ten times more destructive than other types of exploits. This disproportionate impact points to critical weaknesses that attackers are increasingly exploiting with devastating efficiency. Understanding these primary vectors of attack is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the crypto landscape safely. Decoding the Threats: Private Key Exploits and Front-End Vulnerabilities So, where are these billions disappearing to? TRM Labs points directly to two primary culprits: private key exploits and front-end infrastructure attacks. These aren’t just technical terms; they represent fundamental weaknesses that, when compromised, grant attackers direct access to funds or control over user interactions. Private Key Exploits: Imagine your private key as the ultimate password to your crypto wallet. If this key falls into the wrong hands, whether through phishing, malware, or a compromised system, your funds are as good as gone. These exploits are often direct and leave little room for recovery, as they bypass most security layers designed to protect transactions. They are the digital equivalent of someone stealing the keys to your vault. Front-End Infrastructure Attacks: These are more subtle but equally dangerous. The ‘front-end’ is what you see and interact with – the website or application interface. If this infrastructure is compromised, attackers can trick users into approving malicious transactions, redirect funds, or even steal login credentials. This could involve manipulating a legitimate website to display a fake transaction request or redirecting users to a phishing site that looks identical to the real one. The reason these attack types account for such a large percentage of crypto losses is their direct impact on user funds and the core security mechanisms of digital assets. They bypass smart contract audits in many cases, focusing instead on the weakest link: the human element or the interface layer. Bolstering Blockchain Security: A Collective Responsibility Given the escalating threat, what steps can be taken to enhance blockchain security ? It’s a multi-faceted challenge that requires vigilance from both projects and individual users. The good news is that awareness and proactive measures can significantly mitigate risks. For Projects and Protocols: Rigorous Audits: Regular, independent security audits of smart contracts and front-end infrastructure are non-negotiable. These audits should be conducted by reputable firms and ideally involve multiple rounds. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivizing white-hat hackers to find and report vulnerabilities before malicious actors do can be incredibly effective. Multi-Signature Wallets: For treasury funds or critical operations, implementing multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets adds an extra layer of security, requiring multiple approvals for transactions. Decentralized Infrastructure: Reducing reliance on centralized front-ends can decrease the attack surface for infrastructure exploits. Incident Response Plans: Having a clear, well-rehearsed plan for responding to security breaches can minimize damage and facilitate quicker recovery. For Individual Users: Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, hardware wallets (like Ledger or Trezor) are essential. They keep your private keys offline, making them immune to most software-based attacks. Strong, Unique Passwords & 2FA: Use strong, unique passwords for all crypto-related accounts and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. Verify URLs: Always double-check the URL of any crypto website you visit. Phishing sites often use very similar domain names. Bookmark legitimate sites. Be Wary of Phishing: Never click on suspicious links in emails, social media, or direct messages. Always assume a message is a scam until proven otherwise. Understand What You Sign: When interacting with dApps, carefully review the transaction details before signing. Ensure you understand what permissions you are granting. The Impact of DeFi Hacks on Digital Asset Safety While the TRM Labs report highlights private key and front-end exploits, it’s impossible to discuss large-scale crypto losses without acknowledging the significant role of DeFi hacks . Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, while innovative, often present a larger attack surface due to their composability and complex smart contract interactions. Many front-end vulnerabilities are indeed tied to DeFi applications, where users interact with protocols through web interfaces. The interconnectedness of the DeFi ecosystem means that a hack on one protocol can sometimes have ripple effects, impacting others. Flash loan attacks, re-entrancy bugs, and oracle manipulations are common in the DeFi space, alongside the front-end and private key issues that affect the broader crypto landscape. The rapid evolution of DeFi also means new vulnerabilities are constantly emerging, demanding continuous innovation in security measures to maintain digital asset safety . Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Safety The first half of 2025 serves as a harsh but necessary wake-up call. The escalating figures for crypto losses underscore the urgent need for a more robust and proactive approach to security across the entire digital asset ecosystem. It’s a continuous arms race between innovators and attackers, and vigilance is paramount. The industry must invest more heavily in security research, implement standardized best practices, and foster greater collaboration among projects, security firms, and law enforcement. For users, the message is clear: personal responsibility in securing your assets is more critical than ever. As the digital economy expands, so too does the value of what’s at stake. Ultimately, while the figures are daunting, they also spur innovation. Every major hack pushes the industry to develop better defenses, more secure protocols, and more resilient infrastructure. The journey towards truly secure and universally trusted digital assets is ongoing, and learning from these painful lessons is a vital step forward.

Ripple’s Attempt to Reduce Penalty Blocked by Court The long-running legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) saw a fresh development this week, as U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request to amend the court’s earlier ruling. The decision leaves Ripple responsible for a $125 million civil penalty and maintains an injunction imposed over certain XRP sales. Less than two weeks ago, both parties approached the court seeking to reduce Ripple’s penalty for unregistered institutional XRP sales to $50 million, a significant cut from the $2 billion originally pursued by the SEC under former Chair Gary Gensler. The proposal also requested the removal of restrictions on Ripple’s future XRP transactions. However, Judge Torres dismissed these requests, citing the SEC’s extensive casework and the integrity of the court’s prior findings. Court Upholds Previous Findings on Institutional Sales In her ruling, Torres reaffirmed the distinction made in her 2023 judgment: while Ripple’s programmatic XRP sales through exchanges did not violate securities law, its direct institutional sales did. The judge noted that the SEC had built a strong case over four years to establish those violations, which warranted both financial penalties and operational restrictions on Ripple. The court made it clear that neither the SEC nor Ripple could retroactively nullify a court's final judgment through mutual agreement. Judge Torres emphasized that an enforcement agency may alter its approach after initiating legal action, but both parties remain bound by the legal consequences already established. Legal Experts Speculate on the Court’s Motives The ruling has triggered speculation within the crypto legal community. Attorney Fred Rispoli took to social media to suggest possible reasons behind the court’s firm stance. According to Rispoli, frustration over the protracted litigation or underlying political biases might have played a role in the rejection. He noted the possibility of the court being discontent with the amount of time consumed by the case, alongside broader judicial leanings in politically charged regulatory matters. He also speculated, “She is hostile to the Trump administration and will do what she can to throw up obstacles. This reason is 100% in play for some federal judges (it is no matter who is in charge as there are judges that are political rather than objective).” Rispoli further speculated on the case’s next steps, suggesting that while the SEC previously indicated plans to drop its appeal, this move remains unconfirmed. He predicted that both parties might ultimately abandon their appeals, settle on a $50 million penalty, and allow the injunction to stand. Ripple’s Position and Outlook Following the court’s decision, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, commented publicly, stating that “the ball is back in our court.” He affirmed that despite the setback, XRP’s legal status as a non-security for programmatic sales remains unchanged. While Ripple may continue pursuing its appeal, the broader legal landscape for XRP appears largely settled outside of institutional sales. The SEC’s next formal action will likely determine whether the years-long case draws to a close or proceeds into another phase of litigation.

It allows for the creation of scalable, interoperable blockchains which can facilitate seamless asset transfer and integration across multiple chains. This leads to increased efficiency and liquidity within the DeFi space. Furthermore, the high scalability of the Cosmos network allows for a higher volume of transactions, thus addressing some of the congestion issues seen in many blockchains. A significant feature of the Cosmos network is its ecosystem coins. These are native tokens of projects built within the Cosmos network, each serving unique functions and contributing to the overall ecosystem. Some notable examples include Cosmos (ATOM), Band Protocol (BAND), Kava (KAVA), and Terra (LUNA). Each of these projects has distinct use-cases within the ecosystem, from providing oracle solutions to offering decentralized finance (DeFi) services.

In a post on X, Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) suggested that this ruling could set the stage for the U.S. government to acquire XRP’s escrow holdings. Redbeard suggested that the denial of this request may open a pathway for the government to secure XRP’s escrow, potentially adding the digital asset to the U.S. crypto stockpile Donald Trump announced in early March . Did Judge Torres just set the stage for the U.S. Government to buy out the $XRP escrow by denying Ripple’s indicative ruling? Goodbye XRP escrow… Hello U.S. Digital Asset Reserve? #XRP #Ripple #CryptoNews https://t.co/tsW95Yi3fj — Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) June 26, 2025 How the Theory Connects to the Ruling Redbeard’s post ties the ruling to the broader narrative around the government’s growing interest in blockchain-based reserves. The rejection of the indicative ruling leaves Ripple’s escrow untouched under the existing terms of the court’s final judgment. While the decision had nothing to do directly with escrow ownership, it leaves Ripple with fewer options to modify its legal obligations, including the injunction that prevents institutional sales. Experts have speculated for months on ways XRP could join Trump’s digital asset stockpile, and this development could theoretically make Ripple’s escrow more vulnerable to external negotiations, including the possibility of a government acquisition. His argument hinges on the assumption that the unresolved status of the escrow, combined with mounting regulatory pressures, may force Ripple into discussions it might not have otherwise entertained. The Digital Asset Reserve Context The U.S. Digital Asset Reserve proposal, announced by Donald Trump earlier this year, introduced the idea of the federal government holding blockchain-based assets as part of a new financial strategy. Although no XRP has been purchased under this plan, Redbeard suggests that the unresolved regulatory environment, combined with the court’s unwillingness to soften Ripple’s penalties, may indirectly align with such an acquisition strategy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The escrow in question represents almost 40 billion XRP locked under Ripple’s program to release a portion monthly. For years, it has served as a mechanism to manage supply and maintain price stability. Redbeard’s post speculates that securing this escrow would give the U.S. government a significant foothold in digital cross-border liquidity. Will Ripple Sell Its XRP to the Federal Government? While Redbeard’s post raised the question, the legal mechanics behind such a move are complex. Judge Torres’s ruling did not authorize any change to ownership or custody of Ripple’s escrow. However, she has left Ripple with no way to pursue XRP-related institutional dealings within the U.S. The escrow has long been a point of debate surrounding XRP’s tokenomics and Ripple’s broader strategy. Transferring it to a government would reshape XRP’s supply dynamics, governance influence, and future use in global payments.

The move is part of World Liberty’s broader initiative to scale USD1 across Binance’s BNB Chain, a blockchain known for its low transaction costs and high-speed infrastructure. The stablecoin is positioned as a dollar-pegged digital asset designed for use within DeFi ecosystems. Re7 Labs, an arm of London-based DeFi hedge fund Re7 Capital, is playing a key role in the effort. Just last week, Re7 Labs disclosed it would receive up to $10 million from Hong Kong-based VMS Group . The family office, which oversees roughly $4 billion in assets, is making its first foray into crypto with the investment. “This collaboration reflects a shared commitment to building the next generation of DeFi infrastructure — where stability, transparency and capital efficiency converge,” said Evgeny Gokhberg, founder of Re7 Capital, said in the statement. “Working alongside World Liberty, Euler and BNB Chain, we’re advancing a model for stablecoin adoption that meets the expectations of both crypto-native and institutional users.” Euler and Lista are decentralized lending platforms that enable users to borrow and lend digital assets using smart contracts.

The flagship cryptocurrency plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened. A ceasefire announcement saw markets recover, reclaim $100,000, and push towards $105,000 on Monday. Despite a pause in the rally, analysts remain optimistic about a push to $110,000. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $107,000. Metaplanet Pushes Bitcoin Holdings Past $1.3 Billion After 1,234 BTC Purchase Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has purchased an additional 1,234 BTC worth $132 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 12,345 BTC , worth over $1.3 billion. The purchase is the firm’s third-largest Bitcoin buy to date, according to a disclosure released on Thursday. Metaplanet purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $108,129 per coin. However, the purchase date was not disclosed. Metaplanet aims to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 100,000 BTC by 2026. Metaplanet is just one of many publicly traded firms that have pivoted to Bitcoin, adding the asset to their balance sheet. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, over 140 publicly traded firms hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet, amassing $90 billion worth of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s Strategy accounts for two-thirds of this amount, holding over $64 billion worth of Bitcoin. The latest purchase makes Metaplanet the seventh-largest holder of Bitcoin. Indian Politician Calls For Bitcoin Reserve Pilot A spokesperson for India’s ruling party has urged the government to consider launching a Bitcoin reserve pilot, believing it to be a strategic step towards economic resilience. Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari stated in an article that the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and Bhutan’s state-led mining operations signal a shift towards crypto in global financial markets. The spokesperson said that India could create a sovereign Bitcoin strategy by leveraging its expanding renewable energy infrastructure. “This isn’t a reckless pivot. It’s a calculated step toward embracing digital assets.” However, India’s tax policy indicates uncertainty. Crypto in India is unregulated but heavily taxed, with the government imposing a hefty 30% flat rate tax on virtual digital assets. However, it has been slow to establish a regulatory framework for crypto. Under section 115BBH of India’s Income Tax Act, all profits acquired by selling crypto are taxed at 30%. While traders can deduct purchase costs, there are no provisions for other expenses and losses. A 1% TDS also applies to all crypto transactions. According to Bhandari, India must offer regulatory clarity, beginning with the sovereign Bitcoin reserve. He added that regulations could bring transparency and oversight to the emerging asset class, enabling innovation while protecting users. Bhandari concluded, “India stands at a pivotal juncture,” Bhandari wrote. “A measured Bitcoin strategy —perhaps a reserve pilot — could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity.” Bitcoin Treasury Corporation To Relist On Toronto Exchange Canadian Bitcoin lending company Bitcoin Treasury Corporation (BTCT) is set to resume trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Venture Exchange. The company announced its common shares will trade under the ticker BTCT from Monday. The trading resumed after a brokered offering raising $92 million in gross proceeds. The company issued shares at 10 CA$ ($7.32) each. The financing was supported by a concurrent capital raise. BTCT also used a portion of the proceeds to purchase 292.8 BTC at $31.5 million. This is the company’s first major Bitcoin purchase since launching its Bitcoin accumulation and institutional lending strategy. The firm plans to use its Bitcoin reserves to offer clients liquidity solutions. It also plans to publish its initial Bitcoin share per figure after concluding its acquisition phase. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $107,000 as its rally takes a breather around $107,000. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week with a substantial rally after President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC reclaimed $105,000 and ended the day at $105,442. Analysts believe BTC is on the cusp of a bullish breakout and could potentially set a new all-time high. A potential catalyst is the decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY), with President Trump considering candidates to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair. Powell’s term ends in May 2026. The US Dollar Index has fallen 12% this year, with Morgan Stanley anticipating an additional 9% decline. Leading candidates include Scott Bessent, Kevin Hassett, and Kevin Warsh. President Trump has been highly critical of Powell, repeatedly urging the Fed Chair to cut interest rates. However, Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin agreed with Powell, stating, “There is little upside in heading too quickly in any one direction. Given the strength in today’s economy, we have time to track developments patiently and allow the visibility to improve.” Analysts believe a breakout is coming, with two major indicators supporting their argument. The daily chart shows that BTC has maintained its position above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which provided support since April. Additionally, Bitcoin has formed a bullish flag pattern consisting of a vertical line and a descending channel. Analysts also noted the formation of a bullish engulfing candlestick, reversing the weekend’s bearish price action. The pattern also ensured BTC maintained its position above $105,000, indicating a potential shift in market structure, adding weight to the flagship cryptocurrency’s ongoing recovery. However, despite the bullish setup, market sentiment is divided. BTC has recorded 19 instances of the bullish engulfing pattern meeting the defined confirmation criteria. Of these, 15 led to new local highs in the following days or weeks. More importantly, 19 instances occurred within a broader bull market context. The prevailing bull market structure indicates a statistically favorable environment for continuing the current price action, potentially pushing BTC to new highs. BTC registered a sharp drop on Tuesday, falling over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. It recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884, but was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $104,631. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC fell 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $100,979 before settling at $102,180. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $98,385 on Sunday as market sentiment turned bearish. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as the price surged over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as BTC crossed $106,000 on Tuesday and $107,000 on Wednesday to settle at $107,393. The price lost momentum on Thursday, dropping 0.39% to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,970. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The project has now progressed to Stage 4 of its presale. As momentum builds, the token price is set to increase to $0.0014 in the upcoming Stage 5. Little Pepe aims to differentiate itself within the meme token sector by incorporating on-chain utility alongside community engagement. Built on a Layer 2 network prioritizing transaction speed and affordability, the project emphasizes functional use cases in addition to its meme-oriented branding. Different from traditional meme tokens that live and die on speculation, Little Pepe has created its own Ethereum-compatible Layer 2, providing users faster transactions and comparatively lower fees for a meme-based community that lives on microtransactions, NFT trading, gaming rewards, staking, and many more. The Remarkable Presale Journey The presale journey of Little Pepe has been tremendous and remarkable. In Stage 1, tokens were priced at $0.001, and the project raised $500,000 by selling 500 million tokens in just 72 hours. Stage 2 followed with a price of $0.0011, raising approximately $1.325 million through the sale of 1.167 billion tokens. Stage 3, priced at $0.0012, saw even greater momentum, raising over $2.3 million and selling over 2 billion tokens. Now, in Stage 4, the price has risen to $0.0013, with more than 2.25 billion tokens out of the allocated 3.75 billion already sold. So far, Little Pepe has raised a total of $2,536,433 that sparking strong interest among buyers to purchase before the price increases further to $0.0014 in Stage 5. This presale isn’t driven by hype alone—it’s fueled by solid tokenomics, a clear long-term vision, and a highly engaged community. Little Pepe has also launched a $777,000 giveaway campaign in conjunction with its ongoing presale. The giveaway is designed in a way that the top 10 participants will each receive $77k worth of LILPEPE tokens. The giveaway is made around a system where users can earn rewards by finishing tasks, referring friends, holding tokens, etc. Why Is It Winning Various elements are driving the presale and the project’s success, and some of the prime elements are: Low entry price Transparent Roadmap Layer 2 Efficiency Massive Community Engagement Cultural Relevance About Little Pepe Little Pepe isn’t just a fleeting meme; it is a Layer 2-backed ecosystem having a clear path to mass adoption. Having Stage 4 approaching its sellout and a price increase to $0.0014 in the next stage, investors have an opportunity to get in before the token lists on prominent exchanges. As the crypto market matures, meme coins that blend culture with infrastructure will be the ones that thrive. And Little Pepe is proving it’s ready to lead that movement, one meme at a time.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has reached new all-time highs. A couple of U.S. macroeconomic data points Friday morning — though nearly two months old at this point — might have added to the modestly negative tone for BTC and gold. Personal income in May came in at -0.4%, falling short of the expected increase of 0.3%. Personal spending month over month printed at -0.1%, missing the forecast of a 0.1% increase. Maybe of more import to markets, the core PCE price index in the US, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is the Federal Reserve's chosen gauge of underlying inflation, rose by 0.2% in May compared to expectations of a 0.1% increase. On a year-over-year basis, core PCE prices rose 2.7% versus 2.6% expected. This data further supports the view that the economy may be heading toward stagflation. Noted goldbug and no-coiner Peter Schiff : ""Traders continue to sell gold even as this morning's release of weak economic data and stronger-than-expected inflation data pushed the dollar index to new lows.

However, despite the positive data, the Fed prefers to keep interest rates steady due to concerns about tariffs. At this point, the FED left interest rates unchanged in June. While the next interest rate cuts are expected to be made in July and September, the market expects the first interest rate cut of 2025 to be made in September. I Expect Two Interest Rate Cuts in 2025, The First in September! At this point, Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari announced that he expects two interest rate cuts in 2025. Kashkari said in an article published today that he expects two rate cuts in 2025, with the first likely to occur in September. Neel Kashkari, one of the most hawkish Fed members, noted that inflation had fallen, which would allow him to cut the policy rate twice starting in September. While the FED member mentioned the possibility of the first interest rate cut being made in September, he stated that the FED could pause the reduction policy if necessary if the tariffs have a negative impact. “I expect two interest rate cuts in 2025. At this point, the first cut could be in September. “But if the Fed cuts interest rates in September and the inflationary effects of the tariffs become apparent later, we may temporarily pause the rate cuts.” Finally, Kashkari said economic data so far suggest that the impact of tariffs on prices, activity or the labor market has been extremely modest, and inflation is making renewed progress toward the Fed's 2% target. Kashkari is known as one of the members of the FED who is hostile to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. At this point, the FED member describes cryptocurrencies as worthless, fraudulent and ridiculous. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin wavers as traders take profits,https://crypto.news/is-the-crypto-bull-run-here-bitcoin-wavers-as-traders-take-profits/,"Macroeconomic concerns and profit-taking are slowing down crypto’s momentum, but a bull run may be in the works Crypto markets are in recovery mode, but profit-taking and macroeconomic risks continue to weigh on sentiment. On Friday, June 27, Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $106,600, pulling back 1% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins saw similar performance, with the top 100 assets by market cap down about 1%. Bitcoin and major altcoins have mostly recovered their losses following the initial crash sparked by the Iran-Israel conflict. With the geopolitical tensions easing, the market correction appears to have concluded, with most tokens now posting modest declines rather than steep selloffs. Because of this, the recent strength in price action suggests that markets are normalizing. However, further bullish momentum will likely depend on key catalysts, especially in the regulatory and macroeconomic spheres. You might also like: Surprise Fed statement sparks hopes of Bitcoin and altcoin rally Rate cuts, regulation to fuel next crypto bull run Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a central role in crypto price dynamics. Currently, the Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates until at least September. According to analysts at B2BINPAY, this is limiting the performance of altcoins, unless a significant shift in monetary policy occurs. “The bigger picture? Macro uncertainty is keeping altcoins in check. Markets still see only a small chance of a Fed rate cut in July, though odds rise sharply for September. Until that’s clearer, BTC dominance at 62.5% keeps altcoin upside capped,” B2BINPAY analysts. Despite increasing pressure from the White House, the Fed remains committed to a cautious monetary policy, a stance unlikely to change unless President Donald Trump takes drastic action, such as replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That said, the more likely catalyst for the next crypto bull run may lie in regulatory developments. The U.S. Congress is set to deliberate on the Genius Act, a bill that could finally bring stablecoins out of the regulatory gray zone and offer much-needed clarity to the sector.

Layer-1 project Glue’s pseudonymous founder Ogle , raised the alarm on X, saying that Across Protocol founders manipulated the voting process. https://t.co/QEIW5ZVYeP — Hart Lambur (⛺️,⛺️) (@hal2001) June 27, 2025 The controversy centers on claims that the decentralized governance process was subverted. This has raised questions about the transparency and integrity of DAO operations in the crypto space. Ogle says that the governance proposals were orchestrated to benefit insiders. According to him, Across Protocol is a DAO in name only. He said, “Across Protocol – although a relatively well-respected entity in the crypto space, backed by true chads and OGs – appears to be one such faux DAO.” However, Hart Lambur, founder of Across Protocol and Risk Labs, firmly denied this claim. He said that Risk Labs is a Cayman Islands-based nonprofit with no shareholders. DAO vote manipulation The first proposal got a lot of support. It saw 13.1 million tokenholders voting in favor, approving the proposal with over 97% of the vote. However, the second, which asked for 50 million ACX tokens to be used as back-dated funding, only got enough votes to pass because of voting by insiders. Analysis shows that a lot of voting power came from wallets linked to Hart Lambur and the Risk Labs team members. This makes it hard to believe that the DAO’s decision-making processes are fair. “Had the team not voted on this proposal, it wouldn’t have reached quorum, meaning that it wouldn’t have had enough votes to pass at all,” Ogle said. According to Ogle, the proposal did not guarantee that the money would be used for Across, and there were no official agreements between the two companies. He also said that a study of the on-chain shows that many members of the Risk Labs team secretly agreed with the plan. “The second-largest voting wallet in the entire proposal, accounting for almost 14% of the total vote, was initially funded by Hart Lambur,” Ogle said. In response, Hart Lambur strongly denied any wrongdoing. He pointed out that team members purchased tokens on their own and voted publicly. He disproved claims that voting is hidden by saying that all addresses involved are open to the public. Hart Lambur also questioned the accuser’s credibility, pointing to potential conflicts of interest given Ogle’s ties to competing projects. However, it has brought an uproar in the community that disagrees with the legal governance process. The 150 million tokens involved would be worth over $22 million after ACX lost around 9.3% of its value in the last 24 hours to trade at roughly $0.1360 at the time of writing. Allegation of insider trading before the ACX Binance listing After that repost, Lambur and Pellegrino got into a public fight because Pellegrino, the founder of LayerZero, said that Lambur may have been dealing with inside information by buying ACX tokens right before a surprise listing on Binance in December 2024. “I am simply in SHOCK, total SHOCK, that Bryan Pellegrino is accusing me of insider trading when I can prove this is false,” Lambur responded. Lambur said that they had no idea Binance would list ACX. They found out on Twitter like everyone else. He said, “It was 2 am in the morning for me when Binance tweeted. Binance will verify this for you. We paid zero listing fee and had zero heads up.” Pellegrino brought up Across’s recent tweet, in which he talked about months of communication with Binance’s listing team. He also said that most companies limit trading while important listing discussions are underway.

While some tokens struggle despite positive developments, others gain ground through growing adoption. Pi Network (PI) sits in the middle—fueled by a large user base yet facing technical resistance. Meanwhile, as Pi gains more users, XYZVerse is building momentum in the meme coin space — drawing attention with its sports-focused concept. Let’s explore its fundamentals and price dynamics. Growing User Base and Expanding Utility Fuel Optimism The rising number of new users on the Pi Network is supporting a more positive price outlook. The network now counts over 60 million users, which could become a strong catalyst for buying activity. Some analysts suggest this momentum could help Pi reach a potential 160% price increase if the trend continues. Pi’s expanding utility is also helping drive sentiment. Following a four-year mining phase, the network is gradually migrating users to mainnet while rolling out new features. One key initiative is merchant testing which allows Pi tokens to be used for e-commerce and offline real-world transactions. If successful, this could support greater adoption beyond just speculative trading. Pi Network (PI) Price Analysis: Neutral to Bearish Signals Source: TradingView Pi’s technical indicators currently present a mixed, generally bearish outlook. Moving averages show 12 sell signals, 2 neutral, and only 1 buy signal, resulting in an overall neutral-to-sell trend. Oscillators also remain mixed, but the daily trend is still classified as a sell. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the oversold zone near the 30 level, which may suggest a potential reversal if current support levels around $0.70 to $0.74 hold. Trading volume has decreased sharply, dropping from over $3 billion in February to below $100 million—an indication of declining market interest in recent weeks. Chart patterns on both 4-hour and daily frames reveal a descending triangle — typically a bearish pattern, unless price breaks decisively to the upside. PI Price Prediction: Consolidation or Breakout? In the short term, PI is likely to continue trading sideways between $0.62 and $0.70. The current oversold RSI and low volume suggest a rebound is possible, but confirmation is still lacking. For the medium term, reclaiming $0.74–$0.75 with increasing volume could trigger a rally toward $0.85–$0.99. On the downside, failure to hold support below $0.62 would increase the risk of a deeper decline toward $0.57 or lower. Key Factors for Pi’s Future Growth Analysts point to several key factors that will determine whether Pi can sustain its upward trend: Utility: Expanding use cases in commerce and blockchain applications. Regulatory clarity: Compliance will be critical for market acceptance. Token supply: While Pi has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, only about 7.5 billion are currently in circulation. Careful management of circulating supply will be needed to avoid market dilution. Demand vs. user growth: A growing user base alone may not be enough — real demand and meaningful utility will be required to support long-term price gains. While Pi focuses on building long-term utility, another project — XYZVerse — is approaching growth from a different angle: by combining strong tokenomics with community-driven momentum. XYZVerse: A Meme Coin with a Sustainable Growth Model Setting itself apart from typical meme tokens, XYZVerse has introduced mechanisms to support long-term value. The token features a capped supply of 100 billion $XYZ, with a deflationary model that reduces circulating supply over time through regular token burns and community-driven buybacks. This structure is designed to promote steady value growth beyond short-term hype. Boosting Transparency with SolidProof Audit XYZVerse also emphasizes transparency and project security. The team completed a full KYC verification and smart contract audit through SolidProof, helping to build investor trust. As a result, the project has attracted strong early demand — raising over $14 million so far during its presale phase. The presale continues to draw new participants, with investors able to purchase $XYZ tokens at just $0.003333 through the official website . The project’s growing community and sports-focused concept position XYZVerse as one of the more promising meme coins to watch this year. Why Do People Join the XYZVerse Community? The project already has a vibrant and growing community, with over 21.4K followers on X (Twitter) and more than 12K members in its official Telegram channel. In the world of meme coins, community strength often plays a larger role than pure technology. Successful projects like SHIB and PEPE grew largely thanks to strong community backing and viral momentum — not just utility. XYZVerse is building a similar dynamic. Its concept — combining crypto with global sports culture — appeals to a wide audience of sports fans around the world. The project also offers real incentives, such as free bets through its partnership with bookmaker.XYZ. This active support may help XYZVerse follow a similar growth path to other leading meme tokens. Final Thoughts: Two Different Paths in the 2025 Altcoin Market Pi Network and XYZVerse highlight two very different trends shaping the altcoin market this year. Pi is focused on building long-term utility and expanding real-world use cases — though technical indicators suggest it still faces near-term challenges. In contrast, XYZVerse is gaining momentum as a meme-driven project with strong early community support and growing presale success. Both projects reflect the range of opportunities in today’s market — from utility-focused networks like Pi to fast-moving, community-powered tokens like XYZVerse. As 2025 unfolds, investors will be watching closely to see how both stories develop.

The market is reeling from a combination of Judge Torres’ latest ruling in the long-running Ripple-SEC case and of ongoing insecurity in the Middle East, not to mention the possibility that President Donald Trump may replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earlier than expected. In this context, Solana is down by 4% in a week and by 18% in the past month, and some analysts have predicted that the coin could drop further now that it has fallen below $144. But while the near term may be negative for SOL, the coin’s fundamentals continue to give it a very positive long-term price prediction . Solana Price Prediction – Hanging by a Thread: Why This Week Could Decide Everything Posting on X, analyst and trader Sjuul Follings – AKA AltCryptoGems – suggested that SOL had completed a V-shaped recovery from recent lows, and that it could rally further if it crossed $148. However, he also predicted that, if the Solana price dropped below $144, the coin could drop further. $SOL just completed a very nice V-shaped recovery from the low. But is at a very delicate level so time to pay attention. Reclaim $148 and I can see a quick move to the upside, lose $144 and the whole move was just a bearish retest. pic.twitter.com/pgFl4bmhQz — Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) June 25, 2025 And the Solana price has indeed declined below $144, with its indicators supporting the view that it could fall further in the next few days. Looking at its chart today, we see that its MACD (orange, blue) could continue its decline if it’s going to replicate the lows it witnessed in March. Likewise, SOL’s RSI (purple) has been below 50 for nearly a month now, but it was below 50 for all of February and March before we saw a real recovery. Again, this could mean that the Solana price will drop towards $135 or $130 in the next week or so, before potentially rebounding. Source: TradingView In the longer term, Solana’s position remains very strong, given its fundamentals as the second-biggest layer-one network in crypto. It has a couple of big upgrades to look forward to later in the year ( Alpenglow and Firedancer ), while we may also see the arrival of Solana ETFs. Because of this, SOL could easily hit $250 again by Q4, and possibly finish the year at $500. Snorter Trading Bot Raises Over $1 Million in Presale: Is the Best New Coin in Crypto? Traders looking to diversify away from major tokens may also be interested in checking out presale tokens, since these can often rally strongly when they list for the first time. This is particularly the case if they’ve had big, popular sales, with one successful presale coin right now being Snorter (SNORT) . Hold $SNORT . Trade faster. Lowest fees on Solana. Fall in love. pic.twitter.com/jPYk1QPnyB — Snorter (@SnorterToken) June 26, 2025 Running on Ethereum and Solana, Snorter has raised just over $1.2 million, which will run for the next few weeks. Snorter has been able to raise this sum of money because of its interesting fundamentals, with the project preparing to launch an automated sniping bot. As a sniping bot, Snorter will make early trades on behalf of its users, enabling them to buy up high-potential new tokens before the market arrives. It will also enable copy trading of successful investors, atomic swaps (with MEV protection), limit orders, and protection against honeypots and rugpulls. This makes it one of the most comprehensive trading bots in crypto, which helps to explain why investors are racing to SNORT’s presale. You can join it by visiting the Snorter website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. It’s currently available at $0.0965, although this will rise multiple times before the sale ends.

While some projects like Pi Network continue to draw users with promising developments, others like XYZVerse capitalize on niche markets. This article delves into their contrasting strategies and market reactions. Pi Network's Broadening Appeal The Pi Network , with its user base now surpassing 60 million, showcases a robust potential for growth fueled by both an increase in adoption and strategic technical advancements. Analysts speculate a notable 160% price surge in the horizon for Pi, contingent on maintaining user growth and expanding its utility. Transitioning from a lengthy mining phase, Pi Network is now ushering users towards its mainnet, enhancing the cryptocurrency's real-world utility through various integrations such as merchant transactions both online and offline. Technical Challenges Yet Opportunities for Pi Network Source: TradingView Despite the optimistic user adoption rates, Pi faces several technical challenges. Current technical analysis from TradingView provides a bearish outlook with predominant sell signals. However, with the Relative Strength Index nearing an oversold condition, there's potential for a price rebound. The cryptocurrency's trading volume has seen a sharp decline, indicating waning market interest, which could impede its price recovery efforts unless reversed. XYZVerse's Market Strategy and Pre-sale Success In contrast to Pi's utility-focused development, XYZVerse has carved its niche within the meme coin segment, focusing on sports-related themes to engage its audience. It has effectively ingrained strong tokenomics and a cap of 100 billion $XYZ tokens to foster a sustainable growth curve through methods such as token burns and community buybacks. The project highlights transparency and security as core values, having completed an extensive smart contract audit with SolidProof. This commitment has helped it raise over $14 million during its ongoing presale phase. Community Engagement and Market Positioning The XYZVerse community is a critical driver of its market positioning, with significant activity across platforms like Telegram and X. This strong community support is reminiscent of other successful meme coins, offering XYZVerse a solid foundation for growth.

As the market rallies, they're placing bets on popular choices like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK, relying on their potential to multiply investments. Amid this meme coin frenzy, a new entrant, Codename:Pepe crypto, aims to stand apart. This project blends humor with advanced tools, promising to outsmart fake AI players. With a strategic community focus and AI-driven insights, it offers intriguing opportunities for those ready to explore the meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents—shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise.

Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Dogecoin Faces Price Challenges Amid Market Downturn Dogecoin's price has been slipping recently. Over the past week, it dropped by 4.04%. In the past month, it fell by 27.24%. Looking back six months, the price decreased by 47.42%. The current price ranges between $0.1357 and $0.1746. The nearest support level is at $0.1198. If the price falls below this, it might continue to drop. The nearest resistance is at $0.1976. If the price can break through this level, it could rise further. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.38. An RSI of 45.38 suggests that DOGE is not overbought or oversold. This could indicate a potential for price stabilization. However, the recent downward trends may continue if market sentiment remains negative. Based on the data, Dogecoin's price may continue to fall unless it finds support. Breaking through the resistance at $0.1976 could lead to a rise. Investors should watch these levels closely. Shiba Inu's Price Dips: Is a Rebound on the Horizon? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced a challenging period lately. Over the past month, its price has dropped by 19.29%, adding to a six-month decline of 46.31%. In the last week, the coin saw a slight decrease of 0.51%. Currently trading between $0.000009667 and $0.00001194, SHIB is showing signs of stabilization after the sharp declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SHIB stands at 49.01, indicating a neutral market position. This suggests that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, potentially setting the stage for a price movement. Traders are watching closely to see if SHIB can break out of its current trend. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is at $0.00001326. A move to this level would represent an increase of approximately 21% from the current price. Breaking through this resistance could signal a bullish reversal. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.000008723. A drop to this level would mean a decline of about 17%. Given the recent price stability and the neutral RSI, SHIB could be poised for a rebound. However, the significant declines over the past months suggest caution. If SHIB can maintain its current support and challenge the resistance, there may be potential for growth. Traders should monitor the price action closely in the coming days. Pepe Coin Nears Key Resistance Level Pepe (PEPE) is trading between $0.0000076027 and $0.0000108587. This puts the coin close to its nearest resistance at $0.0000128373. Investors are watching to see if Pepe can break through this barrier. If the price climbs above the resistance level, it could signal a bullish trend. This would represent a gain of about 18% from the current upper price range. However, if Pepe's price falls, it may test the nearest support at $0.0000063253. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of around 17% from the current lower price range. The coin's movement towards these key levels will determine its next direction. Traders are monitoring the situation closely as Pepe approaches critical points. Bonk Coin Approaches Key Price Levels Bonk (BONK) is currently trading between $0.00001030 and $0.00001502. This range places the coin close to its nearest resistance level at $0.00001781. If BONK manages to break through this resistance, it could signal a significant upward movement. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.000008373. This support may prevent the price from falling further if a downward trend occurs. Traders are keeping an eye on this level as a potential rebound point. Considering the current price range, there's potential for BONK to rise by about 18% if it reaches the resistance at $0.00001781. Breaking this level could lead to increased buying interest and push the price even higher. Conversely, if the price drops to the support level, it would represent a decrease of approximately 44% from the current high end of the trading range. This significant drop could attract buyers looking for a bargain, possibly leading to a price recovery. Conclusion In the current bull market, established memecoins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK may offer less potential for short-term gains. Their previous surges have set high benchmarks, making significant immediate growth less likely. Meanwhile, Codename:Pepe crypto presents a fresh opportunity by harnessing artificial intelligence to maximize profits. It provides AI-powered trading signals and automated trading to navigate the meme coin market effectively. Participation grants access to a exclusive DAO with strategies and analytics, along with rewards for staking. With a capped token supply and community-driven approach, Codename:Pepe crypto aims to deliver substantial returns to its supporters.

Google Hype Sends Pi Up 38%,https://cryptonews.com/news/pi-coin-price-prediction-whats-coming-on-june-28-google-hype-sends-pi-up-38/,"Pi Coin (PI) has bounced from a recent low in the past seven days ahead of a key event called Pi2Day, at which the developing team is expected to reveal its upcoming ecosystem initiatives. On June 21, the Pi Core Team teased what could be the central topic to be discussed and shared during tomorrow’s event as they pointed to Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis’s presentation at the Generative AI panel at the Consensus 2025 . This is an event hosted by CoinDesk where the future of cryptocurrencies and Web 3 projects is typically discussed. #PiNetwork rumored to have a Google Ai deal, announcement expected on Pi2Day (Pi app shows Google Ai icon). #IceNetwork ecosystem launch with surprise developments! Both projects set for massive moves and big breakouts! $Pi $ICE $ION #Pi #ice #Ion https://t.co/Yg4QoARG1B pic.twitter.com/iRoPVJFeyu — zuzu (@PiGlobal314) June 25, 2025 Users started to speculate that Pi could be about to reveal a partnership with Google. To support that theory, X user @PiGlobal314 compared the imagery of Pi’s latest tweet with the logo of Gemini – the search engine’s proprietary generative AI model. Surprisingly, the token went up by 38% right after that rumor gained traction across social media platforms and messaging boards. A partnership with Google would support a bullish Pi Coin price prediction . If that’s the case and they announce it officially, how high could PI go? Pi Coin Price Prediction: Pi Hits Key Support at $0.56 – Time for the Next Leg Up? Pi’s 4-hour chart shows that the strong boost produced by these rumors pushed the token above its 200-period exponential moving average (EMA). Although the token’s rise to these levels was met with strong selling pressure once it got to $0.67, this bullish breakout is a strong indication that the trajectory of the price trend has changed from bearish to bullish. In the past 4 hours, Pi has found strong support at $0.56 and could use this level as a launchpad for its next leg up. The key driver for Pi’s move toward $0.70 again, or possibly to a higher level, would be confirmation of what the community has been speculating about. A partnership with Google would give Pi a much-needed credibility boost. With Google as a top backer or even partner, a plausible Pi Coin price prediction would estimate a move to $1 at least. In the meantime, analysts emphasize that well-established assets like Bitcoin (BTC) could outperform smaller projects like Pi. One of the hottest crypto presales of the year called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) offers investors a way to generate passive income as the top crypto rises to make new all-time highs. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Introduces Innovative Rewards System Tied to Bitcoin’s Performance BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has created a fun way to earn Bitcoin tokens through a meme coin whose primary use case consists of distributing rewards to token holders. Its milestone-based roadmap is quite simple. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, every time that BTC adds an additional $25,000 to its price, a new reward will be unlocked. The first milestone is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. This should produce an immediate increase in the price of this meme coin. Next up, once the price of Bitcoin hits $150,000, token holders will get a direct BTC airdrop. You can take advantage of BTCBULL’s discounted presale price and reap the highest return once this meme coin is officially launched. To buy the token, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for it or use a bank card to invest.

The digital asset briefly touched $106,000 before settling at its current level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $105,064 — a welcome reprieve for investors who have weathered weeks of regulatory uncertainty and political tension. But it’s not just the price of Bitcoin making headlines this week. In Washington, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are ramping up their efforts to bring clarity and oversight to the U.S. crypto sector, with several key developments pointing to a turning point in digital asset regulation. Lummis: Two Crypto Bills Must Pass in 2025 Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a longtime proponent of responsible crypto legislation, has renewed her call for decisive action in Congress. Speaking with CNBC’s Joe Kernen on Squawk Box this week, Lummis emphasized the importance of passing both the GENIUS Act — focused on digital asset developments and user safety — and the much-anticipated crypto market structure bill. Senator Cynthia Lummis spoke with CNBC on Wednesday about the importance of passing crypto legislation before the year's end. #CynthiaLummis #CryptoLegislation https://t.co/dhmb7SKv6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 “I’m not saying combine them, but they both need to pass this year,” Lummis asserted, stressing the urgent need for legal clarity around stablecoins. Her remarks come amid bipartisan deliberations over how to reconcile separate House and Senate proposals into a unified framework that can win cross-chamber support. GOP Lays Groundwork for Crypto Market Rules In a separate but closely related development, senior Senate Republicans unveiled a set of foundational principles for digital asset regulation. Spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) , the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, the new guidelines aim to establish regulatory clarity while protecting investors. Senate GOP has laid out crypto market structure principles, clarifying regulation and oversight for digital assets. #CryptoRegulation #USSenate https://t.co/4hKf2Ktbim — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 “These principles will serve as an important baseline for negotiations on this bill,” said Scott, who was joined by Senators Thom Tillis, Bill Hagerty, and Cynthia Lummis in crafting the proposal. The document marks one of the clearest signs yet that the Senate is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with the House on comprehensive crypto legislation. The GOP principles are expected to influence the upcoming round of congressional negotiations and could shape the next wave of policy that governs everything from token classifications to consumer protections and compliance requirements for stablecoin issuers. COIN Act Targets Regulation of Politicians’ Crypto Profits Meanwhile, the intersection of politics and crypto has triggered a legislative response of its own. Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the COIN Act (Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure), which would ban presidents and their immediate families from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. Senator @SenAdamSchiff has introduced legislation that would bar the president, vice president, and their family members from crypto. #Crypto #Trump https://t.co/9niXxDMAc0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 The bill — clearly aimed at potential conflicts of interest — also mandates disclosure of any digital asset transactions exceeding $1,000. Violators could face up to five years in prison and civil penalties equivalent to the profits earned. Schiff’s legislation comes amid growing concerns over President Trump’s expanding involvement in the digital asset space. Trump-Linked Crypto Firm Prepares Stablecoin Audit Those concerns are far from hypothetical. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a cryptocurrency firm tied to Donald Trump, is stepping up efforts to bolster credibility. Co-founder Zak Folkman announced at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn that the company is preparing to release a third-party audit of its stablecoin holdings, alongside a new mobile app launch. Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial plans to release a stablecoin audit and debut a new app soon, co-founder Zak Folkman confirmed Wednesday. #Trump #WLFI https://t.co/yVPQqslR4F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 The audit, conducted by an independent accounting firm, is intended to boost transparency as WLFI faces mounting political and regulatory scrutiny. Folkman also hinted at upcoming changes to WLFI’s governance token, suggesting that enhanced token liquidity may be on the horizon. “I think everyone is going to be very, very happy,” he told the audience, stopping short of revealing concrete details. Trump Media Moves Ahead with $400M Buyback Rounding out the week’s Trump-crypto nexus, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. — the parent company of Truth Social — announced a $400 million share buyback plan. The buyback, approved by the board of directors, is positioned as a move to return value to shareholders while retaining strategic flexibility. @TrumpMediaTech has unveiled a $400M stock buyback and maintains a $2.3B Bitcoin reserve. #TrumpMedia #Bitcoin https://t.co/oCc9eMHuSo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 23, 2025 Also the company continues to guard a sizeable $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury, showing the president’s growing entanglement with the digital asset world. “The Board took a vote of confidence in our company, our stock, and our strategic plans,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media. Crypto Regulation To Face Crossroads Ahead Taken together, these developments show a pivotal moment for U.S. crypto regulation. From legislative momentum in Congress to headline-making moves by politically connected crypto firms, the digital asset landscape is rapidly evolving. While price action may grab the headlines, it’s the slow grind of regulatory clarity that will ultimately determine the shape and success of the U.S. crypto market.

Fedyakina, who reportedly branded herself as a cryptocurrency expert, orchestrated what prosecutors described as a pyramid scheme targeting investors in 2023. She was accused of promising quick returns through digital asset deals while ultimately draining clients’ funds. Moscow Court Sentences ‘Bitmama’ to 7 Years Over $23M Bitcoin Scam The scam involved at least four known victims and totaled around 2.2 billion rubles, approximately £17 million at the time, according to The Telegraph . Fedyakina reportedly told her clients that their money would be converted to cryptocurrency in Dubai, helping them avoid Russian sanctions. In return, she offered a 1% bonus on the transferred funds. But investigators say the promised returns never materialized. Instead, the funds disappeared soon after the transfers. A spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee said Fedyakina acted with intent to deceive. “Fedyakina had a criminal intent to steal money or cryptocurrency by deceiving an indefinite number of people,” the spokesperson said. “She did so under the guise of investing in her activities in the transportation and purchase and sale of oil, oil products, gold, and other minerals.” Russian media reports did not link the stolen funds to any specific international cause, but some sources outside the country claimed prosecutors believed some of the money may have been transferred to Ukraine. Those claims have not been independently verified, and Russian outlets reporting on the case made no mention of them. Fedyakina’s defense team denied the fraud charges. They insisted she supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and had expressed willingness to financially support the Russian military. She was arrested in 2023 while attempting to leave Russia for the United Arab Emirates. At the time of her detention, Fedyakina was six months pregnant. She later gave birth in a maternity hospital before being returned to custody. On June 24, the Presnensky District Court in Moscow delivered the final judgment. Despite her appeals, she was sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to repay 2.2 billion rubles to her victims. Due to inflation, the compensation amount is now estimated at around £20 million. Fedyakina had marketed herself under the nickname “Bitmama,” claiming she ran global operations and could deliver massive returns in cryptocurrency. Prosecutors said it was all a front designed to lure in investors and steal their funds under the promise of sanctioned-proof crypto trading. The sentencing marks one of the largest crypto fraud cases in Russia in recent years and adds to growing scrutiny over unregulated crypto schemes in the country. Russia Intensifies Crypto Crackdown with Arrests, Seizures, and Hydra-Linked Investigations The sentencing of a so-called “crypto expert” and her mother in Moscow for a $23 million Bitcoin scam is just one piece of a much broader crackdown by Russian authorities on crypto-related crimes. In recent months, Russian law enforcement has intensified efforts to trace, seize, and prosecute crypto assets linked to illicit activity. On June 2, investigators confiscated $8.2 million worth of crypto from Dmitry Pavlov, a key figure in the now-defunct Hydra darknet market. Pavlov, who admitted to managing the platform’s servers, reportedly earned his crypto “salary and bonuses” for maintaining Hydra’s infrastructure. Prosecutors say he held the coins, anticipating price growth, rather than converting them to fiat. Hydra, once a dominant player on the darknet, is believed to have facilitated over $5 billion in crypto transactions before being dismantled . In December, a Moscow court sentenced 16 individuals involved in Hydra’s operations , with mastermind Stanislav Moiseev receiving a life sentence. Stanislav Moiseev, the mastermind behind the notorious online black market Hydra, has been handed a life sentence by a Russian court. #Hydra #Crypto https://t.co/9uuAfft63K — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2024 The crackdown has also extended to illegal crypto mining. On June 3, police in Amur Oblast seized ₽7 million (~$88K) in BTC from a former power company official who operated unauthorized mining rigs. Two weeks later, officials shut down a large-scale farm in Krasnoyarsk Krai , which earned over ₽4.6 million (~$58K) monthly by exploiting state-owned land. Together, the arrests, seizures, and undercover activity paint a stark picture of how deeply entangled crypto has become in Russia’s underground economy and how aggressively authorities are now moving against it.

Analysts suggest this could lead to a remarkable rally, capturing the excitement of investors. This anticipated move might push Dogecoin to heights unseen, igniting interest across the crypto community as market dynamics shift. Amidst the excitement surrounding Dogecoin, other meme coins like Codename:Pepe crypto are gaining attention. Promising advanced profits through genuine AI analysis, this project seeks to stand out by offering real utility and exclusive trading insights. As new players enter the field, the crypto landscape seems poised for thrilling shifts, with opportunities unfolding for savvy investors. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, two of the most prominent trends today. Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use ""AI"" as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility, while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum.

The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices. The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market: AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Dogecoin: From Meme to Mainstream in the Crypto World Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrencies, featuring the Shiba Inu from the ""Doge"" meme. Created by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to Bitcoin. Surprisingly, it gained a devoted community and widespread fame. Using the Scrypt algorithm with no supply cap, Dogecoin allows unlimited coin creation. Its faster block time than Bitcoin results in quicker transaction confirmations, making it ideal for small transactions and online tipping. This technology supports its efficiency and accessibility. Currently, Dogecoin remains attractive due to strong community support and celebrity endorsements, notably from Elon Musk. Despite competition from other cryptocurrencies, its enthusiastic following keeps it prominent in the crypto world. Its friendly image continues to appeal to a broad audience. Dogecoin's price history is marked by volatility. It soared to all-time highs in 2021 amid social media buzz but also faced sharp declines. Its price movements often align with overall crypto market trends and public sentiment, reflecting its unpredictable nature. Long-term predictions vary. Some forecasts suggest growth; others point to continued volatility. For instance, CoinCodex projected significant price increases by 2030. As always, investors should conduct thorough research due to market uncertainties. Conclusion While Dogecoin's recent pattern indicates the possibility of a significant breakout, its short-term potential may be limited compared to innovative projects entering the market. Established coins like DOGE might not offer immediate substantial gains as they face increasing competition from new tokens leveraging advanced technologies. One such promising project is Codename:Pepe crypto, which introduces genuine artificial intelligence to maximize profits in the meme coin arena. This token provides AI-powered trading signals and fully automated trading capabilities, helping investors capitalize on market trends before they become widespread. By holding Codename:Pepe crypto, investors gain access to an exclusive DAO membership, insider analytics, and staking rewards. With a capped supply and community-driven approach, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself as a compelling option for those seeking significant returns in the current bull run.

This surge is not just any increase but a potentially monumental ascent that could redefine its market position. The crypto community is abuzz with talks about Dogecoin potentially skyrocketing by a staggering 4,000%, catapulting its value past the $4 mark. This speculation stems from a detailed analysis by market experts who have identified a crucial 'second low' formation in its trading graph. The Significance of the 'Second Low' in Dogecoin’s Market Behavior Historically, the 'second low' pattern has often preceded significant bullish runs in various assets. For Dogecoin, this pattern suggests a potential for breaking out of its usual trading range to reach unprecedented highs, driven by both its inherent market appeal and external economic factors. Codename:Pepe: A New Contender in the Crypto Scene While Dogecoin deals with its potential market breakthrough, another crypto project, Codename:Pepe, is making waves by combining the quirky charm of meme coins with serious technological innovation. This project leverages AI to create a distinctive edge in the increasingly crowded crypto market.

In just a few months, the project minted instant millionaires, mainly driven by its active community on X. However, those who did not get in at the ground floor have never been able to make meaningful gains. Since DOGE runs purely on hype, predicting price movements is difficult, which is why smart investors are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Like DOGE, analysts forecast a massive upside of over 31x when the tokens go live. However, unlike DOGE, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on utility, and not mere hype. The design of its protocol and a commitment to the long-term security of its users means that this project will continue to deliver massive benefits for its community for years to come. These factors have seen interest in the presale grow to astronomical levels, and it is quietly becoming the talk of the crypto industry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Second Chance At Success For those who missed the early gains of DOGE, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a second chance at success, with the added benefit of long-term stability. Tokens in the ongoing presale are selling for $0.03 in phase 5, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. So far, over $11.2 million has been raised from around 12,450 unique buyers. With a planned listing price of $0.06, tokens in the current phase are going for a generous 50% discount. Investors have been snapping them up, looking to capitalize fully on the massive discount. So far, 50% of the tokens in phase 5 have been sold out, less than a month after they launched. Consequently, the window to grab your MUTM tokens at the massive discount is closing fast. If you act now, you will receive a 100% guaranteed ROI when the tokens go live at $0.06. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035, reducing the guaranteed ROI to 71.43%. Based on the analysts’ forecast of a 31x gain, if you purchase $1,800 worth of MUTM tokens today, you stand to make over $55,000 on your investment when the tokens launch publicly. The Ultimate Protocol Design The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is designed to offer solutions to the DeFi industry. Its utility-driven design will ensure that MUTM tokens will experience long-term growth in value far beyond the token launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s collective pools to earn interest. Borrowers, meanwhile, deposit collateral into the pools to access the liquidity. The protocol requires that all loans taken on the protocol be overcollateralized. This overcollateralization ensures that, in case of rapid market shifts, there is a buffer in which liquidators can step in and save the situation. The liquidators’ role is to purchase collateral at a discount, thus preventing losses for lenders. Discounts offered to liquidators are based on the urgency of the situation and can be adjusted upwards to get them to act promptly. Security On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team places a premium on security, and they have taken steps to ensure the security of all users’ assets. Their first step was to get a CertiK audit, which they successfully passed, and received a Token Scan Score of 95 from CertiK. The team has upped the stakes when it comes to security via a partnership with CertiK. The partnership is focused on the $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. In this program, vulnerabilities are classified in four tiers, which are Critical, Major, Minor, and Low. Based on the threat that a vulnerability poses to the continued existence of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), it will be classified into one of these four tiers. The security experts, blockchain developers, and ethical hackers will thus be rewarded appropriately. To secure users’ assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses various strategies. One of them is ensuring access to reliable price data. To achieve this goal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement Chainlink price data oracles, a commonly used source of data in the DeFi world. The price oracle data will be paired with a backup data source to ensure the maximum possible uptime. Additionally, the project will rely on on-chain DEX data, where there is sufficient liquidity. Conclusion From the overall protocol design description above, it is quite clear that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built for long-term gains. Coupled with a committed team that is working hard to ensure the long-term security of the protocol and the safety of funds, the MUTM tokens are built for growth. With the current discount of 50%, buying your tokens now could be the best decision you have made in your crypto investment journey to date.

United States President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a move that could shift the central bank’s approach to interest rates and market liquidity. The Dow Jones climbed more than 300 points midweek, and the ripple reached the crypto market too—Bitcoin nudged higher to around 106,950 before easing slightly. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Markets are reading this as a signal. If Powell is pushed out in favor of someone more open to cutting rates, risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could benefit. The US dollar slipped to a three-year low, and bond yields retreated, adding to the sense that easier money may be coming. For crypto investors, this is a setup worth watching. The #USD fell to a three-year low on intensifying speculation that President Trump could soon nominate a new Fed Chair to replace Powell after his term ends next May, a development that could render him a lame duck writes @johnjhardy in today’s #forex update.… — Ole S Hansen (@Ole_S_Hansen) June 26, 2025 Trump Moves Toward Possible Fed Overhaul Reports from multiple outlets say Trump is seriously considering replacing Powell before his term ends in 2026. Though no official announcement has been made, sources suggest Trump has discussed potential successors with advisors. His criticism of Powell’s policies isn’t new, but the recent rise in inflation concerns and election-year pressure may be accelerating the timeline. The market response was immediate. Traders began to price in a more dovish Fed policy, which generally means lower interest rates and increased liquidity. That would be good news for crypto, which has languished under tighter monetary conditions throughout the last year. Bitcoin, which is often used as a hedge against fiat debasement, likes to rally when the dollar declines and rates come down. Bitcoin Price Reacts With Caution Bitcoin was trading at 106,950 Friday, with a daily high of 107,250 and a low of 106,145. It wasn’t a breakout, but it was a clear sign of rising interest. Ethereum and other top coins saw similar quiet moves upward. Traders are treading carefully, knowing that talk of replacing the Fed chair is one thing, but actually doing it is another. Stocks Lead The Way, Crypto Follows The bullish mood started with equities. The Dow surged more than 300 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed higher. Tech stocks led the rally, pushed by falling Treasury yields and hopes that rate hikes are off the table for now. That optimism spilled into crypto markets, where risk sentiment plays a big role. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears Crypto Market Eyes Washington There’s still a lot of uncertainty.

Now it’s here. $10 will melt resistance. $100 will melt faces. ” As XRP continues to consolidate around the $2 mark for several weeks, investors are weighing whether a major breakout is imminent and just how far it could go once momentum returns. XRP Consolidates Above $2 Amid Ongoing Legal Drama As of report time, XRP is trading around $2.09, fluctuating between $2.08 and $2.15. While this may seem unremarkable on the surface, the significance lies in the stability. XRP has maintained its position above $2 for several weeks, despite regulatory noise and broader market volatility, a sign of underlying strength and growing investor conviction. This consolidation follows recent legal developments. On June 26, Judge Analisa Torres denied Ripple and the SEC’s joint request to reduce Ripple’s penalty to $50 million and lift the permanent injunction against institutional XRP sales. While the ruling temporarily shook confidence, XRP quickly recovered, maintaining its tight range near $2, indicating that market participants are largely forward-looking, focusing more on fundamentals than court proceedings. Meanwhile, whale accumulation continues. More than 2,850 wallets now hold over 1 million XRP, and futures open interest remains robust. These indicators reflect sustained institutional interest and a bullish long-term outlook. They said $XRP would never hit $2 again. Now it’s here. $10 will melt resistance. $100 will melt faces. What happens when the switch really flips? — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 27, 2025 Why $10 Is the Real Battlefield The idea of XRP reaching $10 has long been treated as speculative, but the path is becoming clearer. Technical analysts highlight strong support near $1.90 and resistance near $2.30–$2.70. A clean break above that zone could trigger a sharp leg upward into the $3–$4 range, levels not seen since XRP’s 2018 peak. Fundamentally, Ripple is building significant momentum. Institutional partnerships, such as the recent integration with Hidden Road, ongoing upgrades to the XRP Ledger, the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, and the addition of CME-listed XRP futures all point to broader utility and market maturity. These developments suggest that XRP is evolving beyond its remittance roots into a core liquidity and settlement asset for tokenized finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 X Finance Bull’s statement that “$10 will melt resistance” captures this moment. Crossing that psychological barrier would likely mark a cascading breakout, fueled by renewed retail interest, short liquidations, and institutional FOMO. The $100 Vision, More Than Just Hype? While $100 may sound like wishful thinking, it’s a projection rooted in possibility. If XRP becomes a global bridge asset for central bank digital currencies, real-world asset tokenization, and cross-border settlement rails, the upside potential becomes exponential. That would require regulatory clarity, mass-scale adoption, and deep integration into institutional infrastructure, but with Ripple continuing to push in those directions, the vision isn’t entirely implausible. XRP’s prolonged consolidation around $2 is more than just market inertia; it’s pressure building. With technical setups pointing to an imminent move and fundamentals stronger than ever, the road to $10 may be closer than skeptics believe. If the momentum builds and the “switch” really flips, XRP could not only shatter resistance but it could redefine market expectations altogether.

Created Panic in the Market!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-eth-founder-vitalik-buterin-sold-2-trillion-memecoins-created-panic-in-the-market/,"Ethereum (ETH) founder Vitalik Buterin, one of the most important names in the cryptocurrency industry, receives gift altcoins from many projects. Buterin states that all altcoins sent to his wallet by altcoin teams are donated to charity each time. At this point, Buterin made a new sale on one of the memecoins he received as a gift. Buterin, who previously sold on the memecoin called LEDOG (DOG), sold two trillion DOG tokens today and converted them to Ethereum. While investors closely follow the movements of a prominent name like Vitalik Buterin, such as token sales, it is known that such large sales transactions usually bring high volatility and panic selling. Because investors are concerned about the impact on the market of large token sales made by people like Buterin. However, although Buterin's latest sale poses a risk of decline for DOG, it may not mean a definite collapse. The community's reaction from now on is important. At this point, experts estimate that the DOG price will depend on how much the community can support liquidity and prevent panic. In addition, a sudden increase in Ethereum's hourly trading volume was observed at the moment Buterin made a sale. Although the DOG sale only brought 4.4 ETH, ETH's hourly trading volume skyrocketed immediately after the DOG-ETH swap. Finally, it should be noted that given Buterin’s history of quickly redistributing or selling such assets, there is a high probability that the purchased ETH will re-enter the market in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

It has surpassed the previous H1 crypto hacking record from 2022. To be precise, the first half of this year lost more than $2.1 billion across at least 75 distinct hacks and exploits, TRM says. This is “a significant surge in illicit activity,” it warned. It is some 10% higher than the H1 2022 high. Moreover, it’s nearly equal to the total stolen amount over the entire year of 2024. Therefore, this data “highlights an increasingly concentrated threat to digital assets.” Source: TRM Labs Furthermore, two factors fueled this amount: infrastructure attacks and state-sponsored activity. Notably, the infamous Bybit attack alone accounted for nearly 70% of the above total. Therefore, February saw the biggest hack in the history of crypto, with $1.46 billion gone. Moreover, because of this one hack, the average hack size grew to nearly $30 million. This is double the USD 15 million average in the first quarter of 2024. The report notes that the Bybit hack “massively skewed” the H1 2025 total, but that January, April, May, and June saw total thefts in excess of $100 million. This suggests “a broad, persistent threat.” Therefore, based on these findings, “H1 2025 marks a pivotal shift in crypto hacking: escalating strategic intent from state actors and other geopolitically motivated groups,” TRM Labs says. “Massive breaches, often linked to nation-state operations, now demand more than traditional cybersecurity.” You may also like: Ex-Employee Hacks Bedrock UniBTC for $2M: Fuzzland Uncovers Insider Exploit Fuzzland has disclosed a $2 million insider attack that targeted Bedrock’s UniBTC protocol in September 2024, was carried out by a former employee who used malware, social engineering, and privileged access to compromise internal systems.Fuzzland has taken full responsibility for the breach and reimbursed all affected parties.Insider Access Used in $2M Bedrock Protocol ExploitFuzzland, in a post on X, revealed that a past employee exploited the UniBTC protocol via a sophisticated... Infrastructure Attacks Dominated the Crypto Hacking Landscape The report notes that infrastructure attacks – which seek to gain unauthorized control, mislead users, or reroute assets, and are often boosted by social engineering or insider access – accounted for over 80% of stolen funds in H1 2025. These include private key and seed phrase thefts, as well as front-end compromises. Moreover, infrastructure attacks were, on average, ten times larger than other attack types. Next, protocol exploits, including flash loan and reentrancy attacks, accounted for 12%. These attacks target vulnerabilities in a blockchain’s smart contracts or core logic to steal funds or disrupt system behavior. They also show “persistent vulnerabilities in DeFi smart contracts.” Meanwhile, the analysts also highlighted “the persistent and alarming role of state-sponsored crypto attacks.” Some of the most dangerous are North Korea-linked groups, such as the notorious Lazarus , which were also behind the Bybit incident. These groups are responsible for $1.6 billion, or some 70%, of the total stolen amount in H1 2025. TRM Labs describes them as “the most prolific nation-state threat actor in the crypto space.” North Korea is leveraging illicit crypto gains not only to evade sanctions, but also “as an integral component of its statecraft.” Israeli authorities have arrested three citizens accused of spying for Iran—allegedly paid in #crypto —just days after the $90 million Nobitex hack.

This one hacked Iran’s largest crypto exchange, Nobitex , on 18 June, stealing $90 million. Not only that, but the group released the platform’s full source code , exposing users to further risk. This attack suggests “other state actors may increasingly leverage crypto hacks for geopolitical ends,” TRM Labs says. The attackers transferred stolen funds to deliberately unspendable vanity addresses, suggesting political motives. “As digital assets increasingly intertwine with national security, so too will the sophistication and geopolitical motives of their exploiters,” the report warns. TRM concludes that “the path forward requires multifaceted collaboration.” This includes better cooperation among global law enforcement, financial intelligence units, and specialized blockchain intelligence firms.

The company sold more than $24 million worth of shares from Coinbase Global Inc. and Block Inc. This move comes shortly after Coinbase’s stock reached a new all-time high (ATH). The decision comes at a time when the U.S. crypto market is showing signs of strength and growing regulatory clarity. Ark Invest Sold Coinbase Shares at Market Peak This sale was carried out through Ark’s flagship exchange-traded fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK). Ark Innovation ETF sold 33,363 shares of Coinbase, totaling around $12.5 million. This sale was timed as Coinbase’s stock closed at $375.07 on Thursday, up 5.54% for the day. The stock has jumped 27.02% over the past five days and has gained an impressive 51.06% so far in 2025. Notably, the exchange’s stock rose just a day after it helped the U.S. Secret Service in an investigation. This effort resulted in the seizure of $225 million in cryptocurrency linked to investment scams. Many see this move as a confidence booster, showing that the company is secure, reliable, and trusted by regulators. At the same time, the exchange’s recent price rise is partly driven by more supportive and forward-moving U.S. policies toward crypto. Recently, the Senate approved the GENIUS stablecoin bill , which is now heading to the House. The bill aims to create clear rules for stablecoins. Block Inc. Also Part of the Ark’s Selloff In addition to Coinbase, Ark Invest also sold 189,649 shares of Block Inc., a financial services company led by Jack Dorsey. This sale generated an additional $12.3 million. Block’s stock price closed slightly higher at $65.11 on Thursday, up just 0.46% for the day. The company experienced a challenging year in 2025, with its stock declining 23.39% since January. Unlike Coinbase, Block’s stock has not experienced a significant rise, but the company is making substantial moves in the industry. In May, the company announced plans to integrate Bitcoin payments on Square using the Lightning Network by 2026. Circle’s CRCL Sees Renewed Momentum Thursday also saw a rise in the stock price of Circle’s CRCL, the company behind the USDC stablecoin. Circle’s stock, recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), closed up 7.56%. This continued a rally that had briefly paused earlier in the week. This gain highlights renewed investor interest in companies tied to stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure. Circle’s stock valuation now exceeds its stablecoin’s $60 billion circulating supply, USDC.

Bitcoin (BTC) is also riding high, having broken back above the $106,000 resistance. Will Bitcoin be the next to attain an all-time high? S&P 500 all-time high - still climbing Source: TradingView The S&P 500 on the weekly time frame shows the complete recovery for the biggest Wall Street companies. The new all-time high pushes the index to 6,177 points, well beyond the 6,000 points resistance, and a good way higher than the previous 6,147 all-time high. With the weekly close just a few hours away, it remains to be seen how much higher the price might go. As can be noted in the chart above, the price is approaching an ascending trendline. Given that the Stochastic RSI indicators (bottom of chart) are beginning to top out, there may be some sideways, accumulative price action to come, with the possibility of a dip, possibly back to the region of 5,700 if 6,000 does not hold. $BTC nears top of channel Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC reveals how the price is being maintained inside the descending channel. The last swing low may have put the fear of God into some investors, as the price hit a low of $98,300. Be that as it may, the price bounced well from there, and is now near the top of the channel. The price could still hit the top of this channel, but the odds are that some sideways and downwards price action could follow from here, allowing the shorter term Stochastic RSIs to reset back to the bottom. The 4-hour Stochastic RSI is already there, and therefore this might provide the momentum needed to touch the top of the channel. $BTC bull flag has emerged Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $BTC illustrates that the descending channel is probably a bull flag. This makes things even more bullish. If the price can emerge from the top of this flag and confirm above, the next step higher can begin. Bullish weekly Stochastic RSI close Source: TradingView All eyes need to be on the weekly time frame. While there may be one last dip down to come, to the strong supports at $106,000 or $104,000, there could be a bullish close of the Stochastic RSI. If the indicators can continue to flatten out, this augurs well for the following week, where we might see them cross back up, and with this, an impending breakout.

Key Takeaways: GF Securities and HashKey have launched GF Token, offering daily-yielding tokenized securities. The tokens aim to strengthen Hong Kong’s push for real-world asset tokenization. Other Chinese brokers are racing to enter Hong Kong’s crypto market. HashKey announced Friday that the new daily-yielding, daily-redeemable securities, dubbed “GF Token,” are targeted at high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. The USD version of the tokens will track the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a key benchmark reflecting overnight borrowing costs backed by U.S. Treasury securities. GF Token Set for Launch Soon on HashKey Chain Issued on HashKey Chain, the tokens are expected to be distributed soon. “This milestone signifies a major step forward in the city’s real-world asset tokenization journey and lays the groundwork for broader on-chain collaboration within Hong Kong’s securities industry,” HashKey said in its statement. Zeng Chao, CEO of GF Securities (Hong Kong), called the partnership with HashKey a strategic move to strengthen the firm’s lead in digital finance. “This step will further solidify GF Securities (Hong Kong)’s first-mover advantage in emerging digital finance,” he said. The launch comes a day after the Hong Kong government unveiled its latest policy statement, outlining plans to accelerate real-world asset tokenization and expand the city’s crypto licensing regime.

Meanwhile, other major Chinese brokers are also moving fast. Earlier this week, Guotai Junan International received approval to offer crypto trading in Hong Kong , while China Merchants Securities and Huatai International are reportedly seeking license upgrades to enter the digital asset market. Bergen County to Tokenize $240B in Property Deeds on Avalanche Blockchain Bergen County, New Jersey’s largest county by population, has struck a five-year deal with Balcony to tokenize 370,000 property deeds on the Avalanche blockchain, covering an estimated $240 billion in real estate. This marks the biggest deed tokenization effort in U.S. history and is backed by Avalanche-focused venture fund Blizzard. Home to nearly one million residents and generating $500 million yearly in property taxes, Bergen County aims to modernize land record management and speed up deed processing through blockchain integration. A report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) and Boston Consulting Group estimates the global value of tokenized illiquid assets will reach $16 trillion by 2030 . Even more conservative estimates from Citigroup suggest that $4 trillion to $5 trillion worth of tokenized digital securities could be minted by 2030. Recognizing this potential, major companies are making significant moves in the tokenization space. Goldman Sachs, for instance, plans to launch three new tokenization products later this year, driven by growing client interest.

All three are making headlines for very different reasons—yet together, they represent the vanguard of what’s next in digital finance. Chainlink’s recent integration with Mastercard has sent shockwaves across the industry. The collaboration has raised critical questions about the role of on-chain data in enhancing secure global payments. Meanwhile, Aptos has surged more than 12% after launching its next-gen hot storage solution, Shelby, designed to redefine private key access and self-custody for the Web3 ecosystem. But perhaps the most compelling development comes from Qubetics, a Web3 Layer 1 aggregator that’s not only raising millions during its presale but is also preparing to launch on a top 10 global exchange, with analysts already forecasting a 20% listing-day price surge. At the intersection of infrastructure innovation and financial opportunity, Qubetics is being widely named the best crypto presale to buy for 2025, especially as the countdown to its listing accelerates. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN Solves a Real-World Privacy Crisis As privacy concerns dominate headlines and censorship rises globally, Qubetics introduces a use case that’s strikingly relevant: a fully decentralized, blockchain-based VPN integrated into its ecosystem. Unlike traditional VPN providers that rely on centralised server architecture prone to surveillance or breaches, the Qubetics VPN leverages smart contracts and distributed nodes to deliver tamper-proof anonymity. Consider a political journalist in a surveillance-heavy region needing to access blocked information without risking exposure. Or consider a US-based marketing agency working with overseas clients that must securely exchange region-restricted assets and project data. In both cases, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN shields identity and traffic data with zero reliance on a single point of failure. Even mid-sized e-commerce businesses struggling with data privacy compliance across jurisdictions can adopt the Qubetics VPN to maintain secure, regulation-friendly communications while using decentralised protocols that automatically adapt to network conditions. Qubetics doesn’t merely improve VPN usability; it eliminates the trust gap that conventional tools can’t close. And this practical relevance is what’s fuelling strong uptake during its presale phase, positioning it as the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 from both a technical and utility standpoint. Presale ROI Could Be Game-Changing: Why Qubetics Presale May Deliver Serious Upside The current Qubetics presale is at Stage 37, with a token price of $0.3370. More than 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold, raising over $18.1 million, and onboarding 28,300+ token holders so far. As the token supply has been trimmed to 1.36 billion, with only 38.55% of that allocated to the public, scarcity has now become part of the long-term value proposition. At present, fewer than 9 million tokens remain at this price, after which the Qubetics presale will close and all access shifts to open market listings. Here’s what that could mean in real numbers. A commitment of $5,500 at the current rate yields approximately 16,323 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $1 post-launch, the holding would value at $16,323, generating a 197% return. If the token moves to $5, the valuation grows to $81,615, and at $10, that same early commitment could reach $163,230. For those projecting higher valuations based on previous Layer 1 rallies, $TICS reaching $15 would make that portfolio worth over $244,845. This structure isn’t just mathematically attractive. It’s architected for longevity. The public sale ends at 8 AM UTC on June 30, followed by the listing at 11 AM UTC on the same day, priced at $0.40, which is a 20% uplift from the current stage. As anticipation builds around the listing on one of the world’s top 10 exchanges, early adopters see this as a rare chance to lock in exposure before mass retail access kicks in. The ongoing combination of real-world application, presale traction, and scarcity-led design validates why Qubetics is not only the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 , but also one that analysts are calling a 100x project in waiting. Three Hours to Market: Qubetics Locks in June 30 Exchange Debut Momentum surrounding Qubetics is reaching a boiling point as the project formally announces its upcoming exchange listing, just three hours after the close of the public presale. Scheduled for June 30 at 11:00 AM UTC, this listing will debut $TICS at $0.40, representing a direct 20% premium on the current token price. While the project has not yet disclosed the exchange name, it has confirmed placement on a top 10 global platform, aligning it for high visibility and deep order book access at launch. The final presale stage closes on June 30 at 8:00 AM UTC, locking out latecomers just hours before the token becomes accessible to global participants via public markets. This short window, coupled with aggressive presale momentum and the token’s listing mechanics, has driven urgency across communities and analysts alike. Many believe this timing structure was no accident—designed specifically to reward presale supporters and create an efficient launch funnel that prevents liquidity fragmentation at entry. Qubetics’ roadmap includes a full mainnet launch in Q2 2025, with its decentralized VPN rolling out across supported ecosystems. By building real value before even hitting the exchange, Qubetics flips the typical launch narrative on its head. As participants weigh projects worth supporting before the next market cycle hits, the Qubetics launch has become a focal point for those tracking serious projects with growth mechanics already baked in. Chainlink Partners with Mastercard to Advance Regulated Blockchain Transactions In a move that expands the real-world credibility of blockchain infrastructure, Chainlink has officially partnered with Mastercard to integrate its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) with Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN). This collaboration addresses a vital gap in regulated asset movement across blockchains, combining Mastercard’s payment security expertise with Chainlink’s decentralized oracle services. The use case, featured in a pilot program, enables the simulation of secure identity and asset verification across financial institutions like the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank for International Settlements. These systems allow permissioned wallets to simulate secure messaging, identity transfers, and fund movements while remaining blockchain-native. The integration of bank-verified identity into Web3 wallets is a major leap for compliance, scalability, and financial legitimacy. Chainlink’s infrastructure now becomes critical to the functioning of Mastercard’s ambitions in digital identity and multi-asset interoperability. This signals a turning point where enterprise-grade payment systems no longer exist parallel to blockchain—they run through it. Aptos Surges 12% Following Hot Wallet Network Launch ‘Shelby’ Aptos, the modular Layer 1 blockchain founded by former Meta engineers, has introduced a game-changing hot storage network named Shelby—and the market has responded accordingly. Within 24 hours of the announcement, Aptos recorded a 12% price spike, fueled by widespread enthusiasm for the project’s growing infrastructure portfolio. Shelby leverages zero-knowledge encryption and multi-device private key routing, ensuring users can authorize wallet actions securely without exposing their keys. This is a radical improvement over legacy hot wallets, which have historically been the weak point in digital asset custody. With Shelby, Web3 participants gain access to secure, recoverable, and scalable wallet infrastructure—ideal for DeFi protocols, DAOs, and cross-platform consumers. For Aptos, Shelby represents more than just technical achievement; it positions the network as a foundational layer for the next phase of Web3 usability. Combined with Aptos’ high transaction throughput and finality benchmarks, the addition of Shelby rounds out the project’s broader vision: Web3 infrastructure that serves both developers and institutional gatekeepers alike. Why Qubetics, Chainlink, and Aptos Are Leading the Next Cycle of Blockchain Evolution This week’s developments reflect a broader shift: utility, interoperability, and launch strategy are now the main differentiators in crypto. Chainlink is taking enterprise adoption to new heights through its work with Mastercard. Aptos is revolutionizing self-custody with real infrastructure. And Qubetics is combining an already-functional product with a rare exchange entry model, all while preparing for a highly anticipated launch. What makes Qubetics especially noteworthy is the timing. As Chainlink and Aptos soar on established networks, Qubetics is just entering the market—with the potential to unlock compounding returns through utility-driven scarcity. For those analyzing the top crypto presale opportunities, this project stands firmly ahead of the pack. With fewer than 9 million tokens left at current pricing, and its launch date set for June 30, Qubetics isn’t just another name in the market. It’s a frontrunner for the best crypto presale, backed by utility, strategy, and rapidly accelerating momentum.

Many Whales Bet On It,https://cryptopotato.com/is-ethereum-eth-seriously-undervalued-right-now-many-whales-bet-on-it/,"Ethereum (ETH) began climbing again this week, along with the rest of the market. However, it remains trapped under the $2,879 level for now. Even as it struggles to spearhead the much-anticipated “altseason,” its network activity is telling a louder story. Historic Activity on Ethereum On June 25, Ethereum recorded 1,750,940 confirmed transactions. This was the third-highest daily count in its history and breaking a months-long downward trend in on-chain activity. The “Ethereum: Transaction Count (Total)” metric captures all confirmed network transactions, including ETH transfers, DeFi operations, smart contract executions, and DApp interactions, and gives a clear insight into real usage. Such high activity levels have not been seen since January 14, 2024, when the cryptocurrency set its all-time high record with 1,961,144 transactions before usage gradually declined. The latest spike comes even as ETH’s price has shown volatility, ranging between and $2,111-$2,879 over the past month, as traders, DeFi protocols, and arbitrage bots actively adjust positions in real time. This divergence between price weakness and strong on-chain activity suggests a potential early signal of accumulation and renewed DeFi interest, even if it is not yet reflected in ETH’s market valuation. Meanwhile, institutional and retail interest seems to be steady, with stable ETH holdings on exchanges and rising transaction volumes on Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, which continue to handle a significant share of Ethereum’s daily settlement activity. CryptoQuant said that these developments point to deeper structural resilience in the network’s usage patterns. “These developments reinforce Ethereum’s pivotal role in the broader crypto ecosystem and suggest that the network’s recent on-chain spike is not an isolated event, but part of a deeper structural recovery.” Amid these signals of underlying strength, whale activity has emerged as another key indicator reflecting deep-pocketed confidence in Ethereum. Whale Purchases Accelerate Whales continue aggressive ETH accumulation, rapidly draining exchange supplies. Investor Ted Pillows highlighted one whale’s $8.91 million ETH purchase via Galaxy Digital yesterday, adding to $422 million in Ethereum amassed within a month. These large-scale buys suggest mounting confidence among whales, even as overall market sentiment remains cautious. The post Is Ethereum (ETH) Seriously Undervalued Right Now?

Momentum is thinning, resistance levels remain intact, and investor conviction appears to be fading—at least for now. This week’s data hints at a temporary shift in capital flows, leaving room for new players to take the spotlight. For brands navigating similar market slowdowns, Outset PR offers clarity through custom-built crypto communications. Using proprietary media analytics and a performance-first approach, Outset PR helps Web3 projects thrive in uncertain markets with strategies that align perfectly with real-time trends. Solana Struggles to Break Resistance Amid Price Erosion Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is showing signs of fatigue after weeks of erratic price swings. Currently trading between $119 and $152, the token has repeatedly failed to break through its key resistance at $171. Short-term performance remains negative, with a 3% loss over the past week and a nearly 20% drop for the month. On a six-month horizon, SOL has shed more than 27%, suggesting long-term momentum is also cooling. While bulls still eye a breakout toward $204, the lack of volume and market enthusiasm makes such a move increasingly unlikely in the immediate term. For now, the focus remains on whether support near $107 can hold. Ethereum Hits Ceiling as Momentum Cools Off Source: tradingview Ethereum is hovering between $2,000 and $2,500, but upward traction appears limited as it struggles to pierce through resistance near $3,000. Support sits at $1,700, a critical zone that could come under pressure if sentiment weakens further. Over the past six months, ETH has dropped close to 30%, and despite some signals of stabilization—such as a mid-range RSI and a climbing stochastic oscillator—the momentum isn’t convincing. Volume has thinned out, and without new catalysts, Ethereum may remain locked in this consolidation range. Until buyers return with conviction, a breakout looks increasingly out of reach. XRP Faces Resistance as Buyers Lose Conviction Source: tradingview XRP is trading between $1.84 and $2.27 but has lost upward steam as it approaches its resistance at $2.52. While a breakout could technically open the path toward $2.95—a 30% potential gain—momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index around 38 show a lack of urgency from buyers. Support at $1.66 still holds, but if pressure mounts, it may not be enough to prevent a pullback. Over the past weeks, XRP has shown signs of stabilizing, but not enough to build sustained bullish momentum. With trading volume decreasing and price movement tightening, XRP appears poised for a slower, more uncertain week ahead.

The recent and significant Dollar decline against a basket of major currencies, particularly the Euro, serves as a powerful reminder of how macroeconomic shifts can send ripples across all asset classes, including the digital ones. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how are these shifts reshaping the global economy ? Why is the Dollar Experiencing a Significant Decline? The mighty US Dollar, long considered a safe haven and the world’s primary reserve currency, has been on a noticeable downward trajectory. This isn’t a random fluctuation; rather, it’s the culmination of several interconnected factors influencing the Forex market . Investors are closely scrutinizing central bank policies, inflation data, and the overall economic outlook, all of which are contributing to the Dollar’s current weakness. Several key elements are at play: Shifting Interest Rate Expectations: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking cycle, which bolstered the Dollar for much of the past year, appears to be nearing its peak. Markets are now pricing in fewer future rate hikes, and even potential cuts, as inflation shows signs of cooling. This reduces the Dollar’s yield advantage compared to other currencies where central banks are still in tightening mode. Inflation Dynamics: While US inflation remains elevated, the pace of increases has slowed. This could alleviate pressure on the Fed to maintain a highly hawkish stance, leading to a less attractive carry for the Dollar. Economic Growth Concerns: Worries about a potential recession or significant economic slowdown in the United States are weighing on investor sentiment. A weaker economic outlook can deter foreign investment, thereby diminishing demand for the Dollar. Risk Appetite Return: As global economic fears somewhat subside and optimism about China’s reopening grows, investors are showing a greater appetite for riskier assets. This often leads to a rotation out of safe-haven currencies like the Dollar. To illustrate the factors contributing to the Dollar decline , consider the following: Factor Impact on USD Explanation Federal Reserve Policy Negative Anticipation of a dovish pivot or pause in rate hikes reduces the Dollar’s yield appeal. US Economic Data Negative Weaker-than-expected jobs or GDP figures signal a slowdown, reducing demand for the Dollar. Global Risk Sentiment Negative Increased global optimism encourages investors to move away from safe-haven assets like the USD. Inflation Trends Negative Signs of decelerating inflation may prompt the Fed to ease its tightening stance sooner. What’s Fueling the Euro Strength and Demand? In stark contrast to the Dollar decline , the Euro has experienced a remarkable resurgence, finding significant demand across the Forex market . After a challenging period marked by energy crises and inflation concerns, the single currency is now benefiting from a confluence of positive developments. This newfound Euro strength is a key driver in the broader shift in currency trends . Here’s why the Euro is gaining traction: European Central Bank (ECB) Hawkishness: Unlike the Fed, the ECB is still firmly in tightening mode. With inflation remaining stubbornly high in the Eurozone, the ECB has signaled its commitment to further significant rate hikes. This aggressive stance makes Euro-denominated assets more attractive for yield-seeking investors. Improving Economic Outlook: Despite earlier fears, the Eurozone economy has shown surprising resilience. Energy prices have eased considerably, and the bloc has managed to avoid a severe recession, boosting confidence in the region’s economic stability. Reduced Energy Concerns: The milder winter and successful efforts to diversify energy supplies have significantly reduced the immediate threat of an energy crisis in Europe. This has removed a major overhang for the Euro. Positive Capital Flows: As investor sentiment improves towards Europe, capital is flowing back into the region, supporting the Euro. This includes foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows. The Euro strength is not just a reflection of Dollar weakness; it’s a testament to the Eurozone’s improving fundamentals. The market is increasingly optimistic about the region’s ability to navigate current challenges and deliver growth. How are these Currency Trends Impacting the Forex Market? The interplay between the Dollar decline and Euro strength is creating significant volatility and new opportunities within the broader Forex market . The EUR/USD currency pair, the most traded pair globally, is a direct reflection of these shifting dynamics. As the Euro gains ground against the Dollar, it signals a recalibration of global financial power and investor confidence. These evolving currency trends have several implications: EUR/USD Rally: The primary consequence is the robust rally in the EUR/USD pair, which has climbed significantly from its multi-decade lows. This upward momentum is expected to continue as long as the underlying factors of Dollar weakness and Euro strength persist. Impact on Other Currencies: The Dollar’s broad weakness often provides breathing room for other major currencies, such as the British Pound (GBP) and the Japanese Yen (JPY), allowing them to regain some lost ground. Emerging market currencies also tend to perform better when the Dollar is weaker, as it eases debt burdens denominated in USD. Commodity Prices: A weaker Dollar generally makes dollar-denominated commodities, like oil and gold, cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially boosting their demand and price. This is a crucial factor for the global economy . Investor Positioning: Traders and institutional investors are actively adjusting their positions, unwinding long Dollar bets and building up long Euro positions. This shift in sentiment can create self-reinforcing trends in the short to medium term. What Does This Mean for the Global Economy? The significant shifts in currency trends , particularly the Dollar decline and Euro strength , have far-reaching consequences for the entire global economy . These currency movements influence trade balances, corporate earnings, inflation, and investment flows, affecting nations and businesses worldwide. Key impacts on the global economy include: Trade Dynamics: A weaker Dollar makes US exports cheaper and more competitive globally, potentially boosting American industries. Conversely, it makes imports more expensive, which could contribute to domestic inflation. For the Eurozone, a stronger Euro makes their exports more expensive but imports cheaper, potentially easing inflationary pressures from imported goods. Corporate Earnings: Multinational corporations with significant international operations are directly impacted. US companies with overseas earnings will see those earnings translate into fewer Dollars when the Dollar is weaker. European companies, on the other hand, might see their foreign earnings boosted when converted back to a stronger Euro. Inflationary Pressures: A weaker Dollar can contribute to imported inflation in the US, as goods purchased from abroad become more expensive. For the Eurozone, a stronger Euro can help to dampen imported inflation, a welcome development for the ECB in its fight against rising prices. Debt Burdens: Many developing nations and corporations hold Dollar-denominated debt. A weaker Dollar eases the burden of servicing this debt, as it requires less local currency to repay. This can provide much-needed relief to economies under financial strain. Investment Flows: The relative strength of currencies can influence where international capital flows. A stronger Euro might attract more foreign direct investment into the Eurozone, while a weaker Dollar might make US assets less appealing to some foreign investors. These currency shifts underscore the interconnectedness of the global economy , where one nation’s currency movements can send ripple effects across continents, influencing everything from the price of consumer goods to the profitability of multinational corporations. Navigating the Shifting Sands: Actionable Insights and Challenges For investors, businesses, and even individuals, understanding these major currency trends is paramount. The Dollar decline and the rise of Euro strength present both challenges and opportunities that require careful consideration. The Forex market is dynamic, and staying informed is key. Challenges to Consider: Volatility: While the trend seems clear, currency markets can be highly volatile. Unexpected economic data, geopolitical events, or central bank interventions can cause sharp reversals. Uncertainty: The path of inflation and central bank policies remains uncertain. Any significant deviation from current expectations could alter the currency landscape. Hedging Costs: Businesses involved in international trade need to manage currency risk. The cost of hedging can fluctuate with market volatility. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Trends: Diversify Portfolios: Consider diversifying investments across different currencies and regions to mitigate risk. Assets denominated in stronger currencies like the Euro might offer better returns. Monitor Central Bank Commentary: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Their guidance on interest rates and economic outlook will be crucial in determining future currency movements. Re-evaluate International Exposures: For businesses, it’s a good time to re-evaluate pricing strategies, supply chains, and hedging policies in light of the changing currency landscape. Consider Commodity Exposure: Given the potential for commodity prices to rise with a weaker Dollar, certain commodity-related investments could offer a hedge or opportunity. Stay Informed on Global Economy: Keep a close eye on global economic indicators, especially from major economies like China and Europe, as their performance can influence overall risk sentiment and currency flows. Conclusion: A New Era for Global Currencies The ongoing Dollar decline and the surging Euro strength mark a pivotal moment in the Forex market , reshaping fundamental currency trends that will impact the entire global economy . This isn’t merely a cyclical adjustment but potentially a structural shift influenced by diverging monetary policies, evolving economic resilience, and a recalibration of investor confidence. While the Dollar may still reclaim some ground, the current trajectory suggests a more balanced multi-polar currency environment could be emerging. Understanding these profound shifts is essential for anyone navigating the complexities of global finance, from institutional investors to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, as the ripple effects will be felt across all asset classes and international trade. Staying agile and informed will be key to capitalizing on the opportunities presented by this fascinating period of currency realignment.

Circle, issuer of USDC, has seen its stock rise about 500% since its debut on June 5. This week, the company was valued at a staggering $77 billion , which is well above the total market cap of USDC itself (about $62 billion). Bullish signals for stablecoins were all around: CRCL is now the most popular foreign stock in South Korea . The leading stablecoin issuer, Tether, has so much spare cash it can afford to have a determinative stake in Juventus , an Italian soccer team.

Masayoshi Son is aiming to transform SoftBank into the world leader in artificial superintelligence—a form of AI that is, at least on paper, smarter than humans—within the next decade, and he is betting everything on the ambition. SoftBank’s founder is going all in on ASI Masayoshi Son announced his ambitions at an annual shareholder meeting held in Tokyo on Friday. He also proclaimed that only a handful of companies will reap the benefits from the around 600 trillion yen, equivalent to $4.155 trillion, of profit that stands to be made from ASI in the next ten years. One way he plans to ensure his company, with its Japanese roots, is one of them, is by strengthening its relationship with OpenAI . Masayoshi said that by year’s end, SoftBank will have invested up to $32 billion in OpenAI, making it one of the largest single investments ever made in a private company. And the investment is bearing fruit. Back in February, both companies announced a plan for a joint venture to provide major Japanese companies with advanced enterprise AI called “Cristal intelligence.” SoftBank’s investments in OpenAI align with Masayoshi’s faith in the Altman-led firm’s value. The famous CEO believes OpenAI will eventually go public and ultimately become the most valuable company on Earth. Masayoshi sees that listing happening in a few years. Masayoshi Son thinks it is important to stay in America’s good books SoftBank has increasingly gotten bolder about its push into the AI sector, and it recognizes America as a nutrient-rich substrate on which it can fast-track its plans. Last July, it acquired the UK-based AI chip maker Graphcore. This year, it announced the acquisition of U.S. semiconductor design company Ampere Computing in a $6.5 billion deal. Also, earlier this year, SoftBank teamed up with OpenAI to announce a joint project called Stargate to build infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker. Database company Oracle and MGX, an investor backed by the United Arab Emirates, have also been named equity partners in the venture. The companies will invest up to $500 billion in Stargate over the next four years. Many eyes are on SoftBank’s investment plans as Japan tries to close a deal with the Trump administration, which is hell bent on addressing trade deficits and attracting more foreign investment into the United States. On the subject of his relationship with President Trump, Son emphasized the importance of working closely with the U.S. administration, calling America the “world’s largest AI hub and the technical epicenter of this revolution.” Son is convinced “America is where the greatest opportunities lie,” and he is all for staying in its good books if it means his company benefits in the long run. He has to be because he expects his $32 billion to be a bargain in the long run. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While others fade in and out of relevance, these veterans are proving they’re not done yet. From utility-driven upgrades to deep developer trust, their current technical setups reflect more than hype — they reflect resilience. This July 2025 recap is brought to you by Outset PR — a crypto PR agency combining media strategy with performance analytics to deliver results that scale. XRP: Primed for Rebound as Bulls Eye $2.95 Target Source: tradingview Despite recent pullbacks, XRP continues to hold strong within the $1.84–$2.27 range, reinforcing its presence as a dominant market player. With solid support around $1.66 and a Relative Strength Index near 38, XRP is far from overbought—leaving room for a bullish surge. A breakout above the $2.52 resistance could set the stage for a run toward $2.95, offering nearly 30% upside from current levels. As XRP trades close to its moving averages, traders are watching closely for a breakout that could reestablish its upward trajectory in the coming weeks. Solana (SOL): Market Giant Gearing Up for a Comeback Source: tradingview Solana remains one of the most-watched altcoins despite recent volatility, holding its ground between $119 and $152. While SOL has faced short-term setbacks, it continues to attract bullish attention due to its strong fundamentals and technical setup. A move above its key resistance at $171 could unlock a sharp rally toward $204—representing over 30% potential growth. With firm support near $107 and growing anticipation for a broader market breakout, Solana’s current positioning suggests that it’s still a major contender in the crypto race for dominance.

This DeFi Token Could Be Your Second Chance,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-solana-sol-in-2021-this-defi-token-could-be-your-second-chance/,"If you weren’t able to catch the Solana (SOL) breakout in 2021, you’re not alone, but another chance may be forming rapidly. While veteran investors are on the hunt for the next cryptocurrency to moon, one fresh DeFi token trading at $0.03 is creating a buzz across trading groups, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 50% is already sold out because of huge demand. Over $11.2 million has been raised to date and over 12,500 investors have joined. Mutuum Finance is gaining real DeFi traction, and analysts and early adopters are making bold 2025 predictions. Mutuum Finance Breaks the $11.2 Million Mark Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well on its path to being one of the hottest projects in DeFi. With an astonishing $11.2 million raised and over 12,500 investors already joining, the presale is gaining serious traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already determined official launch price of $0.06, early investors already enjoy a 100% profit before the token is even available for sale. Some even foresee a post-launch price bounce of more than $2.50 before the bull run of 2025 is finished. Unlocking Adaptive Intelligence in DeFi Borrowing Mutuum Finance is notoriously revolutionizing the decentralized finance with its lending platform that emphasizes its user control, security, and freedom. Mutuum will offer a two-sided model that incentivizes multiple avenues of DeFi interaction instead of pushing users toward a single model. Its Peer-to-Contract offers an opportunity to invest USDT in automated smart contracts where the interest rate can vary based on the direction in the market. It is a passive income stream since one needs no manual intervention to execute trades since it is a consistent stream of income. To those who need to have more freedom of action it is open to them to utilize the use of the Peer-to-Peer method where the same lenders’ and borrowers’ groups are given freedom to open talks amongst themselves and agree on their own terms and do not necessarily need to rely on a third party of groups. Open, trustless, with complete control of one’s own money, it would be a sound choice as a more volatile environment or other atypical lending system. With the strength of automation and the ability to personalize, Mutuum Finance can establish a new standard of DeFi lending; can have a fully automated product without necessarily sacrificing control of the entire system. $100,000 Leaderboard and Giveaway Prizes Now Live Mutuum Finance is celebrating its amazing growth and compensating early bird supporters with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for getting in early. In addition to this, the project has also revealed a live leaderboard, and the top 50 holders of the MUTM token will get special bonus rewards, adding a gamified aspect to the presale and making it more fun to be involved in. Missing out on Solana in 2021 was a bitter reality for most people, but perhaps Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the second chance that has been waiting for investors. The project is already in presale Phase 5 and has accordingly purchased over $11.2 million with more than 12,500 investors attracted, mirroring huge early demand. At a very affordable $0.03 price point, MUTM is expected to soar and blast well beyond the $2.50 point. It is a project that guarantees value, innovation, as well as growth. Supported by a two-model DeFi lending ecosystem, end-user full control, and a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum Finance is the real deal. Be a part of the presale now and get to the front of the line of what may be the next DeFi breakout success.

In a move that underscores this accelerating convergence, Lion Group Holdings (LGHL) has made a groundbreaking announcement that is set to reverberate across the digital asset landscape. For anyone tracking the evolution of institutional involvement in crypto, this development offers compelling insights into the future direction of corporate treasury management and digital asset integration. Lion Group Holdings Dives Deep with Strategic SUI Tokens Acquisition In a significant declaration, Lion Group Holdings has officially unveiled its plans to acquire a substantial amount of SUI tokens , marking a pivotal moment in the firm’s overarching $600 million crypto treasury strategy. This strategic pivot signals LGHL’s profound commitment to embedding itself within the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem . The news, initially reported by CoinDesk, highlights not just a passive interest but an active, aggressive push into digital assets. Beyond the headline-grabbing SUI acquisition, LGHL also revealed a notable $2 million purchase of HYPE tokens. While SUI represents a foundational Layer 1 blockchain, HYPE tokens likely serve a specific utility within a particular ecosystem, showcasing LGHL’s diversified approach to its digital asset portfolio. This multi-token approach suggests a well-thought-out strategy rather than a speculative gamble, aiming to capitalize on various facets of the blockchain economy. The core of this ambitious initiative lies in LGHL’s commitment to allocate a substantial 75% of proceeds from a convertible debenture facility specifically towards further token acquisitions. This mechanism provides a clear roadmap for how the firm intends to fund its aggressive foray into the crypto space, with SUI tokens explicitly named as a primary target for these future purchases. It’s a clear signal: Lion Group Holdings isn’t just dipping its toes; it’s diving in headfirst. What Does a $600 Million Crypto Treasury Strategy Entail? The concept of a crypto treasury strategy is gaining traction among forward-thinking corporations. Unlike traditional corporate treasuries that primarily focus on cash management, liquidity, and risk mitigation using fiat currencies and conventional financial instruments, a crypto treasury expands this scope to include digital assets. For Lion Group Holdings, a $600 million allocation represents a monumental commitment, positioning them as a significant institutional player in the crypto market. Typically, a crypto treasury strategy aims to achieve several objectives: Diversification: Adding uncorrelated or less correlated assets to a traditional balance sheet to potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Inflation Hedge: Viewing certain cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or potentially even robust Layer 1 tokens like SUI, as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. New Revenue Streams: Exploring opportunities through staking, DeFi protocols, or participation in blockchain governance to generate yield or capital appreciation. Strategic Positioning: Establishing a presence in the Web3 space to understand and leverage emerging technologies and business models. For LGHL, this strategy appears to be a blend of these goals, aiming to secure a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The sheer scale of the $600 million allocation underscores the firm’s belief in the long-term value and disruptive potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Fueling the Future: How Does a Convertible Debenture Facilitate Token Acquisition? The announcement mentioned that 75% of proceeds from a convertible debenture facility would be used for further token acquisition . This is a crucial financial detail that sheds light on LGHL’s funding mechanism. A convertible debenture is a type of long-term debt instrument that can be converted into a predetermined number of common shares (or, in this case, potentially linked to the firm’s overall digital asset performance or specific tokens) at the investor’s option. Key aspects include: Debt First: Initially, it functions as a loan to the company, providing capital without immediate equity dilution. Conversion Option: Investors have the option to convert their debt into equity (or another asset class) if the underlying asset’s price performs well, offering potential upside. Lower Interest Rates: Due to the conversion option, convertible debentures often carry lower interest rates than traditional bonds, making them an attractive financing option for companies. By using a convertible debenture facility, Lion Group Holdings can raise significant capital for its crypto treasury without immediately diluting its existing shareholders. It allows investors to participate in the potential upside of LGHL’s digital asset strategy while having the safety net of a debt instrument. This sophisticated financing approach highlights the seriousness and strategic depth behind LGHL’s move into the crypto space. What Does This Mean for the SUI Blockchain Ecosystem and Beyond? The institutional backing from a publicly traded entity like Lion Group Holdings is a significant validation for SUI tokens and the broader SUI blockchain ecosystem . SUI, developed by Mysten Labs (founded by former Meta employees who worked on Diem and Novi), is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for high performance, low latency, and scalability, utilizing the Move programming language. This acquisition could have several profound implications: Enhanced Legitimacy: Institutional investment often brings a stamp of approval, signaling to other large players and retail investors that the asset is viable and has long-term potential. Increased Liquidity: Large-scale acquisitions can boost market liquidity for SUI, making it easier for larger trades to occur without significant price slippage. Developer Confidence: With increased institutional interest and potential funding, the SUI ecosystem might attract more developers and projects, fostering innovation and growth. Broader Adoption: LGHL’s involvement could pave the way for SUI to be integrated into more traditional financial products or services, expanding its utility and reach. This move by Lion Group Holdings also serves as a powerful case study for other traditional financial institutions contemplating their entry into the digital asset space. It demonstrates a viable pathway for integrating cryptocurrencies into corporate strategies, potentially catalyzing further institutional adoption across the entire blockchain ecosystem . Navigating the Challenges in the Token Acquisition Journey While the prospects of a robust crypto treasury are enticing, Lion Group Holdings will undoubtedly face a unique set of challenges in its token acquisition journey: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations. Managing a $600 million portfolio in such a volatile environment requires sophisticated risk management strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. LGHL will need to navigate complex and often ambiguous regulations concerning token holdings, trading, and reporting. Custody and Security: Securing such a large volume of digital assets is paramount. Implementing robust custody solutions, whether self-custody or third-party institutional custodians, will be critical to prevent hacks or loss. Integration Challenges: Integrating digital assets into existing accounting, legal, and operational frameworks of a traditional financial firm can be complex and resource-intensive. LGHL’s success will hinge on its ability to effectively address these challenges, demonstrating that traditional firms can indeed manage the complexities of the digital asset world responsibly. Conclusion: A New Era for Lion Group Holdings and the Blockchain Ecosystem Lion Group Holdings’ bold decision to pursue a $600 million crypto treasury strategy , spearheaded by significant SUI tokens acquisition, marks a transformative moment for the company and a strong signal for the broader financial industry. This strategic commitment to the blockchain ecosystem , funded in part by a sophisticated convertible debenture facility, positions LGHL as a trailblazer in integrating digital assets into traditional corporate finance. As the lines between conventional finance and the decentralized world continue to blur, LGHL’s initiative offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of institutional investment. It highlights the growing recognition of digital assets not merely as speculative instruments but as legitimate components of a diversified, forward-looking treasury. The journey ahead will undoubtedly present its share of challenges, but the strategic intent behind this substantial token acquisition signals a profound belief in the enduring power and potential of blockchain technology.

46901152,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107921,1751045653,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Bitwise Files Updated Application For Spot Dogecoin ETF Amid Overwhelming SEC Approval Odds,https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-files-updated-application-for-spot-dogecoin-etf-amid-overwhelming-sec-approval-odds/,"Asset manager Bitwise has updated its filing for a U.S.-listed spot Dogecoin (DOGE) exchange-traded fund, indicating that the Securities and Exchange Commission may soon approve the investment vehicle. Bitwise Includes In-Kind Redemptions In Amended DOGE ETF Filing On Thursday, ETF provider Bitwise submitted updated S-1 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos exchange-traded funds. This move, according to pundits, is an indication of increased approval odds. “Bitwise has filed amended S-1s for their spot dogecoin ETF and their spot aptos ETFs,” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed on X. “Good signs as it indicates SEC engagement, and tracks with other spot approvals.” Notably, the Dogecoin filing was amended to include in-kind creations and redemptions, which were not present in Bitwise’s initial application. According to Balchunas, in-kind redemptions, whereby broker-dealers interacting with the ETF can directly trade shares for DOGE tokens instead of cash, are a “near-lock” for spot crypto ETFs “across the board.” At present, all U.S.-based crypto funds must exchange their tokens for cash, then swap that cash for shares — or swap the shares for cash, then the cash for tokens — which is considered less tax efficient. Notably, Bitwise was the first company to submit paperwork for a DOGE ETF in January. Other asset managers, including Grayscale and 21Shares, have also filed to introduce their own funds tracking the price of the OG memecoin. Multiple issuers and industry leaders have sought in-kind creations and redemptions for months, particularly for spot BTC and Ether ETFs that are already on the market. “You’re not adding in kind to the Doge ETF if they didn’t say it was probably kosher,” Balchunas opined. “And if it’s kosher for the Doge ETF, it’s going to be kosher for Bitcoin, which is a much bigger market. “It’s got to be close to 100% that we’ll see in kind creations for all of [the funds].” During a panel at the Bitcoin Policy Institute on Wednesday, US Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commissioner Hester Pierce said in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs are “certainly on the horizon.” Dogecoin was changing hands at approximately $ 0.1615, down 1.3% over the last 24 hours. The popular canine-themed meme coin, created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, is currently ninth-ranked on the crypto leaderboard with a $24.2 billion market capitalization. High Likelihood Of SEC Approval The Securities and Exchange Commission under the new Donald Trump administration has adopted a more lenient approach to crypto when compared to the previous Biden-Harris regime. Since the change of leadership at the SEC, companies have looked to get the agency’s approval for a slew of crypto ETFs, from ones tracking Ripple-affiliated XRP to Solana’s SOL to DOGE and Official Trump. Last week, Bloomberg experts raised the odds of the SEC greenlighting the majority of these spot crypto ETF filings in 2025 to 90% or above.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-27 17:34:13

Their names are synonymous with resilience, utility, and institutional adoption. But with crypto markets entering a new rotation phase, some analysts now believe these established leaders may not lead the next wave of explosive growth. Instead, attention is shifting to earlier-stage altcoins—particularly MAGACOIN FINANCE—which some say could mirror the breakout patterns that propelled Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin in past cycles. This isn’t a dismissal of the major players. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs, and enterprise-level applications. Solana has achieved rare mainstream visibility, backed by powerful investor narratives and growing retail enthusiasm. XRP, after years of regulatory uncertainty, is regaining momentum on the back of possible ETF listings and settlement innovations. These coins aren’t going anywhere. But what they offer in stability, they may now lack in raw upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into the Early-Mover Advantage A growing number of analysts argue the next generation of wealth-building in crypto will come from projects still in their early stages—those with untapped narratives, viral community backing, and enough momentum to ride a full bull cycle from the ground up. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Unlike the blue-chip names that have already logged massive gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is just getting started. Its presale phase has attracted a surge of attention, fueled by a low entry price and an emerging base of early supporters who view it as a high-risk, high-reward contender. What’s drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and Solana isn’t just the marketing. It’s the timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is landing at a moment when retail and institutional traders alike are hungry for fresh narratives—tokens with room to move and communities eager to rally. The core of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s appeal is its blend of meme coin virality and financial utility. It’s not just a token riding hype. It’s being built on a DeFi lending framework that positions it to participate in deeper, long-term conversations around value and use. This dual identity—as both a speculative play and a product with planned functionality—is what some analysts believe gives it a shot at outperforming more mature coins that may now struggle to recreate their historic gains. Market Rotation Is Fueling the Shift Toward Early-Stage Altcoins The trend behind this shift is called capital rotation. As coins like Ethereum and Solana consolidate after massive runs, liquidity begins to flow into smaller-cap projects with room for exponential growth. That rotation is already underway, and analysts say the conditions are now ideal for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to step into the spotlight. It has a story. It has a base. And critically, it hasn’t yet priced in the kind of parabolic move that defined the last cycle’s breakout winners. None of this makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a sure thing. It’s still early, untested, and entirely dependent on sustained traction. But that’s also why the upside is being taken seriously. The same could be said of Dogecoin when it was trading under a cent, or Solana when it was just another smart contract chain fighting for market share. Early-stage altcoins are where conviction meets risk—and sometimes, that mix delivers outsized rewards. XRP, Ethereum, and Solana will still move with the market. They will benefit from ETF momentum, institutional adoption, and long-term ecosystem growth. But according to a growing chorus of analysts, the next real breakout may come from outside the old guard. In 2021, that role belonged to Solana. In 2025, it might belong to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Bitcoin billionaire and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has highlighted multiple catalysts that could supercharge the next BTC bull run to fresh all-time highs. 3 Signs That Suggest BTC Has Room For Further Upside Arthur Hayes took to X on Thursday to outline catalysts that he expects to drive Bitcoin prices higher in the coming months. For starters, the Bitcoin OG pointed to the United States’ monetary policy. Hayes noted that the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption for banks is currently “progressing.” The so-called SLR exemption is a monetary policy tool that lets banks hold more U.S. Treasury securities without raising their supplementary leverage ratio, a move that raises their liquidity. On top of that, Hayes pointed to the US legislation, including the passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, a bill designed to set up guardrails around the approval and supervision of U.S. stablecoin issuers. According to the former BitMEX CEO, the GENIUS Act “hands US stablecoin market to banks.” Finally, Hayes claimed that the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are a boon for safe haven assets like Bitcoin, amid a fragile President Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire pact between Israel and Iran. “BTC all-time highs are coming.” Earlier this month, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would more than double within the next six months, rocketing to the $250,000 mark. The rocket surge will be buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve accelerating money printing to manage a ballooning national debt load. Billionaire investor Tim Draper made a similar call earlier this month, highlighting regulatory tailwinds for the flagship crypto under the Trump-Vance regime. But for Draper, Bitcoin’s journey to $250,000 this year will be bolstered by a bevy of companies making BTC their treasury reserve asset.",Bitcoin|News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-27 17:38:04

We just launched two major upgrades to accelerate commerce’s next leap: Stablecoins Bolt Connect for marketplaces Here’s why they matter — Bolt (@bolt) June 27, 2025 This development follows Bolt’s strategic partnership with Palantir for AI-powered Checkout 2.0 and the launch of Bolt’s SuperApp crypto hub. Bolt’s timing aligns perfectly with the explosive adoption of stablecoins across the payments industry. Source: CryptoQuant The total stablecoin market grew $33 billion in 2025 , driven by renewed trading activity and increased regulatory clarity under President Trump. USDT maintains $155 billion market cap while USDC reached a record $61 billion, growing 39% since January. The broader payments ecosystem is rapidly embracing stablecoin infrastructure. Major players, including Stripe , Visa, Mastercard, and Fiserv, have all launched stablecoin initiatives in recent months. Traditional banks are following suit with JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo reportedly exploring joint stablecoin projects. ‘Bolt Connect’: Marketplace Revolution Through Infrastructure Simplification Bolt Connect eliminates traditional barriers that force marketplace operators to choose between growth velocity and technical complexity, handling compliance, payouts, and backend infrastructure automatically. The solution addresses critical pain points for marketplace operators who previously required significant development resources to onboard and support multiple sellers. Stablecoin integration within Bolt Connect creates particular advantages for cross-border marketplace operations. Traditional international payments often involve multiple intermediaries, currency conversion fees, and settlement delays extending several business days. Stablecoins eliminate these friction points by enabling direct peer-to-peer transfers without the need for correspondent banking relationships. For merchants operating globally, stablecoin payouts offer immediate access to funds, eliminating the risk of foreign exchange volatility. The timing coincides with the dramatic growth of stablecoins across the payments sector.

As it stands now, monthly stablecoin transfers now exceed $4.1 trillion. Business-to-business stablecoin payments reached $36 billion annual run rate, while card-linked stablecoin transactions crossed $13 billion. These metrics indicate genuine utility that both retail and institutional investors are adopting. Global Payment Giants Embrace Stablecoin Infrastructure The stablecoin payment revolution extends far beyond Bolt’s innovation, with traditional financial giants rapidly implementing digital dollar infrastructure across their networks. Stripe’s recent aggressive expansion includes Stablecoin Financial Accounts serving 101 countries , the acquisition of Privy wallet , and the integration of the Bridge platform. Stripe is creating a comprehensive crypto infrastructure solution. @stripe acquires crypto wallet infrastructure startup @privy_io in undisclosed deal, marking its second major crypto acquisition following the $1.1 billion Bridge purchase as stablecoins settle record $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025. https://t.co/TeTdIVgt0V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 Similarly, Visa’s recent partnership with Yellow Card enables stablecoin payments across 20 African countries, while its investment in BVNK validates the development of stablecoin infrastructure. BVNK’s network processes $27 trillion annually in stablecoin volume across 1.25 billion transactions, demonstrating massive scale adoption. Mastercard is not left behind. Its recent “360-degree” stablecoin approach enables 150 million merchants to accept digital dollar payments through partnerships with Circle and Paxos. The company, in collaboration with OKX, also launched a Card and Multi-Token Network that provides comprehensive stablecoin settlement capabilities across traditional payment rails. Fiserv’s FIUSD launch on the Solana blockchain targets its 10,000-strong financial institution network to use stablecoin, while partnerships with PayPal explore PYUSD integration for cross-border transfers.

Recent developments in the ongoing saga between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have once again stirred discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike. A recent decision by Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to reject a joint motion from Ripple and the SEC has naturally raised eyebrows. However, for those eyeing the potential approval of a Spot XRP ETF , a prominent pro-Ripple attorney offers a surprisingly optimistic perspective. Understanding the Latest Ripple SEC Court Dismissal To fully grasp the implications of the latest court ruling, it’s essential to understand what a ‘joint motion’ entails in a legal context, particularly concerning the Ripple SEC lawsuit. In this instance, both parties, Ripple and the SEC, had jointly approached the court regarding certain procedural aspects or perhaps a minor dispute within the broader litigation. Judge Analisa Torres, who has presided over significant parts of this high-profile case, ultimately dismissed this joint request. While any rejection from the court might initially seem like a setback for Ripple, attorney Fred Rispoli, a vocal supporter of Ripple’s position, quickly offered a nuanced interpretation. According to Rispoli, this specific dismissal, while a procedural point, does not directly threaten the prospects of an XRP ETF . His reasoning centers on a crucial distinction that has been central to the entire lawsuit: the status of XRP on the secondary market. Key takeaways from this dismissal, according to Rispoli’s analysis, include: Procedural, Not Substantive: The dismissal likely pertains to a procedural agreement or a minor point of contention between the parties, rather than a fundamental ruling on XRP’s security status. Focus on Primary vs. Secondary: The core of the SEC’s argument against Ripple has always revolved around Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities offerings. This latest dismissal does not re-litigate or alter the court’s previous findings regarding XRP’s status on secondary exchanges. No Direct Impact on ETF Criteria: ETF approvals are heavily dependent on the underlying asset’s market characteristics, particularly its trading on secondary markets, not the primary issuance. Why is the XRP Secondary Market Status So Crucial for an ETF? The distinction between primary and secondary markets is paramount when discussing the potential for a Spot XRP ETF . Think of it this way: when a company initially sells its stock directly to investors, that’s the primary market. When those investors then trade the stock among themselves on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, that’s the secondary market. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple primarily targeted Ripple’s direct, programmatic sales of XRP to institutional investors, classifying them as unregistered securities offerings. However, Judge Torres’s landmark ruling in July 2023 determined that XRP, when sold on secondary exchanges to retail investors, does not constitute an investment contract. This distinction is the bedrock of Fred Rispoli’s optimism. Here’s why the XRP Secondary Market status is so vital for ETF approval: Regulatory Clarity: The court’s ruling provided a degree of clarity that XRP, as traded on public exchanges, is not an unregistered security. This reduces a significant regulatory hurdle for issuers looking to launch a spot ETF. Comparison: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Factor Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval XRP Spot ETF Potential Primary Regulatory Hurdle Market manipulation concerns, lack of surveillance-sharing agreements. XRP’s classification as a security (now largely resolved for secondary sales). SEC’s Stance Historically resistant, citing investor protection. More complex due to ongoing lawsuit, but secondary market clarity is a positive. Market Structure Robust, liquid spot market. Robust, liquid spot market, now with legal clarity on status. Investor Protection: ETFs are designed to offer regulated access to assets. If the underlying asset’s secondary market trading is deemed legitimate and non-security, it aligns with the SEC’s mandate to protect investors within regulated financial products. Precedent from Bitcoin ETFs: The recent approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs by the SEC sets a significant precedent. While each asset is evaluated individually, the framework and the SEC’s comfort with regulated spot crypto products have increased. The core requirements, such as surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets, will likely apply to a potential Spot XRP ETF as well. Fred Rispoli emphasizes that the injunction against XRP selling, which the SEC might seek, only truly matters if the SEC decides to enforce it broadly to impact secondary markets. He suggests the SEC could opt not to enforce such restrictions on the secondary market, focusing instead on Ripple’s direct sales if any. This flexibility on the SEC’s part could be pivotal. The Role of Fred Rispoli and His Insights Attorney Fred Rispoli has become a notable voice in the cryptocurrency legal landscape, particularly concerning the Ripple-SEC case. His consistent analysis and interpretations have provided valuable insights for the XRP community. Rispoli’s perspective is rooted in a deep understanding of securities law and the specific nuances of the Ripple litigation. His ability to dissect complex legal jargon and translate it into understandable implications for the market has made him a trusted source for many. Rispoli’s argument that the secondary market status is the “key factor” influencing XRP ETF approval aligns with the broader legal and regulatory trends seen in the crypto space. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the mechanisms of trading and the integrity of the exchanges where these assets are bought and sold, rather than solely focusing on their initial distribution methods. This shift in focus is a significant win for XRP, as its secondary market trading has been largely deemed legitimate by the court. Beyond the Courtroom: The Influence of Regulatory Reform and Paul Atkins While court rulings provide clarity, the broader regulatory environment plays an equally significant role in the approval of new financial products like a Spot XRP ETF . Fred Rispoli wisely points to the importance of potential shifts in crypto regulation, specifically mentioning whether a ‘new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins’ is geared up for reform. While Gary Gensler currently chairs the SEC, the mention of Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner known for his pro-market and less interventionist stance, highlights the ongoing debate within regulatory circles about the future of crypto oversight. The crypto industry has long advocated for clear, comprehensive regulatory frameworks that foster innovation rather than stifle it. The current patchwork of regulations and the SEC’s enforcement-first approach have created uncertainty. Should there be a genuine move towards regulatory reform, potentially influenced by figures like Paul Atkins who advocate for clearer rules and less ambiguity, it could significantly expedite the approval process for various crypto-related financial products, including an XRP ETF . What kind of reforms are needed? Here are some key areas: Clear Classification of Digital Assets: A framework that clearly defines which digital assets are securities, commodities, or something else entirely. Innovation-Friendly Regulations: Rules that allow new technologies and business models to flourish without being unfairly constrained by outdated frameworks. Harmonization: Better coordination between different regulatory bodies (SEC, CFTC, etc.) to avoid overlapping or conflicting rules. Pathways for Compliance: Clear guidelines for crypto projects to comply with existing laws, rather than relying on enforcement actions. The debate around regulatory reform is critical because it addresses the systemic issues that create uncertainty for issuers and investors. A more predictable and supportive regulatory landscape would undoubtedly pave the way for more crypto ETFs to gain approval. The Path Forward for a Spot XRP ETF: What to Watch Despite the procedural dismissal, the overall sentiment regarding a Spot XRP ETF remains cautiously optimistic, largely thanks to the legal clarity gained on the XRP Secondary Market . Investors and market participants should keep an eye on several key indicators: SEC’s Stance on Other Crypto ETFs: While Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the SEC’s decisions on Ethereum ETFs and other altcoin ETFs will provide further clues about their evolving comfort level with various digital assets. Court Filings and Appeals: The broader Ripple-SEC lawsuit is not entirely over. Any further appeals or significant rulings could impact the perception of XRP’s regulatory status, though Rispoli’s analysis suggests the secondary market ruling is quite robust. Applications from Asset Managers: The submission of official applications for a Spot XRP ETF by major asset management firms (similar to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF application) would signal serious intent and could kickstart the formal review process. Legislative Developments: Any new crypto legislation emerging from Congress could override or clarify existing regulatory ambiguities, potentially streamlining the ETF approval process. The journey to a Spot XRP ETF is complex, weaving through legal battles, regulatory policy, and market dynamics. However, the insights from experts like Fred Rispoli provide a valuable roadmap, highlighting that the core legal status of XRP’s secondary market trading is the most potent factor in its favor, outweighing procedural skirmishes. Conclusion: Unwavering Optimism for XRP’s ETF Future The latest court dismissal in the protracted Ripple SEC legal battle, while a headline, appears to be a mere blip on the radar for the potential approval of a Spot XRP ETF . As articulated by attorney Fred Rispoli , the fundamental legal clarity achieved regarding the XRP Secondary Market status remains the paramount factor. This distinction, separating Ripple’s past institutional sales from the everyday trading of XRP on exchanges, provides a robust foundation for future ETF applications. The path forward for XRP into mainstream financial products seems increasingly plausible, bolstered by legal precedents and the ongoing push for clearer crypto regulations. While challenges persist, the core legal victory for XRP’s secondary market status offers compelling reasons for continued optimism among its proponents.

Top traders from Ethereum, Litecoin, and XRP are now shifting their attention to a new low-cap altcoin that’s catching fire across investor circles — MAGACOIN FINANCE . From its scarcity-based model to its bold identity, this project is attracting serious attention — and the rotation is already underway. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Getting All the Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly taking over conversations across investment groups, trading hubs, and analysis platforms. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens creates a built-in scarcity that appeals to early-stage investors looking to avoid dilution. No venture capital unlocks, no artificial inflation — just a tight structure built for impact. The project’s HashEx-audited smart contract adds credibility and technical trust. Every indicator — from retail interest to analyst reviews — is aligning around one idea: MAGACOIN FINANCE is set for breakout growth. Analysts now project potential returns of 32x for those gaining early entry before listings go live. Ethereum Traders Start Exploring Outside the Usual Ethereum remains a titan in crypto, but recent whale accumulation is signaling a shift in positioning. In June 2025, wallets holding 1,000–10,000 ETH added over 871,000 ETH in a single day — the largest daily net inflow of the year. With projections for Ethereum hovering between $3,000 and $3,300 for Q3, many traders believe the big moves may already be priced in. Litecoin has seen strong accumulation from large holders since mid-April 2025. Whale wallets have added 2 million LTC over the past few months, fueling a price surge that broke resistance levels. XRP Faces Uncertainty as Traders Eye Alternatives XRP also experienced a sharp jump in whale buying in June 2025. Wallets holding large sums have pushed their total ETH-related holdings above 14.3 million ETH. While XRP’s long-term projections stretch toward $4,900 if favorable conditions persist, many believe the potential for rapid short-term growth lies elsewhere. The Rotation Has Already Started — Here’s Why It Matters Top traders are locking in early access to low-cap opportunities with strong fundamentals — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few tokens meeting those conditions.

A strong defense of this support could set the stage for a double bottom and a rally back toward major resistance levels. Stellar ( XLM ) has been in a corrective phase, but price action is now approaching a technically significant area, a bullish order block that aligns with a key swing low and high time frame support at $0.19. This region holds the potential to act as a structural pivot, especially if bulls can defend the level and push price higher from here. Key technical points Bullish Order Block at $0.19: Aligned with swing low and HTF support. Potential Double Bottom Formation: Structure may form if price holds above recent lows. Low Volume Profile: Current low-volume conditions suggest downside risk until buyer influx appears. XLMUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The $0.19 level is more than just a line of support, it’s a technically packed bullish order block area that aligns with a major swing low. If price holds here, it would complete a double bottom formation, which is often a powerful signal of trend reversal. This pattern would also allow for the formation of a higher low, reinforcing bullish structure. However, price action must stay above the previous swing low for this structure to remain valid. A break below the $0.19 support would nullify the double bottom setup and likely trigger a continuation to new local lows.

At the moment, volume is significantly below average, indicating a lack of active buying pressure. Without an influx in volume, the probability of a successful reversal decreases, and the current support may not hold. That said, if volume begins to surge near the $0.19 region, it could signal accumulation by larger participants. This would increase the probability of a bounce from this area, with price potentially targeting $0.30 and $0.35 as the next key resistance levels. These levels mark previous supply zones and high time frame resistance, and would be the natural next stops if the reversal confirms. What to expect in the coming price action If XLM defends the $0.19 region with volume backing, expect a potential reversal targeting $0.30 and $0.35. Failure to hold this zone could invalidate the double bottom setup and lead to new lows. Watch closely for volume spikes and structural confirmation at support.

46902004,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756589,1751046325,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46902004.jpeg,China and US agree to ease trade curbs in rare earths and tech exports,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-reveals-trade-deal-with-us-to-ease/,"China has disclosed fresh details of a trade pact with the United States that will ease some export restrictions, according to a statement by Beijing’s Commerce Ministry. Under the new understanding, China has agreed to fast-track export licences for rare earths and other controlled materials, while the US will roll back a suite of its own restrictions on Chinese exports. According to the ministry’s brief statement, Chinese officials will carefully examine and authorise applications for items covered by export-control laws . These approvals are expected to include magnets and other critical components vital to electronics, renewable energy, and defence industries. Observers, however, note that the exact categories beyond magnets that will see eased curbs remain unspecified. US and China agree on the cancellation of some restrictive measures In tandem, the US administration has pledged to rescind various existing measures that had been targeting Chinese exports. A spokesperson for Beijing’s commerce department said the US will “correspondingly cancel a range of existing restrictive measures imposed against Beijing,” though they did not elaborate on the exact list or timeline for lifting each measure. “China will review and approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law,” said China’s Ministry of Commerce in a statement released on Friday. “It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway …continuously enhance consensus, reduce misunderstandings, strengthen cooperation, and jointly promote the healthy, stable and sustainable development of China-US economic and trade relations.” – China’s Ministry of Commerce. Few specifics were given beyond the broad strokes, prompting some experts to caution against celebrating too soon. Alfredo Montufar-Helu, senior advisor at think tank The Conference Board’s China center, described the statement as “encouraging” but urged restraint, pointing out that both sides are treating rare earths as a high-stakes bargaining chip for negotiations yet to come. This announcement follows remarks by US President Donald Trump on Thursday, who noted at a White House gathering that “we just signed with China yesterday.” A White House aide later clarified that the two countries had reached “an additional understanding of a framework to implement the Geneva agreement,” referring to the mid-May Geneva talks. Earlier this month in London, top trade envoys, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, hammered out the initial implementation plan during two days of intense negotiations. Experts warn firms on both sides to remain cautious Those discussions aimed to stabilise tensions after both sides accused the other of dragging its feet; Washington complained Beijing was slow to loosen its rare earths export curbs, while China objected to American tech restrictions and visa revocations for students. That preliminary accord had already called for a 90-day pause on most tariffs each country levied on the other and the rollback of some other punitive steps. Friday’s update seems designed to build on that truce by specifying how and when trade in strategic minerals and technologies will flow more freely. Still, Montufar-Helu warns the overall impact may prove limited. “Since both sides consider rare earths as a crucial bargaining chip in future negotiations, I’d expect trade in these minerals to stay somewhat constrained.” – Montufar-Helu Indeed, until Beijing publishes clear guidance on which export controls will be relaxed, and until Washington lists the precise measures it plans to remove, companies are likely to remain cautious in their planning. For now, firms on both sides will be watching closely for official regulations and implementation dates . If the promises made in Beijing’s statement materialize into concrete policy, manufacturers from consumer electronics giants to electric vehicle producers could breathe easier knowing vital components may soon move more freely between the world’s two largest economies. However, without a detailed roadmap, lingering doubts over the pace and scope of these changes may well temper any immediate surge in trade.

While long-established altcoins like XRP and Solana face selling pressure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most promising presales of 2025, offering strong early-stage returns and long-term fundamentals. XRP and Solana: Long-Term Progress Shadowed by Uncertainty XRP, once a go-to for institutional investors, is currently dealing with fresh legal hurdles. On June 26, 2025, Judge Analisa Torres rejected a proposed SEC-Ripple settlement and created a fresh legal uncertainty for Ripple. Although Ripple’s leadership has expressed confidence, XRP’s price dropped significantly and it is aiming to retest its weekly support. Despite rising institutional interest and upcoming ETF proposals, the legal cloud hanging over XRP has prompted many investors to rethink their positions. Solana continues to post impressive on-chain activity and DeFi expansion, with TVL exceeding $8.1 billion. Yet, SOL has seen a dip in price recently. However, Sol Strategies launched an ecosystem fund with validator revenue and bought JTO tokens to strengthen Solana’s infrastructure and boost growth. While projects like JitoNetwork and potential Solana ETFs hold promise, price performance remains inconsistent, and many investors are seeking faster, higher-upside plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Analysts’ Attention Amidst this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly capturing the spotlight with a presale that’s already seen over 2,500% gains for early participants. Designed with scarcity, utility, and security in mind, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers everything smart investors look for in a next-generation altcoin. Key features of the project include: Capped token supply (170 billion tokens) to avoid inflation. Smart contract audited by HashEx , ensuring investor safety. Early burn mechanisms to boost long-term token value. Exclusive staking protocol offering high APY for presale buyers. Backed by a strong and growing community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building brand awareness at lightning speed. Its bold, politically inspired branding makes it stand out in the meme coin space, while its structured utility and roadmap give it substance beyond the hype. Final Thought With XRP tied up in court battles and Solana facing price stagnation, many crypto traders and fund managers are reallocating their portfolios. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could follow in the footsteps of early-stage Dogecoin and Shiba Inu—but with far stronger fundamentals and tokenomics. With some experts projecting up to 5000% returns , the presale window is shaping up to be a rare opportunity for early gains.

Recent whispers suggest a significant move that could reshape how we interact with AI: Meta is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Play AI, a pioneering startup specializing in voice cloning technology. This potential AI acquisition signals Meta’s deepening commitment to integrating advanced AI capabilities directly into its consumer platforms, promising a future where digital interactions are more natural and immersive than ever before. What Does This AI Acquisition Mean for Meta? Meta’s reported interest in Play AI is more than just a talent grab; it’s a strategic maneuver to bolster its burgeoning AI ecosystem. While Meta has been actively expanding its AI research talent pool, this move directly targets consumer-facing applications. The goal appears to be to integrate sophisticated audio features into Meta’s existing creative suite and upcoming AI initiatives. Imagine a future where your digital avatars or AI assistants don’t just speak, but speak with a distinct, customizable voice, or even your own cloned voice. This kind of integration could unlock entirely new dimensions for user engagement and content creation. The Power of Voice Cloning : Unlocking New Possibilities Play AI, the startup at the center of these discussions, is known for its ability to clone various types of voices for AI-powered use cases. Their website highlights applications ranging from enhanced customer service to personalized content creation. For Meta, the implications are vast: Enhanced Creator Tools: Creators on Meta’s platforms could use voice cloning to generate voiceovers for videos, podcasts, or even virtual characters without needing to record every line themselves. This could significantly streamline content production. Immersive Metaverse Experiences: As Meta builds out its metaverse, realistic and customizable voices will be crucial for creating believable digital interactions. Voice cloning could allow users to personalize their avatar’s voice or enable AI characters to speak with unique vocal characteristics. Personalized AI Assistants: Imagine a Meta AI chatbot that communicates with a voice you’ve chosen or even one that sounds like a familiar person. This adds a layer of personalization and comfort to digital interactions. Customer Service Innovation: Businesses leveraging Meta’s platforms could deploy AI-powered customer service agents with human-like, natural-sounding voices, improving user experience and efficiency. The potential for voice cloning extends far beyond simple text-to-speech, promising a more dynamic and engaging auditory landscape across Meta’s diverse offerings. Why Play AI is a Strategic Target for Tech Giant Meta ? Play AI has already made significant strides in the voice cloning space, having successfully raised $23.5 million from notable investors including 500 Startups, Kindred Ventures, Race Capital, 500 Global, and Soma Capital. This funding demonstrates investor confidence in their technology and market potential.

On June 5, Circle – the issuer of the USDC stablecoin – raised $1.1 billion in its public debut . This well exceeded expectations, marking a record-setting 167% gain on CRCL’s first day of trading. CRCL stock has since skyrocketed by more than 600%. The NYSE welcomes @circle in celebration of its IPO! For over a decade, Circle has connected traditional finance and digital assets, seeking to create a secure, always-on digital economy. $CRCL @jerallaire pic.twitter.com/YnHL34puz7 — NYSE (@NYSE) June 5, 2025 On June 6, Gemini – the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – also filed confidentially for a US listing . This was followed by a similar IPO filing from digital asset exchange Bullish on June 10. Other crypto exchanges including OKX and Kraken’s parent company, Payward Inc., are also reportedly streamlining operations ahead of potential IPO fillings . Why Crypto IPOs Are Gaining Traction While Circle’s successful IPO is likely influencing the current crypto IPO boom, a number of other factors are driving this trend. Jordan Jefferson, CEO and co-founder of DogeOS, told Cryptonews that the regulatory environment in the US has become significantly more favorable for crypto companies. “We’re finally getting substantial clarity from regulators, rather than just enforcement actions and uncertainty,” Jefferson said. For instance, he pointed out that Circle’s IPO announcement came alongside the Senate passing the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins . Jefferson noted that this is precisely the kind of regulatory clarity companies have been waiting for in the US. “When regulators start giving companies clear rules to follow instead of leaving everyone guessing, that creates the confidence needed to go through the IPO process,” he said. Looking forward to working on market structure as the House moves to send the GENIUS Act to @POTUS 's desk to sign. pic.twitter.com/uWHXebhY7G — Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) June 25, 2025 Jefferson further pointed out that market maturation is equally important, noting that massive institutional interest in digital assets has become apparent. Indeed, traditional financial institutions like Citibank are actively exploring adding crypto custody, while JPMorgan Chase plans to offer crypto investments to its clients through a third-party custodian. “Institutional capital is finally entering crypto, with serious pension funds and asset managers that have been waiting for regulatory clarity to make their move,” Jefferson said. Which Crypto Companies Should Consider an IPO Although notable growth is being seen across the crypto sector, this doesn’t mean that all blockchain-focused companies should consider an IPO. Aaron Jacob, head of accounting solutions at Taxbit, told Cryptonews that the decision for a crypto company to pursue an IPO depends on their stage of growth, business model, and strategic goals. “For well-established firms with predictable revenue streams, a strong compliance posture, and ambitions to scale globally, going public can offer access to capital, enhance reputation, and improve corporate governance,” Jacob remarked. It therefore shouldn’t come as a surprise that Circle’s IPO has been successful. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire recently stated in an interview with Reuters, “We’ve had a deep conviction from the inception of the company that we could build a new infrastructure for money, built on the internet, that could radically reshape the utility of money.” The current stablecoin market cap stands at $252 billion and is expected to grow significantly over time . Circle’s IPO demonstrates the pent up demand from public markets for digital assets. Yet Jacob warned that early-stage or highly experimental companies may find the regulatory burdens, disclosure requirements, and quarterly earnings pressure of public markets to be misaligned with their innovation-driven cultures. “Each company must weigh the long-term benefits of public listing against the operational and compliance commitments it entails,” he said. According to Jefferson, the compliance requirements of an IPO are substantial. For instance, he explained that a company going public requires a whole compliance team, internal audit functions, and significant ongoing operational costs that scale with a businesses size and complexity. To put this into perspective, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reported $58.2 million in professional services expenses in Q1 of 2025 alone, a category that includes legal and compliance advisory. This demonstrates a 35% increase year-over-year, driven in part by expanding regulatory obligations across the US and EU. “Coinbase’s total general and administrative expenses for the quarter reached $394.3 million, highlighting how compliance operations scale with regulatory scrutiny and global licensing,” Jefferson said. He added that another major factor to consider is that traditional public markets value crypto businesses differently than crypto markets tend to. “They’re using different metrics and risk frameworks than what the crypto world is used to.” IPO Versus ICO Given this, crypto companies thinking about going public may want to consider if an initial coin offering (ICO) is better suited for their business. While ICOs were widely popular in 2017, a number of crypto companies are still implementing these models. Yet Jefferson pointed out that token sales and equity sales serve entirely different purposes and shouldn’t be considered alternatives to each other. “An IPO means selling actual equity in your company through regulated public markets with full SEC oversight, giving you access to serious institutional capital – pension funds, asset managers, sophisticated investors who understand traditional business models,” he said. Although the costs associated with an IPO are substantial, Jefferson remarked that companies are tapping into institutional money that can fund significant growth. On the other hand, an ICO token sale focuses more on building a community. A crypto company pursuing an ICO also provides utility tokens to their users. “Both raise capital, but tokens need to have real utility and purpose beyond just fundraising,” Jefferson said. IPO Boom and Bust on the Horizon? ICOs aside, it’s become apparent that the US is undergoing a crypto IPO boom. While major exchanges are considering going public, smaller players have also announced plans for an IPO. For example, Bitcoin advocate and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s firm, ProCap BTC, announced Tuesday that it had acquired 3,724 BTC for $386 million. This came just days after revealing plans for the company to go public later this year . While notable, the possibility of a crypto IPO boom and bust may be looming. Petr Kozyakov, CEO and co-founder of Mercuryo, told Cryptonews that the history of finance has witnessed bubbles, both in traditional markets and in the digital asset space. “This is often fuelled by highly speculative trading,” Kozyakov said. “Some might say it is possible that we could see something similar unfold with crypto IPOs, especially if the excitement outpaces the fundamentals.” Echoing this, Jacob believes that while the IPO landscape is more regulated and selective than the prior ICO boom, the crypto sector – along with any other sector – is not immune to a boom or bust cycle in public markets. “As valuations surge and investor enthusiasm builds, some companies may rush to go public before they are operationally or financially ready, which can lead to underperformance, reputational damage, or post-IPO stock price declines,” he said. However, Jacob pointed out that unlike ICOs – which often lacked investor protections and clear oversight – the IPO process requires extensive disclosures, audited financials, and regulatory scrutiny, which helps filter out weaker companies. “That said, if a wave of crypto IPOs leads to speculative hype and overvalued listings, a correction could follow,” he remarked. “The key difference this time is the presence of institutional investors, stricter compliance standards, and more mature businesses, all of which may mitigate – but not eliminate – the risks of a boom-bust cycle.” The post Will The United States Witness A Crypto IPO Boom and Bust Soon? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|News|Circle USDC|IPO|United States,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-27 17:51:39

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.5411, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.681. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.4167, beginning a bearish trend to $0.3662. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bullish as buyers gained confidence in pushing the price above Fib levels. As a result, buyers are now approaching the $0.5 level to initiate a stronger recovery rally. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.5 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX The dYdX platform revealed that over 64.4 million ethDYDX tokens remain unmigrated to its native chain, prompting urgent calls for users to act. Backed by 91% community support, an on-chain vote is set for June 9, 2025, to potentially end support for the Ethereum-dYdX bridge. dYdX price prediction June 2025 May was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.75 but failed to maintain its buying momentum.

Amid growing pressure from political figures and segments of the financial community, the Fed remains hesitant to shift policy. Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders broke down this development in a recent video on X, emphasizing that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is holding firm, even as internal divisions within the Fed become more visible. Rietveld pointed out that Powell made it clear the Fed is “well positioned to wait and see” when it comes to rate cuts. This is despite rising pressure from other Fed members and external forces, including Donald Trump. The Fed’s refusal to cut rates is particularly relevant for XRP, whose value proposition is increasingly tied to real-world utility rather than speculation. Powell FREEZES Rates. XRP Just Got a MAJOR Boost! pic.twitter.com/BpcKzqJDJc — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 25, 2025 Tariffs, Inflation, and the Policy Dilemma A major point from Powell’s testimony was the impact of tariffs on inflation and economic growth. According to Powell, tariffs are “likely to push up inflation and weigh on the economy.” While inflation has eased, he stressed that it “remains somewhat elevated.” This directly supports the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady for now. Rietveld explained that Powell’s stance means monetary policy will remain tight until clearer signals emerge. This has significant implications not just for traditional markets but also for digital assets, and many in the crypto space anticipated rate cuts and made bullish predictions for June. Tighter U.S. monetary policy historically creates volatility for speculative assets, but for utility-driven assets like XRP, the long-term outlook becomes more favorable as the focus shifts to real-world use cases rather than speculative trading cycles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Divided Federal Reserve While Powell stays cautious, Rietveld noted that several Fed members are beginning to lean toward cutting rates sooner rather than later. The labor market remains strong, but inflation has not fallen to the Fed’s target. The persistence of high rates tends to pressure risky assets broadly, but it also accelerates the institutional search for efficient payment solutions outside of traditional banking systems. This dynamic favors networks like the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and makes XRP an attractive investment , as it doesn’t depend on interest-rate-sensitive intermediaries. Political Pressure Builds Powell’s position comes despite growing pressure from Trump and others who have criticized the Fed’s unwillingness to lower rates. Still, Powell did not suggest that politics would influence the Fed’s decisions. Regardless of political pressure, the Fed’s stance keeps institutional focus on lower-risk assets like XRP that solve real financial problems. Speaking on the potential outcome, Rietveld stated, “We’re going to be seeing incredibly soon,” capturing the tension that now surrounds the central bank’s next steps.

Here are the words popular in the cryptocurrency community according to Santiment analysts: The word 'BTC' came to the fore in light of Bitcoin's central role in cryptocurrency investment, its impact on market behavior, and its comparison to other tokens. Discussions about Bitcoin's use as a store of value and alternative currency are back on the agenda. In addition, large institutional purchases and bull market signals for Bitcoin are among the factors that triggered this rise. The word ‘July’ has become a trending topic in the crypto and financial world due to the many major events expected to take place during July. In particular, Bitcoin price predictions focusing on the end of July 2025, Coinbase launching perpetual futures on July 21, various token launches, legislative hearings being postponed until July, and regulatory initiatives such as the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act being considered in the US Senate make this month a critical juncture for the markets. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump Comments on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies The word ‘Yapyo’ came to the fore thanks to the pre-sale preparations and community interactions of YAPYO, a project connected to the on-chain ecosystem on the Arbitrum blockchain. US-based digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings is in the news with its $1 billion shelf offering application. This application to the SEC has led to speculation that the company may purchase Bitcoin and expand its digital asset strategy. The policy updates that allow the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)-backed company to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet have also attracted attention. The word ‘Bhutan’ has been trending since the Asian country of Bhutan was found to have secretly mined 12,000 Bitcoins since 2020. This reserve is reportedly worth around $1.3 billion, equivalent to 40% of Bhutan’s GDP, making it the third-largest state-backed Bitcoin holder after the US and China. Bhutan’s mining operations are also supported by renewable hydroelectric power, making the country a standout in the field of sustainable mining. The word XRP is on the agenda again due to Ripple's securities lawsuit. In the ongoing litigation process with the SEC, the court rejected requests for early closure of the case. This creates uncertainty over XRP's price, institutional sales and regulatory status. On the other hand, hopeful expectations for XRP have also begun to increase with cross-chain solutions and partnerships for use in payment infrastructures. *This is not investment advice.

The listing follows the successful capital raise and shows the firm’s renewed efforts in Bitcoin-backed services. BTCT’s shares will be traded under the ticker “BTCT” with over 10 million common shares already issued and sold. $92 Million Raise Precedes BTC Accumulation Ahead of resuming trading, BTCT finished a 125 million Canadian dollar ($92 million) raise through brokered offering. It issued 426,650 shares at CA$10 (US$7.32) per share with a standard four-month and one-day hold period pursuant to Canadian securities legislation. The raise positions BTCT to execute on its updated Bitcoin accumulation and institutional lending strategy. Company Buys 292.8 BTC for $31.5 Million With some of the funds raised, BTCT purchased 292.8 BTC at a cost of approximately $31.5 million. The purchase is the company’s first large crypto acquisition since shifting its focus to a Bitcoin-backed reserve and lending business model. BTCT will introduce a Bitcoin-per-share metric to give investors more insight into the underlying asset value of its shares. Strategic Pivot Reflects Industry-Wide Trend BTCT is following a broader industry pattern of cryptocurrency companies leveraging Bitcoin for institutional liquidity and capital efficiency solutions. Long-Term Holders Push BTC Accumulation to New Heights BTCT’s move is within the context of a broader market trend. According to CryptoQuant, long-term Bitcoin holders—addresses that have been inactive for six months or more—have accumulated 800,000 BTC in total holdings over 30 days, a record pace.

Meanwhile, ONDO is generating buzz with a potential breakout towards $1.20, driven by renewed interest in real-world assets. Discover which cryptocurrencies are poised for impressive growth in the current market landscape. Hyperliquid HYPE: Steady Gains and Crucial Support/Resistance Levels The HYPE coin recorded a modest gain of 3.09% over the last month and a significant rise of 25.78% over the past six months. Price action moved within a range from $21.20 to $42.08, showing periods of both calm and bursts in activity. The historical performance reflects a steady upward progression punctuated by moments of volatility. Market participants witnessed gradual build-up in buying interest, leading to observed growth while still grappling with fluctuations. This price progression indicates a market that has grown resilient over time, with gains accumulating slowly and reliably as investor sentiment improved. Current levels show the asset trading within a range that is closely monitored by buyers and sellers alike. The nearest resistance is at $51.47, while a clear support is at $9.73, providing a cushion against deeper declines. The overall price range extends between $21.20 and $42.08, emphasizing critical levels where buying or selling pressure could shift the balance. Indicator readings, including an RSI of 51.30 and momentum near -3.091, suggest neither bulls nor bears have full command, leading to a sideways market with no clear trend. This environment offers trading opportunities, such as accumulating positions near support, with plans to take profits at resistance. Traders may wait for a breakout above $51.47 or further dips toward support before committing to larger positions. Ondo Market Analysis: Key Levels in a Bearish Environment Ondo experienced a significant decline in price over the last month and six months, with a drop of approximately 21.93% in the past month and about 50.60% over the half-year. This downward trend illustrates mounting selling pressure and diminishing buyer interest, highlighting a consistent pattern of falling value. Technical indicators reflect a bearish sentiment, suggesting weakened momentum and a cautious atmosphere for traders. The overall market scenario indicates an environment where prices have steadily eroded. Currently, Ondo trades between $0.70 and $1.05, with key support at $0.57 and $0.21, while resistance levels are at $1.27 and $1.62. Bears appear to dominate, as reflected by negative indicators and low moving average scores, although oscillators indicate slight negativity. A clear trend is absent, confining price action within these levels. Traders may consider the lower support for potential short-term rebounds, but any drop below $0.57 warrants caution. Conversely, breaking above $1.27 could trigger a brief rally, though bearish pressure remains prevalent in the market. Conclusion HYPE has experienced a substantial rise, reaching towards $52 due to a significant 300% rally and increased DEX volume. ONDO is also showing strong potential, with market activity suggesting a possible breakout to $1.20. Both coins demonstrate promising growth fueled by their respective market dynamics. These optimistic trends highlight their strong performance and potential future gains. Investors may find these assets appealing as they continue to gain momentum.

Today, the spotlight falls on Vinanz Ltd., a UK-listed mining firm that has just made another significant move, signaling a robust commitment to its Bitcoin strategy. This latest acquisition isn’t just a headline; it’s a powerful statement about the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, even for companies deeply entrenched in the crypto mining sector. For those keenly following the cryptocurrency market, this development from Vinanz offers compelling insights into the strategic foresight driving some of the industry’s key players. Why Vinanz is Doubling Down on Bitcoin ? Vinanz Ltd. recently announced the purchase of an additional 5.85 BTC, valued at approximately $631,000. This brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 65.03 BTC. But why would a company primarily focused on crypto mining operations choose to accumulate Bitcoin rather than immediately liquidating its mined assets? The answer lies in a multi-faceted strategy aimed at long-term value creation and financial resilience. Strategic Treasury Management: By holding Bitcoin, Vinanz is essentially treating BTC as a primary treasury asset, akin to how traditional companies might hold gold or other stable assets. This strategy aims to hedge against inflation and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation over time. Synergy with Mining Operations: For a crypto mining firm, accumulating Bitcoin is a natural extension of its core business. They are already generating BTC through their operations; holding a portion of it aligns their balance sheet directly with the asset they produce, creating a direct upside from Bitcoin’s price movements. Market Confidence: Vinanz’s continued BTC acquisition signals strong internal confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. This can inspire investor confidence, suggesting that the company believes in the long-term viability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This approach isn’t unique to Vinanz, but their consistent accumulation highlights a growing trend among savvy companies looking to diversify and strengthen their financial foundations in the digital age. The Growing Trend of Crypto Mining Firms Building Digital Assets Treasuries Vinanz’s strategy is part of a broader movement where companies, particularly those involved in crypto mining , are increasingly opting to build substantial digital asset treasuries. This paradigm shift challenges the traditional view of corporate finance and embraces the potential of cryptocurrencies as legitimate, long-term investments. Here’s a look at why this trend is gaining momentum: Benefits of a Corporate Digital Asset Treasury: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing monetary expansion and inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often viewed as a scarce asset with a fixed supply, making it an attractive hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth potential. Holding BTC allows companies to participate directly in this growth. Balance Sheet Strength: A substantial holding of a high-value digital asset can enhance a company’s balance sheet, potentially improving its creditworthiness and attractiveness to investors. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing digital assets positions a company as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to a new generation of investors and talent. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously pioneered this corporate Bitcoin treasury model, inspiring others to follow suit. While Vinanz ‘s holdings are currently smaller, their consistent additions demonstrate a clear strategic direction that aligns with this burgeoning trend. Understanding Vinanz ‘s Strategic BTC Acquisition Vinanz Ltd.’s latest BTC acquisition , bringing their total to 65.03 BTC, underscores a deliberate and sustained effort to build a robust Bitcoin treasury. Operating mining facilities across the U.S. and Canada, Vinanz is strategically positioned in regions known for their stable energy grids and favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrency operations. This geographic diversification not only optimizes their mining efficiency but also provides a stable base from which to execute their treasury strategy. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin rather than selling it immediately to cover operational costs or generate fiat revenue speaks volumes. It suggests that Vinanz’s leadership team believes the intrinsic value and future appreciation of Bitcoin outweigh the immediate benefits of liquidation. This long-term vision is critical in the volatile crypto market, where short-term fluctuations can often obscure the broader trajectory. Consider the potential impact of such a strategy: Strategy Type Description Potential Benefits Potential Risks Bitcoin Treasury (Vinanz Model) Holding mined BTC on the balance sheet for long-term appreciation and inflation hedge. Significant upside potential from BTC price increases; strong signal of confidence in crypto. Exposure to BTC price volatility; potential liquidity challenges if immediate fiat is needed. Immediate Liquidation Selling mined BTC immediately to convert to fiat currency for operational expenses or profit. Predictable fiat revenue; reduces exposure to crypto market volatility. Missed opportunities for BTC appreciation; constant pressure to optimize fiat conversion rates. Vinanz’s choice to lean heavily into the Bitcoin Treasury model highlights a sophisticated understanding of both their operational capabilities and the macroeconomic landscape, positioning them for potential significant gains should Bitcoin continue its upward trajectory. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? While the allure of holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset is strong, it’s crucial to acknowledge both the significant benefits and the inherent challenges. For companies like Vinanz, navigating this landscape requires careful consideration and robust risk management. Key Benefits: Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional asset portfolio can provide diversification, as its price movements often correlate differently with traditional financial markets. Attracting New Investors: A forward-thinking stance on digital assets can attract a new segment of investors who are enthusiastic about the crypto space. Cost-Efficiency (Long-term): If Bitcoin appreciates significantly, the value of the treasury could far exceed the cost of acquisition, creating substantial shareholder value. Key Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. Significant price swings can impact a company’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be complex and varies by jurisdiction, often requiring specialized expertise. Vinanz, by choosing this path, is clearly demonstrating a belief that the potential rewards outweigh these challenges, and they likely have robust strategies in place to mitigate these risks. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Digital Assets Landscape For investors looking at companies like Vinanz, understanding their digital assets strategy is paramount. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin is not just about a single purchase; it’s indicative of a broader corporate philosophy. Here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Management’s Vision: Does the company’s leadership clearly articulate its rationale for holding crypto? Is it a speculative bet or a well-thought-out treasury strategy? Vinanz’s consistent purchases suggest the latter. Assess Risk Management: How does the company mitigate the risks associated with crypto volatility and security? Look for evidence of robust security protocols and clear risk assessment frameworks. Consider Operational Synergy: For mining companies, how well does their crypto treasury strategy integrate with their core mining operations? A strong synergy, like that seen with Vinanz, can create a powerful compounding effect. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Understand if the company is building a long-term position or making short-term trades. Companies with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin, like Vinanz, often present a more stable investment thesis in the crypto space. The move by Vinanz is a microcosm of the larger trend of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency space. As more companies explore and implement strategies involving digital assets, the market matures, and new investment opportunities emerge. Keeping an eye on these pioneering firms provides valuable indicators for the broader market trajectory. In conclusion, Vinanz Ltd.’s continued strategic accumulation of Bitcoin is a significant development, underscoring a strong belief in the long-term value of digital assets. By building a substantial Bitcoin treasury alongside its robust crypto mining operations in the U.S. and Canada, Vinanz is positioning itself not just as a miner, but as a sophisticated player in the broader digital economy. This proactive approach highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, aiming for financial resilience and growth in an increasingly digital world. For investors, it serves as a compelling example of how traditional business models are adapting and thriving within the innovative landscape of cryptocurrency.

While XRP sees mounting momentum with futures ETFs and a likely spot ETF on the horizon, analysts are now pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a lesser-known altcoin with breakout potential in the current cycle. XRP’s Institutional Surge Continues The latest chapter in XRP’s resurgence began with the SEC’s greenlighting of three XRP futures ETFs under ProShares Trust. Slated to launch April 30, these products offer investors expanded access to XRP’s price movements. More significantly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is preparing to list XRP futures alongside only Bitcoin and Ethereum—a move that cements XRP’s place among the few digital assets with high-level institutional access. Regulatory clarity continues to boost confidence. The SEC’s ongoing case now focuses solely on Ripple Labs, with XRP itself officially recognized as a non-security since Judge Torres’s ruling in 2023. Whale accumulation has increased, with large holders growing steadily since April—a bullish signal that investors are preparing for potential new highs. Analysts Turn Toward MAGACOIN FINANCE But while XRP is grabbing headlines, a growing number of crypto insiders are quietly making their move on MAGACOIN FINANCE—a rising altcoin that analysts believe could deliver up to 100x returns. “Every chart I’m looking at is flashing green,” said one analyst who specializes in early-stage crypto plays. “The momentum is real, and the smart money isn’t waiting around—they’re getting in now.” Analysts are spotting all the telltale signs: strategic buying activity, steady organic interest, and that early traction that usually comes before the big breakout. While the mainstream is still focused on XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to turn heads in the places that matter—among seasoned traders and sharp investors who know what a breakout looks like before it happens. Final Thoughts This wouldn’t be the first time a low-profile crypto stormed the charts seemingly overnight. “If you missed out on the early runs of XRP or Dogecoin, this might be your second shot,” one market analyst shared. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just catching the momentum—it’s generating it.

46902362,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72754,1751047247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Software Engineer: They Will Likely Dismiss Ripple vs SEC Appeal Now. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/software-engineer-they-will-likely-dismiss-ripple-vs-sec-appeal-now-heres-why/,"A widely followed software engineer, Vincent Van Code, has offered a compelling take on what could be the closing chapter of the Ripple vs. SEC legal saga. According to Van Code, Ripple is now likely to dismiss its appeal following two failed attempts to dissolve a court-imposed injunction, signaling the potential end of one of crypto’s longest-running regulatory battles. Judge Torres Denies Motion to Dissolve Injunction U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, in May, rejected a joint request by Ripple and the SEC to revise the remedies portion of the case. The parties had proposed reducing Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million and lifting the permanent injunction on future institutional XRP sales. Both parties filed a revised version of the motion on June 12, two weeks later, Judge Torres denied the refiled motion, reinforcing that her prior ruling, which found Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP to be unregistered securities offerings, remains fully intact. This denial was a pivotal moment. It marked Ripple’s second failed attempt to dissolve the injunction, underscoring the court’s reluctance to modify its original decision without a formal legal basis. With limited options left, many, including Van Code, believe Ripple will now abandon the appeal altogether. Chief Legal Officer of Ripple just told us that the court case doesn't change anything. But they will likely dismiss the appeal now that they tried twice to dissolve injunction. Just pay it, get SEC to sign a bunch of XRP sale exemptions and move on. It's time. Leaving it… https://t.co/MHTK80gVag — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) June 27, 2025 Van Code: “Just Pay It and Move On” In his commentary shared on X, Vincent Van Code urged Ripple to stop prolonging the battle. “Just pay it, get SEC to sign a bunch of XRP sale exemptions and move on,” he wrote. He added that lingering too long could allow competitors to catch Ripple off guard. Van Code’s message was as much a legal analysis as it was a business warning: the time for resolution is now. The idea is not to concede defeat but to strategically secure regulatory clarity. A swift conclusion, accompanied by formal exemptions from the SEC for future XRP sales, would allow Ripple to operate without fear of regulatory reversals. It would also send a strong signal to investors, partners, and developers that Ripple is fully back in business. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Legal Position and Future Strategy Despite the setbacks, Ripple’s legal team remains publicly optimistic. Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty reportedly assured the community that the case “doesn’t change anything” in terms of the company’s business operations. This confidence likely stems from the 2023 Torres ruling, which clearly stated that XRP is not a security when sold on exchanges or in retail transactions, an outcome that still stands. What remains is a narrowed battle over past institutional sales. With much of the legal uncertainty behind it, Ripple appears increasingly focused on expansion. The company has launched its RLUSD stablecoin, integrated with Wormhole for cross-chain functionality, and is preparing to roll out the XRPL EVM sidechain, moves that signal a clear pivot toward building. The Endgame Is Near As Vincent Van Code rightly points out, Ripple is at a turning point. Dismissing the appeal and finalizing a penalty may seem like a tactical retreat, but in reality, it could be the final step toward full regulatory certainty. The broader crypto landscape is rapidly evolving, and Ripple can’t afford to be stuck in litigation limbo. What comes next could be Ripple’s most powerful move yet—not in the courtroom, but in the market. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Altcoins, meanwhile, struggled to catch a bid. According to a Binance Research report on June 27, Bitcoin ( BTC ) weathered a volatile weekend spurred by Middle East tensions, briefly dipping below $98,000 before surging past $107,000 and outperforming traditional markets. While the S&P 500 and gold saw muted reactions, BTC’s swift recovery reinforced its status as the go-to asset during uncertainty. Ethereum ( ETH ), meanwhile, lagged with a steeper 17% drop and weaker rebound, underscoring its relative fragility in crisis moments. You might also like: Aptos hits milestone as RWA on-chain breaks $540m Bitcoin’s resilience meets altcoin indifference While Bitcoin’s rebound past $107,000 showcased its strength, the numbers reveal a stark contrast with traditional assets. Per the report, the S&P 500 gained 2.56%, a solid performance, but one that paled next to BTC’s 5% weekly surge after its weekend dip. Gold, typically a safe haven, barely moved, while oil gave up early-week gains as supply fears eased. Notably, the U.S. dollar slumped to a three-year low after President Trump’s renewed attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, reigniting concerns over central bank independence. Bitcoin’s ability to outpace other assets reinforces its dual role as both a risk asset and a hedge against political chaos. BTC once again behaved more like a strategic asset than a speculative bet. Altcoins, however, missed the memo. The divergence suggests a market that still plays by Bitcoin’s rules. Historically, BTC rallies eventually spill over into altcoins—but the 2025 cycle has defied expectations. Ethereum’s 17% weekend plunge and tepid recovery to $2,480, still below its opening price, highlighted its lagging resilience. Solana ( SOL ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) barely budged, mirroring ETH struggles, while speculative favorites in the AI and meme coin categories lacked momentum. The indifference reveals a deeper structural shift: altcoin cycles no longer operate on autopilot. Without a unifying catalyst or narrative, the market has become fragmented, its attention diluted across thousands of competing tokens. The hidden drag on Bitcoin’s momentum Despite reclaiming $107,000, BTC is on track for its weakest monthly gain (just 2%) since July 2025, per crypto.news data. Beneath the surface, Bitcoin faces its own headwinds—a tug-of-war between institutional inflows and whale selling. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed $3.9 billion in fresh capital this month, yet on-chain metrics show large holders (10,000+ BTC) are net sellers, according to Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score. Mid-sized wallets (10–10,000 BTC) are accumulating, but opportunistically, suggesting traders are playing ranges rather than betting on a breakout. Bitcoin’s dominance is undeniable, but its solo act raises questions. For altcoins to awaken, the original cryptocurrency may need more than just stability, it might need a true catalyst that reignites risk appetite across crypto’s saturated landscape.

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will likely trade sideways a little longer before reclaiming $108,500 as support and then have a massive breakout to a new ATH. “Slight consolidation before the next breakout, that’s what Bitcoin is telling us. It couldn’t break through this resistance in one-go and is therefore consolidating.

Table of Contents XYZVerse is breaking the memecoin mold: Will this be the next 50x breakout? Avalanche Chainlink and LINK Conclusion According to a prominent market insider, a little-known cryptocurrency is predicted to soar by an astonishing 5000%. This potential breakout could leave established tokens like AVAX and Chainlink trailing behind. The article delves into which coin is poised for this massive surge and explores the factors that could drive such remarkable growth. XYZVerse is breaking the memecoin mold: Will this be the next 50x breakout? The hype around XYZVerse is turning into something much bigger. With ambitions to deliver 50x returns, this project isn’t just following the memecoin playbook, it’s rewriting it. Presale frenzy: Early birds lock in massive gains XYZVerse’s presale is catching serious traction, offering early investors access to XYZ at deep discounts well below the anticipated listing price. Starting at just $0.0001, the token has now surged to $0.003333 by Stage 12— an eye-watering climb with more to come. With over 70% of the $15 million goal already raised, the momentum is undeniable. XYZ bulls take over CoinMarketCap On CoinMarketCap, the sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish; 95% of community voters expect XYZVerse to pump hard. The coin is being tracked by thousands, and buzz is accelerating as new investors look for the next big thing. Backed by big voices in crypto Top crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster (with nearly 800k followers) recently labeled XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” That kind of endorsement adds serious weight, especially in a market hungry for the next breakout. Not an average memecoin: Real use meets real hype Unlike many memecoins that rely purely on virality, XYZVerse is mixing meme culture with real-world engagement. It taps into the excitement of sports fandom, creating a hybrid that merges entertainment, betting, and crypto utility. The presale isn’t just moving, it’s flying. There’s still time to get in before the presale ends. Smart tokenomics for long-term sustainability XYZVerse has carefully structured its token distribution to fuel lasting growth: 15% for liquidity ensures healthy market depth post-launch. 10% goes to community rewards like airdrops and bonuses. 17.13% is set aside for deflationary burns, helping drive scarcity and long-term value. This isn’t a pump-and-dump — there’s real planning behind the numbers. Built for the community, backed by partnerships The team isn’t just promising utility, they’re delivering. A new partnership with bookmaker.XYZ, a decentralized sportsbook, gives XYZ holders real-world functionality. Token holders even get a bonus on their first bet, adding tangible value from day one. Plus, with the Ambassador Program, community members can earn tokens by promoting the project, turning fans into stakeholders. Talks with sports celebrities are also underway, giving XYZVerse even more firepower for mainstream appeal. Final stages approaching: Still time to jump in With the final presale target at $0.1, those buying in now are still getting in early. As the cap fills up and the price continues to rise, this could be one of the last chances to join before XYZVerse hits major exchanges. Is XYZVerse the next memecoin titan? With explosive presale momentum, top-tier influencer backing, strong tokenomics, and real utility in motion, XYZVerse is shaping up to be more than just hype. It could be the memecoin that actually delivers. The window is closing. Avalanche Source: TradingView Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a notable decline over the past six months. The price has dropped by 51.91% during this period. In the last month, it decreased by 23.81%, and over the past week, it fell by 3.43%. Currently, the price ranges between $14.78 and $19.13. This downward trend reflects the challenges the coin is facing in the market. Technical indicators provide mixed signals for AVAX. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.93, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.30, which also indicates a neutral stance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.0663, pointing to a slight bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are $17.67 and $17.46 respectively, showing that the price is hovering around these levels. The nearest resistance level is at $21.73. Breaking this level could see AVAX rise by about 23% from the current average price of $17.67. The next resistance is at $26.08, implying a potential increase of nearly 48%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $13.04. Dropping to this level would mean a decrease of around 26%. Further decline to the second support at $8.691 would result in a decrease of approximately 51%. These levels are important for traders to watch. Chainlink and LINK Source: TradingView Chainlink (LINK) has experienced notable price movements recently. In the past week, its price changed by 1.52%, showing slight fluctuation. Over the last month, however, LINK’s price decreased by 14.21%, and looking at the six-month span, it dropped by 38.18%. This downward trend over the longer term indicates that the token has faced selling pressure. Currently, LINK is trading between $10.36 and $13.57. The nearest resistance level is at $15, and surpassing this could lead to a move toward the second resistance at $19, representing a significant potential increase. On the downside, the nearest support level is $9.05. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $5.84, which could signal further decline. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53.61, suggesting the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 60.62, indicating mild bullish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $13.32, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $12.65, hinting at short-term strength. The MACD level of 0.0385 shows minimal momentum. Based on these factors, LINK’s price may consolidate before making a significant move. Conclusion Though AVAX and Chainlink are notable, XYZVerse stands out as a community-driven memecoin combining sports and meme culture, targeting 20,000% growth and early adopter benefits.

The powerhouse behind ChatGPT is bringing in the brilliant minds behind Crossing Minds, a startup celebrated for its advanced AI recommendations in the e-commerce sector. This move underscores a growing trend where leading AI entities are strategically integrating specialized expertise to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve, directly impacting how businesses interact with customers and how users experience online shopping. For anyone interested in the future of digital innovation and the practical applications of AI, this acquisition signals a fascinating evolution. The Core Announcement: OpenAI and Crossing Minds Unite On Thursday, Crossing Minds, a company renowned for providing sophisticated AI-driven recommendation systems to e-commerce businesses, confirmed that its entire team is joining OpenAI . This isn’t merely a talent acquisition; it’s a strategic absorption of a team with deep expertise in a critical area of applied AI. Crossing Minds had previously garnered substantial backing, raising over $13.5 million from notable investors including Index Ventures, Shopify, Plug and Play, and Radical Ventures, as reported by Crunchbase. Their work primarily focused on enhancing personalization and recommendation systems for online retailers, making the shopping experience more intuitive and tailored for consumers. The motivation behind this integration, as articulated by Crossing Minds’ co-founders in a post on their website, aligns perfectly with OpenAI ‘s overarching mission: “Joining OpenAI allows us to bring our work — and our values — into a mission we deeply respect: to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. We’re thrilled to bring our experience and energy to a team that’s setting the direction for the future of AI. We’re excited to learn, to contribute, and to help shape what’s next.” This statement highlights a shared vision for AI’s potential to serve humanity on a grand scale. Further confirming the transition, Alexandre Robicquet, one of Crossing Minds’ co-founders, has already updated his LinkedIn profile to reflect his new role: “Research, Post-training and Agents at OpenAI.” While it’s not explicitly stated if every single member of the Crossing Minds team is making the move, the company’s website now clearly indicates that they will no longer be accepting new clients, signaling a definitive shift in their operational focus. This type of ‘acqui-hire,’ where a company acquires another primarily for its talent and intellectual property rather than its ongoing business operations, is becoming increasingly common in the competitive AI landscape. Crossing Minds’ Innovative AI Recommendations : A Deep Dive into Their Approach What made Crossing Minds a valuable asset for OpenAI ? Their core strength lay in their unique approach to AI recommendations . The company prided itself on studying customers’ on-site behavior data to glean insights into their shopping preferences without compromising user privacy. This privacy-preserving methodology is a significant differentiator in an era where data security and ethical AI practices are paramount concerns for both consumers and regulators. Crossing Minds’ previous client roster speaks volumes about their credibility and effectiveness. Their archived ‘About’ page proudly listed prominent names such as Intuit, Anthropic, Udacity, and even luxury brand Chanel as trusted partners. This diverse portfolio demonstrates their ability to adapt their AI recommendation systems across various industries, from financial services to education and high fashion. Their technology helped businesses: Understand User Intent: By analyzing real-time on-site behavior rather than just historical purchases. Enhance Personalization: Delivering highly relevant product and content suggestions. Improve Conversion Rates: Guiding users to items they are more likely to purchase. Ensure Data Privacy: A key selling point, especially in today’s privacy-conscious market. This expertise in building sophisticated, privacy-aware recommendation engines is a direct complement to OpenAI ‘s ambitions, particularly as its models become more integrated into real-world applications and user-facing products like ChatGPT. OpenAI’s Strategic Vision and AI Acquisition : Beyond Just Recommendations The integration of the Crossing Minds team into OpenAI is more than just about improving shopping suggestions; it’s a strategic alignment with OpenAI ‘s broader goals in artificial general intelligence (AGI) development. The mention of Alexandre Robicquet’s new role in “Research, Post-training and Agents” at OpenAI provides crucial insight into where this expertise will be applied. OpenAI is actively developing advanced AI agents that can perform complex tasks, interact with various systems, and understand nuanced user intentions. The ability to create highly effective, privacy-respecting recommendation systems is a direct application of agentic behavior. Imagine an AI agent that not only answers your questions but also intuitively understands your preferences and proactively suggests relevant information, products, or services based on your past interactions and stated interests, all while maintaining strict privacy protocols. Earlier this year, OpenAI had already updated ChatGPT to offer recommendations, images, and reviews for items users inquired about. The addition of the Crossing Minds team will undoubtedly supercharge these capabilities, allowing OpenAI to build more sophisticated, context-aware, and ethically designed recommendation features directly into its foundational models and future AI products. This AI acquisition strengthens OpenAI ‘s position in the competitive AI landscape, enabling it to offer more nuanced and powerful applications. The Broader Landscape: E-commerce AI and Personalization The move by OpenAI also highlights a broader, undeniable trend: the increasing reliance on e-commerce AI to transform the retail experience. The digital shopping landscape is more competitive than ever, and personalization has emerged as a key differentiator. Companies are leveraging AI to move beyond basic recommendation algorithms to truly intelligent shopping assistants. Several major players and innovative startups are already making significant strides in this domain: Google: Has integrated AI features into its shopping platforms, enhancing product discovery and personalized search results. Perplexity: A rising star in AI search, also leverages AI to improve recommendations and provide more comprehensive shopping insights. Startups like Daydream: Have secured substantial investments to develop advanced AI shopping assistants, aiming to replicate the personalized guidance of a human sales associate. The market is rapidly evolving, moving towards a future where AI not only suggests products but also understands individual consumer psychology, anticipates needs, and offers tailored shopping journeys. Crossing Minds’ expertise in privacy-preserving data analysis positions OpenAI to lead in this ethical frontier of e-commerce AI , setting a new standard for responsible personalization. Implications for the Future of AI Recommendations This strategic integration holds profound implications for the future of AI recommendations . It signifies a shift from siloed recommendation engines to more deeply integrated, intelligent systems that can learn and adapt across a wider range of contexts. For businesses, this means the potential for even more accurate and effective personalization, leading to higher customer satisfaction and increased sales. For consumers, it promises a more seamless and intuitive online experience. Imagine an AI that truly understands your style, preferences, and even your mood, offering suggestions that feel less like algorithms and more like genuinely helpful advice. The focus on privacy from Crossing Minds’ methodology suggests that OpenAI intends to pursue this future responsibly, building trust with users by demonstrating a commitment to data security. Furthermore, the expertise in ‘post-training’ that Robicquet brings to OpenAI is critical. Post-training involves fine-tuning and adapting large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks and domains, ensuring they perform optimally and safely. Applying this to recommendation systems means creating highly specialized AI models that can deliver superior results in commerce, content, and beyond. Challenges and Opportunities in AI Integration While the benefits are clear, integrating a specialized team like Crossing Minds into a massive organization like OpenAI also presents challenges. These include: Cultural Integration: Merging different company cultures and workflows. Technological Synergy: Ensuring Crossing Minds’ technology seamlessly integrates with OpenAI ‘s existing models and infrastructure. Scaling Expertise: Adapting specialized recommendation systems to the vast and diverse applications OpenAI is exploring, from general AI agents to industry-specific solutions. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges. This acquisition positions OpenAI to: Accelerate AGI Development: By incorporating real-world behavioral understanding into its foundational models.

This information comes from blockchain analyst Xaif, who shared a leaked stakeholder flowchart on X, revealing XRP’s deep integration into the ECB’s test architecture using the Axiology Distributed Ledger Technology Target Services System (DLT TSS). The diagram outlines two detailed scenarios: the primary issuance of debt securities and the subsequent coupon payments to investors. In both cases, XRP is identified as the core payment rail, facilitating seamless value transfers within a digital ecosystem powered by wCBDCs and Axiology’s blockchain infrastructure.

An escrow wallet is created for each distribution entry, and XRP is used to transfer funds from the issuer’s operational wallet to this escrow account. Once the payment is confirmed, the operator then transfers the assets to final investor wallets, again using XRP, thereby completing the delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement. This workflow illustrates XRP’s utility in enabling real-time, cross-border settlement, with speed, transparency, and finality. It also demonstrates the interoperability between XRP and wCBDC systems, a key objective of the ECB’s ongoing research into the digital euro’s future infrastructure. XRP-Powered Coupon Payments The second scenario focuses on coupon payments, recurring interest payments to bondholders. On the coupon record date, the issuer reconciles wallet balances and transfers the required funds to its agent bank. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On payment day, the operator initiates the payment process using each investor’s wallet ID, and once again, XRP is used to facilitate the actual transfer. Confirmation messages ensure transparency and complete traceability throughout the transaction flow. This process showcases a high degree of automation, accuracy, and security—hallmarks of distributed ledger systems. XRP’s inclusion as a transfer mechanism emphasizes its growing role in institutional finance, particularly in use cases that demand instant and reliable value settlement. Implications for the Future of European Finance Although the ECB has not officially commented on this specific trial, the documentation shared by Xaif reveals a sophisticated testbed where XRP plays a central role in core financial operations. Far from being a speculative asset, XRP is positioned here as an integral part of a sovereign debt infrastructure, underscoring its potential for large-scale financial applications. The ECB’s exploration of XRP through Axiology’s DLT TSS points to a future where blockchain-native assets are embedded in the very heart of traditional finance. As wholesale CBDC frameworks evolve, XRP may emerge as a standard for instant settlement, not just in Europe but across global capital markets.

USDT has a 63% market share of stablecoins and has a circulation of $155 billion, half of which is being processed on the TRON blockchain. On-chain statistics place TRON as a leader in terms of transaction volume and daily user activity regarding USDT. Since January 2025, TRON has added $20 billion USDT to its ecosystem. With these statistics, TRON could become the backbone of the stablecoin market. USDT, hosted on the TRON blockchain, has more user-disclosed funds than PayPal’s $39.2 billion, illustrating the true extent of stablecoin dominance in world markets. TRON has more USDT than any other blockchain, including Ethereum and Solana. There remains a high demand for TRON’s high liquidity and fast transaction times, as shown by recent $1 billion issuances of Tether’s USDT on the TRON ecosystem. There is a growing interest in fast settlement times with cross-border transactions. The stablecoin boom has only just begun, so there is a demand for low fees and fast transactions. TRON can meet this demand and could be in a profitable position to benefit from institutional demand. Cross-border transaction demands place TRON next to other remittance-focused blockchains such as ISO accredited XRP. Justin Sun, co-founder of TRON, said that the success of TRX was grounded in its early focus on openness, user empowerment, and real-world utility. Sun reasoned that people were using USDT on TRON because it just works. Sun is focused on building tech infrastructure for a future generation of entrepreneurs. Stablecoins seem to be a key ingredient in the worldwide adoption of blockchain, due to their practical use for remittances. Despite ongoing tariff wars between major countries, Sun has made business partnerships with US blockchains. USD1, a stablecoin issued by the Trump-backed project World Liberty Financial, chose TRON to launch its new stablecoin. TRON has joined the T3 Financial Crime Unit, which aims to tackle illegal activities on blockchain systems. The crime unit successfully froze over $160 million linked to illicit activities. The focus on sound business practices may attract countries concerned about black markets, and would like a blockchain that does not enable illegal activities. Ethereum has 79,000 active USDT wallets, compared with TRON’s 730,000 active wallets. The trajectory of TRON seems to be upward, with sufficient infrastructure to meet the needs of corporate clients. The repeated rounds of USDT Tether minting on the TRON blockchain suggest that the cryptocurrency is confident in its abilities. TRON is currently dominating the stablecoin market, and if this trend continues, it could become a household name for retail and institutional clients. Whether TRON can adapt well to growing demand and scalability requirements remains to be seen. There are also concerns about how well TRON can navigate the global phenomenon of regulation. Whether Ethereum can bounce back and provide customers with a reliable service that competes well with the up-and-coming contenders is yet to be seen. Meanwhile, while issuing USDT, Tether is also backing up its newly minted tokens with reserve US dollars so that investors can feel confident that their USDT can be converted to US dollars when needed. Tether has made various investments to back up their US dollars and Gold stablecoins, adding to the validity of their cryptocurrencies. The partnership between Tether and TRON is fitting because while Tether can validate USDT with reserve dollars, TRON can reliably use the stablecoins for fast and free transactions. Tether is responsible for promoting its USDT tokens on reliable blockchains, including TRON and Ethereum. There will also be a greater demand for swapping capabilities so that the tokens can easily be transported to various ecosystems with minimal fuss.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|USDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-27 19:01:21

The latest US legislation to do the rounds is the Clarity Act, which, according to some pundits, could be spurring on the recent price increases. There could be speculation that the Clarity Act could provide extra momentum for publicly listed crypto companies. Coinbase has a year-to-date performance of 50%, which is a massive profit for investors. Circle , another publicly listed crypto company, recently had an extremely popular IPO, especially for traders interested in the company’s stablecoin USDC. Andy Heilman, investment advisor, said on X that the price of COIN looked set for a pullback, yet the momentum could see more bullish movements. The investor commented that the stock saw a solid run throughout the trading day. From a technical analysis perspective, the price could be tested by new all-time highs, reaching four-digit figures, and creating an even larger price-to-earnings ratio. Cantonese Cat, a crypto analyst, commented on X that Bollinger Bands indicated that the price was pushing hard against the upper band, which could indicate a pullback to the mean-reversion, but in this instance could indicate further all-time-highs, due to the immense pressure on the upper band. Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results, with a 24% increase in revenue to $2 billion, which was lower than estimated values. The price-to-book ratio looks healthy above 1.5, but the price-to-earnings ratio looks bloated at way above 15. Revenue dropped 10% from the previous quarter, despite showing positive growth. Transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, while subscription and services grew by 37%, indicating a positive result for the company’s efforts to diversify cash flows. The Senate passed the Genius Act last week, providing stablecoins with extra support by the government, including regulatory certainty and consumer protections. The Genius act also offered support for short-term treasuries and requires large tech companies to report activities to federal authorities to provide consistent client services. COIN’s price pumped by 40% after the Genius Act was passed, reflecting a possible sentiment of traders that the new legislation will benefit stablecoin-involved companies. Gautam Chhugani, a financial analyst, called Coinbase the ‘Amazon of crypto services’. Chhugani priced Coinbase at $510, a rise from $310. COIN recently rose to an all-time high of around $375, a 950% increase from the lows 2022. This performance has partly been attributed to Coinbase diversifying its services into stablecoin-related businesses. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been instructed to prepare for stablecoins as a payment method. These entities represent the US housing market. The Genius Act is largely responsible for opening up the doors for traditional investors to engage with stablecoins. The new legislation provides protections and responsibilities for stablecoin businesses and consumers. The added ‘certainty’ created by the new US regulations has finally allowed crypto technologies to enter the public sector. The main form of revenue for Coinbase is derived from transaction fees. However, Coinbase has been diversifying its cash flows and now receives revenue from its assets that back the USDC stablecoin. There seems to be a bullish consensus between technical analysts and pricing experts, with some technical analysts placing COIN at four digits above $1,000. In contrast, pricing experts have a lower target of $500, both vast predictions considering that the price-to-earnings ratio is bloated.",Cryptocurrency|News|Coinbase|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-27 19:06:36

BTCI outperforms in flat Bitcoin markets due to its premium income, but underperforms during sharp rallies and carries a similar downside risk to holding Bitcoin directly. I suspect Bitcoin's price may remain range-bound near $100K due to the behavioral and emotional weight of this price level, creating resistance above $110K and support below $90K. Although BTCI is not suitable for long-term income or aggressive bull scenarios, it stands to outperform with a high yield if Bitcoin remains range-bound, as I suspect. Those who follow my research may know that I am skeptical of both Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and derivative-based ETFs. Both have become more popular investments among retail investors seeking low market correlation and high appreciation potential (Bitcoin) and high-income returns (option selling funds). Thus, it is little surprise that Neos Funds has seen strong inflows in its Bitcoin option strategy ETF ( BTCI ), which generates distributions by selling options on Bitcoin. Although cryptocurrencies provide potential and, in a few cases, actual economic utility, I doubt Bitcoin's potential to fulfill its primary role as a medium of exchange . For the time being, it is certainly a store of value for many, but one subject to the speculative whims led, in part, by excess liquidity conditions in the market. Derivative-based ETFs often generate dividend premiums by selling options. While strategy is attractive to many due to its double-digit yields, I believe it is frequently misunderstood as ""income,"" when in fact it is a return of capital, akin to an insurance premium for assuming risk. Given the fund's sharp rise in assets under management since its inception, and the popularity of both option selling and Bitcoin funds, I believe BTCI deserves closer inspection. Although I am generally skeptical of Bitcoin and option selling, BTCI may be an instance where this strategy is sensible, given that speculative demand for Bitcoin long options may be excessive. BTCI Outperforms in Flat Markets On the surface, BTCI has many desirable qualities. Its current distribution rate is around 30%, with a reasonable expense ratio (for a complex fund) of 0.98%. BTCI's total return since its inception late last year is 50%, significantly outperforming most equity funds over the same period, driven by both price appreciation and substantial distribution returns. Since its inception, BTCI's correlation with the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) is 0.44, a relatively low figure that still indicates some market exposure. Its correlation to the Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), which it owns for appreciation, is 0.98. Since its inception, BTCI has underperformed HODL on a total return basis (which accounts for fully reinvested dividends): Data by YCharts As seen in the total return ratio, BTCI underperforms sharply during large rallies in Bitcoin, such as that seen recently and after the election last November. However, BTCI outperformed slightly during the range-bound conditions in the intermediate periods. Two-thirds of BTCI is allocated to T-Bills, resulting in a BTCI SEC Yield of 2.1%, as distributions of option premiums are not considered actual dividends. The reason is that, unlike actual dividends, these premiums will weigh on BTCI's unit price over time. Approximately 25% of BTCI is allocated to the Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), which may experience minor appreciation potential in the event of a rise in the price of Bitcoin. However, most of its fluctuations come from the small portion of the fund allocated to options on the CBOE Mini Bitcoin Index, MBTX. The index is currently at 255 points, equivalent to a BTC-USD value of approximately $107K. Currently, 9.5% of BTCI is allocated to long calls at 225, providing significant appreciation potential should Bitcoin rise, though this position will be worthless should Bitcoin fall to ~$94K. About 1% of the fund is allocated to call sales at 285 and 270, respectively (about $110K-$120K in BTC terms). It also has a negative put at 225, which is approximately 1% of its holdings. Thus, roughly 2% of the fund is allocated to option sales, generating premium returns of roughly 2% by expiration in mid-July. Based on its allocations, its ratio appears to be four put short positions, two long calls, and two short calls at differing expiries. Because option price data on MBTX is not as readily available as it is on the Bitcoin fund ( GBTC ), I aligned the expiry prices from MBTX with the equivalent prices for GBTC and, using an online tool, created a rough profit payoff chart for this strategy at current GBTC option prices. I assume that implied volatility levels (which drive premiums) are roughly equivalent for GBTC options and MBTX. At the same time, GBTC trades at its NAV , meaning this payoff chart should be almost identical for BTCI based on its current holdings: Option payoff chart for GBTC, July 18th, 2 $75 long calls, 4 $75 short puts,1 $90 short call, and 1 $95 short call (OptionsProfitCalculator.com) Importantly, the total cost of each option position is in the same ratios as BTCI's allocations on its positions, with the same expiry date. Although imperfect, this should be as close as possible to BTCI's actual payoff chart from its current derivative positions. However, it does not include the quarter of the fund allocated to HODL. Accounting for that position would ""tilt"" this chart upward, showing a ~1/4 slope at the left end instead of a plateau. The 2/3rds of the fund in T-bills would very slightly lift the chart by about 30 bps, as that income will come regardless of Bitcoin's price. Fundamentally, this strategy is not significantly different than a simple covered-call approach. However, by selling options at various expiration levels, the payoff is more curved than the usual ""stair step"" seen in simple covered calls. This gives BTCI relatively high appreciation potential, with a roughly 1:1 linear payoff up to a 5% rise in Bitcoin through July 18th. If Bitcoin rises by over 10%, BTCI should increase about 7% to 8%, with more limited gains given a very sharp rise in Bitcoin. Crucially, BTCI should earn about 1% (98 bps) if Bitcoin merely sustains its current price. There is approximately 1/17th of a year between now and July 18th, meaning the annualized return of BTCI would be about 18% annualized, assuming no change in Bitcoin's price or implied volatility levels. BTCI can earn a decent yield in flat markets because Bitcoin is volatile and therefore has high option premiums to account for its added risk. GBTC's implied volatility today is 37% , far higher than seen in equity index funds, but that is one of its lowest implied volatility levels compared to recent months. This means that BTCI's premium compensation may be low compared to the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin. Bitcoin May Face Sustained Plateau Investors who reinvest their distributions back into BTCI can expect total returns that are very similar to those of Bitcoin itself. The primary difference is that BTCI's strategy generates returns in flat markets, albeit not as strong as those in sharp rallies. BTCI's downside risk is roughly the same as that of Bitcoin itself, except for a small premium cushion. That said, if BTCI's distributions are not reinvested, the position's value will inevitably decline compared to the value of Bitcoin. We can see this in the price-return ratio of BTCI to HODL: Data by YCharts Their total returns, accounting for reinvested distributions, are very close; yet, BTCI experiences chronic decay to simply long Bitcoin funds. This decay factor is larger the faster Bitcoin rises, and vice versa. For this reason, it isn't very reasonable to treat BTCI's distributions as income that can be used for personal consumption. Doing so will inevitably lead to the decay of capital over time, assuming Bitcoin does not appreciate forever . Today, Bitcoin is at a key level, aligning with its past peak before the spring correction. Both Bitcoin and gold have been in trading ranges since the May recovery: Data by YCharts Compared to gold, Bitcoin has demonstrated higher market exposure. Although gold faced small losses during the height of the last correction, it generally rose through that period as inflation expectations and concerns mounted. At the same time, Bitcoin's value crashed by around 30%, more than the value of equities. Gold continued to rise as the market recovered. From an inter-asset correlation standpoint, Bitcoin is neither countercyclical nor a hedge against monetary risk. When concerns regarding dovish monetary policies (in a recession) rise, we're generally seeing gold rally and Bitcoin decline. Changes in the liquidity conditions of retail investors likely drive the price change of Bitcoin. When individual investors report having higher cash allocations, and those allocations are declining, we generally see sharp rallies in Bitcoin. When they report having low cash positions, Bitcoin often peaks and declines. See below: Data by YCharts This relationship is not perfect. I have had a bearish sentiment on Bitcoin since late last year due to low investor sideline cash levels; yet, it rose dramatically after Trump's election, primarily due to the view that he would create a Bitcoin reserve. The reality of this plan has disappointed investors , as Trump is not aiming to buy Bitcoin with government funds, but rather is merely creating a named reserve for Bitcoin that the government already owns through civil asset forfeiture. To me, this effort mainly highlights the degree to which Bitcoin is not an asset immune to government oversight and confiscation. Nevertheless, investor cash allocations were higher last month due to a derisking effort following the correction. That may be somewhat supportive of Bitcoin, though it is unclear if cash levels have fallen significantly since, which I assume given the full recovery of most assets. In my view, it is more likely that Bitcoin struggles to break above $110K, given its momentum has slowed. To me, the more likely outcome is continued range-bound behavior around $100K, given that it is an emotionally critical threshold. Bitcoin may also crash again, potentially catalyzed by another market correction due to the upcoming end of delayed tariffs , though recent news suggests the deadline will be delayed yet again . However, considering only Bitcoin's fundamentals, I believe a range-bound outlook is the most reasonable, particularly given that gold is also in a trading range. The Bottom Line If Bitcoin fluctuates around the $90K to $110K range for a prolonged period, BTCI stands to outperform Bitcoin, earning premiums in a flat market. For this reason, I remain neutral on BTCI, but I believe it may have some speculative short-term value in relation to Bitcoin itself. Of course, there's an argument that Bitcoin may see a huge rally if it breaks above $110K. BTCI is likely to underperform in a massive rally and has roughly the same downside risk should the rally reverse. In my opinion, that is unlikely, given the behavioral and emotional importance of $100K, which provides a ""stickiness factor"" that may keep it around this level. A flat Bitcoin price is ideal for BTCI because it will earn high premiums with less volatility if that is sustained.",BTCI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-27 19:07:01

Brace yourselves, because the latest revelation from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis—the May Core PCE price index rising by 0.2%—is more than just a number; it’s a critical signal that could ripple through the global financial landscape, directly influencing the crypto market reaction . What is the Core PCE Index and Why Does it Matter to Your Wallet? The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, particularly its “core” variant which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is the Federal Reserve ‘s preferred gauge for measuring US inflation . Unlike the more commonly cited Consumer Price Index (CPI), PCE captures a broader range of consumer spending and accounts for shifts in consumer behavior, making it a more comprehensive indicator of underlying inflationary pressures. When we talk about the Core PCE , we’re looking at the fundamental pulse of consumer prices, giving us a clearer picture of how much more (or less) you’re paying for everyday goods and services. For investors, especially those in the dynamic world of digital assets, understanding the Core PCE is paramount. It’s not just an academic exercise; it’s a direct input into the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, which in turn dictate the broader economic environment—and that environment significantly impacts asset classes like cryptocurrencies. May’s Surprise: A Closer Look at US Inflation Data The recent announcement confirmed that the Core PCE price index climbed by 0.2% in May from the previous month. While this might seem like a small increment, it crucially exceeded the market’s expectation of a 0.1% rise. This unexpected uptick signals that inflationary pressures might be more persistent than previously hoped, defying some predictions of a rapid cooldown. This data point is a stark reminder that the fight against US inflation is far from over. Let’s put this into perspective: Actual May Core PCE: +0.2% month-over-month Market Expectation: +0.1% month-over-month Implication: Stronger underlying inflationary momentum. This marginal but significant overshoot suggests that the consumer demand remains robust, or supply-side constraints are still playing a role, preventing a faster deceleration of prices. Such nuances are what the Federal Reserve meticulously analyzes to formulate its next moves. The Federal Reserve’s Tightrope Walk: What Does This Mean for Monetary Policy? The Federal Reserve operates under a dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and maintaining price stability. With the latest Core PCE data hinting at stubborn US inflation , the Fed’s path becomes increasingly challenging. For months, the central bank has been engaged in an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to its 2% target. This latest data point adds pressure on the Fed to potentially maintain its hawkish stance or even consider further tightening measures. Here’s why this matters to the Federal Reserve : Inflation Persistence: A higher-than-expected Core PCE suggests inflation isn’t cooling as quickly as desired, making the Fed’s job harder. Credibility: The Fed needs to demonstrate its commitment to price stability to maintain market confidence. Future Rate Decisions: This data directly influences whether the Fed will pause, hike, or cut rates in upcoming meetings. The market closely watches these signals for clues on future interest rate hikes . Any indication that the Fed might need to continue its aggressive approach can send tremors through financial markets, including the crypto market reaction . Will More Interest Rate Hikes Be Necessary, and How Will They Affect You? The specter of additional interest rate hikes looms larger after the May Core PCE report. Higher interest rates typically translate to increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, potentially slowing economic growth. For the average person, this could mean more expensive mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt. For businesses, it can lead to reduced investment and hiring, impacting overall economic activity. The impact of interest rate hikes on different asset classes is profound: Traditional Assets: Higher rates can make bonds more attractive relative to stocks, and can weigh on corporate earnings. Real Estate: Mortgage rates rise, cooling the housing market. Cryptocurrencies: Often seen as riskier assets, crypto tends to perform poorly in high-interest rate environments as investors flock to safer, yielding assets. The Federal Reserve ’s next few meetings will be crucial in determining the trajectory of interest rate hikes , and by extension, the broader economic climate. Investors will be scrutinizing every word from Chairman Powell for hints on the future of monetary policy. Navigating the Crypto Market Reaction to Economic Shifts The relationship between macro-economic data like the Core PCE and the crypto market reaction is increasingly evident. Cryptocurrencies, while often touted as a hedge against inflation, have historically struggled in environments of rising interest rates and a strengthening U.S. dollar. When the Federal Reserve signals a more hawkish stance due to persistent US inflation , the “risk-off” sentiment often prevails, leading investors to pull capital from speculative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here’s how the crypto market reaction typically unfolds: Reduced Liquidity: Higher interest rates can reduce the overall liquidity in the financial system, making it harder for risk assets to thrive. Investor Sentiment: Fear of economic slowdown or recession, fueled by persistent inflation and rate hikes, can lead to widespread de-risking. Dollar Strength: Aggressive Fed policy often strengthens the U.S. dollar, which can put downward pressure on dollar-denominated assets like cryptocurrencies. For crypto investors, this means vigilance is key. Understanding the macro landscape, especially data points like the Core PCE , can help in making informed decisions and adjusting portfolio strategies to mitigate potential volatility. While crypto markets are inherently volatile, external economic pressures certainly amplify this characteristic. What’s Next for the US Economy and Your Portfolio? The May Core PCE data serves as a critical reminder that the path to price stability is bumpy. Investors should prepare for continued volatility as the Federal Reserve navigates this complex economic environment. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on upcoming economic indicators, especially inflation reports (CPI, PPI, and future PCE releases) and Federal Reserve meeting minutes. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers unique opportunities, a diversified portfolio that accounts for various economic scenarios can help weather storms. Long-Term Perspective: For many crypto enthusiasts, the long-term potential of blockchain technology remains compelling. Short-term market fluctuations, driven by macro events, should be viewed within this broader context. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-losses and avoiding over-leveraging, especially during periods of high uncertainty. The interplay between macroeconomics and the digital asset space is becoming increasingly intertwined. A nuanced understanding of indicators like the Core PCE is no longer just for traditional finance experts; it’s essential for anyone serious about navigating the evolving landscape of the crypto market reaction . A Crucial Turning Point? The May Core PCE report, with its surprising 0.2% rise, has underscored the ongoing challenge of taming US inflation . This data point will undoubtedly weigh heavily on the minds of Federal Reserve policymakers as they deliberate on the necessity of further interest rate hikes . For the crypto market reaction , this translates to continued scrutiny and potential headwinds as investors recalibrate their risk appetites in response to a tighter monetary policy outlook. While the road ahead may be volatile, informed decision-making, grounded in a solid understanding of macroeconomic fundamentals, will be your most powerful tool. To learn more about the latest US inflation trends and their impact on the crypto market, explore our articles on key developments shaping the crypto market and its economic outlook .

BTC and ETH, the crypto market’s top two cryptocurrencies, have both witnessed a noticeable drop in positive sentiment on social media since late May. Santiment noted that their sentiment ratios, which measure positive against negative commentary, have trended downward. This cooling in social buzz comes amid wild price volatility and downward pressure on both crypto’s prices, suggesting a more cautious stance among investors. Bitcoin is trading at $106,897 at the time of publication, down 2% over the past 30 days. The alpha crypto hit $110,266 around two weeks ago on June 10, before entering a downtrend a day after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran that tanked equities and crypto markets. Meanwhile, Ether recently dipped to $2,429. The crypto has been stuck below the psychologically important $3,000 mark for over 20 weeks following gradual erosion in trader confidence. XRP Sentiment Positive As Judge Slaps Down $50M Settlement Request In sharp contrast, XRP’s bullish-to-bearish comment ratio has climbed 2.1:1 — the highest in roughly 17 days. Santiment analysts pointed out that this spike comes after New York judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple for her to grant a proposed settlement agreement that would reduce Ripple’s civil penalty to $50 million and lift the permanent injunction against the blockchain payments firm. Despite the SEC adopting a more crypto-friendly regulatory posture in recent months under its new leadership, Torres found that the law hasn’t changed. Although Torres’s ruling was a massive legal blow that could prolong the nearly five-year-long case, it seems to have unexpectedly sparked positive discussion and belief among XRP holders. XRP was changing hands around $2.08 on Friday, a 2.4% decrease over the past day.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-27 19:10:17

Bitcoin (BTC) is down 0.7% in the last 24 hours, now trading for $106,700, according to CoinDesk market data. The orange coin’s performance was broadly in line with the CoinDesk 20’s — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins, and exchange coins — which fell 0.7% in the same period of time. Sui (SUI) was the index’s token that experienced the biggest price change either way, and it only rose 3.3%. Crypto stocks saw more significant moves, with Coinbase (COIN) and Circle (CRCL) losing 6% and 16% respectively. The stablecoin issuer’s stock is down 40% since it topped at almost $300 on Monday. Bitcoin miners remained relatively flat on the day, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which rose more than 30% on Thursday off a report that AI Hyperscaler CoreWeave was looking into acquiring the company, although Hut 8 (HUT) fell 6.5%. The mild price action contrasted with the prospect of the White House’s tariff strategy kicking into high gear again. U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his administration would be terminating all trade discussions with Canada in light of the Digital Services Tax the country aims to impose on U.S. tech firms. “We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven-day period,” Trump posted . The pause on reciprocal tariffs is also slated to end on July 9, but neither traditional markets nor crypto seem particularly concerned, Coinbase analysts noted in a research report. “[Markets] have largely disregarded the potential economic risks stemming from this situation… partly because this hasn’t necessarily been reflected in the economic data,” the analysts wrote. The complacency around tariffs will likely continue, they said, because they are unlikely to be as inflationary as previously expected.",Markets|Bitcoin|Trump|Market Wrap|btc|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 19:18:01

For years, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have worn the crown, leading the pack in the meme coin revolution. But something seismic is shifting. The meme coin spotlight is moving, and it’s now beaming straight at four newer, bolder, and much spicier contenders: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , BONK, WIF, and FLOKI. And if you’re not watching closely, you might just miss the next 239x opportunity of your life. Let’s dive into the future of meme coins and why these four are taking over. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The EVM Layer 2 Monster Has Arrived Move over, DOGE. Step aside, SHIB. LILPEPE isn’t just another frog meme coin—it’s a full-blown revolution, marching into the crypto battlefield with its own Layer 2 EVM blockchain. This isn’t hype without substance. This is where memes meet muscle, and that muscle is a lightning-fast, ultra-low-fee blockchain built for speed, security, and scalability. The presale is already making waves. Stage 3 is 78.60% filled, and that’s no joke. Within 72 hours, nearly $2 million has been poured into the project, with 1,768,233,828 tokens already sold out of the 2.25 billion allocated for this stage. Once it hits 100%, the price jumps to $0.0013, and if you’re in now at $0.0012, you’re staring at an automatic 150% gain when LILPEPE launches at $0.003. Buy now: LILPEPE Official Presale . But that’s just scratching the surface. LILPEPE is not only selling out fast—it’s turning heads globally. Whales have already started aping in. Deep pockets are scooping millions of tokens, and the FOMO is getting very real. The second stage of the presale sold out in just two days, and if that momentum continues, stage 3 will be gone before the end of the week. But what’s the real kicker? Analysts are projecting a potential post-launch rally to $0.287, representing a staggering 23,976% gain from current levels. Yes, you read that right. That’s a potential 239x ROI—and it’s still in its early stages. To top it off, LILPEPE is giving back to its loyal community with a massive $770,000 giveaway. Ten lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens simply by participating. This is the kind of energy meme coins were born for. Enter the new world order with LILPEPE—where memes don’t just go viral, they build empires. BONK: The Solana Surprise Packet Hailing from the Solana network, BONK was written off as a meme gimmick last year. Today, it’s one of the hottest tokens in the Solana ecosystem. BONK has proven it has teeth, bouncing back from market dips and launching with serious community support. Analysts are pointing to upcoming NFT integrations and gamified staking as key reasons to keep BONK on your radar. Bonk is trading at $0.00001411 and could rise six times in July. Dogwifhat (WIF): Meme with a Mission You can’t talk about the next-gen meme wave without mentioning WIF. This bizarre yet endearing coin gained popularity earlier this year, thanks to its unique branding—a dog wearing a hat—and a no-nonsense community that thrives on viral moments. But what sets WIF apart is its resilient price action. After cooling down from all-time highs, it’s quietly consolidating and preparing for a second breakout as it trades at $0.8688. Many crypto traders are referring to WIF as the “silent killer” of the meme coin space. Its next rally might not just be loud—it might be deafening. FLOKI: The Meme King With a Roadmap FLOKI is the Viking warrior of this bunch. It’s got community, marketing muscle, and an actual roadmap loaded with utility—something rare in the meme space. With initiatives like FlokiFi and Valhalla (a P2E metaverse game), as well as aggressive global partnerships (including those with Premier League football teams), FLOKI is building a substantial empire. The fact that its price has increased to $0.00007416 indicates that investors are starting to trust it again. FLOKI demonstrates that meme currencies can be both enjoyable and valuable, filling a unique space that combines excitement with practical applications in the real world. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Next Meme Coin Explosion The rules are changing. The leaders are shifting. LILPEPE, BONK, WIF, and FLOKI are no longer underdogs—they’re the new guard of crypto culture. With a listing price of $0.003, a presale price of $0.0012, and a potential 239x moonshot, LILPEPE is the meme coin to watch. The clock’s ticking, and Stage 3 is almost filled. Blink, and you’ll miss it. Grab LILPEPE now before Stage 3 sells out Welcome to the new era of meme coins.

In 2028, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.7912, with an average price of $0.6529. By 2031, HBAR could trade between $2.03 and $2.32, with an average price of $2.08 HBAR price prediction – Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) cryptocurrency is one of the altcoins that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing at a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we might see a bullish scenario happening sooner: perhaps a retest of its all-time high.

Image Source: Tradingview Based on the 1-day chart, Hedera (HBAR) is attempting a modest rebound after a recent decline. The price is currently at $0.14576, rising slightly above the lower Bollinger Band ($0.12988) but still below the midline ($0.15452), indicating that bearish sentiment persists. The RSI is at 40.73, nearing oversold conditions but not yet signaling a strong reversal. A sustained move above the midline could shift momentum toward the upper band at $0.17915. However, failure to reclaim that level may result in renewed downside pressure. If $0.13 support fails, HBAR risks revisiting lower lows. Caution remains warranted without stronger confirmation. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBAR/USD chart . Image Source: Tradingview Based on the 4-hour chart, Hedera (HBAR) is showing early signs of recovery but remains technically fragile. The price is currently at $0.14587, trading just above the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.14895), indicating mild bullish momentum. The Balance of Power is strongly positive at 0.93, suggesting buyers are temporarily in control. However, the MACD remains flat and near the zero line, reflecting indecisive momentum with no clear directional trend. To confirm a breakout, HBAR must close above $0.15695 resistance with volume. Failure to hold above $0.14096 support could lead to a short-term pullback. Traders should monitor for confirmation before positioning.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Hedera (HBAR) is exhibiting a cautious recovery attempt but remains within a broader bearish structure. On the 1-day chart, HBAR trades at $0.14576, hovering below the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.15452), with the RSI at 40.73 indicating weak momentum. The 4-hour chart shows price near the midline of the Bollinger Bands, with a strong Balance of Power at 0.93 suggesting short-term buyer strength. However, the MACD remains neutral, and resistance at $0.15695 must be cleared for a sustained uptrend. Failure to hold above $0.14096 support could result in another downward move. Is HBAR a good investment? Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.24 How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth $1.65. Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely in the near future. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $1.34 and $1.65, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes. Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good, long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.2393 by 2025 and $1.65 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Recent news/opinion on HBAR Nasdaq has applied to list an ETF holding Hedera’s HBAR token. This follows multiple filings by exchanges and asset managers seeking altcoin-based ETFs. The SEC must approve the listing before trading begins. In November, Canary Capital filed for its Canary HBAR ETF to provide investors with exposure to Hedera’s native currency. Hedera Hashgraph price prediction June 2025 The price of Hedera is forecasted to attain a minimum value of $0.1629 in June 2025.

This is where innovations like Circle CCTP step in, and a recent announcement from Circle, the issuer of the popular stablecoin USDC, marks a significant leap forward. They’ve officially announced that their Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) V2 now supports Polygon (POL), a move poised to unlock new efficiencies and possibilities for users and developers alike. But what does this really mean for the everyday crypto enthusiast or the seasoned DeFi participant? Let’s dive deeper. Understanding the Power of Circle CCTP V2 At its core, Circle CCTP is designed to facilitate secure and efficient transfers of USDC across various blockchain networks. Instead of traditional ‘bridge’ mechanisms that often involve wrapping assets (creating a synthetic version on another chain), CCTP employs a ‘burn and mint’ mechanism. When you want to move USDC from, say, Ethereum to Polygon, the USDC on Ethereum is burned, and an equivalent amount of native USDC is minted on Polygon. This direct approach reduces risks associated with wrapped assets and enhances capital efficiency. Native USDC Transfers: Ensures users always hold native USDC, not wrapped versions, reducing counterparty risk. Enhanced Security: By burning and minting, CCTP bypasses common bridge vulnerabilities. Improved Liquidity: Facilitates deeper liquidity pools across integrated chains. Streamlined User Experience: Simplifies the process of moving USDC for users and developers. The CCTP V2 iteration brings further refinements, improving the protocol’s robustness and expanding its reach. This evolution is crucial for the interconnected future of Web3, where users expect their digital assets to be as fluid as information on the internet. Why is Polygon Support a Game-Changer? The integration of Polygon support into CCTP V2 is a monumental step. Polygon has emerged as a leading scaling solution for Ethereum, boasting lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Its vibrant ecosystem hosts a multitude of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and gaming applications. By enabling native USDC transfers to and from Polygon, Circle is directly addressing a significant need within this rapidly expanding network. Consider the practical implications: Aspect Before Polygon Support on CCTP After Polygon Support on CCTP USDC Transfer Method Typically wrapped USDC via third-party bridges Native USDC via CCTP’s burn-and-mint Security Risk Higher, due to reliance on bridge security and wrapped asset risks Lower, leveraging CCTP’s robust protocol Capital Efficiency Lower, as liquidity can be fragmented across wrapped versions Higher, consolidated native USDC liquidity Developer Experience Complex integrations for various bridge solutions Simplified, standardized CCTP integration This integration streamlines the process for users looking to engage with Polygon’s ecosystem, making it easier and safer to move their stablecoin holdings. It also empowers developers on Polygon to build more robust applications that rely on secure and efficient stablecoin liquidity. The Indispensable Role of USDC in Cross-Chain Finance USDC , issued by Circle, stands as one of the most widely adopted and trusted stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market. Pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, it provides a stable medium of exchange, a reliable store of value, and a crucial component for liquidity within DeFi protocols. Its transparency and regulatory compliance have contributed significantly to its widespread acceptance. In the context of cross-chain transfers, USDC’s ubiquity is its greatest strength. For CCTP to be truly effective, it needs a stablecoin that is recognized and utilized across numerous chains. USDC fits this bill perfectly, acting as the universal digital dollar that can flow freely between different blockchain environments. This move by Circle further solidifies USDC’s position as a cornerstone of the multi-chain future, facilitating everything from simple payments to complex DeFi strategies across disparate networks. Navigating the Landscape of Cross-Chain Transfer The need for efficient and secure cross-chain transfer mechanisms has been one of the biggest challenges in the blockchain space. Historically, moving assets between different blockchains was cumbersome, expensive, and often fraught with security risks. Bridges, while innovative, have also been targets for exploits, leading to significant financial losses for users and projects. CCTP offers a distinct advantage by not holding assets in a smart contract on the source chain, but rather burning them. This architectural choice significantly mitigates the risks associated with liquidity pools and bridge vulnerabilities. The expansion of CCTP V2 to include Polygon, alongside other major networks like Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Linea, Optimism, Solana, Sonic Labs, Unichain, and World Chain, creates a vast network for native USDC transfers. This comprehensive support network is critical for fostering a truly interconnected and liquid DeFi ecosystem. What are the benefits of CCTP’s approach? Reduced Trust Assumptions: Users rely on Circle’s minting/burning rather than a third-party bridge operator. Capital Efficiency: No need for locked liquidity on a bridge, as USDC is burned on one chain and minted on another. Enhanced Composability: Developers can integrate CCTP directly into their applications, offering seamless user experiences. Future-Proofing: A standardized protocol simplifies future integrations with new chains and scaling solutions. This approach paves the way for a more secure and user-friendly experience in the multi-chain world, making it easier for users to access the best opportunities wherever they may exist. Advancing Blockchain Interoperability: A Unified Vision The ultimate goal of developments like CCTP’s Polygon integration is to foster greater blockchain interoperability . In an ideal world, users and applications should be able to interact across different blockchains as easily as they navigate different websites on the internet. Each blockchain has its unique strengths and weaknesses – some are optimized for speed, others for security, and others for specific applications. True interoperability means that these chains can communicate and transfer value without friction, unlocking the full potential of a decentralized internet. Circle’s CCTP V2 is a crucial piece of this puzzle, building the ‘highway’ for stablecoin liquidity between these disparate digital economies. By standardizing the transfer of USDC, it reduces fragmentation and creates a more unified financial landscape within Web3. The Broader Impact: Liquidity Unification: Helps consolidate USDC liquidity across various chains, leading to more efficient markets. Developer Empowerment: Provides a robust, reliable primitive for building cross-chain applications. User Accessibility: Lowers the barrier for users to participate in diverse blockchain ecosystems. Ecosystem Growth: Attracts more users and capital to the integrated chains, fostering innovation. As more chains are added to the CCTP network, the vision of a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem moves closer to reality, where assets and information can flow freely, enabling a new generation of decentralized applications and services. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for CCTP and the Multi-Chain World? The addition of Polygon to CCTP V2 is not an endpoint but a significant milestone in an ongoing journey. Circle’s commitment to expanding CCTP’s reach signals a clear vision for a future where USDC is the universal medium for value transfer across all major blockchain networks. As the DeFi space continues to mature, the demand for seamless, secure, and efficient cross-chain solutions will only intensify. We can anticipate further integrations with emerging Layer 2 solutions and other innovative blockchain architectures. This continuous expansion will further cement USDC’s role as the leading stablecoin for interoperable finance and solidify CCTP as the backbone for its cross-chain movement. For users, this means more choices, lower costs, and greater freedom to engage with the entire spectrum of decentralized applications. For developers, it means a more robust and predictable environment for building the next generation of Web3 innovations. Conclusion: A Seamless Future for Digital Assets Circle’s decision to bring Polygon support to its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol V2 is a pivotal development that underscores the industry’s drive towards greater blockchain interoperability . By enabling native USDC to flow freely and securely across Polygon and other major networks, CCTP is solving one of the most pressing challenges in decentralized finance: efficient cross-chain transfer . This move not only benefits the vibrant Polygon ecosystem but also strengthens the overall utility and reach of Circle CCTP , paving the way for a more unified, secure, and user-friendly multi-chain future. As the digital economy continues its rapid expansion, innovations like CCTP will be instrumental in building the bridges that connect us all.

The accusations are based on its unrealized losses of $6 billion in its Bitcoin portfolio and accuse the corporation of not sufficiently disclosing risks to investors. According to the plaintiffs, the company issued untrue and misleading statements for 11 months, beginning in April 2024 and lasting until April 2025. The lawsuits allege that Strategy presented the Bitcoin volatility and the effects of the new accounting alteration in a weak manner. Investors contend that the failure to submit these risks led to a significant decline in share price. In the first case to be led by an investor, Abhey Parmar, he claims that the executives of Strategy Inc. had breached fiduciary duties and exaggerated the firm’s financial prospects. One of the main allegations is that CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang sold 31.5 million worth of the company before publicly announcing the changes in Bitcoin accounting. According to legal experts, this is common in large-scale class actions where law firms will bid to be appointed lead counsel. Stock gains amid legal scrutiny Strategy shares are up 28% year-to-date through all the legal headwinds, signaling continued investor confidence in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm now has 592,345 BTC worth more than $63 billion. Strategy has an average purchase price of $70,702 per coin, and Bitcoin is trading at $106,824, an unrealized gain of $21.3 billion, roughly a 51% gain. The founder and chairman of Strategy, Michael Saylor, remained the largest individual shareholder. He owns close to 20 million shares as of the last SEC filing, which translates to approximately $7.8 billion using the current stock price of $389.50 per share. Other significant shareholders are Vanguard (8.55%), BlackRock (5.80%), Capital International Investors (5.80%), Susquehanna Securities (4.82%), and Jane Street Group (4.70%). Despite the growing scrutiny, the company has maintained the same long-term approach to Bitcoin, which involves frequent buy-ups no matter the market conditions, and it has new fiscal backing as a result. Strategy shares ( $MSTR ) are trading at $393.24 and have a market cap of $107.51 billion, a premium of 1.67x over its net asset value. Profit warning sparked filing surge The lawsuits continued to gain traction following revelations by Strategy in April that it was expected to report no profit on Q1, attributed to unrealized losses in Bitcoin. The company cautioned in an SEC filing that it “may not be able to regain profitability in future periods.” Strategy recorded a loss of $16.49 per share in Q1. The initial class action was filed on May 16 by Pomerantz LLP, followed by individual actions by Gross Law Firm, Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, and Levi & Korsinsky. The possibility of seeing numerous claims instead of a unified lawsuit indicates a clash of legal interests and confusion among the major stakeholders who should take the initiative. So far, none of the top institutional holders of Strategy has attested to participating in any of the suits. The result may shape wider market attitudes toward corporate exposure and disclosure on Bitcoin, especially when insider trading allegations become material.

That would be a near doubling from the current level just above $16. The note came hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave, a cloud AI compute firm, is once again in advanced talks to acquire Core Scientific, following a failed $5.75 per share offer in 2024. CORZ shares jumped 33% to close over $16 Thursday, but Cantor believes that it still undervalues the company by at least 50%. At the heart of the bull case is a 12-year, $3.5 billion infrastructure lease Core Scientific signed with CoreWeave in 2024 to provide 200 megawatts of AI capacity. Cantor values the lease stream at $24/share, using a conservative 15x profit multiple typical for traditional data center REITs. Add another $11.70/share for the replacement value of CORZ’s 570MW of power infrastructure, and the upside case becomes clear. The BTC - AI Pivot But it’s not just Cantor arguing that the compute power used for crunching numbers to mine BTC might be more efficiently used for AI. Rittenhouse Research, a new fintech and AI-focused firm, released a report in May arguing that the most successful crypto companies aren’t doubling down on bitcoin. Instead, they’re pivoting to become AI infrastructure providers. When Galaxy Digital bought the Helios data center in late 2022, it seemed like a rescue of a struggling miner, yet it turned out to be a strategic AI asset as demand for data center space surged with the rise of ChatGPT and LLMs, Rittenhouse pointed out. “The infrastructure used to mine digital gold is better used to process AI algorithms,” Rittenhouse wrote at the time. At the core of the argument is the belief that AI generates stable, long-term cash flows, unlike BTC mining, which is subject to sharp revenue drops every four years due to halvings and is heavily dependent on bitcoin’s volatile price cycles. The future profitability of BTC mining, Rittenhouse noted, is also dependent on mining firms being able to design chips that are significantly more efficient each cycle to account for the halvening, an increasingly difficult task as gains from silicon shrinkage begin to plateau. But Not Every Pivot Away from BTC is Successful While Cantor, and the market broadly, is looking fondly on Core Scientific's possible pivot, not all pivots away from BTC mining have gone this well. As CoinDesk recently reported, Bit Digital is dumping its bitcoin rigs to go all-in on Ethereum staking , and the market pushed down its stock by 15% during the Thursday trading session in New York. Canaan, once hoping to diversify into AI hardware, has now shuttered its chip unit entirely after failing to gain traction. Its stock is down nearly 75% in the last six months, and closed at 63 cents on Thursday. But Core Scientific might have found the middle path, leveraging its mining-built footprint to tap into a $100 billion-plus AI infrastructure boom. If Cantor’s thesis proves right, CoreWeave’s second offer for CORZ could look very different from the one they made last year , and it could mark a new blueprint for the rest of the sector. Neither CoreWeave nor Core Scientific has publicly commented on the matter.",Markets|Bitcoin|Mining|Corz|Coreweave|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 19:20:43

While XRP and ADA offer strong fundamentals, their current trajectories suggest limited upside in the near term. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum as a low-cap presale gem with the kind of explosive potential early investors crave. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Dark Horse with Breakout Potential AGACOIN FINANCE enters the scene as a high-risk, high-reward contender in the early stages of its presale. The project is attracting significant attention for its bold narrative, viral community, and fixed token supply. With a low initial entry point, it wouldn’t take a massive influx of capital to push MAGACOIN FINANCE toward the $5 mark. A 30x move from its current valuation is speculative—but entirely plausible in the context of past presale success stories like SHIBA or PEPE. Analysts have flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few new altcoins with real potential to deliver over 70x returns in a breakout scenario. If momentum continues and key exchange listings follow, MAGACOIN FINANCE could outpace even the most established names in the market. XRP Forecast: Could Reach $5, But Odds Are Slim XRP continues to command attention, especially as regulatory battles ease and talk of ETF listings heats up. But despite renewed optimism, most credible forecasts place XRP between $2 and $4 by the end of 2026. Some models even stretch to $8 in bullish scenarios, but few see $5 as a base case unless the market enters a full-blown mania phase. While XRP’s long-term utility in cross-border payments is compelling, reaching $5 will likely require a confluence of catalysts—clear regulation, institutional demand, and sustained retail inflows. Cardano (ADA): Solid Fundamentals, Slower Growth Cardano has built a reputation for slow and steady development, backed by academic research and a loyal developer community. Analysts generally expect ADA to trade between $2.75 and $3.25 in 2026. While some long-term predictions put the $5–$10 range in play, that’s more likely by 2030 than mid-decade. Despite strong tech and an active ecosystem, ADA has struggled to break out of its sideways momentum. Without a major shift in user adoption or DeFi activity on its chain, $5 remains a stretch target in the current cycle. Conclusion: Will the Underdog Strike First? XRP and ADA could approach $5 under extremely bullish conditions, but neither is expected to reach that level by 2026 based on mainstream forecasts. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, offers the kind of early-stage growth opportunity that speculative investors chase during bull markets. For those willing to take the risk, this emerging altcoin might just be the first to cross the $5 finish line.

Small businesses in Bolivia are increasingly embracing crypto as trust in the official currency deteriorates. According to a report by Reuters, restaurants, beauty salons, and a range of small businesses are beginning to accept crypto payments. Amid this rising crypto adoption, transactions are up 530% in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. According to Bolivia’s central bank, crypto transactions rose from $46.5 million to $294 million over the course of the year. The surge in crypto usage comes as the country grapples with a major financial crisis. Bolivia’s currency has lost more than half its value on the black market, while the central bank has run out of dollar reserves. Fuel shortages and historic inflation levels are making crypto assets appear stable in comparison. As a result, Bolivians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins like Tether (USDT) to protect their savings and purchasing power. According to Jose Gabriel Espinoza, former head of Bolivia’s central bank, daily USDT volumes in the country may be as high as $600,000. While this is still a small fraction of the $12–$14 million cash-based black market, reliance on crypto is rapidly growing.

ETH staking picked up again in Q2, leading to a record value locked of over 35M ETH, or around 30% of the available supply. | Source: Beacon Chain After some outflows from the staking contract during the market panic in March and April, Ethereum staking returned to peak levels, not seen since September 2024. ETH staking became one of the most reliable markers for long-term confidence in the network’s value. Following the Pectra upgrade, staking also accelerated as large-scale whales could deposit more ETH at a time to build their stake. As a result, the total value staked on Ethereum is at an all-time high. The Ethereum network carries over $61B locked in DeFi protocols, including lending, liquid staking, and DEX liquidity pools. ETH remains valuable as collateral, and whales are in no hurry to sell. More ETH is wrapped in multiple protocols and is taken off the open market. Whales have also shown increased activity, adding on average 800K ETH per day for the previous week, while only 16K new ETH are produced each week. Whales are showing unprecedented levels of accumulation, boosting the narrative of a long-awaited price breakout. ETH exchange reserves remain scarce, at around 19M tokens. ETFs are also actively buying, with BlackRock recently absorbing the stake sold by Grayscale. ETH is also becoming attractive to corporate buyers as a collateral asset. The Ethereum network also awaits a new upgrade , which could further scale and speed up transactions. Despite the relatively high price compared to other networks, Ethereum remains a key platform for DeFi. Based on smart contract activity, the network’s main use cases are ETH transfers, while USDT and USDC remain some of the busiest smart contracts. ETH remains undervalued with volatile trading The current status of ETH is raising expectations for a catch-up rally. Trading under $2,500, ETH is seen as undervalued, despite the peak on-chain activity. Transactions have been climbing for Ethereum throughout 2025, reaching a higher baseline, with the occasional day of anomalous record activity. Despite this, the ETH market price remains close to its lows, still crashing after each breakout. In June, ETH failed to reclaim the $3,000 level. The token is down around 5% in June, though Q2 may end with significant net gains. ETH expanded by 31.8% in Q2, mostly driven by the peak gains in May. The multiple bullish factors for ETH are still not enough to spark a more decisive rally. In June, there is still an expectation for a breakout, where ETH can rally as high as $10,000. Even without a rally, Ethereum has shown it is not a dead chain. Recently, the network drew in over $334M in daily net inflows from bridges, as value returned to the biggest liquidity hub.

The initial lawsuit was filed by Pomerantz LLP on May 16. However, four other law firms — Gross Law Firm, Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check and Levi & Korsinsky — have opted to file separate lawsuits with similar content rather than join the lawsuit. That’s not unusual, legal experts say. “In class-action securities litigation, law firms compete for the lead counsel role because that role can be very lucrative, with fees in the tens of millions of dollars,” said Adam Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump Comments on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Each of the lawsuits alleges that the company made “materially false and misleading” statements about the profitability and risks of Bitcoin investments between April 30, 2024 and April 4, 2025. Professor Ann Lipton of the University of Colorado School of Law similarly emphasized the importance of the lead plaintiff position, saying, “The lead plaintiff controls the litigation and determines the class attorneys. In cases that appear to be strong, many firms and plaintiffs file lawsuits to try their luck.” Law firms looking to get ahead in the litigation process are issuing public press releases inviting more investors to join the case. These statements often draw attention to the July 15 deadline, when the court will choose a lead plaintiff and the other cases will be consolidated under that umbrella. The primary goal of law firms, Pritchard says, is to include the most harmed investor among their plaintiffs. The Securities Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requires that the lead plaintiff role be given to the investor who suffered the most harm and volunteered to take on that role. Lipton sums it up this way: “An investor who has had more losses will monitor the case and the lawyers more carefully. That’s why institutional investors are generally preferred.” *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents A fresh meme powerhouse on the rise Why Dogecoin’s crown is suddenly in question The mechanics behind little Pepe’s ascent Community vibes and the $777k giveaway Navigating the presale: A guide for aspiring frog kings What comes after the presale? Betting on the next meme era Memecoins have a habit of sneaking up on even the savviest investors. Bliink, and suddenly, what was “just a joke” has become a serious contender to the throne. Dogecoin (DOGE) may have pioneered the space, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) rode the second wave, but a newcomer is stealing the spotlight, and it’s priced well under one cent. Meet Little Pepe (LILPEPE), the memecoin that’s defying expectations and raising eyebrows in equal measure. You might also like: 5 coins under $10 that might pump big if BTC soars to $150,000 A fresh meme powerhouse on the rise In the crowded memecoin market, it takes more than funny images to stand out. Little Pepe isn’t relying on nostalgia alone; it’s built on a Layer-2 blockchain designed specifically for meme culture. That means every transaction is almost instantaneous, fees are near zero, and the network resists the kinds of sniper-bot exploits that plague so many launches. It’s a technical foundation that gives LILPEPE a legitimacy most meme tokens only dream of. The presale journey tells the tale. After two lightning-fast initial stages, LILPEPE’s presale is now in its third round and still open. Over $1.87 million has poured in so far, a testament to the demand brewing behind the scenes. With the token sitting at just $0.0012, early buyers are looking at an entry point that most only get to brag about afterward. Why Dogecoin’s crown is suddenly in question Dogecoin owes its success to simplicity, community, and the power of celebrity tweets, but it’s not without limitations. It suffers from network congestion during peak demand, and fees, while low, aren’t negligible when DeFi activity ramps up. Little Pepe takes a different approach. It brings meme tokens into the realm of robust blockchain engineering, delivering low-cost transactions and ultra-fast confirmation times. That technical edge, married with an ever-growing community of meme enthusiasts, suggests LILPEPE could capture attention and capital that might otherwise flow into DOGE. The mechanics behind little Pepe’s ascent Behind the playful frog imagery lies a carefully crafted token economy. Half of all LILPEPE tokens are allocated to presale participants, while liquidity and reserve funds ensure the project can scale responsibly. There’s no tax on buys or sells, allowing momentum to flow freely from wallet to wallet. And with a dedicated marketing allocation poised to unleash viral memes, outrageous influencer content, and maybe even a billboard in Times Square, Little Pepe is choreographing its legend. Community vibes and the $777k giveaway No memecoin thrives without a passionate crowd, and Little Pepe’s community is anything but quiet. Across Telegram, Discord, and Twitter, holders swap their dankest creations, cheer on presale milestones, and share dreams of green candles. That energy has fueled a $777,000 giveaway, where ten fortunate winners will each claim $77,000 worth of LILPEPE. It’s a headline-grabbing stunt, but it’s also a clever way to distribute tokens to engaged users who will keep the buzz alive. Navigating the presale: A guide for aspiring frog kings Buying into Little Pepe’s presale is surprisingly straightforward and crucially, still possible as the project cruises through stage three. First, there’s a need for a crypto wallet compatible with Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund it with ETH or USDT, then head to the official LILPEPE website. Connect the wallet, choose the number of tokens (remembering the current price of $0.0012), and confirm the transaction. Moments later, the new LILPEPE tokens will be in the wallet, along with the sense of being part of something that could rewrite memecoin history. What comes after the presale? When the dust settles on LILPEPE’s presale stages, the token will list on Uniswap and at least two major centralized exchanges, paving the way for increased liquidity en route to toppling Dogecoin. Furthermore, the developers aim to deploy a meme launchpad that allows users to create new memecoins on Little Pepe’s chain, an innovation that could cement LILPEPE’s place at the center of future meme revolutions. Looking further ahead, Little Pepe’s architects envision integration with NFT platforms and DeFi tools, turning the network into a true playground for digital culture. If that vision materializes, LILPEPE could do more than dethrone Dogecoin, it could redefine what it means to be a memecoin in a world that increasingly values utility alongside humor. Betting on the next meme era In crypto, timing is everything. The chance to buy into Dogecoin at fractions of a penny is long gone; Shiba Inu’s early investors ride on margins that newcomers can only envy. But with Little Pepe still under the $0.01 mark and its presale moving through its third stage, the window is wide open for anyone who wants in on the ground floor. So, is now a good time to invest in Little Pepe? Inventors who believe that the spirit of memes and the rigor of blockchain can coexist and thrive, then the countdown to the Golden Meme Age might already be underway. The frog that leaps first may very well catch the moon. To learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website , Telegram , and X .

That figure is the highest monthly net growth in coins sitting untouched for more than six months, meaning they’ve now officially crossed into Long-Term Holder (LTH) status. And it’s not some bear-market bargain hunting either. These coins were bought when Bitcoin was trading between $95,000 and $107,000, with spot prices still holding above $100,000 today. The term “LTH” can get tricky. It’s not about addresses, it’s about the coin age. The moment a coin stays put for over 180 days, it’s categorized as long-term. So this isn’t just whales parking coins. It’s about how long those coins sit there, untouched. What we’re seeing now is a kind of quiet lock-in, with investors holding harder than they ever have before. This exact kind of accumulation spike has only shown up six times in Bitcoin’s 15-year history. ETFs and dolphins buy as megawhales back off Since May 9, Bitcoin has barely moved, sticking to a $10,000 range, even with a brief jump near $112,000, just above its previous high. That rally didn’t last. And it wasn’t for lack of interest. Over the last month, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.5 billion across 12 straight trading sessions, making it their ninth week of inflows out of the last 11. But while the ETFs were stacking, the price barely moved. Why? Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, explained it bluntly: “There is this change of ownership happening. We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets.” In other words, the big early holders — the megawhales — are selling. But they’re doing it slowly, waiting for institutions like ETFs and corporate treasuries to absorb the supply. Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s research chief, said the real power buyers this year are wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a group CryptoQuant calls dolphins. ETFs likely fall into that bracket. These aren’t retail investors or megawhales. They’re institutions spreading coins across many wallets. BlackRock, for example, operates around 550 wallets, averaging 1,290 BTC each. Strategy — the firm formerly known as MicroStrategy — controls 490 wallets, averaging 927 BTC each, based on 10x Research’s breakdown. Despite looking like mid-sized holders, these companies have stacked thousands of Bitcoin through their network of smaller wallets. Julio said, “In reality, these entities are in fact large holders, having purchased thousands of Bitcoin.” Chinese miners sit on five million coins as whales manage exit Meanwhile, the biggest Bitcoin holders ever, the early Chinese mining operations, are still in the picture. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate, creating as much as 15 million BTC. Today, they still sit on at least five million of those coins. In every previous bull run, those dormant wallets would start dumping onto exchanges. Not this time. Thielen pointed out that these older wallets are only letting go of what ETFs and companies like Strategy are ready to take. “This time, so far, it seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many Bitcoins as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” he said. Still, not everyone’s buying like they were in 2024. Strategy has slowed its acquisition pace, thanks to tighter stock premiums and more competition from other companies moving Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. They’re still the biggest public buyer, but they’re not pushing as hard right now. The whale cohorts — wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC — and the megawhales holding more than that, have been net sellers in 2025. Retail wallets, those with less than 1 BTC, are also offloading. But as long as the dolphins keep buying faster than the whales sell, the market holds steady. If that flips, things stall out. “The imbalance creates a slight bearish bias,” Thielen said. “Making a breakout unlikely without a clear shift in our tactical flow indicator. Until that signal improves, consolidation is expected to continue.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-27 19:50:25

This rally is being fueled by a convergence of macroeconomic forces, regulatory certainty, and a rising euro, laying the groundwork for the euro to take on the dollar's dominance in the digital asset ecosystem. Strength of Euro and Contrasting Monetary Policy Drive Demand The euro has appreciated by a whopping 12.88% against the U.S. dollar year to date, reaching its highest since 2021. A lot of this currency appreciation is due to the aggressive tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) compared to the more relaxed approach of the Federal Reserve in the face of sustained fears of inflation. The result? Investors and institutions alike are being forced to seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar, driving demand for euro-backed digital assets and stablecoins. Market watchers say the move is part of a broader ”Sell America” trend as money flows out of U.S. assets and into Bitcoin, the euro, and gold. Top macro strategist Jens Nordvig cites rising demand for BTC and EUR call options as a sign that investors are protecting themselves against USD volatility and going long on the euro's ongoing strength. This macroclimate has laid rich soil for euro-denominated stablecoins, which are being used more and more as a store of value and transactional currency in DeFi and cross-border payments. EURC Pioneers the Way: Historic Growth and Multi-Chain Growth Circle's EURC stablecoin paces the way, with supply increasing 138% to over $200 million in market value during the first half of 2025. EURC has become the largest euro stablecoin, getting picked up quickly on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. On-chain activity is taking off: active accounts for EURC are up 66% to 22,000, and monthly transfer volume has grown 47% to over $2.5 billion. While still overshadowed by USDC and USDT, EURC's activity is forthcoming—especially since euro stablecoins have now begun to represent an expanding share of the $230 billion global stablecoin market. Other euro-backed tokens, such as Stasis EURS and Tether's EURT, are also picking up once more, but Circle's regulatory alignment and MiCA compliance made EURC the go-to token for institutions and DeFi protocols. EURC is already heavily adopted on lending platforms like Aave, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve, and as collateral for new euro-denominated DeFi products. MiCA Rules The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rule by the European Union is a key stimulant for euro stablecoin growth. MiCA has stringent standards for issuer licensing, transparency, and reserves, guaranteeing investors that euro-denominated tokens are secure and in line. The European Commission is expected to affirm stablecoins created outside the EU will be treated as equivalent to the licensed ones in the EU, also opening doors to global adoption. While the ECB has warned that stablecoins pose a threat to traditional banks during stress conditions, markets embrace MiCA's ease. Euro stablecoins are therefore becoming more seen as a regulated, safe haven for retail and institutional buyers alike—especially with euro-denominated DeFi rails expanding and an increasing number of protocols backing EURC and its cousins. Can the Euro Be Crypto's Second Reserve? While they are increasing rapidly, euro stablecoins are still below 1% of all stablecoins worldwide, light-years behind USD-backed giants. But with the revival of the euro, MiCA regulatory clarity, and increasing demand for non-dollar-denominated assets, the time is now right for the euro to become crypto's second reserve currency. Market observers expect more innovation in euro-denominated DeFi, payments, and cross-border settlements with EURC and its rivals poised to take a larger slice of the digital money economy. Bottom Line The meteoric surge of the euro stablecoin market to $500 million is more than a news ticker headline—it's a harbinger of new global finance. With MiCA regulations kicking in and the euro growing in strength, euro-backed stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular as a solid contender to the dollar, poised to reshape the future of digital money and DeFi in Europe and beyond.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-27 19:53:37

This setup historically leads to strong upside.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Bitcoin Vector goes on to note that the crypto king has been outperforming Ethereum ( ETH ) – the second-largest digital asset by trading volume – over the last year, meaning that ETH is now “undervalued and under-owned” and in “catch-up mode.” “Over the past year, BTC outperformed ETH massively: BTC rose +74% while ETH fell -28% But that strength has come at a cost BTC’s dominance is stretched, while ETH is now under-owned, undervalued, and in catch-up mode.

According to Bloomberg , the exchange designated Kakaopay as an “investment risk” due to extreme volatility, but the underlying cause runs much deeper than simple market mechanics. Over the past month, shares had tripled in value as markets bet heavily on South Korea’s evolving digital asset regulations, which created an opportunity window for established payment companies. Source: YahooFinance The dramatic selloff resulted from the growing tension between market enthusiasm for stablecoin opportunities and mounting regulatory concerns about the risks to financial stability. Stablecoin Fever Grips Korean Markets The excitement began earlier this month when South Korea’s Democratic Party proposed legislation that would allow local companies to issue won-pegged stablecoins. South Korea’s Democratic Party launches a Digital Asset Committee, aiming to put crypto regulation under the next president’s control. #southkorea #regulation https://t.co/p8xJDmqFoZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 13, 2025 Kakaopay recently filed 18 trademark applications related to digital currency services. The filing created widespread speculation that the company was positioning itself to become a major player in South Korea’s anticipated won-pegged stablecoin market. The company joins a growing list of Korean financial institutions racing to secure stablecoin-related intellectual property, including KB Kookmin Bank, Hana Bank, and internet-only Kakao Bank. This broader crypto-linked stock rally swept across multiple companies, with KakaoBank touching three-year highs before regulatory warnings triggered sharp reversals.

However, Thursday’s sharp correction has halted the trend, and companies are now taking their steps cautiously. Regulatory Reality Check Decreases Optimism Bank of Korea Governor Lee Chang-yong dampened investor enthusiasm by warning about the risks associated with won-pegged stablecoins. The Bank of Korea, South Korea’s central bank, is still lukewarm on proposals to launch a won stablecoin despite a recent meeting with the USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle. #SouthKorea #Stablecoins #USDC https://t.co/qPwbqgvtFg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The central bank governor warned that domestic stablecoins could paradoxically increase demand for dollar-denominated alternatives, complicating foreign exchange operations. The Bank for International Settlements separately questioned whether stablecoins can truly replace traditional money, calling their future role “unclear” despite the rapid growth of the sector. South Korea’s regulators are not isolated from these challenges. It is a global tension that policymakers worldwide are grappling with, as they are actively exploring ways to create a sustainable oversight framework for stablecoins.

The Sei ( SEI ) price was up 12% at the time of writing on June 27, 2025, hovering above $0.28 after bouncing off support at $0.25. The cryptocurrency’s value touched highs of $0.30, and while profit-taking has slightly pulled buyers back, momentum suggests they are poised to eclipse this mark. Sei reached highs of $0.33 on June 25, 2025, its highest level in a month. As top altcoins shed gains or struggle, SEI is currently trading more than 42% higher over the last 30 days.

Sei is trending as one of the top two best-performing altcoins in the past 24 hours among the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Pudgy Penguin ( PENGU ), which has gained by more than 14% in the same period as of writing, tops then Sei. The price of PENGU is riding spot exchange-traded funds euphoria after Canary Capital filed its Form S-1 registration for the Canary PENGU ETF. The filing proposes an exchange-traded product that would invest in a portfolio comprising the PENGU token and Pudgy Penguins non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, PENGU is only up 15% in the past week and remains down 14% over the past 30 days. Like Pudgy Penguins, Sei is also riding optimism around spot crypto ETFs. Analysts recently said the odds of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving most of the crypto ETF filings in 2025 are high. Solana, Litecoin, XRP, and Cardano are each said to have a 95% chance. The SEI community is similarly upbeat that the SEC will greenlight the Canary SEI ETF, which the asset manager recently filed. Additional bullish sentiment comes from stablecoin traction, with Wyoming selecting Sei for the issuance of its WYST stablecoin. SEI hit its all-time high of $1.14 in March 2024.

After briefly falling below $100k as tensions escalated in the Middle East, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered to over $105,000. One of the factors that has allowed Bitcoin (BTC) to remain relatively stable throughout the conflict is the growing institutional interest in BTC. US-traded Bitcoin Spot ETFs have seen continued inflows, which signals that investor confidence remains high. Amid the upbeat mood in the crypto sector, investors are looking for options for massive gains. One of the options that has gained mass attention so far is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is currently in the presale phase, where it has enjoyed a lot of success. According to analysts, this could be one of the leading projects for explosive growth in 2025, based on the results of the ongoing presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. The price is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. These gradual increases are expected to continue until the final listing price of $0.06. In the upcoming phase 6, the price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. One of the reasons for the massive success of the presale is the expected beta launch of the Mutuum Finance platform on day one of the token listing. This beta launch will boost organic mentions of MUTM tokens and could push the price to new highs. It will boost interest in the project overall and lead to a rush to secure tokens before the live launch of the platform. According to analysts, this could cause the price of MUTM tokens to rise by 4,300%. Based on that forecast, a $1,900 investment in the current phase of the presale could grow to over $81,000. That is a massive return that investors in phase 5 of the presale are keen to secure. With tokens currently available at a 50% discount, this presents the best time to get your tokens. CertiK Partnership The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is highly focused on the security of its protocol. In line with efforts to ensure the best security possible, the team submitted the code for a CertiK audit. They passed the audit, and they have a token Scan Score of 95 on CertiK. On top of the audit, the team has sought to partner with CertiK to ensure the continuous security of the protocol, long after it goes live. This partnership has taken the form of a Bug Bounty Program. The program will have a $50,000 pot set aside to reward bug hunters. To ensure fairness, the program has been split into four tiers of severity. These are critical, major, minor, and low, with those that identify the most critical vulnerabilities getting the rewards. By adding CertiK as a key partner in the development and maintenance of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, it will boost trust in MUTM tokens. Additionally, it will serve to reassure potential protocol users that it is safe. These factors combined could make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the biggest DeFi platforms by user numbers when it goes live. Details Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol where users can participate as lenders, liquidators, or borrowers. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pool and earn interest, while borrowers can obtain loans by depositing overcollateralized collateral. The level of overcollateralization is determined by protocol parameters, chief amongst them the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Each asset accepted for use on the protocol is assigned its own unique LTV, based on factors that include its liquidity and volatility. The more volatile an asset is, for example, the more conservative an LTV it will be assigned. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem does not require individual loan matching. Instead, it is based on collective pools with the associated borrowings and collateral. Interest rates on the protocol for both borrowers and lenders are determined automatically by market conditions. When there is a high proportion of funds being actively borrowed in a pool, the interest rate goes up. This process ensures that there is optimal capital efficiency. To ensure that liquidity on the protocol is protected, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has placed various safeguards in place. These include address screening and asset screening. When it comes to address screening, the project will rely on a third-party service, which will check all addresses before they join the protocol. In terms of asset screening, various checks will be performed. They include checking the validity of a token’s price oracle, its centralization, volatility, and liquidity. The checks will be performed on listed assets as well, and if they fall below safe levels, a token may be delisted, or its use paused until the issue can be investigated. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2025. With a massive 50% discount on offer for buyers in the current phase, this could represent your best opportunity to make returns of 43x or higher when the MUTM tokens go live.

Here’s Why Smart Investors Say Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is This Year’s Best Bet For Such Returns,https://timestabloid.com/didnt-catch-ripples-xrp-100x-heres-why-smart-investors-say/,"Ripple’s incredible 100x price surge remains one of the most talked-about success stories in cryptocurrency history. But for those who missed that boat, there’s good news. Analysts are pointing to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as 2025’s most promising contender for delivering similar returns. Offering a utility-first approach , structured growth plan , and early investor bonuses , Ruvi AI is quickly becoming the go-to for investors aiming to capitalize on massive gains. With over $2 million raised , 170 million tokens sold , and 1,700+ holders , Ruvi AI’s rapid ascent proves its potential to rival Ripple’s trajectory. Here’s what makes this project such a strong pick. Why Ruvi AI Could Deliver Ripple-Like Returns While Ripple focuses on streamlining cross-border payments, Ruvi AI’s strength lies in its AI-driven applications across essential industries such as marketing , entertainment , and finance . This real-world utility ensures that demand for Ruvi AI will grow based on its innovative value, not hype.

At its current $0.015 Phase 2 presale price , Ruvi AI offers a highly affordable entry point. The token’s value is guaranteed to rise to $0.07 following the presale , giving early adopters an almost 5x return . The long-term potential is what’s truly exciting. Analysts forecast Ruvi AI will reach a $1 valuation shortly after its listing , resulting in a 66x ROI for presale buyers. For those taking advantage of VIP Bonuses, the profit potential can stretch well beyond 100x. Maximize Earnings With VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers reward early participants with bonus tokens, creating even more lucrative opportunities for returns.

These tiers amplify returns for investors willing to secure their allocation early, making them a smart choice for maximizing gains.

Ruvi AI, in contrast, has taken proactive steps to instill trust and transparency in its ecosystem. The project completed a rigorous third-party audit by CyberScope , ensuring the safety and reliability of its smart contracts. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity , giving investors seamless access to trading their tokens after listing. This laser focus on security ensures Ruvi AI provides a safer investment environment. Why Experts Are Betting on Ruvi AI Ripple’s explosive growth was fueled by its innovative solutions and strategic execution. Analysts now see Ruvi AI following a similar path. Starting at a low presale price of $0.015 per token , with a guaranteed increase to $0.07 after presale and a projected rise to $1 , Ruvi AI offers unparalleled ROI potential.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the country’s largest mortgage liquidity providers, has issued a directive that could change how digital assets are viewed. Under this directive, mortgage liquidity providers have been officially ordered to begin preparations for considering cryptocurrencies as part of a borrower’s asset portfolio during mortgage evaluations. Crypto As Mortgage-Eligible Asset In a recent post on the social media platform X, FHFA Director Bill Pulte issued a directive instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare proposals that allow homebuyers to count cryptocurrency holdings held on US-regulated exchanges as part of their asset reserves for mortgage applications without converting them into dollars. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor’s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Crypto assets have always been excluded from mortgage risk assessments unless converted to U.S. dollars before closing. However, this recent move breaks that barrier. This policy shift aligns with former President Donald Trump’s campaigns to establish the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Pulte, who was recently sworn in as the 5th Director of U.S. Federal Housing FHFA in March 2025, is now part of those taking steps to make this vision a reality. According to the order, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must also factor in market volatility and enforce strong risk-based adjustments before implementing the new assessment method. Fannie and Freddie are government-sponsored enterprises that do not issue mortgages themselves but play an important role in the housing market by purchasing home loans on the secondary market and setting the criteria for the loans they are willing to acquire. Bitcoin To Benefit The Most, But Where Does XRP Stand? Bitcoin is going to benefit the most from this policy update. Being the largest and most widely held cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has long been considered the digital gold standard, which makes it a natural candidate for institutional recognition. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ Its established presence on U.S.-regulated exchanges and deep liquidity profile through Spot Bitcoin ETFs tick nearly every box laid out in the FHFA’s directive. However, the decision raises an important question for XRP holders as to whether the same regulation will be extended to XRP. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP has had a complicated history with regulatory agencies in the US, most notably the SEC. Although recent legal clarity around XRP has allowed the crypto to resume trading on major US-based exchanges, it isn’t really certain whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be quick to include it under this new directive. Nonetheless, the FHFA’s directive doesn’t specify eligible tokens. It simply refers to cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated exchanges. As such, the directive could be quick to include US-based cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum alongside Bitcoin. Other countries are already far ahead with XRP in real estate. In Japan, for instance, Open House Group allows XRP payments for property purchases in cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Dubai is also using the XRP Ledger to tokenize real estate.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Play Advances The disclosure came in response to a question about the execution of President Donald Trump’s March 6 executive order on digital assets. Hines explained that “the EO… mandated an accounting to take place in which the Treasury [is] spearheading that,” noting that the department has now “received the numbers from the different agencies inside of the government.” Those numbers reflect coins accumulated piecemeal over the past decade through criminal forfeitures, civil penalties, and unspent research allocations across multiple departments. Describing the next phase, Hines told lawmakers that “there are a lot of different actors that held on to some Bitcoin and in some fashion or another,” adding that “now the process begins in establishing the reserve, the actual infrastructure behind it, and getting all of that accomplished.” Hines stressed that publication of the full audit is optional: “There’s nothing in the EO that mandates that that report become public, but we could choose to make it public at some point.” The administration’s strategic intent is unambiguous. “We’ve stated publicly that Bitcoin is digital gold,” Hines said, repeating language he has used since early March. “We believe it’s in the best interest of the United States to garner as much as we can possibly get.” That ambition, he added, must be squared with the order’s fiscal guard-rails: “Obviously this has to be done in budget-neutral ways that don’t cost the taxpayer a dime. The president was clear about that in the executive order.” Hines, gesturing to the two senators beside him, struck an optimistic note with regards to acquiring Bitcoin in a budget-neutral way: “I think we have some very creative minds, two of which are sitting up here with me, and I think we’ll begin moving very quickly on that.” GENIUS First, CLARITY Next, Bitcoin Last Finding those budget-neutral mechanisms now falls to Capitol Hill. Senator Lummis reminded colleagues that the House-passed GENIUS Act —covering stablecoins—should reach the president for signing in July, while a Senate draft of a broader market-structure bill “is on track before the August recess,” with Banking Committee markup set for the first week of September. Via X, “Crypto Czar” David Sacks confirmed : “Thank you to Senate Banking Committee Chair Senator Tim Scott and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Senator Lummis for announcing a clear timeline and plan for comprehensive crypto market structure legislation: Bill introduced before August recess, Mark up first week of September, Done by end of September. President Trump supports CLARITY on market structure as well as GENIUS on stablecoins. Let’s get this done! July will be a big month, with a bill signing for GENIUS, and CLARITY going to the Senate!” Previously, Lummis made clear that the forthcoming bills on stablecoins and broader market structure would reach Congress before lawmakers take up the proposed Bitcoin Accumulation Act, which would authorize additional federal purchases of BTC.

Top traders from Investors from XRP and Ethereum Seek Higher Returns in This Crypto Targeting Major ROI in 2025. As XRP and Ethereum navigate market uncertainty and regulatory hurdles, savvy investors are seeking new opportunities for significant returns — and many are landing on MAGACOIN FINANCE . Touted as the “#1 coin to buy in 2025,” this rising altcoin has attracted over 20,000 community members and more than 5,000 early backers, signaling a shift in capital toward higher-upside crypto plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The High-Growth Contender While XRP and ETH consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. Still in its presale phase, this altcoin boasts analyst projections of 25x–30x gains—and possibly over 5000% for early investors. Built on strong tokenomics with a capped supply, burn mechanisms, and an audited smart contract, the project is structured for sustainability and investor trust. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its hybrid of viral narrative appeal and real DeFi utility. A high-APY staking program is set to launch soon, offering extra incentives for early adopters. Its community is growing rapidly, with a strong online presence driving awareness and hype. XRP and ETH: Strong Fundamentals, Slower Momentum XRP recently dropped to around $2.10, marking a 5% decline amid selling pressure. Despite whale accumulation and eased geopolitical concerns, bearish technical patterns like a double top and rising wedge breakdown have curbed its rally. Although long-term sentiment is still bullish—fueled by SEC settlement, ETF momentum, and growing retail interest—short-term risks remain, especially if XRP falls below key support at $1.94. Ethereum is showing signs of recovery, trading between $2,450 and $2,550. Bullish signals include strong whale accumulation and a record streak of ETF inflows. Yet, the third quarter has historically been weak for ETH, and technical resistance near $2,600 could stall gains. Recent macro volatility and cautious sentiment are keeping price action in check. Why Investors Are Making the Shift MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefiting from capital rotation out of more mature tokens like XRP and Solana. With Solana facing technical slowdowns and XRP still awaiting full regulatory clarity, MAGACOIN’s early-stage status and bullish sentiment present an appealing alternative for those seeking asymmetric risk/reward opportunities. Final Thoughts As legacy assets like XRP and Ethereum stabilize, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly positioning itself as the breakout altcoin of 2025. Backed by strong fundamentals, a passionate community, and bullish forecasts, it’s capturing the attention of investors eager for explosive growth in the next market cycle.

46907696,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72791,1751054437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says XRP Is About to Explode. Here’s the Bullish Indicator,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-about-to-explode-heres-the-bullish-indicator/,"XRP appears to be on the verge of a major breakout, according to widely followed crypto analyst and chartist STEPH IS CRYPTO. In a recent post on X, he shared a compelling chart pattern showing XRP locked in a familiar consolidation phase, a symmetrical triangle, that has historically preceded explosive moves. Symmetrical Triangle: A Pre-Breakout Pattern Symmetrical triangles are classic continuation patterns in technical analysis. They form when price action tightens between converging trendlines, typically signaling a period of indecision before a breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend. For XRP, that trend has been bullish since late 2024. STEPH IS CRYPTO highlights two such patterns on the XRP chart. The first, seen around Q3–Q4 2024, ended with a massive rally that took XRP from below $0.50 to over $2.00 within weeks. The current pattern, forming between March and June 2025, shows striking similarities in both structure and sentiment. #XRP IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE! pic.twitter.com/5TDuotmyG5 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 27, 2025 In the image shared, the analyst humorously captions the chart with: “Frustration: 100%, Anger: 100%, Patience: 0%”, capturing the emotional state of many traders. This level of frustration is often a hallmark of markets just before a major move, as prices compress and volatility vanishes. Market Conditions and Broader Momentum Beyond technicals, XRP’s potential breakout is supported by improving macro and crypto market conditions. Regulatory clarity is slowly emerging in the United States and globally, providing a more stable framework for institutions to enter the space. As this shift unfolds, confidence in digital assets is rising. XRP, in particular, is regaining the attention of investors who see it as undervalued compared to other top-tier cryptocurrencies. Its recent price resilience and well-defined chart structure make it an attractive candidate for a breakout trade. With other major assets either consolidating or retracing, XRP’s setup is beginning to stand out. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technicals Match Sentiment On the 4-day Binance chart, XRP is visibly coiled within a tightening triangle, signaling low volatility and increasing pressure. The price currently hovers between $1.60 and $2.20. If the breakout mimics the previous pattern, XRP could target $3 in the short term , with some analysts projecting $5 to $6 under optimal conditions. Historically, XRP has shown a tendency to surge rapidly once it breaks out of compression zones. Volume and momentum are the final pieces needed to trigger such a move. Traders are watching closely as the pattern nears its apex. As frustration peaks and patience wears thin, XRP may be on the brink of another powerful rally. STEPH IS CRYPTO’s analysis points to a familiar and highly reliable pattern, supported by broader market improvements and growing investor interest. If history repeats, XRP could soon break free from its current range, and the move might be bigger and faster than many expect.

On Thursday, the company revealed that it had received nearly 300,000 orders for its new YU7 electric SUV within just one hour of its launch. Xiaomi’s success with the SU7 and the ongoing explosive response to the YU7 seem to spell bad news for Tesla’s sales in Asia’s largest economy. “We will not accept defeat,” Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s CEO, said during the YU7 launch. “We’re officially taking up Tesla’s long-standing challenge to compare products head-to-head.” The vehicle is currently priced at around $35,000, significantly less expensive than Tesla’s Model Y , which starts at $36,760. Xiaomi receives 300,000 YU7 orders on launch day Xiaomi’s SUV isn’t just a cheaper alternative to the Model Y. Analysts have praised the vehicle’s strong specs and stated that its local brand power and integration with Xiaomi’s digital ecosystem make it uniquely positioned to disrupt the current market dynamic. “The new Xiaomi is probably Tesla’s largest threat so far, not only in China but globally. It’s very competitive and appealing,” Felipe Muoz, the global analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a statement to Business Insider. According to Bill Russo, the CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility, Xiaomi isn’t just selling cars. “They’re not just an EV company,” Russo told Bloomberg TV. “They’re creating a fully integrated digital ecosystem… which resonates very, very well in China, the world’s biggest digital economy.” The firm’s “smartphone mindset” positions these vehicles as extensions of the tech products Xiaomi users already know. With over 600 million Xiaomi smart devices currently in use around the globe, the company has a unique advantage in syncing its car offerings with its other consumer electronics. “They recognize this opportunity, they entered it, and in one year with one model, they’re outselling Tesla in China,” Russo added. The first model of the electronic vehicle, the SU7 launched in 2024, and was widely praised. Ford’s CEO described it as “fantastic,” and Business Insider reported that it “shouldn’t drive this well given it’s from a company that had not produced vehicles before.” Tesla endures sales drops across different markets Xiaomi’s YU7 launch coincides with Tesla’s ongoing rough patch in the Chinese market. Between January and May of 2025, Tesla’s battery electric vehicle sales in the country dropped a staggering 18% year-over-year, according to a Shanghai-based automotive consultancy called ThinkerCar. Meanwhile, Xiaomi’s stock is up 72% year-to-date. BYD also recorded 894,000 EV sales globally during the same period, compared to Tesla’s 603,000. The 291,000 sales deficit is quite significant, as both companies had been in a neck-and-neck global EV race. BYD also overtook Tesla in global revenue in 2024, pulling in $107B, surpassing Tesla’s $97.7B. In April 2025, BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time, with 7,230 battery-electric vehicles sold while Tesla recorded 7,165 sold, according to data compiled by JATO Dynamics. Analyst Felipe Muoz noted that Tesla’s older car models, especially the Model Y, is part of the company’s problem. “It’s about time to get an all-new generation,” Muoz said. “But based on Tesla’s strategy with other models, it doesn’t seem like an all-new Model Y is coming anytime soon.” “The YU7 is one of many strong new entrants, but it won’t mean the defeat of Tesla,” he said. “It will complicate life, but Tesla has already built a reputation for excellent EVs and is a pioneer in the EV industry.” He added that while Tesla still leads on battery specs and software in the U.S. and Europe, it is losing ground fast in China. Russo also suggested that Tesla’s software lead is no longer enough in China. Several media outlets also reported on Thursday that Omead Afshar, Tesla’s VP of Manufacturing and a longtime Elon Musk ally, left the company. Prior to Afshar’s exit, the company also lost another talent as Milan Kovac, who led Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot project, left. “The dismissal of Afshar is part of the game and Tesla’s response to the increasing challenges in China, considering that it can’t react fast from a product point of view,” Muoz commented. “The Model Y is still one of China’s top sellers, but it is not alone anymore.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Capo, tells his 128,716 Telegram subscribers that Solana ( SOL ) is currently testing a resistance level that was previously a support zone. According to Capo, Solana could fall by up to 58% from the current level after failing to break above a level last reached late last month. “After the current dead-cat bounce, it’s now testing another important resistance, which was support before (support/resistance flip). Main target remains $60 to $80.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram Solana is trading at $143 at time of writing, down by around 51% from the all-time high reached in January. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), Capo says the crypto king is facing strong resistance at the level just below $109,000. Based on the pseudonymous analyst’s chart of the one-day time frame, it appears Capo is suggesting that Bitcoin could first fall to a support level around the price of $93,000. Capo also appears to suggest that Bitcoin could capitulate even further and revisit the zone between $60,000 and $70,000, levels last witnessed in October of 2024. “If you think we’ve seen it all… think again.” Source: CryptoCapo/Telegram Bitcoin is trading at $107,197 at time of writing, down by around 4% from the current level.

Micro-futures are smaller in scale than traditional futures contracts, allowing investors to speculate or hedge against asset price movements with lower capital requirements and risk. These products are often preferred for assets such as stock indices, commodities and currencies.

Stellar: Bridging the gap between fiat and blockchain Stellar (XLM) continues to position itself as a vital player in the world of cross-border payments. Originally launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple, Stellar was designed with a clear mission: to connect financial institutions, payment systems, and individuals—especially in underserved regions—through a decentralized, fast, and low-cost blockchain network. Stellar’s native token, XLM, plays a crucial role in this vision. It acts as a bridge currency for transactions and helps prevent spam on the network. With major partnerships over the years—including IBM and MoneyGra — Stellar has built a reputation as a reliable infrastructure for remittances and asset tokenization. Terra Classic: Rising from the ashes of crypto turmoil Terra Classic , known as LUNC, is making waves in the crypto world. Originally part of the Terra blockchain, LUNC emerged after a significant split in 2022. Terra was designed to use stablecoins tied to traditional currencies, like the US dollar and South Korean won, to make global payments stable and fast. It combined the trust of regular money with the security of Bitcoin. In 2019, Terra launched its main network, offering various stablecoins and aiming to add more. In May 2022, a new chain was born, and the original Terra became Terra Classic. Some see this move as similar to Ethereum’s split in 2017. According to CEO Do Kwon, the collapse of Terra’s stablecoin was a pivotal moment. Now, LUNC stands as the native token of Terra Classic. With its unique history and technology, LUNC has potential in today’s market. As stablecoins draw more attention, LUNC could be an interesting option for those watching crypto trends. Compared to other coins, it offers a blend of stability and innovation in the ever-changing crypto landscape. Conclusion XLM and LUNC are promising sub-$1 cryptos with growing communities, but XYZVerse uniquely unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for significant growth and community rewards.
