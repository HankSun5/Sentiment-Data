His prediction has thrilled the XRP community, who are now excited about the potential. However, the analyst has also underlined a new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , with an even better prospect. He insists that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token will yield higher returns than the XRP price, which is poised to reach $28. XRP Price To Touch $28 Soon, Analyst Claims After correctly predicting that the Dogecoin price will surge massively in 2021, the renowned analyst has once again stated that the XRP price is on its way to $28. The Ripple community has welcomed this news with excitement, as the XRP prive touching $28 will yield significant profits for investors. According to data on CoinGecko, the XRP price is $1.46. A potential surge to $28 will transform investors’ finances by 1,845%. Despite the Dogecoin analyst’s prediction, chances of the XRP price touching $28 soon are low, as the altcoin is struggling with spikes and dips. The Dogecoin analyst, however, named an emerging token with a better prospect than the XRP price: WallitIQ (WLTQ). Interestingly, the token is trading at a low price, as it is still in its presale stages. Investors who want higher returns at a low cost are already storming the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. Analyst Claims The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Token Holds Better Prospect Than XRP Price Hitting $28 According to an analyst who predicted the historical Dogecoin price surge, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token holds better prospects than the XRP price hitting $28. The Dogecoin analyst insists that WallitIQ (WLTQ) has the potential to surge by 17,000% in the bull run. This means investors holding the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token could accrue 17,000% profit in the current bull market. Since this prediction, investors have caught FOMO and are rapidly joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. The presale has raised over $1.3 million and is still fast increasing every day. Priced at only $0.0171 per token, investors can still buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token before it sells out. With the demand increasing daily, the presale is poised to sell out in a few days. Beyond its rewarding presale, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) potential lies in its unique features that make storing and transacting cryptocurrencies smooth and easy. As a decentralized crypto wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) allows investors to store their cryptocurrencies without hassle. It is developed with cutting-edge AI technology to create a secure and productive environment for crypto investors and holders. To verify its robust security, SolidProof , a top blockchain audit firm, has audited its smart contract and found no irregularities. Not to mention, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a significant milestone for the Ethereum token. WallitIQ (WLTQ) incorporates Escrow Connect (AI-Einstein) , an inventive security feature that provides top-notch protection for investors’ assets, into its platform. This security feature uses advanced authentication, making sure that every connection between investors’ wallets and dApps or web3 websites is secure. This way, investors’ assets are safe from phishing attempts and malicious activity. Investors are provided with AI-powered smart suggestions on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) crypto wallet. The AI technology analyzes real-time data, offering investors actionable insights to assist them in various tasks. These tasks include selecting the right transaction fees, choosing staking opportunities, deciding when to buy or sell holdings, etc. Final Thoughts While the XRP price surge promises investors a potential return of 1,845%, the new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ), will provide a higher return potential of up to 17,000% on money invested and at a lower cost. Moreover, the analyst is renowned for his accurate predictions in the crypto space, notably his Dogecoin price surge forecast. Consequently, investors who want enormous returns at a low price should buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token now!

Its performance was boosted by its newly launched AI-integrated products, which analysts also cited in optimistic fiscal forecasts for 2025. In late October, the customer relationship management (CRM) software heavyweight launched Agentforce, a suite of autonomous AI agents that augment employees and handle service, sales, marketing, and commerce tasks. Impressive Agentforce outing and positive forecast for 2025 In the early hours of morning trading, Salesforce shares hit $368.7, a record high that resulted in a potential addition of $35 billion to its current market valuation of $316.85 billion. Many analysts raised their price targets because of their confidence in the stock, according to LSEG data. Salesforce stock went up 26% this year, with a new median price target of $380 representing an upside of about 15%. Other US tech company stocks in the cloud space have also seen surges in their stock prices. For example, Oracle saw a 3.2% rise, while ServiceNow gained 3.5%. Others like Datadog and Snowflake both saw a 4% rise. Expectations for Salesforce’s revenue for the 2025 fiscal year have slightly increased by $100 million, increasing to a new range between $37.8 billion to $38 billion compared to its previous forecast of $37.7 billion to $38 billion. The company also beat analyst revenue estimates, which rose to $9.44 billion during the third quarter of this year. While its steady growth continues to impress, analysts expect increasing enterprise adoption of Salesforce’s solutions to help the company to a steady double-digit percentage growth performance. Salesforce enters a competitive autonomous AI agent market With Agentforce, Salesforce enters the race for stakes in the supply of autonomous AI agents that help businesses complete tasks. It enters competition with the likes of Microsoft, and a rivalry is already developing between both companies. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, called out Microsoft in October on X (Twitter) , saying the latter’s Copilot does work and doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. He also added in a press release that Agentforce is the third wave of AI and actively drives customer success. When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it’s disappointing. It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are… — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) October 17, 2024 A week before Agentforce’s release, Microsoft announced that it would be enabling customers to build autonomous AI agents through its Copilot studio in the following month, which was November. So far, Salesforce’s Agentforce seems to have delivered on its promise. Bullish on its early success, Salesforce has gone on to project that its AI product will continue to close more deals as it has already delivered 200 deals since its launch. Other than the success of its Agentforce AI, Salesforce’s high-performing data cloud was another major contributor to the company’s strong quarter. To meet up with increasing demand for Agentforce, Salesforce executives are reportedly planned to hire 1400 new staff members in the fourth quarter.

According to a new report by Fox Business, anonymous sources familiar with the matter say that Trump is considering Boring to take the reins of the regulatory agency, partially due to her ability to be conversant and telegenic in presenting financial topics to the public. Other top contenders for the job include Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham, who both currently serve as Commissioners for the CFTC, as well as Jill Sommers, a former Commissioner of the agency who currently serves as the chief of the derivatives practice group at Patomak Global Partners, according to the report. Neal Kumar, a former special counsel to the CFTC and the current co-head of the commodities and derivatives practice at Willkie Farr and Gallagher, is also in the running. Earlier this year, the Chamber of Commerce – with Boring at its helm – argued that Democratic lawmakers Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown were attempting to take down the crypto industry by proposing bills to make it comply with the same anti-money laundering laws that apply to traditional finance. At the time, Boring penned a letter to Brown asking him to kill the bill. Last year, Boring predicted that Bitcoin ( BTC ) would hit a price tag of $1 million by 2029 if its adoption continued at the rate it was going. According to the CEO, a combination of a spike in demand and a lack of supply will push the crypto king to higher prices during the next few years. Bitcoin is trading for $94,944 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.

While Bitcoin remains relatively flat above the $97K level, the altcoin market is now back in focus among retail traders and analysts, raising expectations of an altseason. According to Google Trends, the search interest for the term “altcoins” hit 100 in early December. This increase is not a steady growth because it has been observed in the course of 2023. In November, searches reached a high of 93 and then declined to 56 mid-month, which coincided with the market’s response to Donald Trump’s announcement of his presidential candidacy and Bitcoin’s record value. In the past, similar search volume surges have pointed to the involvement of the retail investor, an essential component of the cryptocurrency price movements. The last similar peak was observed during the 2016/2017 bull cycle, which means that the cycle of interest in altcoins is repeating when the BTC price is stable. Several other digital assets have come to light as the top performers in the current market cycle. XRP and XLM have each more than quadrupled this month but are still down from their all-time highs. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX) have hit new highs in the market, indicating strong market activities. Altcoin season indicators Crypto analysts are paying attention to these trends in order to determine the general mood in the market. According to Jamie Coutts, the Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, the market dominance of Bitcoin is not the only sign of an altcoin rally. Instead, market breadth, the number of assets trading above their Bitcoin counterparts, paints a different picture. Coutts also notes that the Altseason Indicator, which currently sits at 67%, means that altcoins are in the consolidation phase. However, other analysts, including Daan Crypto Trades, say that the true altcoin season starts when this metric is above 75%. However, the indicator has not reached high enough levels to suggest that the altcoin season has started. The Alt Season Index has been rising at a rapid pace in the past week. It's now sitting at 67, which means that 67% of the top 50 alts outperformed #Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Above 75%+ it's officially labelled as ""Alt Season"". https://t.co/3Z87crI8cx pic.twitter.com/qfHU6dhpSo — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) December 2, 2024 According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the transfer of assets from Bitcoin to altcoins is no longer the main factor that moves the market. Rather, the increase in trading volume of the altcoins is being driven by stablecoin and fiat pairs. He stated, “Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” This futher suggests the shift to real-world application and unique features of the altcoins.

Deaton, a strong critic of the SEC leadership under Gary Gensler, called for changes to make the agency more transparent toward the crypto industry. John Deaton Urges Immediate Reforms at SEC, Calls for Action from Paul Atkins In a recent blog post on X , John Deaton emphasized the urgent need for reform at the SEC, particularly under the leadership of Paul Atkins. Deaton called on Atkins to take decisive action on Day 1, starting with the firing of individuals involved in the Debt Box fiasco. He pointed to the necessity of removing officials who had engaged in misconduct under Gensler’s leadership. Deaton stressed that if Atkins doesn’t take immediate steps to replace certain SEC personnel, it would indicate he was not the right choice for the role. The Pro-XRP lawyer stated, “If Paul Atkins doesn’t fire, or at least demote, certain individuals and completely dismantle – that is, do away with – the crypto unit, he’s not the right pick. Period!” Deaton also highlighted the importance of reshaping the SEC’s leadership to better align with a pro-crypto agenda. He argued that Paul Atkins should not inherit the appointments made by Gensler, stating that a fresh perspective was needed. This includes appointing individuals who can foster a balanced regulatory environment that supports innovation while protecting investors. Deaton’s comments reflect a broader desire for a leadership change within the agency, particularly after Gensler’s tenure. However, earlier on, the XRP lawyer expressed support for the new SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, praising his pro-crypto stance and commitment to reducing regulatory burdens. Deaton emphasized that Atkins’ leadership would restore balance and transparency to the SEC Crypto Unit Dissolution Proposal In his call for reform, John Deaton advocated for the complete disbandment of the SEC’s crypto unit. He argued that the existence of a separate crypto unit was unnecessary and that the SEC should instead operate a general fraud unit that handles all types of fraud. Deaton emphasized that this change would streamline regulatory efforts and prevent overreach by the agency. Deaton also suggested that Paul Atkins make clear on Day 1 that decentralized finance (DeFi) and self-custody should not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. In addition, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed strong support for the new US SEC Chair. Garlinghouse echoed John Deaton’s sentiments regarding the need for clearer regulations and less hostility toward the crypto industry.

The chairman of the Federal Reserve (The Fed), the central bank of the United States, has publicly called Bitcoin ( BTC ) a competitor for gold due to the aspect of preserving the value of money rather than using it as a currency. “It’s just like a gold only it’s virtual. People are not using it as form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold,” Powell mentioned on The New York Times DealBook Summit 2024 posted video on YouTube. He also noted that the growing crypto industry should find a position that is suitable for the conventional banking system, which is his concern, and that it must be safe and supervised. Although the central bank does not regulate crypto directly, Powell aims for the people who are involved in these digital assets to have consumer protections, no matter what the crypto-product they hold. Powell also claimed that he does “not at all” hold any crypto, after being asked by the American journalist and author on that occasion, Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Seasonality and high RSI suggest the coin may be taking a breather. Bitcoin's Dominance in the crypto market has fallen from 60% to 55% in just two weeks. BRRR is currently trading at a very small discount to net asset value. The fund has not benefitted from Grayscale fee flight to the same degree as other spot ETFs. After a four-month rally, the market has taken Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from a low of $49k in early August up to $99.7k in late November. An epic tease, perhaps. With many, myself included, expecting a $100k BTC price, crypto's top coin is taking a breather. Have we already seen the top for this cycle? I have my doubts about that, though I don't think the top is as far away as others seem to believe. But with this recent pullback in the orange coin and another month of on-chain activity in the books, I think it's worth updating readers with how I'm seeing the ball currently. In this article, we'll look at chain usage data, seasonality, market dominance, and assess whether the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BRRR ) is the right financial product for investors who want long-term exposure to BTC. On Chain Data Token Terminal If you'd like to see a picture of 'Gresham's Law' in one chart, the one above might suffice. Since September 2023, Bitcoin's price has surged while monthly active addresses have fallen off a cliff. At 9 million active addresses during the month of November, monthly active addresses (or MAAs) on Bitcoin have fallen by 43% year over year while the price of the coin has nearly tripled. I've made this case ad nauseam at this point, but my personal view is that less people using Bitcoin is only sustainable if average transaction fees remain elevated to counter both the declining usage and the declining coin issuance long term. Otherwise, the hash rate is at risk of collapse as ledger validation loses incentive. Thus, my view is investors are better off if monthly fees trend up. Token Terminal For the month of November, Bitcoin produced $38.3 million in fees. This was a 19.2% decline from the $47.4 million fees produced in October and a 73% decline from the $142.1 million produced from transaction fees in November 2023. The general trend in transactions each month has been higher going back to January. That said, there was a 21% MoM decline in November as Bitcoin processed 16.1 million transactions - down from 20.5 million in October. November 2024 transactions were also slightly behind the 16.4 million in November 2023. Token Terminal The average transaction fee was essentially flat month over month from $2.38 in October to $2.41 in November. TPS fell month over month from 7.7 to 6.2. All things considered, network usage was down in November by most important metrics. As has been the case for some time, Bitcoin is being used primarily as a fiat hedge rather than as a peer to peer payment network. Of course, none of that means the price of the coin will go down. If anything, it's indicative of a broad crunch on supply. But I believe there are additional factors to consider. Seasonality & Bitcoin Dominance In previous articles for Seeking Alpha, I've noted the terrific historical setup for Bitcoin seasonality in the fourth quarter - particularly in years of and following halving events. October and November have notoriously been terrific months for Bitcoin gains, December is much less clear: TrendSpider Going back the last 11 years, Bitcoin has a 45% chance of delivering a positive return in December. Despite the month generally being a toss up from a gain or loss standpoint, the mean return is 8%, which still makes December a solid month for Bitcoin on paper. But BTC is typically feast or famine in December. Going back to 2011, December has resulted in a single digit percentage return in either direction just 4 times. So it's a 'go big or go home' kind of month historically. TrendSpider We've also seen Bitcoin generate positive returns in each of the last three months between September and November. Bitcoin has actually generated positive returns for four consecutive months starting in September three different times in the past. But I would caution against expecting that to happen again. Bitcoin is very much a part of the traditional investment world now and that puts the coin at risk of profit taking to end the year and the quarter, in my view. Furthermore, judging by indicators like the RSI, there are signs that BTC is technically overbought on several time frames. Exhaustion in the BTC move is potentially why we're seeing so much action in altcoins like XRP ( XRP-USD ). CoinMarketCap 'Alt season' may finally be upon us. Over the last decade, we've seen the general trend in long term 'Bitcoin Dominance' has been down. As calculated by CoinMarketCap.com, Bitcoin Dominance of the $3.45 trillion crypto market cap has fallen from 60% on November 10th down to 55% on December 3rd. If that was indeed the cycle peak for Bitcoin Dominance on 11/10, it would be yet another lower high in the long-term trend dating back the last two halving cycles. The point is, seasonality and Bitcoin Dominance may both be signaling that the better returns from here are in the altcoins rather than in Bitcoin. BRRR In a recent article covering Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, I shared the most recent weekly capital flow data that we have from CoinShares. While the net flow in the final week of November was positive for the broader digital asset investment landscape, Bitcoin was actually down by nearly a half a billion dollars in a single week: Asset ($m) Week Flows MTD Flows YTD Flows Bitcoin -$457 $6,226 $33,912 Ethereum $634 $1,427 $2,198 Multi-asset -$16 -$25 $441 Solana -$4 $40 $110 Binance - $0 -$2 Source: CoinShares, Bloomberg, as of 11/30/24 In spite of the final week of November sales, full-month net flow for Bitcoin was enormously positive at over $6.2 billion. That brings the full-year capital flows to nearly $34 billion for Bitcoin. Despite the clear enthusiasm for this asset from the investment community, the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF has not enjoyed the same level of interest: BitcoinTreasuries With a little over 9k BTC managed by the fund, investors haven't looked to BRRR for Bitcoin allocations to the same degree that they have with other funds like the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) or the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ). There are a few different reasons why there could be relative lack of interest for BRRR, though all of these are just my own speculations. The fund originally launched with a 0.49% expense ratio after waiver expiration. That expense ratio has since been dropped down to 0.25%, which is very much in line with the rest of the market. But it's possible that early fee mispricing soured the market on BRRR. Larger funds are managed by companies like BlackRock ( BLK ), Grayscale, and Fidelity - which may give those ETFs an advantage in areas like product marketing. The fund's original manager, Valkyrie, sold to CoinShares shortly after launch, which may have also contributed to confusion in the market. Again, all of these are just guesses. It's important to keep in mind that smaller funds could potentially produce larger swings in the NAV rate than bigger funds: Data by YCharts So far, we haven't really seen BRRR decouple dramatically from the larger players in the market. That said, at market close on 12/2/24, BRRR shares could be had for a 0.25% discount to NAV, larger than both IBIT and FBTC. Closing Thoughts As far as Bitcoin specifically, I think we're witnessing a small pullback in price that will allow altcoins to have their moment. I suspect there are better gains in select alts from here. That said, I'm of the view that we have not yet seen the peak in BTC for this cycle. I still think we see a BTC price that eclipses the long-awaited six-figure level. There may be better ways to play that possibility as a trade than through BRRR shares. And I'll no doubt explore some of those opportunities in the days and weeks ahead. For long-term investment, BRRR is a fine option since the expense ratio has come down in line with the market. Especially considering the fund trades at a larger discount to NAV than peers. I am not personally long BRRR, but I'll rate it a 'buy' yet again simply on the notion that I suspect Bitcoin will continue higher in 2025.",BTC-USD|BRRR,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-04 23:12:44

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also ready to let local government bodies sell crypto. And it will allegedly follow up by eventually allowing companies to open corporate crypto wallets . Universities to ‘Trade’ Crypto in 2025? The newspaper claimed sources had told it the FSC will release a tentatively named “Roadmap for Allowing Corporations to Open Virtual Asset-Won Accounts” before the end of this year. Critics have accused Seoul of dragging its feet on the matter, allowing American, European, and Japanese companies to steal a march on domestic firms. Many South Korean firms want to use their balance sheets to buy cryptoassets, aware of the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) -buying strategies have helped many overseas firms boost the value of their assets. South Korea's martial law turmoil strains alliance with US https://t.co/bKA1QOfTmd — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 4, 2024 However, South Korean legal conventions do not allow corporations to invest in Bitcoin or other tokens. The FSC reportedly wants to “gradually” roll out regulations that will change that. And the body reportedly wants to begin with universities, schools, and local government bodies. Several major universities have received crypto donations in recent years. But government guidance currently prevents them from selling their coins for cash. There is no law that explicitly bans public bodies and corporations from opening crypto wallet-linked bank accounts. However, regulators have told domestic banks not to accept applications from anyone except private citizens. The FSC document allegedly outlines a “Stage 1” on the roadmap, which will allow “central government ministries, local government bodies, public institutions, other non-profit organizations, and universities” to “trade” crypto. South Korea’s financial markets tumbled on Wednesday following a night of political chaos, as President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law only to withdraw the measure just hours later under pressure from lawmakers. https://t.co/SVXisTSfqp — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 4, 2024 University Wants to Make WEMIX Sale The move will allow universities such as the elite Seoul National University (SNU) to finally sell altcoins they have been holding for years. The domestic gaming firm WeMade donated a large quantity of its WEMIX (WEMIX) token to SNU back in 2022. The university has since repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Education and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to allow it to sell the coins. However, the FSC rejected all of these requests, concerned that it could lead other companies to try to promote their coins by donating them to schools. Experts say they think SNU is currently holding some 800 million won ($566,000) worth of WEMIX. WEMIX prices over the past four years. (Source: CoinMarketCap) The media outlet added that “Stage 2” of the roadmap will focus on crypto exchanges and other crypto-related businesses. An unnamed official explained: “In order to foster the virtual asset industry and increase the effectiveness of regulations, business operations such as issuance, listing, and brokerage should be carried out as if [coins] were stocks or bonds.” “Stage 3” of the roadmap will finally give most private companies the right to buy and sell crypto, although this is listed as a “mid to long-range” goal. Banks Last to Get Green Light? The final two “stages” of the roadmap will see “financial companies,” a group that likely includes banks, granted permission to access the crypto market. However, the newspaper said the FSC was “considering building safety measures” into its regulations. One of these will likely see limits placed on stock exchange-listed companies. These companies will only be allowed to “hold a small percentage of their capital” in crypto. This move, Hanguk Kyungjae wrote, will help “prevent side effects” such as the creation of “Bitcoin-themed stocks.” Crypto speculators kept Bitcoin in sight of the landmark $100,000 level in anticipation of further steps to support the sector by Trump https://t.co/cCfVdAcE07 — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) December 4, 2024 The FSC may find this to be something of an uphill battle. The Korea Exchange is already highly influenced by Bitcoin price fluctuations, with even minor shareholders in unlisted crypto exchanges experiencing high price volatility when crypto news breaks or BTC prices rise . At present, the only South Korean public bodies with fiat-tradable crypto wallets are the Prosecution Service and the National Tax Service. The tax body uses its wallets to liquidate crypto confiscated from (mainly local) tax dodgers . The prosecution mainly uses its wallets to sell the coins of convicted crypto fraudsters.

Choosing the best crypto to join this week can be a game-changer for your portfolio in this dynamic landscape. With major updates from Monero and Avalanche, alongside the exciting presale of Qubetics, there’s a lot to unpack. Monero’s focus on privacy has kept it a favourite among enthusiasts, while Avalanche’s recent price surge has brought it back into the spotlight. But the real star of the moment? Qubetics ($TICS). With its innovative solutions for financial institutions and a presale generating serious momentum, $TICS is positioning itself as a standout opportunity. This article will discuss the latest updates for Monero, Avalanche, and Qubetics, with a special spotlight on why Qubetics might be the best crypto to join this week. From Borders to Breakthroughs: Qubetics Leads the Charge The Qubetics Network is shaking things up in the financial sector by offering banks and institutions a cutting-edge blockchain solution. With $TICS, institutions can execute near-instant cross-border payments , cutting down the delays and high costs associated with traditional methods.

To top it off, Qubetics recently hosted a well-received AMA session , where they shared insights into their vision and roadmap. Want to know more? Dive into the details from their AMA—it’s worth the watch. Monero ($XMR): The Privacy Pioneer’s Latest Move Monero continues to lead the charge as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy-conscious users. With its untraceable transactions and decentralised nature, $XMR has carved out a unique space in the crypto world. Recently, Monero announced enhancements to its stealth addresses, making it even harder to link transactions to individual users. This upgrade reinforces Monero’s commitment to safeguarding financial privacy in an era of increasing surveillance. As debates around privacy and regulation heat up, Monero’s relevance and appeal remain rock solid. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Momentum Keeps Building Avalanche has been making headlines with a significant price surge. Currently trading at $46.34, $AVAX has gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes skyrocketing by 200% to hit $2.07 billion. Investors are optimistic about the coin’s potential to break the $50 mark, driven by whale accumulation and institutional interest. What’s fueling this growth? Avalanche’s scalability and low transaction costs make it a favourite for DeFi applications. As more institutional investors recognise its potential, the demand for $AVAX is expected to climb even higher. 6200+ Holders and Counting: Best Crypto to Join This Week If you’re searching for the best crypto to join this week , Qubetics’ presale is the golden ticket. In Phase 11, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.028, but that won’t last long. Each weekly phase introduces a 10% price hike, culminating in a massive 20% jump in the final stage. Over $4.3 million has already been raised, with 6200+ holders securing 266 million tokens. Here’s the kicker: $TICS is targeting $0.25 per token post-presale. That’s a staggering 783.45% ROI potential for those who act now. Should the token price climb further to $15, as predicted, a $1000 investment would reach an extraordinary $530,173.50, with an ROI of approximately 52,917.35%. With excitement building and the next phase imminent, this presale isn’t just an opportunity—it’s a must-grab for anyone looking to make serious gains. Think about it: in just a few weeks, you could hold a token primed for exponential growth. But the window is closing fast, so don’t wait. Conclusion: Your Next Move in Crypto The crypto market is brimming with opportunities, but picking the best crypto to join this week is crucial. Monero’s privacy innovations and Avalanche’s price momentum offer compelling cases for investors. But Qubetics steals the show with its transformative vision and an electrifying presale that promises unbeatable ROI potential. If you’re serious about maximising your gains and joining a project with groundbreaking utility, Qubetics is the one to watch. With $TICS poised to disrupt financial systems and a presale offering massive rewards, there’s no better time to get in on the action. Don’t just follow the trend—be part of the movement.

Popular blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence indexed the transaction on December 3. Announcing the move on X, Arkham stated: “ALERT: US GOVERNMENT MOVING $1.5 MILLION OF SHIBA INU.” Specifically, the US government transferred 54,897,092,549 SHIB tokens to the Ethereum wallet ‘0x995’. Following the transaction, the sending wallet—associated with the US government—no longer holds any SHIB tokens. The recipient wallet, now with a total crypto portfolio valued at $33 million, has retained the assets. Notably, the US government acquired these SHIB tokens through the seizure of assets from Alameda Research, the trading firm affiliated with the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. This seizure was part of a broader forfeiture action involving more than $700 million in assets due to legal issues surrounding FTX and Alameda. The SHIB tokens were among a variety of digital assets seized during this process. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could Increase 75% If It Holds Current Level – Analyst Shares Price Target Data from Arkham suggests that the recipient wallet was newly created. Its first transaction occurred recently when it received $1.061 million worth of AEGRO tokens from the same wallet that moved the SHIB tokens. Within less than two hours, the wallet also received other crypto assets from the US government-affiliated address, including 4,815 ETH (approximately $17.9 million), 13.58 million BUSD ($133 million), and 631,959 POWR ($221,000). While it remains unclear whether the US government has sold its SHIB holdings, the absence of any identified exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) addresses linked to the transaction suggests that the government may still hold the tokens. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Potential For A 130% Surge? Crypto analyst Rony Kapoor (@LearnRony) shared a comparative chart analysis between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on X, stating: “Next leg up in SHIB will be like DOGE? Shib looks like big Cup & Handle pattern forming like doge before it run turbo. Sooner or later Shiba Inu will pump!!!” The chart for DOGE illustrates a clear “Cup and Handle” formation—a bullish continuation pattern that often precedes a significant price breakout. DOGE’s handle formed near the $0.21 mark, and following a period of consolidation, the token rallied to a peak of approximately $0.48. This move represented a substantial 128% increase from the breakout point. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Similarly, SHIB’s chart indicates the potential formation of a Cup and Handle pattern, with the structure still developing. The current trading price is hovering around $0.000030, with resistance levels identified at $0.000038—the anticipated handle resistance. If SHIB follows a trajectory similar to DOGE, a successful breakout could target a price level around $0.000087, based on the proportional increase observed in DOGE’s previous movement. Technical indicators such as the Fibonacci retracement levels support this analysis. SHIB is currently trading below the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.000032. A break above this level could see SHIB targeting the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.000038. Subsequent targets include the yearly high from March at $0.00004569. Notably, the all-time high of $0.00008854 aligns closely with the projected target from the Cup and Handle pattern identified by Kapoor.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 23:43:00

Ethereum’s price took a battering, while Pepe coin (PEPE) also lost ground. Both are recovering lost price points after a recent rally. Meanwhile, bullish signals for IntelMarkets INTL offer a jump to $0.07 as its Stage 7 concludes. IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making waves with an impressive presale, hinting at a possible surge. Analysts predict that IntelMarkets INTL, a novel AI crypto, will also ride this bullish wave. Its innovative blend of AI and DeFi, which aims to reshape the crypto trading scene, has caught investors’ attention. Tipped to outperform PEPE, the top-performing meme coin, this is a new DeFi project to watch out for. Ethereum (ETH) Price Ready to Close 2024 Over $4,000 ETH is a top altcoin, and the price of Ethereum managed to withstand the bearish markets of last week and sustain its upward momentum. The Ethereum price climbed by 4% in the past seven days but is still trading at above $3,500. With a 32% rise on the monthly chart, it cements its status as one of the top crypto coins. During the year, Ethereum prices touched a high of $4,000. While there has been a major dip since then, the current market sentiments seem likely to push it above this level in the coming days. Seven-day technical indicators like the Hull Moving Average and Momentum are at sell, while the 14-day RSI is at neutral for the short term. Community sentiment is still bullish today but is moving towards bearish at 59%. Source: CoinMarketCap Pepecoin (PEPE) Retraces After Massive Price Rally After its remarkable surge in November, PEPE started dipping, losing over 10% in price over the past week. It has recovered and experienced a rise of 2.8% over the weekend. The coin is still highly volatile, while community sentiment remains bullish. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators like the RSI are mainly neutral for day trading, while 30-day technical indicators are divided between neutral and buy for the coin. People are moving into positions with PEPE, and many are opting to accumulate IntelMarkets (INTL) for its upcoming price pump. Whales’ Find a New Winner: IntelMarkets (INTL) IntelMarkets (INTL) is a new AI crypto that is stirring up a lot of attention. Its current presale is in the news, having raised over $2.7 million. Its major growth potential and cross-AI-DeFi product utility are its core appeals, generating sustained demand. In stage seven of the ICO, a token sells for just $0.064. This low entry makes picking up the INTL token easy, while its projected gains bring whales to the presales. Providing a low entry, the projected 50x gain after its debut makes it a whale favorite—retailers are also doubling down. As it approaches its ICO, investors are betting big and overlooking top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and PEPE. Besides its significant upside potential, INTL’s future transformation of the crypto trading scene with AI puts it in the spotlight. Offering a merger of all the advantages of AI technology, blockchain, and DeFi, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels. Its first commercial application of AI technology with a proprietary Layer-1 blockchain offers access to crypto trading assets. IntelMarkets has a range of advanced processing tools to improve trading performance. Conclusion For crypto investors looking to pick up guaranteed altcoins, joining the IntelMarkets’ INTL presale is necessary. The AI Crypto token has stolen the spotlight with its ongoing crypto presale. It also benefits from steep Ethereum prices and PEPE’s volatility.

He claims that if the Bitcoin price climbed from $2 to $97,000, so could the XRP price. His outrageous prediction is shining a spotlight on XRP’s long-term potential, which is driven by increasing adoption and legal victories. However, as XRP gains traction, an undervalued altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , with high-growth potential, is emerging as a worthy rival. With its cutting-edge features, AI integration, and practical utility, RCOF is poised to mirror and possibly even outdo XRP’s gains. $97,000 XRP Price Prediction: Can it reach Bitcoin Price levels? Analysts like BowTiedBull @BowTiedBull, are increasingly optimistic about XRP’s potential to reach ambitious XRP price levels, including hitting $97,000 like the Bitcoin price. This extraordinary projection isn’t baseless; it is fueled by several factors that showcase XRP’s growing adoption and relevance in the current market. XRP’s utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments is gaining traction among banks and payment providers. This is driving demand for the token, pushing up the XRP price. Ripple’s partnerships with major financial institutions continue to strengthen XRP’s position as a cornerstone in global financial infrastructure and drive up the XRP price. These partnerships position XRP as a utility tool for financial institutions and underscore Ripple’s commitment to promoting financial inclusion. Ripple’s recent legal victory over the SEC has been pivotal in the 409% rise in the XRP price over the past month. This ruling alleviated some of XRP’s regulatory uncertainty, reigniting investor confidence and paving the way for institutional adoption. With more legal clarity, the XRP price could grow tremendously, mirroring the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin’s deflationary model, with its halving cycles, is a big contributor to the Bitcoin price growth. XRP’s capped supply and rising demand are creating scarcity. As demand grows, the XRP price could climb higher, making BowTiedBull’s $97,000 prediction more plausible. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Set to Mirror XRP Price Gains While the XRP price chases Bitcoin price-like levels, its ambitious target spotlights RCO Finance , a Ripple rival with immense potential to achieve massive returns at a fraction of the price. RCOF’s ecosystem blends AI, DeFi, and real-world utility to deliver more value and exponential growth. Its AI integration allows RCOF to provide AI-powered investment and trading tools designed to improve and streamline the investing process. These tools provide real-time market insights, automated trading strategies, and predictive analytics, empowering users to maximize returns.

This eliminates crypto-fiat conversions, simplifies the investment process, and helps users create a well-rounded portfolio more easily. With every transaction, RCOF burns a portion of its token supply, ensuring scarcity and long-term value appreciation for holders. This deflationary model helps increase the token’s value and incentivizes long-term holding. Reducing its circulating supply allows RCOF to create a more stable and valuable asset for its investors. Transparency and trust are paramount in crypto. To demonstrate the platform’s transparency and integrity, RCOF’s smart contracts and code have undergone a rigorous SolidProof audit , guaranteeing the security of its ecosystem. Don’t Just Watch XRP’s Rise: Ride The wave with RCOF The journey of the XRP price to similar levels as the Bitcoin price, however optimistic, might take a while (read years). Luckily, the opportunity to achieve similar gains but faster is already here with RCO Finance. Backed by cutting-edge technology, deflationary tokenomics, a SolidProof audit, and a low entry price, RCOF is set to deliver extraordinary returns that could outpace XRP’s. Priced at $0.0777, the ongoing presale is the perfect chance to purchase tokens and secure your place in this forward-thinking, fast-growing project. Early birds get to enjoy this discounted price and also get a bonus to boost their gains. You don’t have to wait for XRP for massive gains.

The price has rallied 60 percent in the last seven days and according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP is in a strong bullish trend on the larger time frames despite encountering resistance. The analyst also observed that XRP failed to follow through on a breakout past the $2.80 level, which acted as a short-term resistance. After a brief push higher, the price quickly rejected, breaking back down. Major Resistance Around $3 XRP has encountered significant resistance near the $3 level, a crucial psychological point and also a Fibonacci extension. XRP’s all-time high (ATH) is just slightly above $3, around $3.30. This makes the $3 mark an even more critical point for the price action since it’s very close to the ATH. Typically, when the price approaches an ATH, it tends to face resistance due to the historical significance of that price point. Short-Term Pullback XRP has faced a small pullback after reaching the $3 resistance. This is normal in bullish markets, and it doesn’t mean the market is turning bearish. Short-term pullbacks can happen even during larger upward trends. Given the rejection at $3 and the current price behavior, it’s possible we could see a deeper pullback in the short term. A pullback could test lower support levels, such as $2.50 or even $2.30, providing a better entry point for those looking to re-enter long positions. Sustained Bullish Trend : However, despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term outlook remains bullish. XRP is still in a broader upward trend, and these pullbacks could provide opportunities for traders to accumulate more positions at favorable prices.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 00:36:46

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS.

However, some new tokens that started out with market caps below $1 million ended up striking a chord in the market, and going on to achieve market caps in the $100s of millions. The prospect of finding that one 100x gem is a key reason why traders brave the risks of the highly volatile and unpredictable DEX markets. Such traders often employ tools like DEXTools as they hunt for trending tokens. Here are some of the top crypto gainers today that will likely be catching their attention. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools – Which Are They? Nothing (VOID) A new Solana meme coin called Nothing (VOID) is one of the top crypto gainers today, having rallied 3,800% in the past 24 hours to a market cap of just over $12 million, per DEXTools . VOID has seen an impressive $12 million in trading volumes since its launch earlier in the day, and has amassed a respectable $700,000 in mostly locked liquidity. That said, its lack of engagement on social media platforms like X suggest it probably won’t retain value for long. Nothing may soon reach its real value, as implied by its name. That suggests it’s not a good candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS) Another Solana meme coin amongst the top crypto gainers today is Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS), which was last up 3,300% in the past 24 hours. Per DEXTools , its market cap remained tiny at just $156,000 with tiny liquidity of around $28,200. The Christmas-themed meme coin is doing a better job of generating hype on X than Nothing, posting entertaining new memes roughly every hour. The meme coin has also paid for ads and boosts, so may stand a solid chance of reaching million dollar status. Quick 10x gains are certainly a decent probability for JEETMAS, though, as with most new meme coins, this one will likely fade to zero soon. Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW) A new Depart of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) inspired Ethereum meme coin called Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW), which appears to be referencing the idea of the D.O.G.E. taking a chainsaw to the US government in its cost-cutting efforts, is another one of the top crypto gainers today. Per DEXTools , it was last up 6,500% in the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of around $300,000 with $70,000 in liquidity. CHAINSAW could do well in the weeks ahead as the countdown to the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump in the White House begins. Once Trump arrives, the D.O.G.E will get to work. And D.O.G.E-related meme coins could do very well. Of course, that doesn’t mean CHAINSAW will perform well. There will be millions of other similar meme coins vying for attention and mind-share. Most will be abject failures. Perhaps a better way for investors to do well in the meme coin market would be to instead get involved in meme coin presales. By running a presale, a meme coin gives itself a chance to build community hype and fund marketing, product and community development initiatives. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is a great example of a new meme coin project that has had huge success in doing all of these things. The project has raised a whopping more than $70 million in funds from early investors, and is putting these funds to work to build a leading web3 ecosystem. Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution and its developers have been busily building out all manner of dApps, including a DEX, a meme coin launch platform called Pepe Pump Pad, a block explorer, a bridge and much more. Just 10 days out from the end of the presale, PEPU is currently valued at around $100 million. But this is meme coin that has a high chance of reaching billion-dollar status – it has the funds, the community, the hype, the strong use case/technology. Learn more about Pepe Unchained , and why analysts at cryptonews.com rank it as one of their top presale picks for 2024, in the below video.

The ISC token will remain functional, but other features like its points system and ecosystem integrations will cease. ISC’s co-founder, Richard, announced via X that the company would be pivoting to FxSwap full-time. According to Richard, ISC's failure to find product market fit (PMF), even after exceeding the original budget, influenced the decision to close the company. “After working for more than 2 years on ISC, this decision is heart-wrenching. Especially considering that every week, we’re ever closer to a breakthrough. ISC launched at $1.54 and is now sitting at $1.81. It works,” Richard said.

The firm stated it is keen to launch under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) while upholding the regulations. Ripple posted through their X platform : Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. ~Ripple The launch of RLUSD stablecoin is set to redefine Ripple’s primary use case, moving it beyond its “memecoin” perception. The RLUSD will battle with market giants like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC as it will feature on XRPL and Ethereum. The stablecoin can kickstart DeFi activity on XRPL if it matches a fraction of USDT’s $134 billion in circulation. December 4 was marked for the big announcement Earlier, Ripple signaled that December 4 would be a tentative launch day, anticipating regulatory clearance by then. Although the launch is delayed, Ripple is set to sell its stablecoin, the RLUSD, to the public. Such a feat will see the firm grow into a big player in New York’s regulated digital finance market and stablecoin ecosystem. In June, Ripple officially unveiled its stablecoin, which it characterizes as a 1:1 USD-pegged asset fully backed by USD deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Later in the year, the stablecoin went through beta testing on the Ethereum main net, XRP ledger, and Ripple’s decentralized blockchain. Ripple’s CEO says Paul Atkin will bring back common sense to the SEC While announcing the delayed launch, Ripple’s CEO also shared remarks about the SEC. Brad Garlinghouse supported the nomination of Paul Atkins for the SEC chairperson position. He believes that Atkins is an outstanding choice at the helm of SEC. Ripple CEO notes Atkins will bring back common sense to the agency. According to one industry source, Atkins recently voiced a desire to let GOP Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” lead on crypto policy alongside her fellow GOP Commissioner Mark Uyeda. Brad also stated that with the team, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto. He believes such changes will restore freedom of choice and spur economic growth and innovations in America.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 301,800 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the Ethereum-based decentralized oracle Chainlink ( LINK ) is poised to spark a five-wave surge to a new all-time high. Bluntz relies on the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that states a bullish asset often witnesses a five-wave rally. Says Bluntz, “Major breakout on LINK today, all you have to do is take one look at LINK/BTC before you realize that you are probably not late and still early. It underperformed pretty much everything for the entirety of the bull run and now seems to be playing turbo catch-up. Probably one of the very few I would categorize as a dino coin that isn’t complete vaporware.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that LINK will explode to a new record high of $70. At time of writing, LINK is worth $24.44. Turning to Near ( NEAR ), the analyst says he’s bullish on the Ethereum rival after it breached a diagonal resistance on its Bitcoin pair (NEAR/ BTC ). “Revenge of the dinos. NEAR/BTC pair finally broke out.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $7.42. Bluntz also thinks that the Solana ( SOL )-based meme token dogwifhat ( WIF ) is primed to outperform the broader meme sector. “Huge six-month+ basing/inverse head and shoulder structure on US dollar pair. Double daily divergences against doge and double 12-hour bull divergences against PEPE. If you are playing memes, you want to outperform DOGE, that should always be the goal.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $3.31.

A crypto analyst has underscored why this support level is crucial for Bitcoin’s next price rally, as it could set the stage for a potential retest above the $100,000 All-Time High (ATH). Bitcoin Price Retests $96,400 To Trigger Surge To $100,000 Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital took to X (formerly Twitter) on December 4 to inform his over 518,000 followers about the current Bitcoin price action and future direction. The analyst suggested that if Bitcoin successfully tests the $96,440 support level, it could trigger a price increase to $100,068. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Sharing a price chart, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin has persistently retested its series of Lower Highs, establishing them as a key support level. In his Bitcoin price chart, “Lower Highs” means that each successive high point is lower than the previous point. This development is typically observed during a downtrend. However, with Bitcoin now treating these lower highs as support, it indicates a potential shift in the market, suggesting that prices may be stabilizing after declining. Rekt Capital also highlighted that Bitcoin is producing longer downside wicks, indicating that its price declined significantly during the time frame, but buyers stepped in. The analyst emphasized that Bitcoin is currently grabbing liquidity at lower prices without breaking below the key support trendline. A liquidity grab occurs when large volumes of orders at key price levels are triggered unexpectedly. In the case of Bitcoin, “grabbing liquidity” refers to the market dipping into levels where buy orders are clustered, enabling large players to execute trades. Rekt Capital has disclosed that, as long as this trend continues, Bitcoin will eventually move back up to reclaim the $96,440 level. Recovering this crucial support will allow Bitcoin to reach and even surpass the $100,000 milestone. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Bear Case Scenario Looking at the price chart presented by Rekt Capital, several support levels are highlighted, indicating price levels that Bitcoin could fall to if it fails to reclaim the $96,440 mark. While current Bitcoin price action indicates that it could potentially reach $100,000, the analyst has suggested that if the pioneer cryptocurrency fails to hold the $96,440 support, it might retest a lower support level of around $91,070. As indicated by the red line on the price chart, $91,070 is a critical price level for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency also falls below this level, it could crash to new lows around $87,325. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $96,737, marking a 3.24% increase over the past week. A drop below the $87,300 level would represent more than a 10% crash from Bitcoin’s current value.

Neiro had a lot of promise with its bold vision and rapidly growing community, but for those who couldn’t get in early, it might feel like the ship had already sailed. Fortunately, there’s still hope— BTFD Coin is offering a second chance for anyone who missed out. With its incredibly strong presale performance and a chance to grab it at the current price of $0.000064, BTFD Coin is your opportunity to make a comeback and position yourself for massive gains in 2025. Let’s take a closer look at both Neiro and BTFD Coin to understand what makes BTFD Coin such an irresistible second chance. Neiro: The Meme Coin with High Hopes Neiro’s ICO raised some serious eyebrows. With a bold narrative, a flashy community, and promising tokenomics, it felt like it could be the next big meme coin to take the world by storm. The early stages of the ICO saw over $2.5 million in funds raised, and the project drew significant attention for its viral marketing tactics and community-driven approach. It seemed like everyone was on board with Neiro—its catchy branding and innovative use of blockchain tech created FOMO in the market, making it one of the most talked-about coins of 2024. However, for those who couldn’t secure their spot in the presale or ICO, it’s been a bit of a waiting game. The price surged quickly, and as expected, the volatility of meme coins took its toll. Some early holders made huge returns, while others are holding out for bigger gains. If you belong to neither group, you might feel like an outsider waiting for the next big shot. Well, don’t fret just yet. BTFD Coin: Your Chance at Financial Redemption Here’s where BTFD Coin comes into play. If you missed out on Neiro, now’s your time to strike back with a new opportunity that is already showing massive potential. BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of impressive, with over $900,000 raised, and the presale is still going strong. Over 21 billion BTFD coins have already been sold, and more than 2,000 investors have hopped on board, forming the foundation of what’s shaping up to be a thriving community. Unlike other meme coins that rely heavily on hype, BTFD Coin has a more comprehensive roadmap that goes beyond just ‘buying the dip’. The project is community-driven, has a solid utility plan, and offers features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and high staking rewards. For those who missed out on the frenzy of Neiro, BTFD Coin is poised to deliver the next wave of exciting opportunities for investors. Investment Opportunity: How a $3,000 Investment Could Pay Off Let’s break down what a $3,000 investment in BTFD Coin could look like. At the current presale price of $0.000064, your $3,000 would buy you 46,875,000 BTFD coins. If the price rises to just $0.0006—a conservative estimate considering the current momentum—that investment could grow to $28,125. That’s a potential return of 843%! Considering BTFD Coin’s growth trajectory, this could be a smart play for anyone who missed the boat on Neiro but still wants to get in on a meme coin that’s on the rise. Why BTFD Coin Is the Meme Coin You Need Right Now So, what makes BTFD Coin such a compelling second chance? Here’s a rundown of why it should be at the top of your list for potential meme coin investments: Proven Presale Success: With over $900,000 raised and 21 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin is gaining serious traction in the market. The strong presale performance is an indication that there is plenty of interest in the project. A Strong Community: Over 2,000 Bulls are already holding BTFD Coins, and the community continues to grow. Community-driven projects tend to thrive in the meme coin space, and BTFD Coin’s strong following gives it a solid foundation for long-term success. Real Utility: BTFD Coin offers tangible utility in the form of high staking rewards and a Play-to-Earn game. This adds intrinsic value to the coin and makes it more than just a speculative asset. Massive Growth Potential: With the presale still in full swing, there’s plenty of room for early investors to lock in great prices before the coin hits exchanges. If the price rises as expected, the potential for high returns is huge.

This move is part of Trump’s broader goal to create a more crypto-friendly environment, a message that has been well received by the digital currency community. Atkins’ nomination is seen as a strategic choice to replace Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair, who has faced criticism for his strict regulations on the $3.5 trillion crypto market. Trump, a vocal supporter of crypto, expressed his excitement for Atkins’ nomination on his Truth Social platform, calling him a leader who supports common-sense regulations and understands the importance of digital assets in the country’s economy. “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,” Trump said as he made the big announcement. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, currently serves on the advisory board of digital securities platform Securitize. Notably, Securitize is a company Ripple invested in back in 2018, and its CEO recently spoke at Ripple’s Swell 2024 event. Carlos Domingo, the founder and CEO of Securitize told Yahoo Finance, “He’s (Paul) certainly a person that is known for streamlining regulation and being very pro digital assets, and very knowledgeable in the industry. There’s this big debate about whether certain digital assets are commodities or securities.” Legal Expert Calls For Quick Actions However, Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton said that if Paul Atkins doesn’t fire or demote certain individuals and completely dismantle the SEC’s crypto unit, he’s not the right choice for the job. According to Deaton, there is no need for a separate crypto unit at the SEC; a general fraud unit should handle all fraud cases.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 01:16:09

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 01:30:00

This innovative platform is being hailed as “smarter” than Solana , with its unique approach to combining artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Priced at just $0.002 during its presale , Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in the next wave of decentralized innovation, attracting both enterprise clients and retail investors alike. Lightchain AI: Smarter Technology, Broader Potential While Solana is known for its speed and scalability, Lightchain AI brings a level of intelligence to blockchain that sets it apart. By integrating AI capabilities into its core infrastructure, Lightchain AI enables real-time data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning directly on-chain. Why Lightchain AI Is Smarter: AI Integration: Lightchain AI’s platform allows developers to leverage AI for real-time decision-making and complex computations, making it a natural fit for industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): This innovative consensus mechanism not only reduces energy consumption but also ensures scalability without sacrificing speed. Meme Coin Pump Pad: While offering enterprise solutions, Lightchain AI doesn’t shy away from retail appeal, featuring a meme coin pump pad to attract broader participation. Presale Opportunity: At $0.002, Lightchain AI offers an unparalleled chance to invest in a blockchain project with massive growth potential. Lightchain AI combines enterprise-grade functionality with retail-friendly features, positioning it as a versatile and forward-thinking blockchain solution. Solana’s Strengths and Challenges Solana has long been a market leader, praised for its ability to handle 65,000 transactions per second with low fees. Its focus on speed and developer-friendly infrastructure has made it a popular choice for DeFi and NFT projects. What Solana Does Well: High Performance: Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) consensus ensures fast, low-cost transactions. Expanding Ecosystem: With a growing number of DeFi, NFT, and gaming projects, Solana remains a hub of blockchain activity. Developer Adoption: Solana’s tools and resources make it a preferred platform for building decentralized applications. However, Solana’s focus on speed comes at a cost. Network outages and scalability challenges have left room for competitors like Lightchain AI to step in with smarter, more versatile solutions. Lightchain AI vs. Solana: A Comparative Look While Solana excels in speed and scalability, Lightchain AI’s integration of AI technology adds a layer of intelligence and utility that Solana lacks. This makes Lightchain AI better suited for industries that require complex computations and predictive analytics. The Smart Investment for December As analysts highlight the strengths of Lightchain AI, its $0.002 presale price offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors. With its focus on AI-driven solutions and its ability to cater to both enterprise and retail markets, Lightchain AI is emerging as a smarter, more versatile blockchain platform than Solana. Seize the Opportunity with Lightchain AI With its innovative technology, scalable solutions, and early-stage pricing, Lightchain AI is leading the charge as the smarter blockchain investment this December.

Polkadot has been making headlines with its cutting-edge scalability and decentralised solutions. Meanwhile, Bittensor TAO is gaining traction for pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence on blockchain. But there’s another name emerging as a true game-changer: Qubetics ($TICS) . What makes Qubetics unique is its focus on tokenisation and real-world solutions, setting it apart from its competitors. Whether you’re a tech entrepreneur or an everyday investor, Qubetics’ tokenised asset marketplace promises unmatched accessibility and growth potential. Plus, with its presale offering jaw-dropping ROI predictions, this project demands attention from anyone serious about diversifying their portfolio. How Qubetics Reinvents Real World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is taking asset tokenisation to a whole new level. Imagine a world where you can fractionally own a piece of real estate, intellectual property, or even fine art without navigating complex intermediaries. That’s exactly what Qubetics offers with its tokenised asset marketplace. Leveraging blockchain technology, the platform democratises ownership, allowing investors to access exclusive opportunities previously limited to the wealthy elite. Take, for instance, a small investor interested in the commercial real estate market. Traditionally, they would face insurmountable barriers, from hefty capital requirements to lengthy paperwork. With Qubetics, they can invest fractionally, owning a share in a lucrative property for as little as the price of a single token. This access unlocks new avenues for wealth creation without the usual hassles. The marketplace also brings transparency and liquidity to previously illiquid markets. Picture an entrepreneur looking to trade tokenised intellectual property rights. Instead of negotiating opaque agreements, they can list their tokenised assets on Qubetics’ marketplace and attract a global pool of buyers in real-time. This ease of use fosters financial inclusivity, making Qubetics an indispensable player among the best altcoins to join now. For more insights into the Qubetics marketplace, you can watch this informative video . If you’re considering the best altcoins to join now, Qubetics is an opportunity worth exploring. Why Qubetics Presale Offers Unmatched Potential Currently in its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 266 million $TICS tokens , raising a staggering $4.3 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282, with a 10% price hike set for the upcoming 12th stage. Every presale stage lasts seven days, ending Sunday at midnight, ensuring consistent upward momentum. Now let’s talk about the returns. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by presale end , translating into a 783% ROI. Post-presale projections are even more ambitious, with $TICS expected to climb to $1, $5, and $15 in subsequent stages. For example, a $4,500 investment at the current price secures approximately 159,574 tokens. At $15 post-mainnet launch, that investment could balloon to $2,393,610. Polkadot Continues to Lead in Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot has cemented its position as a leader in blockchain interoperability, and recent updates prove it isn’t slowing down. The protocol has expanded its parachain ecosystem, with over 40 parachains actively contributing to its decentralised network. These parachains bring unique functionalities to Polkadot, from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces, enhancing its utility for developers and users alike. According to recent reports, Polkadot’s daily active users have grown by over 18% in the past month, reaching new heights in engagement. This surge coincides with its Kusama test network’s successful rollout of enhanced governance features, a testament to Polkadot’s innovation. Polkadot’s staking mechanism also deserves a mention. With an annual yield of 14%, staking has become a go-to choice for investors looking to maximise returns while supporting network security. For anyone searching for the best altcoins to join now, Polkadot offers both technological sophistication and attractive investment opportunities. Bittensor TAO Revolutionises Blockchain-Based Artificial Intelligence Bittensor TAO is rewriting the rulebook for blockchain and AI integration. As decentralised AI networks become the next frontier, Bittensor is ahead of the curve, allowing users to monetise their contributions to AI model training. The project has seen a 22% increase in active validators this quarter, underlining its growing traction among blockchain enthusiasts. One of Bittensor’s standout features is its staking model, which incentivises long-term participation. Recent updates revealed that its network processed over 1.2 million transactions last month, reflecting its robust scalability. Additionally, TAO token holders are reaping the benefits of an impressive annual yield of 12%, making it a solid pick for investors focused on passive income. In terms of adoption, partnerships with research institutions and AI startups are positioning Bittensor as a leader in its niche. Whether you’re an AI developer or an investor eyeing the best altcoins to join now, Bittensor TAO is worth considering for its innovative approach and growing ecosystem. Why These Altcoins Should Be on Your Radar The cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, and projects like Qubetics, Polkadot, and Bittensor TAO exemplify the industry’s potential for innovation and growth.

Recently, Toncoin and EOS have grabbed attention with their strong comebacks, setting benchmarks in scalability and adoption. Toncoin is riding high after its seamless integration with Telegram’s Web3 wallet, while EOS has surged thanks to a major tokenomics overhaul. But the real question is, can these projects keep up with the growing demands of the digital economy? Qubetics ($TICS) is a blockchain project transforming the cross-border payment landscape, addressing challenges like high fees, delays, and lack of transparency. By tackling these inefficiencies head-on, it is solving real-world financial issues that have often been overlooked. With its presale now in the 11th stage, Qubetics offers investors an exciting opportunity to secure early-stage returns with significant growth potential. Here’s a closer look at how these altcoins compare. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Cross-Border Payments With Speed, Security, and Affordability Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a practical solution for global financial challenges. Picture a small business owner in Los Angeles importing artisan goods from Europe. Traditional payment methods would mean waiting days for transfers and losing profits to high bank fees and currency conversions. Qubetics offers instant settlements, drastically reducing delays and costs. Now think about freelancers. A graphic designer in Toronto working for clients in Singapore can skip the headaches of delayed international wire transfers. Payments are processed swiftly and securely through Qubetics’ blockchain-based system, improving cash flow and client satisfaction. Families sending remittances? They can rely on the platform to make sure their hard-earned money reaches loved ones fast, without burning a hole in their wallets. With transparency, speed, and affordability at its core, Qubetics transforms how people and businesses move money globally. If you’re curious about its functionality, check out this video for more insights. Why Qubetics Presale Is the Talk of the Town The Qubetics presale is more than just an investment; it’s an opportunity. Now in its 11th stage, over 266 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.3 million from 6,200 holders. At $0.0282 per token, the presale offers an entry point that’s hard to ignore. Each week, the price increases by 10%, with the next stage starting Sunday at midnight. What makes this even more exciting are the returns. Analysts predict that by the end of the presale, $TICS will be priced at $0.25—a whopping 783% ROI. Post-presale, the token is expected to hit $1 (3,434% ROI) and could soar to $15 after the mainnet launch, offering an eye-watering 52,912% ROI. For example, if someone invests $2,000 now, they could see their investment grow to $105,824 if these projections hold true. Toncoin Keeps Growing Its Ecosystem Toncoin, the powerhouse behind The Open Network, is leveraging its ties to Telegram to create a massive Web3 ecosystem. With over 700 million active Telegram users potentially engaging with its Web3 wallet, Toncoin is set for mainstream adoption. The token has already seen a 27% price jump since late November, bringing its market cap to a hefty $15.3 billion. This surge reflects not just market confidence but also Toncoin’s ability to scale efficiently for decentralised apps and financial tools. If this trajectory continues, Toncoin could soon breach the $10 mark, cementing its place as one of the best altcoins to invest in now. EOS Bounces Back With New Upgrades EOS, a blockchain once declared dead by critics, is proving the doubters wrong with its latest updates. The platform has surged by 250% from its yearly low, thanks to its reworked tokenomics and growing appeal among developers. The revamped EOS Network is attracting decentralised applications and partnerships, ensuring it remains a strong player in the blockchain space. For those looking for altcoins with scalability and longevity, EOS is regaining its shine. Conclusion Each of these altcoins—Qubetics, Toncoin, and EOS—offers something valuable for investors and developers. Toncoin is capitalising on its integration with Telegram and its ability to scale, making it a strong contender for widespread adoption. EOS is staging an impressive comeback with revamped tokenomics and renewed interest from developers. However, Qubetics stands out for its ability to address real-world issues, particularly in cross-border payments, while offering investors unparalleled growth potential. With a presale already raising millions and analysts projecting remarkable ROI figures, it’s clear that Qubetics is carving a niche that others have yet to fill. For those seeking innovation with a solid foundation, Qubetics offers a compelling narrative and the potential for significant long-term rewards.

Staying ahead of the curve means spotting the gems before they shine—and that’s where today’s story begins. While Cardano’s latest bullish trend has traders buzzing and Bitcoin inches closer to a jaw-dropping $100,000 milestone, there’s a new player quietly making waves: Qubetics ($TICS). Positioned as a game-changer for blockchain development, Qubetics is already turning heads with its powerful tools and a presale that’s generating serious excitement. This article dives into all three coins—Qubetics, Cardano, and Bitcoin—but focuses on why Qubetics is a top crypto to invest in this week. Let’s break it down. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Development with Innovation At the heart of Qubetics is its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, a development platform that’s a dream for beginners and seasoned blockchain developers. This isn’t just another IDE; it’s a fully visual environment that lets users build blockchain applications without breaking a sweat. Imagine drag-and-drop functionality for creating features like token management or user authentication. You don’t need to be a coding wizard—intuitive forms let you easily define logic and parameters, while a code snippet library provides ready-made solutions for complex tasks. And it doesn’t stop there. Qubetics integrates AI-driven development tools that turbocharge your workflow. Think smart contract generation tailored to your needs, instant code suggestions, error detection, and even optimisation tips for better performance and security. Whether you’re a startup founder or a hobbyist exploring blockchain, Qubetics makes development fast, efficient, and approachable. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session packed with insights about its roadmap, features, and community-driven focus. With tools like these, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being hailed as the top crypto to invest in this week. Cardano: Bullish Momentum in Action Cardano is showing impressive strength, riding a bullish channel that’s caught traders’ attention. The ADA/USD pair recently bounced off $0.80, hinting at growing accumulation and setting the stage for a breakout. The pivotal moment? A golden cross, where the 50-period SMA moved above the 200-period SMA, confirming a sustained uptrend. With these moving averages acting as dynamic support, Cardano’s price action looks poised for continued growth. Moments like these keep it among the top cryptos, especially for traders seeking technical-driven opportunities. Bitcoin Nears $100K Amid Speculation of Crypto-Friendly Policies Bitcoin is once again flirting with historic highs, trading just shy of $100,000. The recent surge—over 40% since November 5—comes as President-elect Donald Trump pledges to reverse restrictive policies on digital assets. The idea of the U.S. becoming a global hub for crypto, combined with talks of a strategic national Bitcoin reserve, has fueled investor confidence. However, not everyone’s convinced. Some analysts argue that Trump’s staunch support for the U.S. dollar could limit these ambitions. Still, the excitement is palpable with Bitcoin’s price within striking distance of six figures. It’s no surprise it remains a top crypto for those looking to ride the momentum. Qubetics Presale Soars: The Top Crypto to Watch Now Here’s where the real excitement lies: Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 11, with $TICS tokens priced at just $0.028. Each weekly phase brings a 10% price hike, and the final stage promises a 20% surge, so getting in early could mean huge rewards. The presale has already raised over $4.3 million, signalling strong community interest and confidence. Now, let’s talk about potential. Analysts predict that if $TICS were to hit $10, a modest $200 investment could balloon to a staggering $70,689.80, delivering an ROI of 35,244.90%. And if $TICS climbs even further to $15, that same investment would soar to $106,034.70, an ROI of 52,917.35%. Imagine the possibilities—this is why so many are calling Qubetics one of the top cryptos to invest in this week . If you’re waiting for the perfect time, this is it. Don’t let the next big opportunity pass you by. Conclusion: Qubetics Steals the Spotlight Each of these cryptos offers a compelling story. Cardano’s bullish channel highlights its technical potential, while Bitcoin’s climb toward $100K reflects growing market optimism and policy shifts. But Qubetics stands apart. With its cutting-edge tools, AI-driven development, and a presale that’s turning heads, it’s not just another token—it’s an opportunity to shape the future of blockchain. If you’re searching for the top crypto to invest in this week, Qubetics is the clear standout. Don’t just watch from the sidelines—join the presale and be part of something groundbreaking. Time is ticking, and so are the price hikes. Are you in?

If confirmed, Isaacman will become NASA’s 15th administrator, succeeding Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. Isaacman is the CEO of Shift4, a fintech company that processes over $260 billion annually for more than 200,000 clients. He is also recognized for his collaboration with Elon Musk and SpaceX, a key commercial partner of NASA. In 2021, Isaacman financed and led the Inspiration4 mission, a private spaceflight aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Resilience. He returned to space in September 2024 as commander of the Polaris Dawn mission, where he became the first private citizen to perform a “spacewalk.” Extensive Aviation and Business Background Before his space ventures, Isaacman was a certified pilot for various civilian and military aircraft, even flying in stunt formations as part of an aeronautical team. In the business realm, Isaacman co-founded Draken International, a defense aerospace company and U.S. Department of Defense contractor. Trump highlighted this experience in his Truth Social announcement, describing him as a dynamic leader in both business and aerospace. “I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Jared will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in space science, technology, and exploration,” Trump stated. Part of a Broader Transition Strategy Isaacman’s nomination comes amidst other major appointments by the Trump transition team. These include pro-crypto Paul Atkins for SEC commissioner, University of Maryland professor Michael Faulkender for deputy Treasury secretary, and potential moves to replace Pete Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as secretary of defense. Trump’s cabinet picks signal a mix of innovation and strategic leadership for his upcoming administration.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 01:49:12

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 02:28:00

In a matter of four weeks, the coin reversed a bearish trend that had persisted for more than 1,000 days. With increased investor interest, experts are piling on the lofty price predictions, suggesting a rise in faith in this enterprise-grade public ledger. Related Reading: Cardano Rally Heats Up: Experts See 750% Jump Ahead The price of HBAR was $0.3173 at the time of writing. Even though the coin lost 10% in the last 24 hours, it did very well over the course of a week and a month. Notably, HBAR has maintained a huge 801% rally over the last 30 days, which has made buyers very happy. What’s driving this momentum? A combination of innovative upgrades, partnerships, and market optimism. HBAR’s rebound is more than just a price spike—it’s a transformation in how the project is positioned in the blockchain space. Aggressive Targets In The Bull Market Experts have projected a hopeful $5 for HBAR as the bull market for cryptocurrencies keeps up. A more conservative $2.50 shows great growth potential if the market peaks in April 2025. This positive attitude is not founded in conjecture alone. Hedera is getting ready for major announcements including a new privacy layer that will let consumers construct private network instances while still linked to the public ledger. Dr. Leemon Baird, co-founder of Hedera, believes that this privacy layer has the potential to change areas such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Hedera addresses significant gaps in blockchain technology by providing organizations with a safe yet interoperable solution. Ripple Partnership Boosts HBAR Adoption Hedera’s increasing integration with blockchain-based payment systems is another motivator. The technology, via Dropp, plays an important part in the Federal Reserve’s FedNow system, allowing for rapid and safe transactions. Moreover, its interaction with Ripple (XRP) proves it to be a strong rival in USD transaction handling. The likely certification of the RLUSD stablecoin by Ripple in December could help HBAR’s position in the payments ecosystem to be strengthened, therefore promoting acceptance in many sectors.

Bitcoin has reached $99k and is now approaching $100k. While many of the top 100 coins have seen some gains, only a few have been rallying strongly. While coins like XRP and ADA are up, Gala has been showing impressive performance. The Sandbox (SAND) is up by more than 15 percent in the last 24 hours and is trading close to the $1 levels. Up by more than 45 percent in the last seven days, SAND hit a range high of $1.06 before hitting a reverse and is now retesting the $0.88 levels. SAND’s ATH sits at $8.44, which was achieved three years ago. Gala has also been quietly surging and is trading close to the $0.60 levels at the time of writing. Up by more than 11 percent in the last 24 hours, Gala has surged by 55 percent this week alone. The altcoin hit a high of $0.66 in the last 24 hours and is also nearing it’s ATH which sits just above the $0.83 level. The Curve DAO token is also rising and has shifted to the green zone. Curve Finance has seen a huge surge in both market cap and trading volume, now sitting at $1.3 billion with $1.66 billion in trading volume. The rally is driven by news of BlackRock partnering with Curve and Elixir to bring traditional financial assets into DeFi. The price of Curve hit a major resistance level at $1.25, which is a key point to watch. If it breaks above this level, the next target could be $1.50. However, there might be some pullback before that happens. Overall, Curve is showing strong bullish momentum, and investors should keep an eye on these key price levels.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|CRV|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 02:33:50

BREAKING: #BITCOIN HITS $100,000 FOR FIRST TIME EVER! https://t.co/XwdsvLUycN — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 5, 2024 The next logical target for Bitcoin is another 10x away — $1,000,000. It is now no longer a question of if Bitcoin will achieve this, but when. When it comes to Bitcoin as a store of value, it has won. It’s off to the races from here, any price action is now possible. And one can only assume that going from $100,000 to $1,000,000 is going to be a lot easier than going from $0 to $100,000. During this rise to $100,000, Bitcoin has cemented itself as a legitimate asset, and everyone who has taken any meaningful amount of time to research and understand it is buying more. Everyday people around the world have adopted it for savings, payments, and financial privacy, nation states have adopted it as legal tender and are passing very pro-Bitcoin legislation, and now Wall Street firms are joining in. For someone who has been around for 7 years in the Bitcoin world, it feels unreal. Congratulations to all the bitcoin holders, old and new, on achieving this milestone. For those who have been HODLing through the bear markets, educating themselves on why Bitcoin is so important, accumulating BTC and ignoring the FUD, and onboarding new Bitcoiners — I salute you. You deserve this and all the gains that have been made on this journey. This was not easy, you did not get lucky. It takes conviction and strength to be able to buy and hold this extremely volatile asset long term. Enjoy this moment with your friends and family, and here’s to a new era of Bitcoin — the grind towards $1,000,000. This article is a Take .

It’s small compared to the up-to-infinite price levels that succeed it. While $100,000 is a significant milestone worth pausing to recognize, it is also merely a checkpoint on Bitcoin ’s much longer, much larger journey ahead. Let’s take a moment to remember the early moments of this journey. The year Kraken was founded (2011), Bitcoin’s Dec. 31 closing price was $4.25. From that level, the value of just one of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist is now up over 2.3 million percent at BTC $100,000. BTC $100,000 has long been viewed as the next/seemingly “final” frontier for Bitcoin’s price . Laser eyes and dank memes, as well as innovative products and user experiences, have accelerated us to this point. Through years of speculation around “the world to be when Bitcoin reaches $100,000,” a common sentiment held that the $100,000 price level would somehow confer the legitimacy of “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” It would show the value of a tamper-resistant and immutable way of recording information. It would prove that decentralization had a place in modern society. But, now that we are here, those goals may seem as if they still have more to deliver. It feels like this is still only the beginning. We’ve reached a pricing milestone, but when it comes to fulfilling Satoshi’s original vision for Bitcoin – its widespread use as a borderless, worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash system – Bitcoin is still in its relative infancy. Over the short term, it’s anyone’s guess whether the price of Bitcoin will continue its sprint higher or pull back from its recent run. What is clear is that the $100,000 milestone demonstrates ongoing demand for a reliable, transparent and peer-to-peer way to transact . BTC $100,000 represents a monumental milestone in Kraken’s mission to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency, so that everyone can achieve financial freedom and inclusion. We’d like to congratulate those who have built in the space alongside us and played a role in realizing this achievement. We’d also like to congratulate our clients as they celebrate this watershed moment, while making a commitment to serve them through the next chapters of Bitcoin’s history . Join us as we reflect on the journey that got us here and commemorate this remarkable day – while we reaffirm our commitment to a future of financial freedom.

Now ahead about 130% year-to-date, bitcoin's market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2 trillion only 15 years after coming into existence. For reference, Nvidia and Apple sport market caps of about $3.5 trillion, Microsoft $3 trillion, and Google and Amazon $2.2 trillion. The market capitalization of all the gold in the world is roughly $17.7 trillion. At the forefront of this rally was the early-2024 launch of spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by asset management giants including BlackRock and Fidelity. These products have been a resounding success, securing assets under management of around $30 billion in less than one year's time. Despite the success of the ETFs, the move higher in bitcoin seemingly stalled throughout a large chunk of this year, at least in part thanks to regulatory uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election. The early November victory of crypto-friendly Donald Trump, though, spurred new legs for the rally, with bitcoin quickly taking out its March high above $73,500, then in fast time moving past $80,000, then $90,000, and finally $100,000 just minutes ago.

As Bitcoin has now crossed $100K, it’s likely altcoins will take a break. As long as Bitcoin stays above support, we could see a potential rise towards $102K, based on a 100% extension target. This level isn’t set in stone, but it’s a key level to watch. If Bitcoin breaks above this, it might even push towards $110K, although there are many possible scenarios. The support zone around $99K is crucial. Bitcoin needs to stay above the 50% retracement level for this move to hold. If the price drops below $96,885, it could signal weakness and may lead to a pullback. Why is Bitcoin Rallying? The excitement surrounding Bitcoin is fueled by the hope that Trump will bring a more crypto-friendly environment, including better regulation and the possibility of a national reserve or stockpile. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin ETFs have also surpassed $1 billion in assets, which should drive more demand as institutions become more comfortable with the asset. These institutions could further boost Bitcoin’s price. Conclusion: Bitcoin has been making headlines with its fast appreciation, but even when prices drop, it’s important to stay focused on the bigger picture. The recent price drop after hitting $99,000 didn’t last long, and as of now, it’s close to that high again. Looking ahead, Bitcoin could become an even bigger part of global financial systems, with more institutions, countries, and companies investing in it.

Investors are riding a wave of optimism as Bitcoin has surged by 45.65% since November 5, while the Altcoin market has seen an equally impressive rise of 46.57%. It seems the market is unstoppable—or there is a correction incoming? Bitcoin is charging towards $100,000, up 0.99% since yesterday, and still holding strong with a 59.23% dominance. However, a slight dip in trading volume shows traders are both bullish and cautious. Looking at the market scenario, Ran Neuner predicts that after Bitcoin hits the $100,000 mark, it will likely experience a correction, potentially dropping to between $75,000 and $80,000. He believes this pullback can happen within the next four to eight weeks, driven by the typical volatility that characterizes Bitcoin’s bull markets. This price dip may reflect the past cycles, where corrections followed major Bitcoin price surges. Is this your chance to buy the dip, before the BTC touches new highs? Let’s understand. Preparing for the Dip Neuner is gearing up for a potential Bitcoin correction by strategically adjusting his portfolio. He plans to hold 30% in cash, which will provide him the flexibility to buy during the anticipated market dip. Alongside this, he is reducing his leveraged positions and trading exposure, opting to focus on preserving his core Bitcoin holdings. This approach aims to minimize risks while positioning him to capitalize on opportunities during a pullback. He expects Bitcoin to face a 25-30% correction after reaching the $100,000 milestone, which aligns with patterns seen in previous market cycles such as 2016-17 and 2020-21. Historically, Bitcoin’s sharp corrections are a natural part of its growth trajectory, often followed by strong recoveries. Plus, Neuner highlights that altcoins typically rally when Bitcoin cools off after a major surge, as investors often redirect profits into smaller-cap tokens. With Bitcoin surging above the $100,000 level, he anticipates a similar trend this time, presenting a unique opportunity for altcoin investments at discounted prices. Despite the expected short-term volatility, Neuner remains optimistic about the crypto market’s long-term potential, fueled by regulatory shifts and investor sentiment, making this pullback a strategic buying moment. Good time to Invest in Altcoins? Overall, Neuner is optimistic about the future of crypto, even though he expects a short-term correction. He believes that in the next four years, the market will see strong growth due to changes in regulations and a shift in U.S. policies that favor crypto. Neuner sees the correction as a chance to buy altcoins at lower prices and remains confident in the long-term potential of the crypto market despite short-term ups and downs.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 02:52:58

The cryptocurrency now commands a market cap of $2 trillion, surpassing major assets like Saudi Aramco and Facebook. Experts predict Bitcoin’s price could reach $500K in the future. Bitcoin, the world’s leading crypto asset, has finally crossed the $100,000 milestone after over a decade in the making. The rally that propelled Bitcoin to this landmark began on November 4, when it traded at $66,803. The following day, Americans elected pro-Bitcoin candidate Donald Trump as president, fueling the market’s momentum. With Trump emerging victorious, the Bitcoin market quickly responded , reaching an intraday peak of $76,522 on November 6 and maintained its upward trajectory, ultimately breaching the $100K mark. This growth represents a massive 49.25% increase from its monthly low. Considering that Bitcoin traded as low as $0.04865 on July 14, 2010, the leading crypto asset has appreciated by 205,549,745% in 14 years, making it one of the most profitable investments in recent decades.

Gary Gensler Confirms resignation, XRP price surpasses the $2.3 mark. Dogecoin records increased bullish momentum, eyes to retest $0.50. With the BTC price achieving the $100,000 mark, the volatility in the cryptocurrency market has recorded a new high. Moreover, the altcoin market has experienced a significant increase, with top altcoins recording a mixed price sentiment. As the crypto market records a new high, is this a good time to stack altcoins to maximize future gains? In this article, we have covered the short-term possibilities of Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) crypto tokens. Ethereum (ETH) The ETH price has jumped 7.84% in 24 hours, resulting in it retesting its $3,900 level. Moreover, with a trading volume of $57.74 billion, the largest altcoin by market cap is currently valued at $464.169 billion. ETH-05th-Dec-2024 The EMA 50/200-day has recorded a Golden Cross in the daily time frame. This indicates a positive outlook for the ETH coin price during the upcoming time. Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of experiencing a bullish crossover with it heading toward the overbought range in the 1D time frame. This suggests an increase in the buying pressure for the altcoin in the market. If the bullish sentiment sustains, the Ethereum price will head toward its resistance level of $4.5k. On the flip side, if the bears outrun the bulls, this could result in the altcoin retesting its support trendline of $3,200 this month. Ripple (XRP) With a weekly surge of ~62% and a trading volume of $24.653 billion, the XRP price has reclaimed the $2.34 mark. Moreover, with Gary Gensler resigning as the SEC chair, this altcoin has gained significant attention from the crypto space and is on the path of achieving a new ATH. XRP 05th Dec 2024 The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recorded a constant green histogram, with its averages showing a significant rise in the 1D time frame. This suggests an increase in the buying-over-selling pressure. Maintaining its bullish action could push the XRP coin price toward its upper resistance level of $3.00. On the contrary, if a bearish trend reversal occurs, the Ripple token could plunge toward its lower support level of $2.00. Also, read XRP Price Prediction ! Dogecoin (DOGE) Amid increased market volatility, the Dogecoin price has maintained its bullish price rally by adding 4.21% in 24 hours and 3.69% in the last seven days.

DOGE 05th Dec 2024 The RSI indicator continues hovering above the overbought range in the daily time frame with its average trendline experiencing a similar price action. This indicates that the largest meme coin may continue gaining value this week. If the market favors the bulls, the DOGE price will breach its $0.44 mark and prepare to test its upper high of $0.50. Conversely, if the bears regain momentum, this memecoin could plunge toward its support level of $0.325 this month. Wondering when will DOGE price hit $1?

Say Yes to This Layer 1 Blockchain with 53k% ROI Prospects,https://thecoinrise.com/rue-missing-out-on-ethereum-ico-say-yes-to-this-layer-1-blockchain-with-53k-roi-prospects/,"The cryptocurrency market is heating up again, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge as one of the most celebrated projects in blockchain history. From its humble beginnings as an ICO in 2015 to becoming the backbone of decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum has carved its legacy. But if you’re feeling a little regret for not jumping in on Ethereum’s ICO when tokens were just $0.30 each, there’s some good news on the horizon. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain project making waves with a massive presale and an innovative ecosystem that aims to address gaps its predecessors left open. As the best crypto to buy before Christmas 2024 , Qubetics is not just another blockchain—it’s an ambitious project solving real-world problems through its powerful web3 aggregator and developer tools. If Ethereum is the grand architect of decentralised applications, Qubetics is the master planner poised to bring structure and usability to blockchain chaos. Here’s how these two projects stack up against each other. Ethereum (ETH): The Pioneer That Changed the Game Ethereum wasn’t just another cryptocurrency when it launched; it was a revolution. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum introduced smart contracts—self-executing agreements that run on its blockchain. This feature turned Ethereum into the go-to platform for developers and businesses looking to build decentralised applications (dApps). From DeFi platforms like Uniswap to NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Ethereum paved the way for blockchain innovation. Fast forward to 2024, Ethereum continues to dominate, but it’s not without its challenges. Network congestion and sky-high gas fees have been persistent issues, even after the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which replaced proof-of-work with proof-of-stake. Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Optimism, have alleviated some pressure, but scalability and affordability remain hot-button topics for developers and users alike. Despite its hurdles, Ethereum is still a powerhouse. As of December 2024, Ethereum trades at just under $2,000, with analysts predicting a climb to $3,000 in 2025 as the broader crypto market recovers. While Ethereum offers stability and proven utility, its growth potential is moderate compared to emerging projects like Qubetics. Why is Ethereum still a key player? It’s the original Layer 1 that unlocked a trillion-dollar market. However, as competition heats up, Ethereum might share the stage with newer, more focused projects like Qubetics that address its weaknesses. Qubetics ($TICS): The Next Big Thing with Groundbreaking ROI Qubetics isn’t here to play second fiddle. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, it offers a robust ecosystem for developers, businesses, and individual users. But what sets Qubetics apart is its application, QubeQode IDE, a development environment designed to make blockchain coding accessible to everyone—from seasoned developers to budding entrepreneurs. Imagine a freelance software developer juggling projects on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. With QubeQode IDE, they can write, test, and deploy smart contracts across multiple chains without switching platforms or tools. Now picture a small business looking to integrate blockchain for supply chain transparency. Qubetics simplifies the process, offering customisable templates and real-time analytics that make blockchain integration seamless. For individuals, Qubetics is equally transformative. Think of a digital artist looking to mint NFTs but overwhelmed by the complexity of multiple blockchain platforms. QubeQode IDE enables easy NFT creation and deployment, eliminating the technical barriers that deter creators from entering the blockchain space. The ongoing $TICS presale has already attracted over 6,200 holders, raising $4.3 million. With a current price of $0.0282, the potential upside is staggering. An investment of $100,000 at this stage would secure approximately 3.54 million $TICS tokens. By the presale’s end, when $TICS is projected to hit $0.25, that investment could balloon to $885,000—a 783% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. Analysts predict $TICS could soar to $1 after the presale and $15 after its mainnet launch, translating into a jaw-dropping $53 million ROI. Why is Qubetics the best crypto to buy before Christmas 2024? It’s all about innovation and practicality. By bridging gaps left by Ethereum and other blockchains, Qubetics is shaping up to be the go-to platform for anyone looking to harness blockchain technology without the steep learning curve. Why Qubetics is the Way to Go for New Crypto Investors Both Ethereum and Qubetics have their strengths. Ethereum is the tried-and-true option, with a legacy that’s hard to beat. But for investors seeking exponential growth and fresh opportunities, Qubetics is the clear winner. Its focus on real-world applications, combined with its user-friendly developer tools and groundbreaking presale success, makes it a standout project in the blockchain landscape. So, what’s the takeaway? If you missed Ethereum’s ICO or have been hesitant to dive into crypto, Qubetics is your golden ticket. Its potential for massive ROI, coupled with its practical applications, makes it a no-brainer for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio. Which is the Best Crypto to Buy Before Christmas 2024 The crypto market rarely offers second chances, but Qubetics is the exception. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer, this Layer 1 blockchain has the potential to redefine your financial future. With its presale already making headlines and its applications poised to transform industries, now is the time to act. Don’t rue missing out on Ethereum. Join the Qubetics presale now and be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The price is trading above $3,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,880 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Starts Fresh Increase Ethereum price remained well-bid above the $3,650 support zone.

The milestone underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance in mainstream finance and the potential for broader institutional adoption. Investors are betting on Trump’s crypto-friendly policies, which aim to establish the US as a global leader in digital assets. Bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise this year, doubling its value and gaining 45% in the weeks since Trump’s election victory. When writing, Bitcoin traded at $102,302, up 6.64% from the previous session. Source: CoinMarketCap Market analysts attribute this surge to growing confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital told Reuters . “Institutional adoption, advancements in tokenization, and a clearer regulatory path are driving Bitcoin and digital assets toward financial mainstream acceptance.” Fed Chair Powell calls Bitcoin a competitor to gold Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has described Bitcoin as a competitor to gold , emphasizing its role in preserving monetary value rather than functioning as a currency. Speaking at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell highlighted the cryptocurrency’s characteristics and volatility. Bitcoin is more like gold, but in a virtual form. People aren’t using it as a payment method or a reliable store of value. “It’s not a competitor to the dollar; it’s more of a competitor to gold,” Powell added. Why is Bitcoin going up? Trump’s campaign promises to transform the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” have resonated with investors. Illimar Mattus @IllimarM · Follow #Bitcoin making history. Now going parabolic.

Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 marks a turning point in the cryptocurrency’s journey from a niche asset to a significant financial instrument. Industry experts highlight the role of institutional adoption and technological advancements in driving this growth. “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 isn’t just a number; it reflects a broader shift in global finance, technology, and geopolitics,” Justin D’Anethan, an independent crypto analyst based in Hong Kong was quoted as saying by Reuters. What was once dismissed as a fantasy is now a reality, underscoring Bitcoin’s resilience and relevance. The milestone comes more than 16 years after Bitcoin’s creation, a period marked by skepticism, regulatory challenges, and market volatility. Despite these obstacles, BTC has demonstrated staying power and adaptability.

Watch on Twitter View replies 8:24 AM · Dec 5, 2024 6 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Beyond surpassing the $100,000 milestone, optimism around Bitcoin’s future growth remains strong among institutions and prominent crypto personalities. New price targets range between $150,000 and $500,000 within the next few years, fueled by increasing institutional adoption and market momentum. Bernstein Research has revised its bullish price forecast for Bitcoin, projecting it to reach $200,000 by 2025. This updated target, previously set at $150,000, reflects the growing institutional demand for cryptocurrencies across various regions. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, is even more optimistic. He predicts Bitcoin’s price could soar to $250,000 within the next two years, considering it a conservative estimate. Hoskinson believes Bitcoin’s potential upper limit could reach as high as $500,000, driven by rapid adoption and expanding use cases. Bitcoin hits $100K: what this means for crypto markets Bitcoin’s rally is expected to have ripple effects across the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple could see renewed interest as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Meanwhile, advancements in blockchain technology and tokenization could further integrate cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems. With the US poised to take a leadership role in the digital asset ecosystem, the stage is set for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to continue their upward trajectory. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and the potential for reduced regulatory hurdles could drive further investment and innovation in the space. Bitcoin’s ascent past $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it’s a testament to its growing acceptance as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. As geopolitical dynamics evolve and regulatory clarity improves, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape is likely to expand further.

Bitcoin is up 138% year-to-date. After a week of side way moments Bitcoin finally broke through $100,000. The reason for this current raly has been linked to Donald Trump winning the 2024 United States Presidential Election . $100k Bitcoin Was Imminent Market analysts believe that Bitcoin breaking $100,000 was imminent, as a number of factors perfectly aligned to drive the price up. Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, told Cryptonews that major catalysts for the price increase include tax policy around crypto, along with talks of strategic BTC reserves and continued inflows into Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) . Bitcoin has certainly been on a roll lately. BTC just recently became the seventh-largest asset by market cap in the world. It’s also impressive that within the past 10 trading days, Bitcoin ETFs have seen an incredible amount of inflows, totalling over $3.5 billion (check number) as of last week. According to Farside data , this brings the total amount of Bitcoin ETF inflows to $29.3 (double check) billion since their introduction in January this year. (add chart) Record Breaking Inflows Into Bitcoin ETFs Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at multisig Bitcoin vault maker Theya, told Cryptonews that it’s impressive to see the crypto industry have several consecutive days of record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. “There has also been roughly $1.12 billion in short positions between here and $100,000, clustered heavily between $91.5k and $92k. Once the price broke through these two levels decisively, it was a very easy ride all the way up to $100k,” Consorti added. The current BTC bull run has led to Bitcoin backers like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet announcing new BTC purchases . MicroStrategy now holds 1.5% of the asset’s total supply . Investors Will Take BTC Profits, Fueling A Full Crypto Bullrun Bitcoin breaking $100,000 also marks a significant turning point for both retail and institutional investors. Sergey Vasylchuk, CEO of global crypto staking platform Everstake, told Cryptonews that the $100,000 BTC mark demonstrates a psychological level where people will undoubtedly take BTC profits. However, Vasylchuk believes that many investors will not shy away from cryptocurrency. “Once you are addicted to crypto profit, you come back to seek more,” Vasylchuk said. He further believes that the crypto industry will see entry into Solana (SOL) or Ethereum (ETH) , which will fuel a full crypto bull run. “This bull run to 100,000 BTC is not the same narrative as past bullruns. This has been a BTC bullrun and not a full crypto bullrun,” said Vasylchuk. “We may even see another memecoin rally that pushes Solana to another rise or approval of an ETH ETF or pro-DeFi regulation that drives ETH up.” Joe Flanagan, Co-Founder of Maple Finance, also believes that as Bitcoin dominance stabilizes attention will shift to blue-chip decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens . What’s Next For Bitcoin? Industry experts predict that the new Bitcoin ATH will lead to increased growth within the crypto sector overall. Dennis Porter, CEO and Co-Founder of Satoshi Action Fund, told Cryptonews that the $100k BTC price will likely result in a massive surge of retail purchases. Tim Enneking, Founder and Principle of Digital Capital Management, told Cryptonews that Bitcoin breaking $100,000 indeed creates fear of missing out, or “FOMO” for retail investors. “The more valuable a single BTC becomes, the more it will have a significant effect on retail investors,” Enneking said. “The asset is also closer to becoming incorporated into different countries’ reserves.” Enneking added that the $100k Bitcoin price will not turn into permanent support for the asset. “If we get to $120,000 we may even see BTC drop back somewhere around $90k,” he remarked.

Bulls are already targeting levels beyond $103k at the time of writing. As the focus has now shifted to Bitcoin, the second largest cryptocurrency–Ethereum is also showing strong bullish momentum. Right now, Ethereum is breaking out towards $4,000 and looking at the weekly Ethereum chart, the price is showing strong performance ahead. Ethereum is approaching a major resistance zone around $3.9K to $4K. If it breaks above these levels, the next target would be the previous all-time high, around $4.7K to $4.9K, just under $5,000. On the 3-day chart, Ethereum is moving above $3.2K, which was resistance and is now acting as support. It also has support around $3.5K. The next resistance zone to watch is between $3,850 and $4,000, which are the previous highs. On the daily chart, Ethereum is still breaking out above previous resistance, now acting as support. The altcoin has seen strong buying around $3,430 to $3,560, confirming the breakout. There’s a potential bearish divergence forming, but it’s not confirmed yet since we haven’t seen a strong rejection in the RSI. For now, things are looking more bullish than bearish. For short-term gains, it’s crucial to watch the $3,750 level. A confirmed break above this could lead to a surge towards $4,600, and eventually, higher targets. Looking ahead, Ethereum is forming a cup and handle pattern, and some analysts predict prices could reach $7,400 or even $10,000. However, right now, Ethereum faces resistance at $4000 and we need to break and hold above that level to move higher. Ethereum’s strong uptrend is supported by large institutional investments, with Ethereum ETF inflows recently surpassing Bitcoin’s. This trend hints at positive price action for Ethereum, and many believe it could reach new highs by the end of the year, possibly even breaking its all-time high.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 03:29:50

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Solana’s Ecosystem Thrives According to VanEck’s analysis, Solana delivered a 42% return in November, with the SOL token hitting an all-time high of $262. This increase was largely driven by a surge in on-chain trading activity related to memecoins, which led the general market rally with a 95% increase during the month. This drove Solana’s revenues and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes to unprecedented levels. In fact, Solana generated $177 million in revenue in November, doubling the previous month’s high of $74 million.

This rush of activity also benefited projects such as Jito and Pump.fun, which generated revenues of $185 million and over $92 million, respectively. Jito operates as an on-chain application that generates revenue through maximal extracted value (MEV), which is derived from arbitrage opportunities created during DEX trading. Meanwhile, Pump.fun captures revenue directly from memecoin trading, showcasing the dual benefits of Solana’s vibrant ecosystem. Solana’s success was further underscored by its wallet, Phantom, claiming the top spot in Apple’s “free utility apps” category, and Robinhood reinstating SOL trading on its platform. In addition, the popular non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden announced an upcoming token airdrop, which is expected to stimulate further on-chain trading. Cardano And Polkadot Lead Crypto Altcoin Rallies Cardano’s ADA was another standout performer in November, achieving an impressive 201% increase. This rally was spurred by off-chain developments and speculation surrounding the influence of Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, in shaping future crypto policy. Following Hoskinson’s announcement of establishing a crypto policy office in Washington, D.C., ADA experienced a significant price surge. The upward momentum continued with Robinhood’s relisting of ADA and an update to Cardano’s governance structure, which emphasized on-chain decision-making by ADA holders. On-chain usage metrics reflected Cardano’s price movement, with total value locked (TVL) surging by 180% as various Cardano project tokens rallied. However, despite these gains, Cardano’s absolute figures in stablecoins and daily DEX volumes remain modest compared to Ethereum (ETH), highlighting a potential area for growth. Related Reading: XRP Under The Microscope: Will It Break $2.9? Key Support Levels And Future Targets Polkadot, often viewed as an underperformer in the crypto space, also saw a surprising rally in November. While its ecosystem has struggled with slow onboarding and technical challenges, recent developments, particularly from the Mythos Chain—a gaming blockchain hosting popular titles like NFL Rivals—have invigorated interest. Polkadot’s founder, Gavin Wood, also unveiled plans for a more agile architecture, allowing for enhanced interoperability and cloud-like services, which could position Polkadot favorably against other crypto assets like Ethereum and Celestia. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, major protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, and Sky (formerly MakerDAO) demonstrated strength, with significant fee increases and market activity. Aave crossed a milestone of $30 billion in deposits, positioning it among the largest banks by deposits if it were a traditional institution. Meanwhile, Uniswap’s market position was bolstered by a favorable court ruling regarding the legality of immutable smart contracts, which spurred a substantial increase in its market capitalization.

How High Can Bitcoin Go?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-bitcoin-going-up-today-5-december/,"The post Why Is Bitcoin Going Up? How High Can Bitcoin Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has finally crossed $100,000. Adding 7% in the last three days and 4% today, BTC peaked at $104,630 before retracing back to $101,132. This gives the crypto community new hope that the bull cycle is still on. Let’s analyse what is happening in the market and why is Bitcoin going up today. Bitcoin Hit $100K The $100k mark has been a very heavy psychological resistance for Bitcoin, which it passed this morning. As we talked about how new buying can support the price and raise it, we saw huge volume coming in to push the price up. The Fear and Greed index was recorded at 84 this morning, displaying that the market still has potential for buying. The biggest crypto needs to cement the support as there is no moving average present in this area for assistance. How High Can Bitcoin Go? The RSI is currently at 76.41 showing bulls are charging, however it will soon enter the overbought zone and will have to cool off. On the other hand, ADX is at 17.57 which is considerably low but has started to rise. Bitcoin is experiencing heavy volume with a rise of 35% in the last 24 hours, most of which came in the last hour.BTC has reached at almost $100B in trading volume which pushes the marketcap of total crypto market to $3.69 trillion with a rise of 4.97%. Bitcoin dominance over the market is at 55.5% which is comparatively low. There are many factors pumping the force into Bitcoin. According to experts, the most influential part is the pro crypto President, Donald Trump. Since the US election, the crypto market has gained huge momentum with Bitcoin and altcoins adding huge numbers to their prices. The community is feeling relaxed towards crypto as Trump is working to get pro crypto people into his administration. Will Bitcoin Crash? What Next? With bitcoin above $100k, it is very clear that the alt market will soon follow. There is no single reason to why is Bitcoin going up today but its is a collective power of multiple factors. BTC is Expected to reach $120k soon, however rising RSI points towards a cool down. Also, the market tends to take advantage of such situations. People are going in with huge confidence & greed which is a great time for the market to rekt them. Just in the last one hour, over $130 million worth of funds were liquidated, most of which came in from shorts. The market takes some steps back in order to retest the support and if it fails to do so, the price can plummet under panic. We might see huge inflows into the Bitcoin etfs as well but investors should exercise caution.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 03:39:35

Starting Dec. 5 at 11:00 am UTC, PEPE will be tradable against Tether’s stablecoin, USDt ($USDT), the exchange announced on Dec. 4. “Since its inception, PEPE has seen significant popularity among network participants, largely driven by social media and community support,” Binance.US stated. As of Dec. 4, PEPE held a market capitalization nearing $9 billion, according to CoinGecko. Memecoin Listings on the Rise Following President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, U.S. exchanges like Binance.US and Coinbase have been expanding their offerings of memecoins. Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s vice president of international policy, highlighted the trend in November, saying, “We’re talking more about some of the smaller tokens, some of the memecoin tokens.” In recent months, Coinbase has listed memecoins such as Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Binance.US also introduced Bonk ($BONK), a dog-themed memecoin, in November. Currently, memecoins collectively hold a market capitalization of over $130 billion, per CoinGecko. Mixed Reactions Memecoins have sparked debate within the crypto community. Influencers like Murad Mahmudov argue that memecoins serve a purpose by reducing speculative premiums in altcoins. Conversely, others like Jimmy Song view them as risky and speculative. The Story of Pepe Created in 2005 by artist Matt Furie, Pepe the Frog became an internet sensation and later a cryptocurrency symbol. While initially a “peaceful frog-dude,” Pepe stirred controversy during the 2016 U.S. election due to its use by alt-right groups. Despite the backlash, the Anti-Defamation League stated, “the majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted.”",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|PEPE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 03:55:00

Seeking Case Dismissal Ver’s legal counsels recently sought the dismissal of all tax evasion cases against the Bitcoin influencer, citing that the US government has overstepped its actions which have gone beyond what is allowed in the constitution. In February, Bitcoin Jesus was arrested while participating in a crypto conference in Barcelona for allegations of eluding to pay taxes for his BTC sales. Roger Ver aims to fight back against what he claimed is a politically motivated move against cryptocurrency by tapping the services of lawyers from Steptoe LLP and Kimura London & White. NEW from me: Roger Ver’s legal team moves to dismiss indictment citing government overreach Lawyers for @rogerkver , aka ‘Bitcoin Jesus,’ are hoping his tax evasion charges will get dropped as part of Trump’s promise to end #crypto regulatory blitz. https://t.co/NtOlAkUNfR — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 4, 2024 On Tuesday, his legal team asked Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald of the United States District Court for the Central District of California to dismiss the indictment against the crypto influencer, arguing that the charges are the result of unconstitutional government overreach and misleading evidence against their client. “The indictment must be dismissed. The charges are unconstitutional: they rely on a tax that is itself a violation of both the 16th Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment,” the motion stated. ‘Purely Political’ Ver’s lawyers believe that the indictment made by the US Department of Justice was “purely political”, which many netizens saw as part of the government’s war on cryptocurrency. The legal team added that the case of the Bitcoin influencer is a perfect example of using enforcement to regulate an industry without giving clarity on rules surrounding the space. This has been the approach of state authorities under the Biden administration. In April, a US grand jury charged Ver with eight counts of criminal conduct for allegedly not paying taxes amounting to almost $50 million for his Bitcoin sale in 2017. He was also charged for under-representing the true value of his crypto holdings in 2014. A Glimmer Of Hope The filing of a motion to dismiss the charges couldn’t come at a better time as the US government is on a transition to a new administration, which many believed has a more pro-crypto stance than the Biden administration. Ver’s lawyers are optimistic that under the administration of incoming US President Donald Trump, their client’s indictment would be dropped. Trump has pledged that his administration will have a more favorable approach to the cryptocurrency industry. Ver’s case has caused an uproar from the crypto community who condemned the US justice department’s enforcement-first approach to digital assets. Civil rights attorney Robert Barnes believed that the indictment against the crypto influencer is selective enforcement, adding that the case is an excellent example of lawfare versus the crypto industry, “targeting individuals based on political considerations rather than clear evidence of wrongdoing.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView",Bitcoin|Bitcoin Jesus|btc|crypto|Roger Ver,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-05 04:00:43

This refers to instances where early investors or bots snatch up large amounts of tokens, leaving the broader community with less access and exposing them to risks.

The price is consolidating near $2.20 and might aim for a fresh increase above the $2.45 level. XRP price started another decline and traded below the $2.40 level. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance. XRP Price Revisits Key Support At $2.20 XRP price made another attempt to clear the $2.70 resistance. However, it failed to surpass $2.70 and corrected some gains unlike Bitcoin and like Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.50 and $2.40 levels. A low was formed at $2.166 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $2.20 and $2.25 levels. The bulls pushed it back above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.865 swing high to the $2.166 low. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.40 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.865 swing high to the $2.166 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance or even $2.850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $2.500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support and the trend line. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.
