His prediction has thrilled the XRP community, who are now excited about the potential. However, the analyst has also underlined a new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , with an even better prospect. He insists that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token will yield higher returns than the XRP price, which is poised to reach $28. XRP Price To Touch $28 Soon, Analyst Claims After correctly predicting that the Dogecoin price will surge massively in 2021, the renowned analyst has once again stated that the XRP price is on its way to $28. The Ripple community has welcomed this news with excitement, as the XRP prive touching $28 will yield significant profits for investors. According to data on CoinGecko, the XRP price is $1.46. A potential surge to $28 will transform investors’ finances by 1,845%. Despite the Dogecoin analyst’s prediction, chances of the XRP price touching $28 soon are low, as the altcoin is struggling with spikes and dips. The Dogecoin analyst, however, named an emerging token with a better prospect than the XRP price: WallitIQ (WLTQ). Interestingly, the token is trading at a low price, as it is still in its presale stages. Investors who want higher returns at a low cost are already storming the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. Analyst Claims The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Token Holds Better Prospect Than XRP Price Hitting $28 According to an analyst who predicted the historical Dogecoin price surge, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token holds better prospects than the XRP price hitting $28. The Dogecoin analyst insists that WallitIQ (WLTQ) has the potential to surge by 17,000% in the bull run. This means investors holding the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token could accrue 17,000% profit in the current bull market. Since this prediction, investors have caught FOMO and are rapidly joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. The presale has raised over $1.3 million and is still fast increasing every day. Priced at only $0.0171 per token, investors can still buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token before it sells out. With the demand increasing daily, the presale is poised to sell out in a few days. Beyond its rewarding presale, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) potential lies in its unique features that make storing and transacting cryptocurrencies smooth and easy. As a decentralized crypto wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) allows investors to store their cryptocurrencies without hassle. It is developed with cutting-edge AI technology to create a secure and productive environment for crypto investors and holders. To verify its robust security, SolidProof , a top blockchain audit firm, has audited its smart contract and found no irregularities. Not to mention, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a significant milestone for the Ethereum token. WallitIQ (WLTQ) incorporates Escrow Connect (AI-Einstein) , an inventive security feature that provides top-notch protection for investors’ assets, into its platform. This security feature uses advanced authentication, making sure that every connection between investors’ wallets and dApps or web3 websites is secure. This way, investors’ assets are safe from phishing attempts and malicious activity. Investors are provided with AI-powered smart suggestions on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) crypto wallet. The AI technology analyzes real-time data, offering investors actionable insights to assist them in various tasks. These tasks include selecting the right transaction fees, choosing staking opportunities, deciding when to buy or sell holdings, etc. Final Thoughts While the XRP price surge promises investors a potential return of 1,845%, the new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ), will provide a higher return potential of up to 17,000% on money invested and at a lower cost. Moreover, the analyst is renowned for his accurate predictions in the crypto space, notably his Dogecoin price surge forecast. Consequently, investors who want enormous returns at a low price should buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token now!

Its performance was boosted by its newly launched AI-integrated products, which analysts also cited in optimistic fiscal forecasts for 2025. In late October, the customer relationship management (CRM) software heavyweight launched Agentforce, a suite of autonomous AI agents that augment employees and handle service, sales, marketing, and commerce tasks. Impressive Agentforce outing and positive forecast for 2025 In the early hours of morning trading, Salesforce shares hit $368.7, a record high that resulted in a potential addition of $35 billion to its current market valuation of $316.85 billion. Many analysts raised their price targets because of their confidence in the stock, according to LSEG data. Salesforce stock went up 26% this year, with a new median price target of $380 representing an upside of about 15%. Other US tech company stocks in the cloud space have also seen surges in their stock prices. For example, Oracle saw a 3.2% rise, while ServiceNow gained 3.5%. Others like Datadog and Snowflake both saw a 4% rise. Expectations for Salesforce’s revenue for the 2025 fiscal year have slightly increased by $100 million, increasing to a new range between $37.8 billion to $38 billion compared to its previous forecast of $37.7 billion to $38 billion. The company also beat analyst revenue estimates, which rose to $9.44 billion during the third quarter of this year. While its steady growth continues to impress, analysts expect increasing enterprise adoption of Salesforce’s solutions to help the company to a steady double-digit percentage growth performance. Salesforce enters a competitive autonomous AI agent market With Agentforce, Salesforce enters the race for stakes in the supply of autonomous AI agents that help businesses complete tasks. It enters competition with the likes of Microsoft, and a rivalry is already developing between both companies. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, called out Microsoft in October on X (Twitter) , saying the latter’s Copilot does work and doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. He also added in a press release that Agentforce is the third wave of AI and actively drives customer success. When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it’s disappointing. It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are… — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) October 17, 2024 A week before Agentforce’s release, Microsoft announced that it would be enabling customers to build autonomous AI agents through its Copilot studio in the following month, which was November. So far, Salesforce’s Agentforce seems to have delivered on its promise. Bullish on its early success, Salesforce has gone on to project that its AI product will continue to close more deals as it has already delivered 200 deals since its launch. Other than the success of its Agentforce AI, Salesforce’s high-performing data cloud was another major contributor to the company’s strong quarter. To meet up with increasing demand for Agentforce, Salesforce executives are reportedly planned to hire 1400 new staff members in the fourth quarter.

According to a new report by Fox Business, anonymous sources familiar with the matter say that Trump is considering Boring to take the reins of the regulatory agency, partially due to her ability to be conversant and telegenic in presenting financial topics to the public. Other top contenders for the job include Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham, who both currently serve as Commissioners for the CFTC, as well as Jill Sommers, a former Commissioner of the agency who currently serves as the chief of the derivatives practice group at Patomak Global Partners, according to the report. Neal Kumar, a former special counsel to the CFTC and the current co-head of the commodities and derivatives practice at Willkie Farr and Gallagher, is also in the running. Earlier this year, the Chamber of Commerce – with Boring at its helm – argued that Democratic lawmakers Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown were attempting to take down the crypto industry by proposing bills to make it comply with the same anti-money laundering laws that apply to traditional finance. At the time, Boring penned a letter to Brown asking him to kill the bill. Last year, Boring predicted that Bitcoin ( BTC ) would hit a price tag of $1 million by 2029 if its adoption continued at the rate it was going. According to the CEO, a combination of a spike in demand and a lack of supply will push the crypto king to higher prices during the next few years. Bitcoin is trading for $94,944 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.

While Bitcoin remains relatively flat above the $97K level, the altcoin market is now back in focus among retail traders and analysts, raising expectations of an altseason. According to Google Trends, the search interest for the term “altcoins” hit 100 in early December. This increase is not a steady growth because it has been observed in the course of 2023. In November, searches reached a high of 93 and then declined to 56 mid-month, which coincided with the market’s response to Donald Trump’s announcement of his presidential candidacy and Bitcoin’s record value. In the past, similar search volume surges have pointed to the involvement of the retail investor, an essential component of the cryptocurrency price movements. The last similar peak was observed during the 2016/2017 bull cycle, which means that the cycle of interest in altcoins is repeating when the BTC price is stable. Several other digital assets have come to light as the top performers in the current market cycle. XRP and XLM have each more than quadrupled this month but are still down from their all-time highs. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX) have hit new highs in the market, indicating strong market activities. Altcoin season indicators Crypto analysts are paying attention to these trends in order to determine the general mood in the market. According to Jamie Coutts, the Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, the market dominance of Bitcoin is not the only sign of an altcoin rally. Instead, market breadth, the number of assets trading above their Bitcoin counterparts, paints a different picture. Coutts also notes that the Altseason Indicator, which currently sits at 67%, means that altcoins are in the consolidation phase. However, other analysts, including Daan Crypto Trades, say that the true altcoin season starts when this metric is above 75%. However, the indicator has not reached high enough levels to suggest that the altcoin season has started. The Alt Season Index has been rising at a rapid pace in the past week. It's now sitting at 67, which means that 67% of the top 50 alts outperformed #Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Above 75%+ it's officially labelled as ""Alt Season"". https://t.co/3Z87crI8cx pic.twitter.com/qfHU6dhpSo — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) December 2, 2024 According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the transfer of assets from Bitcoin to altcoins is no longer the main factor that moves the market. Rather, the increase in trading volume of the altcoins is being driven by stablecoin and fiat pairs. He stated, “Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” This futher suggests the shift to real-world application and unique features of the altcoins.

Deaton, a strong critic of the SEC leadership under Gary Gensler, called for changes to make the agency more transparent toward the crypto industry. John Deaton Urges Immediate Reforms at SEC, Calls for Action from Paul Atkins In a recent blog post on X , John Deaton emphasized the urgent need for reform at the SEC, particularly under the leadership of Paul Atkins. Deaton called on Atkins to take decisive action on Day 1, starting with the firing of individuals involved in the Debt Box fiasco. He pointed to the necessity of removing officials who had engaged in misconduct under Gensler’s leadership. Deaton stressed that if Atkins doesn’t take immediate steps to replace certain SEC personnel, it would indicate he was not the right choice for the role. The Pro-XRP lawyer stated, “If Paul Atkins doesn’t fire, or at least demote, certain individuals and completely dismantle – that is, do away with – the crypto unit, he’s not the right pick. Period!” Deaton also highlighted the importance of reshaping the SEC’s leadership to better align with a pro-crypto agenda. He argued that Paul Atkins should not inherit the appointments made by Gensler, stating that a fresh perspective was needed. This includes appointing individuals who can foster a balanced regulatory environment that supports innovation while protecting investors. Deaton’s comments reflect a broader desire for a leadership change within the agency, particularly after Gensler’s tenure. However, earlier on, the XRP lawyer expressed support for the new SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, praising his pro-crypto stance and commitment to reducing regulatory burdens. Deaton emphasized that Atkins’ leadership would restore balance and transparency to the SEC Crypto Unit Dissolution Proposal In his call for reform, John Deaton advocated for the complete disbandment of the SEC’s crypto unit. He argued that the existence of a separate crypto unit was unnecessary and that the SEC should instead operate a general fraud unit that handles all types of fraud. Deaton emphasized that this change would streamline regulatory efforts and prevent overreach by the agency. Deaton also suggested that Paul Atkins make clear on Day 1 that decentralized finance (DeFi) and self-custody should not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. In addition, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed strong support for the new US SEC Chair. Garlinghouse echoed John Deaton’s sentiments regarding the need for clearer regulations and less hostility toward the crypto industry.

The chairman of the Federal Reserve (The Fed), the central bank of the United States, has publicly called Bitcoin ( BTC ) a competitor for gold due to the aspect of preserving the value of money rather than using it as a currency. “It’s just like a gold only it’s virtual. People are not using it as form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold,” Powell mentioned on The New York Times DealBook Summit 2024 posted video on YouTube. He also noted that the growing crypto industry should find a position that is suitable for the conventional banking system, which is his concern, and that it must be safe and supervised. Although the central bank does not regulate crypto directly, Powell aims for the people who are involved in these digital assets to have consumer protections, no matter what the crypto-product they hold. Powell also claimed that he does “not at all” hold any crypto, after being asked by the American journalist and author on that occasion, Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Seasonality and high RSI suggest the coin may be taking a breather. Bitcoin's Dominance in the crypto market has fallen from 60% to 55% in just two weeks. BRRR is currently trading at a very small discount to net asset value. The fund has not benefitted from Grayscale fee flight to the same degree as other spot ETFs. After a four-month rally, the market has taken Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from a low of $49k in early August up to $99.7k in late November. An epic tease, perhaps. With many, myself included, expecting a $100k BTC price, crypto's top coin is taking a breather. Have we already seen the top for this cycle? I have my doubts about that, though I don't think the top is as far away as others seem to believe. But with this recent pullback in the orange coin and another month of on-chain activity in the books, I think it's worth updating readers with how I'm seeing the ball currently. In this article, we'll look at chain usage data, seasonality, market dominance, and assess whether the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BRRR ) is the right financial product for investors who want long-term exposure to BTC. On Chain Data Token Terminal If you'd like to see a picture of 'Gresham's Law' in one chart, the one above might suffice. Since September 2023, Bitcoin's price has surged while monthly active addresses have fallen off a cliff. At 9 million active addresses during the month of November, monthly active addresses (or MAAs) on Bitcoin have fallen by 43% year over year while the price of the coin has nearly tripled. I've made this case ad nauseam at this point, but my personal view is that less people using Bitcoin is only sustainable if average transaction fees remain elevated to counter both the declining usage and the declining coin issuance long term. Otherwise, the hash rate is at risk of collapse as ledger validation loses incentive. Thus, my view is investors are better off if monthly fees trend up. Token Terminal For the month of November, Bitcoin produced $38.3 million in fees. This was a 19.2% decline from the $47.4 million fees produced in October and a 73% decline from the $142.1 million produced from transaction fees in November 2023. The general trend in transactions each month has been higher going back to January. That said, there was a 21% MoM decline in November as Bitcoin processed 16.1 million transactions - down from 20.5 million in October. November 2024 transactions were also slightly behind the 16.4 million in November 2023. Token Terminal The average transaction fee was essentially flat month over month from $2.38 in October to $2.41 in November. TPS fell month over month from 7.7 to 6.2. All things considered, network usage was down in November by most important metrics. As has been the case for some time, Bitcoin is being used primarily as a fiat hedge rather than as a peer to peer payment network. Of course, none of that means the price of the coin will go down. If anything, it's indicative of a broad crunch on supply. But I believe there are additional factors to consider. Seasonality & Bitcoin Dominance In previous articles for Seeking Alpha, I've noted the terrific historical setup for Bitcoin seasonality in the fourth quarter - particularly in years of and following halving events. October and November have notoriously been terrific months for Bitcoin gains, December is much less clear: TrendSpider Going back the last 11 years, Bitcoin has a 45% chance of delivering a positive return in December. Despite the month generally being a toss up from a gain or loss standpoint, the mean return is 8%, which still makes December a solid month for Bitcoin on paper. But BTC is typically feast or famine in December. Going back to 2011, December has resulted in a single digit percentage return in either direction just 4 times. So it's a 'go big or go home' kind of month historically. TrendSpider We've also seen Bitcoin generate positive returns in each of the last three months between September and November. Bitcoin has actually generated positive returns for four consecutive months starting in September three different times in the past. But I would caution against expecting that to happen again. Bitcoin is very much a part of the traditional investment world now and that puts the coin at risk of profit taking to end the year and the quarter, in my view. Furthermore, judging by indicators like the RSI, there are signs that BTC is technically overbought on several time frames. Exhaustion in the BTC move is potentially why we're seeing so much action in altcoins like XRP ( XRP-USD ). CoinMarketCap 'Alt season' may finally be upon us. Over the last decade, we've seen the general trend in long term 'Bitcoin Dominance' has been down. As calculated by CoinMarketCap.com, Bitcoin Dominance of the $3.45 trillion crypto market cap has fallen from 60% on November 10th down to 55% on December 3rd. If that was indeed the cycle peak for Bitcoin Dominance on 11/10, it would be yet another lower high in the long-term trend dating back the last two halving cycles. The point is, seasonality and Bitcoin Dominance may both be signaling that the better returns from here are in the altcoins rather than in Bitcoin. BRRR In a recent article covering Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, I shared the most recent weekly capital flow data that we have from CoinShares. While the net flow in the final week of November was positive for the broader digital asset investment landscape, Bitcoin was actually down by nearly a half a billion dollars in a single week: Asset ($m) Week Flows MTD Flows YTD Flows Bitcoin -$457 $6,226 $33,912 Ethereum $634 $1,427 $2,198 Multi-asset -$16 -$25 $441 Solana -$4 $40 $110 Binance - $0 -$2 Source: CoinShares, Bloomberg, as of 11/30/24 In spite of the final week of November sales, full-month net flow for Bitcoin was enormously positive at over $6.2 billion. That brings the full-year capital flows to nearly $34 billion for Bitcoin. Despite the clear enthusiasm for this asset from the investment community, the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF has not enjoyed the same level of interest: BitcoinTreasuries With a little over 9k BTC managed by the fund, investors haven't looked to BRRR for Bitcoin allocations to the same degree that they have with other funds like the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) or the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ). There are a few different reasons why there could be relative lack of interest for BRRR, though all of these are just my own speculations. The fund originally launched with a 0.49% expense ratio after waiver expiration. That expense ratio has since been dropped down to 0.25%, which is very much in line with the rest of the market. But it's possible that early fee mispricing soured the market on BRRR. Larger funds are managed by companies like BlackRock ( BLK ), Grayscale, and Fidelity - which may give those ETFs an advantage in areas like product marketing. The fund's original manager, Valkyrie, sold to CoinShares shortly after launch, which may have also contributed to confusion in the market. Again, all of these are just guesses. It's important to keep in mind that smaller funds could potentially produce larger swings in the NAV rate than bigger funds: Data by YCharts So far, we haven't really seen BRRR decouple dramatically from the larger players in the market. That said, at market close on 12/2/24, BRRR shares could be had for a 0.25% discount to NAV, larger than both IBIT and FBTC. Closing Thoughts As far as Bitcoin specifically, I think we're witnessing a small pullback in price that will allow altcoins to have their moment. I suspect there are better gains in select alts from here. That said, I'm of the view that we have not yet seen the peak in BTC for this cycle. I still think we see a BTC price that eclipses the long-awaited six-figure level. There may be better ways to play that possibility as a trade than through BRRR shares. And I'll no doubt explore some of those opportunities in the days and weeks ahead. For long-term investment, BRRR is a fine option since the expense ratio has come down in line with the market. Especially considering the fund trades at a larger discount to NAV than peers. I am not personally long BRRR, but I'll rate it a 'buy' yet again simply on the notion that I suspect Bitcoin will continue higher in 2025.",BTC-USD|BRRR,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-04 23:12:44

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also ready to let local government bodies sell crypto. And it will allegedly follow up by eventually allowing companies to open corporate crypto wallets . Universities to ‘Trade’ Crypto in 2025? The newspaper claimed sources had told it the FSC will release a tentatively named “Roadmap for Allowing Corporations to Open Virtual Asset-Won Accounts” before the end of this year. Critics have accused Seoul of dragging its feet on the matter, allowing American, European, and Japanese companies to steal a march on domestic firms. Many South Korean firms want to use their balance sheets to buy cryptoassets, aware of the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) -buying strategies have helped many overseas firms boost the value of their assets. South Korea's martial law turmoil strains alliance with US https://t.co/bKA1QOfTmd — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 4, 2024 However, South Korean legal conventions do not allow corporations to invest in Bitcoin or other tokens. The FSC reportedly wants to “gradually” roll out regulations that will change that. And the body reportedly wants to begin with universities, schools, and local government bodies. Several major universities have received crypto donations in recent years. But government guidance currently prevents them from selling their coins for cash. There is no law that explicitly bans public bodies and corporations from opening crypto wallet-linked bank accounts. However, regulators have told domestic banks not to accept applications from anyone except private citizens. The FSC document allegedly outlines a “Stage 1” on the roadmap, which will allow “central government ministries, local government bodies, public institutions, other non-profit organizations, and universities” to “trade” crypto. South Korea’s financial markets tumbled on Wednesday following a night of political chaos, as President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law only to withdraw the measure just hours later under pressure from lawmakers. https://t.co/SVXisTSfqp — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 4, 2024 University Wants to Make WEMIX Sale The move will allow universities such as the elite Seoul National University (SNU) to finally sell altcoins they have been holding for years. The domestic gaming firm WeMade donated a large quantity of its WEMIX (WEMIX) token to SNU back in 2022. The university has since repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Education and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to allow it to sell the coins. However, the FSC rejected all of these requests, concerned that it could lead other companies to try to promote their coins by donating them to schools. Experts say they think SNU is currently holding some 800 million won ($566,000) worth of WEMIX. WEMIX prices over the past four years. (Source: CoinMarketCap) The media outlet added that “Stage 2” of the roadmap will focus on crypto exchanges and other crypto-related businesses. An unnamed official explained: “In order to foster the virtual asset industry and increase the effectiveness of regulations, business operations such as issuance, listing, and brokerage should be carried out as if [coins] were stocks or bonds.” “Stage 3” of the roadmap will finally give most private companies the right to buy and sell crypto, although this is listed as a “mid to long-range” goal. Banks Last to Get Green Light? The final two “stages” of the roadmap will see “financial companies,” a group that likely includes banks, granted permission to access the crypto market. However, the newspaper said the FSC was “considering building safety measures” into its regulations. One of these will likely see limits placed on stock exchange-listed companies. These companies will only be allowed to “hold a small percentage of their capital” in crypto. This move, Hanguk Kyungjae wrote, will help “prevent side effects” such as the creation of “Bitcoin-themed stocks.” Crypto speculators kept Bitcoin in sight of the landmark $100,000 level in anticipation of further steps to support the sector by Trump https://t.co/cCfVdAcE07 — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) December 4, 2024 The FSC may find this to be something of an uphill battle. The Korea Exchange is already highly influenced by Bitcoin price fluctuations, with even minor shareholders in unlisted crypto exchanges experiencing high price volatility when crypto news breaks or BTC prices rise . At present, the only South Korean public bodies with fiat-tradable crypto wallets are the Prosecution Service and the National Tax Service. The tax body uses its wallets to liquidate crypto confiscated from (mainly local) tax dodgers . The prosecution mainly uses its wallets to sell the coins of convicted crypto fraudsters.

Choosing the best crypto to join this week can be a game-changer for your portfolio in this dynamic landscape. With major updates from Monero and Avalanche, alongside the exciting presale of Qubetics, there’s a lot to unpack. Monero’s focus on privacy has kept it a favourite among enthusiasts, while Avalanche’s recent price surge has brought it back into the spotlight. But the real star of the moment? Qubetics ($TICS). With its innovative solutions for financial institutions and a presale generating serious momentum, $TICS is positioning itself as a standout opportunity. This article will discuss the latest updates for Monero, Avalanche, and Qubetics, with a special spotlight on why Qubetics might be the best crypto to join this week. From Borders to Breakthroughs: Qubetics Leads the Charge The Qubetics Network is shaking things up in the financial sector by offering banks and institutions a cutting-edge blockchain solution. With $TICS, institutions can execute near-instant cross-border payments , cutting down the delays and high costs associated with traditional methods.

To top it off, Qubetics recently hosted a well-received AMA session , where they shared insights into their vision and roadmap. Want to know more? Dive into the details from their AMA—it’s worth the watch. Monero ($XMR): The Privacy Pioneer’s Latest Move Monero continues to lead the charge as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy-conscious users. With its untraceable transactions and decentralised nature, $XMR has carved out a unique space in the crypto world. Recently, Monero announced enhancements to its stealth addresses, making it even harder to link transactions to individual users. This upgrade reinforces Monero’s commitment to safeguarding financial privacy in an era of increasing surveillance. As debates around privacy and regulation heat up, Monero’s relevance and appeal remain rock solid. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Momentum Keeps Building Avalanche has been making headlines with a significant price surge. Currently trading at $46.34, $AVAX has gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes skyrocketing by 200% to hit $2.07 billion. Investors are optimistic about the coin’s potential to break the $50 mark, driven by whale accumulation and institutional interest. What’s fueling this growth? Avalanche’s scalability and low transaction costs make it a favourite for DeFi applications. As more institutional investors recognise its potential, the demand for $AVAX is expected to climb even higher. 6200+ Holders and Counting: Best Crypto to Join This Week If you’re searching for the best crypto to join this week , Qubetics’ presale is the golden ticket. In Phase 11, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.028, but that won’t last long. Each weekly phase introduces a 10% price hike, culminating in a massive 20% jump in the final stage. Over $4.3 million has already been raised, with 6200+ holders securing 266 million tokens. Here’s the kicker: $TICS is targeting $0.25 per token post-presale. That’s a staggering 783.45% ROI potential for those who act now. Should the token price climb further to $15, as predicted, a $1000 investment would reach an extraordinary $530,173.50, with an ROI of approximately 52,917.35%. With excitement building and the next phase imminent, this presale isn’t just an opportunity—it’s a must-grab for anyone looking to make serious gains. Think about it: in just a few weeks, you could hold a token primed for exponential growth. But the window is closing fast, so don’t wait. Conclusion: Your Next Move in Crypto The crypto market is brimming with opportunities, but picking the best crypto to join this week is crucial. Monero’s privacy innovations and Avalanche’s price momentum offer compelling cases for investors. But Qubetics steals the show with its transformative vision and an electrifying presale that promises unbeatable ROI potential. If you’re serious about maximising your gains and joining a project with groundbreaking utility, Qubetics is the one to watch. With $TICS poised to disrupt financial systems and a presale offering massive rewards, there’s no better time to get in on the action. Don’t just follow the trend—be part of the movement.

Popular blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence indexed the transaction on December 3. Announcing the move on X, Arkham stated: “ALERT: US GOVERNMENT MOVING $1.5 MILLION OF SHIBA INU.” Specifically, the US government transferred 54,897,092,549 SHIB tokens to the Ethereum wallet ‘0x995’. Following the transaction, the sending wallet—associated with the US government—no longer holds any SHIB tokens. The recipient wallet, now with a total crypto portfolio valued at $33 million, has retained the assets. Notably, the US government acquired these SHIB tokens through the seizure of assets from Alameda Research, the trading firm affiliated with the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. This seizure was part of a broader forfeiture action involving more than $700 million in assets due to legal issues surrounding FTX and Alameda. The SHIB tokens were among a variety of digital assets seized during this process. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could Increase 75% If It Holds Current Level – Analyst Shares Price Target Data from Arkham suggests that the recipient wallet was newly created. Its first transaction occurred recently when it received $1.061 million worth of AEGRO tokens from the same wallet that moved the SHIB tokens. Within less than two hours, the wallet also received other crypto assets from the US government-affiliated address, including 4,815 ETH (approximately $17.9 million), 13.58 million BUSD ($133 million), and 631,959 POWR ($221,000). While it remains unclear whether the US government has sold its SHIB holdings, the absence of any identified exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) addresses linked to the transaction suggests that the government may still hold the tokens. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Potential For A 130% Surge? Crypto analyst Rony Kapoor (@LearnRony) shared a comparative chart analysis between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on X, stating: “Next leg up in SHIB will be like DOGE? Shib looks like big Cup & Handle pattern forming like doge before it run turbo. Sooner or later Shiba Inu will pump!!!” The chart for DOGE illustrates a clear “Cup and Handle” formation—a bullish continuation pattern that often precedes a significant price breakout. DOGE’s handle formed near the $0.21 mark, and following a period of consolidation, the token rallied to a peak of approximately $0.48. This move represented a substantial 128% increase from the breakout point. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Similarly, SHIB’s chart indicates the potential formation of a Cup and Handle pattern, with the structure still developing. The current trading price is hovering around $0.000030, with resistance levels identified at $0.000038—the anticipated handle resistance. If SHIB follows a trajectory similar to DOGE, a successful breakout could target a price level around $0.000087, based on the proportional increase observed in DOGE’s previous movement. Technical indicators such as the Fibonacci retracement levels support this analysis. SHIB is currently trading below the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.000032. A break above this level could see SHIB targeting the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.000038. Subsequent targets include the yearly high from March at $0.00004569. Notably, the all-time high of $0.00008854 aligns closely with the projected target from the Cup and Handle pattern identified by Kapoor.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 23:43:00

Ethereum’s price took a battering, while Pepe coin (PEPE) also lost ground. Both are recovering lost price points after a recent rally. Meanwhile, bullish signals for IntelMarkets INTL offer a jump to $0.07 as its Stage 7 concludes. IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making waves with an impressive presale, hinting at a possible surge. Analysts predict that IntelMarkets INTL, a novel AI crypto, will also ride this bullish wave. Its innovative blend of AI and DeFi, which aims to reshape the crypto trading scene, has caught investors’ attention. Tipped to outperform PEPE, the top-performing meme coin, this is a new DeFi project to watch out for. Ethereum (ETH) Price Ready to Close 2024 Over $4,000 ETH is a top altcoin, and the price of Ethereum managed to withstand the bearish markets of last week and sustain its upward momentum. The Ethereum price climbed by 4% in the past seven days but is still trading at above $3,500. With a 32% rise on the monthly chart, it cements its status as one of the top crypto coins. During the year, Ethereum prices touched a high of $4,000. While there has been a major dip since then, the current market sentiments seem likely to push it above this level in the coming days. Seven-day technical indicators like the Hull Moving Average and Momentum are at sell, while the 14-day RSI is at neutral for the short term. Community sentiment is still bullish today but is moving towards bearish at 59%. Source: CoinMarketCap Pepecoin (PEPE) Retraces After Massive Price Rally After its remarkable surge in November, PEPE started dipping, losing over 10% in price over the past week. It has recovered and experienced a rise of 2.8% over the weekend. The coin is still highly volatile, while community sentiment remains bullish. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators like the RSI are mainly neutral for day trading, while 30-day technical indicators are divided between neutral and buy for the coin. People are moving into positions with PEPE, and many are opting to accumulate IntelMarkets (INTL) for its upcoming price pump. Whales’ Find a New Winner: IntelMarkets (INTL) IntelMarkets (INTL) is a new AI crypto that is stirring up a lot of attention. Its current presale is in the news, having raised over $2.7 million. Its major growth potential and cross-AI-DeFi product utility are its core appeals, generating sustained demand. In stage seven of the ICO, a token sells for just $0.064. This low entry makes picking up the INTL token easy, while its projected gains bring whales to the presales. Providing a low entry, the projected 50x gain after its debut makes it a whale favorite—retailers are also doubling down. As it approaches its ICO, investors are betting big and overlooking top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and PEPE. Besides its significant upside potential, INTL’s future transformation of the crypto trading scene with AI puts it in the spotlight. Offering a merger of all the advantages of AI technology, blockchain, and DeFi, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels. Its first commercial application of AI technology with a proprietary Layer-1 blockchain offers access to crypto trading assets. IntelMarkets has a range of advanced processing tools to improve trading performance. Conclusion For crypto investors looking to pick up guaranteed altcoins, joining the IntelMarkets’ INTL presale is necessary. The AI Crypto token has stolen the spotlight with its ongoing crypto presale. It also benefits from steep Ethereum prices and PEPE’s volatility.

He claims that if the Bitcoin price climbed from $2 to $97,000, so could the XRP price. His outrageous prediction is shining a spotlight on XRP’s long-term potential, which is driven by increasing adoption and legal victories. However, as XRP gains traction, an undervalued altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , with high-growth potential, is emerging as a worthy rival. With its cutting-edge features, AI integration, and practical utility, RCOF is poised to mirror and possibly even outdo XRP’s gains. $97,000 XRP Price Prediction: Can it reach Bitcoin Price levels? Analysts like BowTiedBull @BowTiedBull, are increasingly optimistic about XRP’s potential to reach ambitious XRP price levels, including hitting $97,000 like the Bitcoin price. This extraordinary projection isn’t baseless; it is fueled by several factors that showcase XRP’s growing adoption and relevance in the current market. XRP’s utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments is gaining traction among banks and payment providers. This is driving demand for the token, pushing up the XRP price. Ripple’s partnerships with major financial institutions continue to strengthen XRP’s position as a cornerstone in global financial infrastructure and drive up the XRP price. These partnerships position XRP as a utility tool for financial institutions and underscore Ripple’s commitment to promoting financial inclusion. Ripple’s recent legal victory over the SEC has been pivotal in the 409% rise in the XRP price over the past month. This ruling alleviated some of XRP’s regulatory uncertainty, reigniting investor confidence and paving the way for institutional adoption. With more legal clarity, the XRP price could grow tremendously, mirroring the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin’s deflationary model, with its halving cycles, is a big contributor to the Bitcoin price growth. XRP’s capped supply and rising demand are creating scarcity. As demand grows, the XRP price could climb higher, making BowTiedBull’s $97,000 prediction more plausible. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Set to Mirror XRP Price Gains While the XRP price chases Bitcoin price-like levels, its ambitious target spotlights RCO Finance , a Ripple rival with immense potential to achieve massive returns at a fraction of the price. RCOF’s ecosystem blends AI, DeFi, and real-world utility to deliver more value and exponential growth. Its AI integration allows RCOF to provide AI-powered investment and trading tools designed to improve and streamline the investing process. These tools provide real-time market insights, automated trading strategies, and predictive analytics, empowering users to maximize returns.

This eliminates crypto-fiat conversions, simplifies the investment process, and helps users create a well-rounded portfolio more easily. With every transaction, RCOF burns a portion of its token supply, ensuring scarcity and long-term value appreciation for holders. This deflationary model helps increase the token’s value and incentivizes long-term holding. Reducing its circulating supply allows RCOF to create a more stable and valuable asset for its investors. Transparency and trust are paramount in crypto. To demonstrate the platform’s transparency and integrity, RCOF’s smart contracts and code have undergone a rigorous SolidProof audit , guaranteeing the security of its ecosystem. Don’t Just Watch XRP’s Rise: Ride The wave with RCOF The journey of the XRP price to similar levels as the Bitcoin price, however optimistic, might take a while (read years). Luckily, the opportunity to achieve similar gains but faster is already here with RCO Finance. Backed by cutting-edge technology, deflationary tokenomics, a SolidProof audit, and a low entry price, RCOF is set to deliver extraordinary returns that could outpace XRP’s. Priced at $0.0777, the ongoing presale is the perfect chance to purchase tokens and secure your place in this forward-thinking, fast-growing project. Early birds get to enjoy this discounted price and also get a bonus to boost their gains. You don’t have to wait for XRP for massive gains.

The price has rallied 60 percent in the last seven days and according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP is in a strong bullish trend on the larger time frames despite encountering resistance. The analyst also observed that XRP failed to follow through on a breakout past the $2.80 level, which acted as a short-term resistance. After a brief push higher, the price quickly rejected, breaking back down. Major Resistance Around $3 XRP has encountered significant resistance near the $3 level, a crucial psychological point and also a Fibonacci extension. XRP’s all-time high (ATH) is just slightly above $3, around $3.30. This makes the $3 mark an even more critical point for the price action since it’s very close to the ATH. Typically, when the price approaches an ATH, it tends to face resistance due to the historical significance of that price point. Short-Term Pullback XRP has faced a small pullback after reaching the $3 resistance. This is normal in bullish markets, and it doesn’t mean the market is turning bearish. Short-term pullbacks can happen even during larger upward trends. Given the rejection at $3 and the current price behavior, it’s possible we could see a deeper pullback in the short term. A pullback could test lower support levels, such as $2.50 or even $2.30, providing a better entry point for those looking to re-enter long positions. Sustained Bullish Trend : However, despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term outlook remains bullish. XRP is still in a broader upward trend, and these pullbacks could provide opportunities for traders to accumulate more positions at favorable prices.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 00:36:46

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS.

However, some new tokens that started out with market caps below $1 million ended up striking a chord in the market, and going on to achieve market caps in the $100s of millions. The prospect of finding that one 100x gem is a key reason why traders brave the risks of the highly volatile and unpredictable DEX markets. Such traders often employ tools like DEXTools as they hunt for trending tokens. Here are some of the top crypto gainers today that will likely be catching their attention. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools – Which Are They? Nothing (VOID) A new Solana meme coin called Nothing (VOID) is one of the top crypto gainers today, having rallied 3,800% in the past 24 hours to a market cap of just over $12 million, per DEXTools . VOID has seen an impressive $12 million in trading volumes since its launch earlier in the day, and has amassed a respectable $700,000 in mostly locked liquidity. That said, its lack of engagement on social media platforms like X suggest it probably won’t retain value for long. Nothing may soon reach its real value, as implied by its name. That suggests it’s not a good candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS) Another Solana meme coin amongst the top crypto gainers today is Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS), which was last up 3,300% in the past 24 hours. Per DEXTools , its market cap remained tiny at just $156,000 with tiny liquidity of around $28,200. The Christmas-themed meme coin is doing a better job of generating hype on X than Nothing, posting entertaining new memes roughly every hour. The meme coin has also paid for ads and boosts, so may stand a solid chance of reaching million dollar status. Quick 10x gains are certainly a decent probability for JEETMAS, though, as with most new meme coins, this one will likely fade to zero soon. Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW) A new Depart of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) inspired Ethereum meme coin called Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW), which appears to be referencing the idea of the D.O.G.E. taking a chainsaw to the US government in its cost-cutting efforts, is another one of the top crypto gainers today. Per DEXTools , it was last up 6,500% in the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of around $300,000 with $70,000 in liquidity. CHAINSAW could do well in the weeks ahead as the countdown to the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump in the White House begins. Once Trump arrives, the D.O.G.E will get to work. And D.O.G.E-related meme coins could do very well. Of course, that doesn’t mean CHAINSAW will perform well. There will be millions of other similar meme coins vying for attention and mind-share. Most will be abject failures. Perhaps a better way for investors to do well in the meme coin market would be to instead get involved in meme coin presales. By running a presale, a meme coin gives itself a chance to build community hype and fund marketing, product and community development initiatives. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is a great example of a new meme coin project that has had huge success in doing all of these things. The project has raised a whopping more than $70 million in funds from early investors, and is putting these funds to work to build a leading web3 ecosystem. Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution and its developers have been busily building out all manner of dApps, including a DEX, a meme coin launch platform called Pepe Pump Pad, a block explorer, a bridge and much more. Just 10 days out from the end of the presale, PEPU is currently valued at around $100 million. But this is meme coin that has a high chance of reaching billion-dollar status – it has the funds, the community, the hype, the strong use case/technology. Learn more about Pepe Unchained , and why analysts at cryptonews.com rank it as one of their top presale picks for 2024, in the below video.

The ISC token will remain functional, but other features like its points system and ecosystem integrations will cease. ISC’s co-founder, Richard, announced via X that the company would be pivoting to FxSwap full-time. According to Richard, ISC's failure to find product market fit (PMF), even after exceeding the original budget, influenced the decision to close the company. “After working for more than 2 years on ISC, this decision is heart-wrenching. Especially considering that every week, we’re ever closer to a breakthrough. ISC launched at $1.54 and is now sitting at $1.81. It works,” Richard said.

The firm stated it is keen to launch under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) while upholding the regulations. Ripple posted through their X platform : Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. ~Ripple The launch of RLUSD stablecoin is set to redefine Ripple’s primary use case, moving it beyond its “memecoin” perception. The RLUSD will battle with market giants like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC as it will feature on XRPL and Ethereum. The stablecoin can kickstart DeFi activity on XRPL if it matches a fraction of USDT’s $134 billion in circulation. December 4 was marked for the big announcement Earlier, Ripple signaled that December 4 would be a tentative launch day, anticipating regulatory clearance by then. Although the launch is delayed, Ripple is set to sell its stablecoin, the RLUSD, to the public. Such a feat will see the firm grow into a big player in New York’s regulated digital finance market and stablecoin ecosystem. In June, Ripple officially unveiled its stablecoin, which it characterizes as a 1:1 USD-pegged asset fully backed by USD deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Later in the year, the stablecoin went through beta testing on the Ethereum main net, XRP ledger, and Ripple’s decentralized blockchain. Ripple’s CEO says Paul Atkin will bring back common sense to the SEC While announcing the delayed launch, Ripple’s CEO also shared remarks about the SEC. Brad Garlinghouse supported the nomination of Paul Atkins for the SEC chairperson position. He believes that Atkins is an outstanding choice at the helm of SEC. Ripple CEO notes Atkins will bring back common sense to the agency. According to one industry source, Atkins recently voiced a desire to let GOP Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” lead on crypto policy alongside her fellow GOP Commissioner Mark Uyeda. Brad also stated that with the team, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto. He believes such changes will restore freedom of choice and spur economic growth and innovations in America.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 301,800 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the Ethereum-based decentralized oracle Chainlink ( LINK ) is poised to spark a five-wave surge to a new all-time high. Bluntz relies on the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that states a bullish asset often witnesses a five-wave rally. Says Bluntz, “Major breakout on LINK today, all you have to do is take one look at LINK/BTC before you realize that you are probably not late and still early. It underperformed pretty much everything for the entirety of the bull run and now seems to be playing turbo catch-up. Probably one of the very few I would categorize as a dino coin that isn’t complete vaporware.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that LINK will explode to a new record high of $70. At time of writing, LINK is worth $24.44. Turning to Near ( NEAR ), the analyst says he’s bullish on the Ethereum rival after it breached a diagonal resistance on its Bitcoin pair (NEAR/ BTC ). “Revenge of the dinos. NEAR/BTC pair finally broke out.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $7.42. Bluntz also thinks that the Solana ( SOL )-based meme token dogwifhat ( WIF ) is primed to outperform the broader meme sector. “Huge six-month+ basing/inverse head and shoulder structure on US dollar pair. Double daily divergences against doge and double 12-hour bull divergences against PEPE. If you are playing memes, you want to outperform DOGE, that should always be the goal.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $3.31.

A crypto analyst has underscored why this support level is crucial for Bitcoin’s next price rally, as it could set the stage for a potential retest above the $100,000 All-Time High (ATH). Bitcoin Price Retests $96,400 To Trigger Surge To $100,000 Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital took to X (formerly Twitter) on December 4 to inform his over 518,000 followers about the current Bitcoin price action and future direction. The analyst suggested that if Bitcoin successfully tests the $96,440 support level, it could trigger a price increase to $100,068. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Sharing a price chart, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin has persistently retested its series of Lower Highs, establishing them as a key support level. In his Bitcoin price chart, “Lower Highs” means that each successive high point is lower than the previous point. This development is typically observed during a downtrend. However, with Bitcoin now treating these lower highs as support, it indicates a potential shift in the market, suggesting that prices may be stabilizing after declining. Rekt Capital also highlighted that Bitcoin is producing longer downside wicks, indicating that its price declined significantly during the time frame, but buyers stepped in. The analyst emphasized that Bitcoin is currently grabbing liquidity at lower prices without breaking below the key support trendline. A liquidity grab occurs when large volumes of orders at key price levels are triggered unexpectedly. In the case of Bitcoin, “grabbing liquidity” refers to the market dipping into levels where buy orders are clustered, enabling large players to execute trades. Rekt Capital has disclosed that, as long as this trend continues, Bitcoin will eventually move back up to reclaim the $96,440 level. Recovering this crucial support will allow Bitcoin to reach and even surpass the $100,000 milestone. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Bear Case Scenario Looking at the price chart presented by Rekt Capital, several support levels are highlighted, indicating price levels that Bitcoin could fall to if it fails to reclaim the $96,440 mark. While current Bitcoin price action indicates that it could potentially reach $100,000, the analyst has suggested that if the pioneer cryptocurrency fails to hold the $96,440 support, it might retest a lower support level of around $91,070. As indicated by the red line on the price chart, $91,070 is a critical price level for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency also falls below this level, it could crash to new lows around $87,325. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $96,737, marking a 3.24% increase over the past week. A drop below the $87,300 level would represent more than a 10% crash from Bitcoin’s current value.

Neiro had a lot of promise with its bold vision and rapidly growing community, but for those who couldn’t get in early, it might feel like the ship had already sailed. Fortunately, there’s still hope— BTFD Coin is offering a second chance for anyone who missed out. With its incredibly strong presale performance and a chance to grab it at the current price of $0.000064, BTFD Coin is your opportunity to make a comeback and position yourself for massive gains in 2025. Let’s take a closer look at both Neiro and BTFD Coin to understand what makes BTFD Coin such an irresistible second chance. Neiro: The Meme Coin with High Hopes Neiro’s ICO raised some serious eyebrows. With a bold narrative, a flashy community, and promising tokenomics, it felt like it could be the next big meme coin to take the world by storm. The early stages of the ICO saw over $2.5 million in funds raised, and the project drew significant attention for its viral marketing tactics and community-driven approach. It seemed like everyone was on board with Neiro—its catchy branding and innovative use of blockchain tech created FOMO in the market, making it one of the most talked-about coins of 2024. However, for those who couldn’t secure their spot in the presale or ICO, it’s been a bit of a waiting game. The price surged quickly, and as expected, the volatility of meme coins took its toll. Some early holders made huge returns, while others are holding out for bigger gains. If you belong to neither group, you might feel like an outsider waiting for the next big shot. Well, don’t fret just yet. BTFD Coin: Your Chance at Financial Redemption Here’s where BTFD Coin comes into play. If you missed out on Neiro, now’s your time to strike back with a new opportunity that is already showing massive potential. BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of impressive, with over $900,000 raised, and the presale is still going strong. Over 21 billion BTFD coins have already been sold, and more than 2,000 investors have hopped on board, forming the foundation of what’s shaping up to be a thriving community. Unlike other meme coins that rely heavily on hype, BTFD Coin has a more comprehensive roadmap that goes beyond just ‘buying the dip’. The project is community-driven, has a solid utility plan, and offers features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and high staking rewards. For those who missed out on the frenzy of Neiro, BTFD Coin is poised to deliver the next wave of exciting opportunities for investors. Investment Opportunity: How a $3,000 Investment Could Pay Off Let’s break down what a $3,000 investment in BTFD Coin could look like. At the current presale price of $0.000064, your $3,000 would buy you 46,875,000 BTFD coins. If the price rises to just $0.0006—a conservative estimate considering the current momentum—that investment could grow to $28,125. That’s a potential return of 843%! Considering BTFD Coin’s growth trajectory, this could be a smart play for anyone who missed the boat on Neiro but still wants to get in on a meme coin that’s on the rise. Why BTFD Coin Is the Meme Coin You Need Right Now So, what makes BTFD Coin such a compelling second chance? Here’s a rundown of why it should be at the top of your list for potential meme coin investments: Proven Presale Success: With over $900,000 raised and 21 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin is gaining serious traction in the market. The strong presale performance is an indication that there is plenty of interest in the project. A Strong Community: Over 2,000 Bulls are already holding BTFD Coins, and the community continues to grow. Community-driven projects tend to thrive in the meme coin space, and BTFD Coin’s strong following gives it a solid foundation for long-term success. Real Utility: BTFD Coin offers tangible utility in the form of high staking rewards and a Play-to-Earn game. This adds intrinsic value to the coin and makes it more than just a speculative asset. Massive Growth Potential: With the presale still in full swing, there’s plenty of room for early investors to lock in great prices before the coin hits exchanges. If the price rises as expected, the potential for high returns is huge.

This move is part of Trump’s broader goal to create a more crypto-friendly environment, a message that has been well received by the digital currency community. Atkins’ nomination is seen as a strategic choice to replace Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair, who has faced criticism for his strict regulations on the $3.5 trillion crypto market. Trump, a vocal supporter of crypto, expressed his excitement for Atkins’ nomination on his Truth Social platform, calling him a leader who supports common-sense regulations and understands the importance of digital assets in the country’s economy. “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,” Trump said as he made the big announcement. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, currently serves on the advisory board of digital securities platform Securitize. Notably, Securitize is a company Ripple invested in back in 2018, and its CEO recently spoke at Ripple’s Swell 2024 event. Carlos Domingo, the founder and CEO of Securitize told Yahoo Finance, “He’s (Paul) certainly a person that is known for streamlining regulation and being very pro digital assets, and very knowledgeable in the industry. There’s this big debate about whether certain digital assets are commodities or securities.” Legal Expert Calls For Quick Actions However, Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton said that if Paul Atkins doesn’t fire or demote certain individuals and completely dismantle the SEC’s crypto unit, he’s not the right choice for the job. According to Deaton, there is no need for a separate crypto unit at the SEC; a general fraud unit should handle all fraud cases.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 01:16:09

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 01:30:00

This innovative platform is being hailed as “smarter” than Solana , with its unique approach to combining artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Priced at just $0.002 during its presale , Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in the next wave of decentralized innovation, attracting both enterprise clients and retail investors alike. Lightchain AI: Smarter Technology, Broader Potential While Solana is known for its speed and scalability, Lightchain AI brings a level of intelligence to blockchain that sets it apart. By integrating AI capabilities into its core infrastructure, Lightchain AI enables real-time data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning directly on-chain. Why Lightchain AI Is Smarter: AI Integration: Lightchain AI’s platform allows developers to leverage AI for real-time decision-making and complex computations, making it a natural fit for industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): This innovative consensus mechanism not only reduces energy consumption but also ensures scalability without sacrificing speed. Meme Coin Pump Pad: While offering enterprise solutions, Lightchain AI doesn’t shy away from retail appeal, featuring a meme coin pump pad to attract broader participation. Presale Opportunity: At $0.002, Lightchain AI offers an unparalleled chance to invest in a blockchain project with massive growth potential. Lightchain AI combines enterprise-grade functionality with retail-friendly features, positioning it as a versatile and forward-thinking blockchain solution. Solana’s Strengths and Challenges Solana has long been a market leader, praised for its ability to handle 65,000 transactions per second with low fees. Its focus on speed and developer-friendly infrastructure has made it a popular choice for DeFi and NFT projects. What Solana Does Well: High Performance: Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) consensus ensures fast, low-cost transactions. Expanding Ecosystem: With a growing number of DeFi, NFT, and gaming projects, Solana remains a hub of blockchain activity. Developer Adoption: Solana’s tools and resources make it a preferred platform for building decentralized applications. However, Solana’s focus on speed comes at a cost. Network outages and scalability challenges have left room for competitors like Lightchain AI to step in with smarter, more versatile solutions. Lightchain AI vs. Solana: A Comparative Look While Solana excels in speed and scalability, Lightchain AI’s integration of AI technology adds a layer of intelligence and utility that Solana lacks. This makes Lightchain AI better suited for industries that require complex computations and predictive analytics. The Smart Investment for December As analysts highlight the strengths of Lightchain AI, its $0.002 presale price offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors. With its focus on AI-driven solutions and its ability to cater to both enterprise and retail markets, Lightchain AI is emerging as a smarter, more versatile blockchain platform than Solana. Seize the Opportunity with Lightchain AI With its innovative technology, scalable solutions, and early-stage pricing, Lightchain AI is leading the charge as the smarter blockchain investment this December.

Polkadot has been making headlines with its cutting-edge scalability and decentralised solutions. Meanwhile, Bittensor TAO is gaining traction for pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence on blockchain. But there’s another name emerging as a true game-changer: Qubetics ($TICS) . What makes Qubetics unique is its focus on tokenisation and real-world solutions, setting it apart from its competitors. Whether you’re a tech entrepreneur or an everyday investor, Qubetics’ tokenised asset marketplace promises unmatched accessibility and growth potential. Plus, with its presale offering jaw-dropping ROI predictions, this project demands attention from anyone serious about diversifying their portfolio. How Qubetics Reinvents Real World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is taking asset tokenisation to a whole new level. Imagine a world where you can fractionally own a piece of real estate, intellectual property, or even fine art without navigating complex intermediaries. That’s exactly what Qubetics offers with its tokenised asset marketplace. Leveraging blockchain technology, the platform democratises ownership, allowing investors to access exclusive opportunities previously limited to the wealthy elite. Take, for instance, a small investor interested in the commercial real estate market. Traditionally, they would face insurmountable barriers, from hefty capital requirements to lengthy paperwork. With Qubetics, they can invest fractionally, owning a share in a lucrative property for as little as the price of a single token. This access unlocks new avenues for wealth creation without the usual hassles. The marketplace also brings transparency and liquidity to previously illiquid markets. Picture an entrepreneur looking to trade tokenised intellectual property rights. Instead of negotiating opaque agreements, they can list their tokenised assets on Qubetics’ marketplace and attract a global pool of buyers in real-time. This ease of use fosters financial inclusivity, making Qubetics an indispensable player among the best altcoins to join now. For more insights into the Qubetics marketplace, you can watch this informative video . If you’re considering the best altcoins to join now, Qubetics is an opportunity worth exploring. Why Qubetics Presale Offers Unmatched Potential Currently in its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 266 million $TICS tokens , raising a staggering $4.3 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282, with a 10% price hike set for the upcoming 12th stage. Every presale stage lasts seven days, ending Sunday at midnight, ensuring consistent upward momentum. Now let’s talk about the returns. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by presale end , translating into a 783% ROI. Post-presale projections are even more ambitious, with $TICS expected to climb to $1, $5, and $15 in subsequent stages. For example, a $4,500 investment at the current price secures approximately 159,574 tokens. At $15 post-mainnet launch, that investment could balloon to $2,393,610. Polkadot Continues to Lead in Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot has cemented its position as a leader in blockchain interoperability, and recent updates prove it isn’t slowing down. The protocol has expanded its parachain ecosystem, with over 40 parachains actively contributing to its decentralised network. These parachains bring unique functionalities to Polkadot, from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces, enhancing its utility for developers and users alike. According to recent reports, Polkadot’s daily active users have grown by over 18% in the past month, reaching new heights in engagement. This surge coincides with its Kusama test network’s successful rollout of enhanced governance features, a testament to Polkadot’s innovation. Polkadot’s staking mechanism also deserves a mention. With an annual yield of 14%, staking has become a go-to choice for investors looking to maximise returns while supporting network security. For anyone searching for the best altcoins to join now, Polkadot offers both technological sophistication and attractive investment opportunities. Bittensor TAO Revolutionises Blockchain-Based Artificial Intelligence Bittensor TAO is rewriting the rulebook for blockchain and AI integration. As decentralised AI networks become the next frontier, Bittensor is ahead of the curve, allowing users to monetise their contributions to AI model training. The project has seen a 22% increase in active validators this quarter, underlining its growing traction among blockchain enthusiasts. One of Bittensor’s standout features is its staking model, which incentivises long-term participation. Recent updates revealed that its network processed over 1.2 million transactions last month, reflecting its robust scalability. Additionally, TAO token holders are reaping the benefits of an impressive annual yield of 12%, making it a solid pick for investors focused on passive income. In terms of adoption, partnerships with research institutions and AI startups are positioning Bittensor as a leader in its niche. Whether you’re an AI developer or an investor eyeing the best altcoins to join now, Bittensor TAO is worth considering for its innovative approach and growing ecosystem. Why These Altcoins Should Be on Your Radar The cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, and projects like Qubetics, Polkadot, and Bittensor TAO exemplify the industry’s potential for innovation and growth.

Recently, Toncoin and EOS have grabbed attention with their strong comebacks, setting benchmarks in scalability and adoption. Toncoin is riding high after its seamless integration with Telegram’s Web3 wallet, while EOS has surged thanks to a major tokenomics overhaul. But the real question is, can these projects keep up with the growing demands of the digital economy? Qubetics ($TICS) is a blockchain project transforming the cross-border payment landscape, addressing challenges like high fees, delays, and lack of transparency. By tackling these inefficiencies head-on, it is solving real-world financial issues that have often been overlooked. With its presale now in the 11th stage, Qubetics offers investors an exciting opportunity to secure early-stage returns with significant growth potential. Here’s a closer look at how these altcoins compare. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Cross-Border Payments With Speed, Security, and Affordability Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a practical solution for global financial challenges. Picture a small business owner in Los Angeles importing artisan goods from Europe. Traditional payment methods would mean waiting days for transfers and losing profits to high bank fees and currency conversions. Qubetics offers instant settlements, drastically reducing delays and costs. Now think about freelancers. A graphic designer in Toronto working for clients in Singapore can skip the headaches of delayed international wire transfers. Payments are processed swiftly and securely through Qubetics’ blockchain-based system, improving cash flow and client satisfaction. Families sending remittances? They can rely on the platform to make sure their hard-earned money reaches loved ones fast, without burning a hole in their wallets. With transparency, speed, and affordability at its core, Qubetics transforms how people and businesses move money globally. If you’re curious about its functionality, check out this video for more insights. Why Qubetics Presale Is the Talk of the Town The Qubetics presale is more than just an investment; it’s an opportunity. Now in its 11th stage, over 266 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.3 million from 6,200 holders. At $0.0282 per token, the presale offers an entry point that’s hard to ignore. Each week, the price increases by 10%, with the next stage starting Sunday at midnight. What makes this even more exciting are the returns. Analysts predict that by the end of the presale, $TICS will be priced at $0.25—a whopping 783% ROI. Post-presale, the token is expected to hit $1 (3,434% ROI) and could soar to $15 after the mainnet launch, offering an eye-watering 52,912% ROI. For example, if someone invests $2,000 now, they could see their investment grow to $105,824 if these projections hold true. Toncoin Keeps Growing Its Ecosystem Toncoin, the powerhouse behind The Open Network, is leveraging its ties to Telegram to create a massive Web3 ecosystem. With over 700 million active Telegram users potentially engaging with its Web3 wallet, Toncoin is set for mainstream adoption. The token has already seen a 27% price jump since late November, bringing its market cap to a hefty $15.3 billion. This surge reflects not just market confidence but also Toncoin’s ability to scale efficiently for decentralised apps and financial tools. If this trajectory continues, Toncoin could soon breach the $10 mark, cementing its place as one of the best altcoins to invest in now. EOS Bounces Back With New Upgrades EOS, a blockchain once declared dead by critics, is proving the doubters wrong with its latest updates. The platform has surged by 250% from its yearly low, thanks to its reworked tokenomics and growing appeal among developers. The revamped EOS Network is attracting decentralised applications and partnerships, ensuring it remains a strong player in the blockchain space. For those looking for altcoins with scalability and longevity, EOS is regaining its shine. Conclusion Each of these altcoins—Qubetics, Toncoin, and EOS—offers something valuable for investors and developers. Toncoin is capitalising on its integration with Telegram and its ability to scale, making it a strong contender for widespread adoption. EOS is staging an impressive comeback with revamped tokenomics and renewed interest from developers. However, Qubetics stands out for its ability to address real-world issues, particularly in cross-border payments, while offering investors unparalleled growth potential. With a presale already raising millions and analysts projecting remarkable ROI figures, it’s clear that Qubetics is carving a niche that others have yet to fill. For those seeking innovation with a solid foundation, Qubetics offers a compelling narrative and the potential for significant long-term rewards.

Staying ahead of the curve means spotting the gems before they shine—and that’s where today’s story begins. While Cardano’s latest bullish trend has traders buzzing and Bitcoin inches closer to a jaw-dropping $100,000 milestone, there’s a new player quietly making waves: Qubetics ($TICS). Positioned as a game-changer for blockchain development, Qubetics is already turning heads with its powerful tools and a presale that’s generating serious excitement. This article dives into all three coins—Qubetics, Cardano, and Bitcoin—but focuses on why Qubetics is a top crypto to invest in this week. Let’s break it down. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Development with Innovation At the heart of Qubetics is its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, a development platform that’s a dream for beginners and seasoned blockchain developers. This isn’t just another IDE; it’s a fully visual environment that lets users build blockchain applications without breaking a sweat. Imagine drag-and-drop functionality for creating features like token management or user authentication. You don’t need to be a coding wizard—intuitive forms let you easily define logic and parameters, while a code snippet library provides ready-made solutions for complex tasks. And it doesn’t stop there. Qubetics integrates AI-driven development tools that turbocharge your workflow. Think smart contract generation tailored to your needs, instant code suggestions, error detection, and even optimisation tips for better performance and security. Whether you’re a startup founder or a hobbyist exploring blockchain, Qubetics makes development fast, efficient, and approachable. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session packed with insights about its roadmap, features, and community-driven focus. With tools like these, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being hailed as the top crypto to invest in this week. Cardano: Bullish Momentum in Action Cardano is showing impressive strength, riding a bullish channel that’s caught traders’ attention. The ADA/USD pair recently bounced off $0.80, hinting at growing accumulation and setting the stage for a breakout. The pivotal moment? A golden cross, where the 50-period SMA moved above the 200-period SMA, confirming a sustained uptrend. With these moving averages acting as dynamic support, Cardano’s price action looks poised for continued growth. Moments like these keep it among the top cryptos, especially for traders seeking technical-driven opportunities. Bitcoin Nears $100K Amid Speculation of Crypto-Friendly Policies Bitcoin is once again flirting with historic highs, trading just shy of $100,000. The recent surge—over 40% since November 5—comes as President-elect Donald Trump pledges to reverse restrictive policies on digital assets. The idea of the U.S. becoming a global hub for crypto, combined with talks of a strategic national Bitcoin reserve, has fueled investor confidence. However, not everyone’s convinced. Some analysts argue that Trump’s staunch support for the U.S. dollar could limit these ambitions. Still, the excitement is palpable with Bitcoin’s price within striking distance of six figures. It’s no surprise it remains a top crypto for those looking to ride the momentum. Qubetics Presale Soars: The Top Crypto to Watch Now Here’s where the real excitement lies: Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 11, with $TICS tokens priced at just $0.028. Each weekly phase brings a 10% price hike, and the final stage promises a 20% surge, so getting in early could mean huge rewards. The presale has already raised over $4.3 million, signalling strong community interest and confidence. Now, let’s talk about potential. Analysts predict that if $TICS were to hit $10, a modest $200 investment could balloon to a staggering $70,689.80, delivering an ROI of 35,244.90%. And if $TICS climbs even further to $15, that same investment would soar to $106,034.70, an ROI of 52,917.35%. Imagine the possibilities—this is why so many are calling Qubetics one of the top cryptos to invest in this week . If you’re waiting for the perfect time, this is it. Don’t let the next big opportunity pass you by. Conclusion: Qubetics Steals the Spotlight Each of these cryptos offers a compelling story. Cardano’s bullish channel highlights its technical potential, while Bitcoin’s climb toward $100K reflects growing market optimism and policy shifts. But Qubetics stands apart. With its cutting-edge tools, AI-driven development, and a presale that’s turning heads, it’s not just another token—it’s an opportunity to shape the future of blockchain. If you’re searching for the top crypto to invest in this week, Qubetics is the clear standout. Don’t just watch from the sidelines—join the presale and be part of something groundbreaking. Time is ticking, and so are the price hikes. Are you in?

If confirmed, Isaacman will become NASA’s 15th administrator, succeeding Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. Isaacman is the CEO of Shift4, a fintech company that processes over $260 billion annually for more than 200,000 clients. He is also recognized for his collaboration with Elon Musk and SpaceX, a key commercial partner of NASA. In 2021, Isaacman financed and led the Inspiration4 mission, a private spaceflight aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Resilience. He returned to space in September 2024 as commander of the Polaris Dawn mission, where he became the first private citizen to perform a “spacewalk.” Extensive Aviation and Business Background Before his space ventures, Isaacman was a certified pilot for various civilian and military aircraft, even flying in stunt formations as part of an aeronautical team. In the business realm, Isaacman co-founded Draken International, a defense aerospace company and U.S. Department of Defense contractor. Trump highlighted this experience in his Truth Social announcement, describing him as a dynamic leader in both business and aerospace. “I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Jared will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in space science, technology, and exploration,” Trump stated. Part of a Broader Transition Strategy Isaacman’s nomination comes amidst other major appointments by the Trump transition team. These include pro-crypto Paul Atkins for SEC commissioner, University of Maryland professor Michael Faulkender for deputy Treasury secretary, and potential moves to replace Pete Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as secretary of defense. Trump’s cabinet picks signal a mix of innovation and strategic leadership for his upcoming administration.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 01:49:12

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 02:28:00

In a matter of four weeks, the coin reversed a bearish trend that had persisted for more than 1,000 days. With increased investor interest, experts are piling on the lofty price predictions, suggesting a rise in faith in this enterprise-grade public ledger. Related Reading: Cardano Rally Heats Up: Experts See 750% Jump Ahead The price of HBAR was $0.3173 at the time of writing. Even though the coin lost 10% in the last 24 hours, it did very well over the course of a week and a month. Notably, HBAR has maintained a huge 801% rally over the last 30 days, which has made buyers very happy. What’s driving this momentum? A combination of innovative upgrades, partnerships, and market optimism. HBAR’s rebound is more than just a price spike—it’s a transformation in how the project is positioned in the blockchain space. Aggressive Targets In The Bull Market Experts have projected a hopeful $5 for HBAR as the bull market for cryptocurrencies keeps up. A more conservative $2.50 shows great growth potential if the market peaks in April 2025. This positive attitude is not founded in conjecture alone. Hedera is getting ready for major announcements including a new privacy layer that will let consumers construct private network instances while still linked to the public ledger. Dr. Leemon Baird, co-founder of Hedera, believes that this privacy layer has the potential to change areas such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Hedera addresses significant gaps in blockchain technology by providing organizations with a safe yet interoperable solution. Ripple Partnership Boosts HBAR Adoption Hedera’s increasing integration with blockchain-based payment systems is another motivator. The technology, via Dropp, plays an important part in the Federal Reserve’s FedNow system, allowing for rapid and safe transactions. Moreover, its interaction with Ripple (XRP) proves it to be a strong rival in USD transaction handling. The likely certification of the RLUSD stablecoin by Ripple in December could help HBAR’s position in the payments ecosystem to be strengthened, therefore promoting acceptance in many sectors.

Bitcoin has reached $99k and is now approaching $100k. While many of the top 100 coins have seen some gains, only a few have been rallying strongly. While coins like XRP and ADA are up, Gala has been showing impressive performance. The Sandbox (SAND) is up by more than 15 percent in the last 24 hours and is trading close to the $1 levels. Up by more than 45 percent in the last seven days, SAND hit a range high of $1.06 before hitting a reverse and is now retesting the $0.88 levels. SAND’s ATH sits at $8.44, which was achieved three years ago. Gala has also been quietly surging and is trading close to the $0.60 levels at the time of writing. Up by more than 11 percent in the last 24 hours, Gala has surged by 55 percent this week alone. The altcoin hit a high of $0.66 in the last 24 hours and is also nearing it’s ATH which sits just above the $0.83 level. The Curve DAO token is also rising and has shifted to the green zone. Curve Finance has seen a huge surge in both market cap and trading volume, now sitting at $1.3 billion with $1.66 billion in trading volume. The rally is driven by news of BlackRock partnering with Curve and Elixir to bring traditional financial assets into DeFi. The price of Curve hit a major resistance level at $1.25, which is a key point to watch. If it breaks above this level, the next target could be $1.50. However, there might be some pullback before that happens. Overall, Curve is showing strong bullish momentum, and investors should keep an eye on these key price levels.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|CRV|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 02:33:50

BREAKING: #BITCOIN HITS $100,000 FOR FIRST TIME EVER! https://t.co/XwdsvLUycN — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 5, 2024 The next logical target for Bitcoin is another 10x away — $1,000,000. It is now no longer a question of if Bitcoin will achieve this, but when. When it comes to Bitcoin as a store of value, it has won. It’s off to the races from here, any price action is now possible. And one can only assume that going from $100,000 to $1,000,000 is going to be a lot easier than going from $0 to $100,000. During this rise to $100,000, Bitcoin has cemented itself as a legitimate asset, and everyone who has taken any meaningful amount of time to research and understand it is buying more. Everyday people around the world have adopted it for savings, payments, and financial privacy, nation states have adopted it as legal tender and are passing very pro-Bitcoin legislation, and now Wall Street firms are joining in. For someone who has been around for 7 years in the Bitcoin world, it feels unreal. Congratulations to all the bitcoin holders, old and new, on achieving this milestone. For those who have been HODLing through the bear markets, educating themselves on why Bitcoin is so important, accumulating BTC and ignoring the FUD, and onboarding new Bitcoiners — I salute you. You deserve this and all the gains that have been made on this journey. This was not easy, you did not get lucky. It takes conviction and strength to be able to buy and hold this extremely volatile asset long term. Enjoy this moment with your friends and family, and here’s to a new era of Bitcoin — the grind towards $1,000,000. This article is a Take .

It’s small compared to the up-to-infinite price levels that succeed it. While $100,000 is a significant milestone worth pausing to recognize, it is also merely a checkpoint on Bitcoin ’s much longer, much larger journey ahead. Let’s take a moment to remember the early moments of this journey. The year Kraken was founded (2011), Bitcoin’s Dec. 31 closing price was $4.25. From that level, the value of just one of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist is now up over 2.3 million percent at BTC $100,000. BTC $100,000 has long been viewed as the next/seemingly “final” frontier for Bitcoin’s price . Laser eyes and dank memes, as well as innovative products and user experiences, have accelerated us to this point. Through years of speculation around “the world to be when Bitcoin reaches $100,000,” a common sentiment held that the $100,000 price level would somehow confer the legitimacy of “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” It would show the value of a tamper-resistant and immutable way of recording information. It would prove that decentralization had a place in modern society. But, now that we are here, those goals may seem as if they still have more to deliver. It feels like this is still only the beginning. We’ve reached a pricing milestone, but when it comes to fulfilling Satoshi’s original vision for Bitcoin – its widespread use as a borderless, worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash system – Bitcoin is still in its relative infancy. Over the short term, it’s anyone’s guess whether the price of Bitcoin will continue its sprint higher or pull back from its recent run. What is clear is that the $100,000 milestone demonstrates ongoing demand for a reliable, transparent and peer-to-peer way to transact . BTC $100,000 represents a monumental milestone in Kraken’s mission to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency, so that everyone can achieve financial freedom and inclusion. We’d like to congratulate those who have built in the space alongside us and played a role in realizing this achievement. We’d also like to congratulate our clients as they celebrate this watershed moment, while making a commitment to serve them through the next chapters of Bitcoin’s history . Join us as we reflect on the journey that got us here and commemorate this remarkable day – while we reaffirm our commitment to a future of financial freedom.

Now ahead about 130% year-to-date, bitcoin's market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2 trillion only 15 years after coming into existence. For reference, Nvidia and Apple sport market caps of about $3.5 trillion, Microsoft $3 trillion, and Google and Amazon $2.2 trillion. The market capitalization of all the gold in the world is roughly $17.7 trillion. At the forefront of this rally was the early-2024 launch of spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by asset management giants including BlackRock and Fidelity. These products have been a resounding success, securing assets under management of around $30 billion in less than one year's time. Despite the success of the ETFs, the move higher in bitcoin seemingly stalled throughout a large chunk of this year, at least in part thanks to regulatory uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election. The early November victory of crypto-friendly Donald Trump, though, spurred new legs for the rally, with bitcoin quickly taking out its March high above $73,500, then in fast time moving past $80,000, then $90,000, and finally $100,000 just minutes ago.

As Bitcoin has now crossed $100K, it’s likely altcoins will take a break. As long as Bitcoin stays above support, we could see a potential rise towards $102K, based on a 100% extension target. This level isn’t set in stone, but it’s a key level to watch. If Bitcoin breaks above this, it might even push towards $110K, although there are many possible scenarios. The support zone around $99K is crucial. Bitcoin needs to stay above the 50% retracement level for this move to hold. If the price drops below $96,885, it could signal weakness and may lead to a pullback. Why is Bitcoin Rallying? The excitement surrounding Bitcoin is fueled by the hope that Trump will bring a more crypto-friendly environment, including better regulation and the possibility of a national reserve or stockpile. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin ETFs have also surpassed $1 billion in assets, which should drive more demand as institutions become more comfortable with the asset. These institutions could further boost Bitcoin’s price. Conclusion: Bitcoin has been making headlines with its fast appreciation, but even when prices drop, it’s important to stay focused on the bigger picture. The recent price drop after hitting $99,000 didn’t last long, and as of now, it’s close to that high again. Looking ahead, Bitcoin could become an even bigger part of global financial systems, with more institutions, countries, and companies investing in it.

Investors are riding a wave of optimism as Bitcoin has surged by 45.65% since November 5, while the Altcoin market has seen an equally impressive rise of 46.57%. It seems the market is unstoppable—or there is a correction incoming? Bitcoin is charging towards $100,000, up 0.99% since yesterday, and still holding strong with a 59.23% dominance. However, a slight dip in trading volume shows traders are both bullish and cautious. Looking at the market scenario, Ran Neuner predicts that after Bitcoin hits the $100,000 mark, it will likely experience a correction, potentially dropping to between $75,000 and $80,000. He believes this pullback can happen within the next four to eight weeks, driven by the typical volatility that characterizes Bitcoin’s bull markets. This price dip may reflect the past cycles, where corrections followed major Bitcoin price surges. Is this your chance to buy the dip, before the BTC touches new highs? Let’s understand. Preparing for the Dip Neuner is gearing up for a potential Bitcoin correction by strategically adjusting his portfolio. He plans to hold 30% in cash, which will provide him the flexibility to buy during the anticipated market dip. Alongside this, he is reducing his leveraged positions and trading exposure, opting to focus on preserving his core Bitcoin holdings. This approach aims to minimize risks while positioning him to capitalize on opportunities during a pullback. He expects Bitcoin to face a 25-30% correction after reaching the $100,000 milestone, which aligns with patterns seen in previous market cycles such as 2016-17 and 2020-21. Historically, Bitcoin’s sharp corrections are a natural part of its growth trajectory, often followed by strong recoveries. Plus, Neuner highlights that altcoins typically rally when Bitcoin cools off after a major surge, as investors often redirect profits into smaller-cap tokens. With Bitcoin surging above the $100,000 level, he anticipates a similar trend this time, presenting a unique opportunity for altcoin investments at discounted prices. Despite the expected short-term volatility, Neuner remains optimistic about the crypto market’s long-term potential, fueled by regulatory shifts and investor sentiment, making this pullback a strategic buying moment. Good time to Invest in Altcoins? Overall, Neuner is optimistic about the future of crypto, even though he expects a short-term correction. He believes that in the next four years, the market will see strong growth due to changes in regulations and a shift in U.S. policies that favor crypto. Neuner sees the correction as a chance to buy altcoins at lower prices and remains confident in the long-term potential of the crypto market despite short-term ups and downs.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 02:52:58

The cryptocurrency now commands a market cap of $2 trillion, surpassing major assets like Saudi Aramco and Facebook. Experts predict Bitcoin’s price could reach $500K in the future. Bitcoin, the world’s leading crypto asset, has finally crossed the $100,000 milestone after over a decade in the making. The rally that propelled Bitcoin to this landmark began on November 4, when it traded at $66,803. The following day, Americans elected pro-Bitcoin candidate Donald Trump as president, fueling the market’s momentum. With Trump emerging victorious, the Bitcoin market quickly responded , reaching an intraday peak of $76,522 on November 6 and maintained its upward trajectory, ultimately breaching the $100K mark. This growth represents a massive 49.25% increase from its monthly low. Considering that Bitcoin traded as low as $0.04865 on July 14, 2010, the leading crypto asset has appreciated by 205,549,745% in 14 years, making it one of the most profitable investments in recent decades.

Gary Gensler Confirms resignation, XRP price surpasses the $2.3 mark. Dogecoin records increased bullish momentum, eyes to retest $0.50. With the BTC price achieving the $100,000 mark, the volatility in the cryptocurrency market has recorded a new high. Moreover, the altcoin market has experienced a significant increase, with top altcoins recording a mixed price sentiment. As the crypto market records a new high, is this a good time to stack altcoins to maximize future gains? In this article, we have covered the short-term possibilities of Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) crypto tokens. Ethereum (ETH) The ETH price has jumped 7.84% in 24 hours, resulting in it retesting its $3,900 level. Moreover, with a trading volume of $57.74 billion, the largest altcoin by market cap is currently valued at $464.169 billion. ETH-05th-Dec-2024 The EMA 50/200-day has recorded a Golden Cross in the daily time frame. This indicates a positive outlook for the ETH coin price during the upcoming time. Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of experiencing a bullish crossover with it heading toward the overbought range in the 1D time frame. This suggests an increase in the buying pressure for the altcoin in the market. If the bullish sentiment sustains, the Ethereum price will head toward its resistance level of $4.5k. On the flip side, if the bears outrun the bulls, this could result in the altcoin retesting its support trendline of $3,200 this month. Ripple (XRP) With a weekly surge of ~62% and a trading volume of $24.653 billion, the XRP price has reclaimed the $2.34 mark. Moreover, with Gary Gensler resigning as the SEC chair, this altcoin has gained significant attention from the crypto space and is on the path of achieving a new ATH. XRP 05th Dec 2024 The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recorded a constant green histogram, with its averages showing a significant rise in the 1D time frame. This suggests an increase in the buying-over-selling pressure. Maintaining its bullish action could push the XRP coin price toward its upper resistance level of $3.00. On the contrary, if a bearish trend reversal occurs, the Ripple token could plunge toward its lower support level of $2.00. Also, read XRP Price Prediction ! Dogecoin (DOGE) Amid increased market volatility, the Dogecoin price has maintained its bullish price rally by adding 4.21% in 24 hours and 3.69% in the last seven days.

DOGE 05th Dec 2024 The RSI indicator continues hovering above the overbought range in the daily time frame with its average trendline experiencing a similar price action. This indicates that the largest meme coin may continue gaining value this week. If the market favors the bulls, the DOGE price will breach its $0.44 mark and prepare to test its upper high of $0.50. Conversely, if the bears regain momentum, this memecoin could plunge toward its support level of $0.325 this month. Wondering when will DOGE price hit $1?

Say Yes to This Layer 1 Blockchain with 53k% ROI Prospects,https://thecoinrise.com/rue-missing-out-on-ethereum-ico-say-yes-to-this-layer-1-blockchain-with-53k-roi-prospects/,"The cryptocurrency market is heating up again, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge as one of the most celebrated projects in blockchain history. From its humble beginnings as an ICO in 2015 to becoming the backbone of decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum has carved its legacy. But if you’re feeling a little regret for not jumping in on Ethereum’s ICO when tokens were just $0.30 each, there’s some good news on the horizon. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain project making waves with a massive presale and an innovative ecosystem that aims to address gaps its predecessors left open. As the best crypto to buy before Christmas 2024 , Qubetics is not just another blockchain—it’s an ambitious project solving real-world problems through its powerful web3 aggregator and developer tools. If Ethereum is the grand architect of decentralised applications, Qubetics is the master planner poised to bring structure and usability to blockchain chaos. Here’s how these two projects stack up against each other. Ethereum (ETH): The Pioneer That Changed the Game Ethereum wasn’t just another cryptocurrency when it launched; it was a revolution. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum introduced smart contracts—self-executing agreements that run on its blockchain. This feature turned Ethereum into the go-to platform for developers and businesses looking to build decentralised applications (dApps). From DeFi platforms like Uniswap to NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Ethereum paved the way for blockchain innovation. Fast forward to 2024, Ethereum continues to dominate, but it’s not without its challenges. Network congestion and sky-high gas fees have been persistent issues, even after the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which replaced proof-of-work with proof-of-stake. Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Optimism, have alleviated some pressure, but scalability and affordability remain hot-button topics for developers and users alike. Despite its hurdles, Ethereum is still a powerhouse. As of December 2024, Ethereum trades at just under $2,000, with analysts predicting a climb to $3,000 in 2025 as the broader crypto market recovers. While Ethereum offers stability and proven utility, its growth potential is moderate compared to emerging projects like Qubetics. Why is Ethereum still a key player? It’s the original Layer 1 that unlocked a trillion-dollar market. However, as competition heats up, Ethereum might share the stage with newer, more focused projects like Qubetics that address its weaknesses. Qubetics ($TICS): The Next Big Thing with Groundbreaking ROI Qubetics isn’t here to play second fiddle. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, it offers a robust ecosystem for developers, businesses, and individual users. But what sets Qubetics apart is its application, QubeQode IDE, a development environment designed to make blockchain coding accessible to everyone—from seasoned developers to budding entrepreneurs. Imagine a freelance software developer juggling projects on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. With QubeQode IDE, they can write, test, and deploy smart contracts across multiple chains without switching platforms or tools. Now picture a small business looking to integrate blockchain for supply chain transparency. Qubetics simplifies the process, offering customisable templates and real-time analytics that make blockchain integration seamless. For individuals, Qubetics is equally transformative. Think of a digital artist looking to mint NFTs but overwhelmed by the complexity of multiple blockchain platforms. QubeQode IDE enables easy NFT creation and deployment, eliminating the technical barriers that deter creators from entering the blockchain space. The ongoing $TICS presale has already attracted over 6,200 holders, raising $4.3 million. With a current price of $0.0282, the potential upside is staggering. An investment of $100,000 at this stage would secure approximately 3.54 million $TICS tokens. By the presale’s end, when $TICS is projected to hit $0.25, that investment could balloon to $885,000—a 783% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. Analysts predict $TICS could soar to $1 after the presale and $15 after its mainnet launch, translating into a jaw-dropping $53 million ROI. Why is Qubetics the best crypto to buy before Christmas 2024? It’s all about innovation and practicality. By bridging gaps left by Ethereum and other blockchains, Qubetics is shaping up to be the go-to platform for anyone looking to harness blockchain technology without the steep learning curve. Why Qubetics is the Way to Go for New Crypto Investors Both Ethereum and Qubetics have their strengths. Ethereum is the tried-and-true option, with a legacy that’s hard to beat. But for investors seeking exponential growth and fresh opportunities, Qubetics is the clear winner. Its focus on real-world applications, combined with its user-friendly developer tools and groundbreaking presale success, makes it a standout project in the blockchain landscape. So, what’s the takeaway? If you missed Ethereum’s ICO or have been hesitant to dive into crypto, Qubetics is your golden ticket. Its potential for massive ROI, coupled with its practical applications, makes it a no-brainer for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio. Which is the Best Crypto to Buy Before Christmas 2024 The crypto market rarely offers second chances, but Qubetics is the exception. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer, this Layer 1 blockchain has the potential to redefine your financial future. With its presale already making headlines and its applications poised to transform industries, now is the time to act. Don’t rue missing out on Ethereum. Join the Qubetics presale now and be part of the next big thing in crypto.

The price is trading above $3,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,800 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,880 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Starts Fresh Increase Ethereum price remained well-bid above the $3,650 support zone.

The milestone underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance in mainstream finance and the potential for broader institutional adoption. Investors are betting on Trump’s crypto-friendly policies, which aim to establish the US as a global leader in digital assets. Bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise this year, doubling its value and gaining 45% in the weeks since Trump’s election victory. When writing, Bitcoin traded at $102,302, up 6.64% from the previous session. Source: CoinMarketCap Market analysts attribute this surge to growing confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital told Reuters . “Institutional adoption, advancements in tokenization, and a clearer regulatory path are driving Bitcoin and digital assets toward financial mainstream acceptance.” Fed Chair Powell calls Bitcoin a competitor to gold Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has described Bitcoin as a competitor to gold , emphasizing its role in preserving monetary value rather than functioning as a currency. Speaking at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell highlighted the cryptocurrency’s characteristics and volatility. Bitcoin is more like gold, but in a virtual form. People aren’t using it as a payment method or a reliable store of value. “It’s not a competitor to the dollar; it’s more of a competitor to gold,” Powell added. Why is Bitcoin going up? Trump’s campaign promises to transform the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” have resonated with investors. Illimar Mattus @IllimarM · Follow #Bitcoin making history. Now going parabolic.

Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 marks a turning point in the cryptocurrency’s journey from a niche asset to a significant financial instrument. Industry experts highlight the role of institutional adoption and technological advancements in driving this growth. “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 isn’t just a number; it reflects a broader shift in global finance, technology, and geopolitics,” Justin D’Anethan, an independent crypto analyst based in Hong Kong was quoted as saying by Reuters. What was once dismissed as a fantasy is now a reality, underscoring Bitcoin’s resilience and relevance. The milestone comes more than 16 years after Bitcoin’s creation, a period marked by skepticism, regulatory challenges, and market volatility. Despite these obstacles, BTC has demonstrated staying power and adaptability.

Watch on Twitter View replies 8:24 AM · Dec 5, 2024 6 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Beyond surpassing the $100,000 milestone, optimism around Bitcoin’s future growth remains strong among institutions and prominent crypto personalities. New price targets range between $150,000 and $500,000 within the next few years, fueled by increasing institutional adoption and market momentum. Bernstein Research has revised its bullish price forecast for Bitcoin, projecting it to reach $200,000 by 2025. This updated target, previously set at $150,000, reflects the growing institutional demand for cryptocurrencies across various regions. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, is even more optimistic. He predicts Bitcoin’s price could soar to $250,000 within the next two years, considering it a conservative estimate. Hoskinson believes Bitcoin’s potential upper limit could reach as high as $500,000, driven by rapid adoption and expanding use cases. Bitcoin hits $100K: what this means for crypto markets Bitcoin’s rally is expected to have ripple effects across the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple could see renewed interest as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Meanwhile, advancements in blockchain technology and tokenization could further integrate cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems. With the US poised to take a leadership role in the digital asset ecosystem, the stage is set for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to continue their upward trajectory. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and the potential for reduced regulatory hurdles could drive further investment and innovation in the space. Bitcoin’s ascent past $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it’s a testament to its growing acceptance as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. As geopolitical dynamics evolve and regulatory clarity improves, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape is likely to expand further.

Bitcoin is up 138% year-to-date. After a week of side way moments Bitcoin finally broke through $100,000. The reason for this current raly has been linked to Donald Trump winning the 2024 United States Presidential Election . $100k Bitcoin Was Imminent Market analysts believe that Bitcoin breaking $100,000 was imminent, as a number of factors perfectly aligned to drive the price up. Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, told Cryptonews that major catalysts for the price increase include tax policy around crypto, along with talks of strategic BTC reserves and continued inflows into Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) . Bitcoin has certainly been on a roll lately. BTC just recently became the seventh-largest asset by market cap in the world. It’s also impressive that within the past 10 trading days, Bitcoin ETFs have seen an incredible amount of inflows, totalling over $3.5 billion (check number) as of last week. According to Farside data , this brings the total amount of Bitcoin ETF inflows to $29.3 (double check) billion since their introduction in January this year. (add chart) Record Breaking Inflows Into Bitcoin ETFs Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at multisig Bitcoin vault maker Theya, told Cryptonews that it’s impressive to see the crypto industry have several consecutive days of record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. “There has also been roughly $1.12 billion in short positions between here and $100,000, clustered heavily between $91.5k and $92k. Once the price broke through these two levels decisively, it was a very easy ride all the way up to $100k,” Consorti added. The current BTC bull run has led to Bitcoin backers like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet announcing new BTC purchases . MicroStrategy now holds 1.5% of the asset’s total supply . Investors Will Take BTC Profits, Fueling A Full Crypto Bullrun Bitcoin breaking $100,000 also marks a significant turning point for both retail and institutional investors. Sergey Vasylchuk, CEO of global crypto staking platform Everstake, told Cryptonews that the $100,000 BTC mark demonstrates a psychological level where people will undoubtedly take BTC profits. However, Vasylchuk believes that many investors will not shy away from cryptocurrency. “Once you are addicted to crypto profit, you come back to seek more,” Vasylchuk said. He further believes that the crypto industry will see entry into Solana (SOL) or Ethereum (ETH) , which will fuel a full crypto bull run. “This bull run to 100,000 BTC is not the same narrative as past bullruns. This has been a BTC bullrun and not a full crypto bullrun,” said Vasylchuk. “We may even see another memecoin rally that pushes Solana to another rise or approval of an ETH ETF or pro-DeFi regulation that drives ETH up.” Joe Flanagan, Co-Founder of Maple Finance, also believes that as Bitcoin dominance stabilizes attention will shift to blue-chip decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens . What’s Next For Bitcoin? Industry experts predict that the new Bitcoin ATH will lead to increased growth within the crypto sector overall. Dennis Porter, CEO and Co-Founder of Satoshi Action Fund, told Cryptonews that the $100k BTC price will likely result in a massive surge of retail purchases. Tim Enneking, Founder and Principle of Digital Capital Management, told Cryptonews that Bitcoin breaking $100,000 indeed creates fear of missing out, or “FOMO” for retail investors. “The more valuable a single BTC becomes, the more it will have a significant effect on retail investors,” Enneking said. “The asset is also closer to becoming incorporated into different countries’ reserves.” Enneking added that the $100k Bitcoin price will not turn into permanent support for the asset. “If we get to $120,000 we may even see BTC drop back somewhere around $90k,” he remarked.

Bulls are already targeting levels beyond $103k at the time of writing. As the focus has now shifted to Bitcoin, the second largest cryptocurrency–Ethereum is also showing strong bullish momentum. Right now, Ethereum is breaking out towards $4,000 and looking at the weekly Ethereum chart, the price is showing strong performance ahead. Ethereum is approaching a major resistance zone around $3.9K to $4K. If it breaks above these levels, the next target would be the previous all-time high, around $4.7K to $4.9K, just under $5,000. On the 3-day chart, Ethereum is moving above $3.2K, which was resistance and is now acting as support. It also has support around $3.5K. The next resistance zone to watch is between $3,850 and $4,000, which are the previous highs. On the daily chart, Ethereum is still breaking out above previous resistance, now acting as support. The altcoin has seen strong buying around $3,430 to $3,560, confirming the breakout. There’s a potential bearish divergence forming, but it’s not confirmed yet since we haven’t seen a strong rejection in the RSI. For now, things are looking more bullish than bearish. For short-term gains, it’s crucial to watch the $3,750 level. A confirmed break above this could lead to a surge towards $4,600, and eventually, higher targets. Looking ahead, Ethereum is forming a cup and handle pattern, and some analysts predict prices could reach $7,400 or even $10,000. However, right now, Ethereum faces resistance at $4000 and we need to break and hold above that level to move higher. Ethereum’s strong uptrend is supported by large institutional investments, with Ethereum ETF inflows recently surpassing Bitcoin’s. This trend hints at positive price action for Ethereum, and many believe it could reach new highs by the end of the year, possibly even breaking its all-time high.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 03:29:50

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Solana’s Ecosystem Thrives According to VanEck’s analysis, Solana delivered a 42% return in November, with the SOL token hitting an all-time high of $262. This increase was largely driven by a surge in on-chain trading activity related to memecoins, which led the general market rally with a 95% increase during the month. This drove Solana’s revenues and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes to unprecedented levels. In fact, Solana generated $177 million in revenue in November, doubling the previous month’s high of $74 million.

This rush of activity also benefited projects such as Jito and Pump.fun, which generated revenues of $185 million and over $92 million, respectively. Jito operates as an on-chain application that generates revenue through maximal extracted value (MEV), which is derived from arbitrage opportunities created during DEX trading. Meanwhile, Pump.fun captures revenue directly from memecoin trading, showcasing the dual benefits of Solana’s vibrant ecosystem. Solana’s success was further underscored by its wallet, Phantom, claiming the top spot in Apple’s “free utility apps” category, and Robinhood reinstating SOL trading on its platform. In addition, the popular non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden announced an upcoming token airdrop, which is expected to stimulate further on-chain trading. Cardano And Polkadot Lead Crypto Altcoin Rallies Cardano’s ADA was another standout performer in November, achieving an impressive 201% increase. This rally was spurred by off-chain developments and speculation surrounding the influence of Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, in shaping future crypto policy. Following Hoskinson’s announcement of establishing a crypto policy office in Washington, D.C., ADA experienced a significant price surge. The upward momentum continued with Robinhood’s relisting of ADA and an update to Cardano’s governance structure, which emphasized on-chain decision-making by ADA holders. On-chain usage metrics reflected Cardano’s price movement, with total value locked (TVL) surging by 180% as various Cardano project tokens rallied. However, despite these gains, Cardano’s absolute figures in stablecoins and daily DEX volumes remain modest compared to Ethereum (ETH), highlighting a potential area for growth. Related Reading: XRP Under The Microscope: Will It Break $2.9? Key Support Levels And Future Targets Polkadot, often viewed as an underperformer in the crypto space, also saw a surprising rally in November. While its ecosystem has struggled with slow onboarding and technical challenges, recent developments, particularly from the Mythos Chain—a gaming blockchain hosting popular titles like NFL Rivals—have invigorated interest. Polkadot’s founder, Gavin Wood, also unveiled plans for a more agile architecture, allowing for enhanced interoperability and cloud-like services, which could position Polkadot favorably against other crypto assets like Ethereum and Celestia. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, major protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, and Sky (formerly MakerDAO) demonstrated strength, with significant fee increases and market activity. Aave crossed a milestone of $30 billion in deposits, positioning it among the largest banks by deposits if it were a traditional institution. Meanwhile, Uniswap’s market position was bolstered by a favorable court ruling regarding the legality of immutable smart contracts, which spurred a substantial increase in its market capitalization.

How High Can Bitcoin Go?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-bitcoin-going-up-today-5-december/,"The post Why Is Bitcoin Going Up? How High Can Bitcoin Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has finally crossed $100,000. Adding 7% in the last three days and 4% today, BTC peaked at $104,630 before retracing back to $101,132. This gives the crypto community new hope that the bull cycle is still on. Let’s analyse what is happening in the market and why is Bitcoin going up today. Bitcoin Hit $100K The $100k mark has been a very heavy psychological resistance for Bitcoin, which it passed this morning. As we talked about how new buying can support the price and raise it, we saw huge volume coming in to push the price up. The Fear and Greed index was recorded at 84 this morning, displaying that the market still has potential for buying. The biggest crypto needs to cement the support as there is no moving average present in this area for assistance. How High Can Bitcoin Go? The RSI is currently at 76.41 showing bulls are charging, however it will soon enter the overbought zone and will have to cool off. On the other hand, ADX is at 17.57 which is considerably low but has started to rise. Bitcoin is experiencing heavy volume with a rise of 35% in the last 24 hours, most of which came in the last hour.BTC has reached at almost $100B in trading volume which pushes the marketcap of total crypto market to $3.69 trillion with a rise of 4.97%. Bitcoin dominance over the market is at 55.5% which is comparatively low. There are many factors pumping the force into Bitcoin. According to experts, the most influential part is the pro crypto President, Donald Trump. Since the US election, the crypto market has gained huge momentum with Bitcoin and altcoins adding huge numbers to their prices. The community is feeling relaxed towards crypto as Trump is working to get pro crypto people into his administration. Will Bitcoin Crash? What Next? With bitcoin above $100k, it is very clear that the alt market will soon follow. There is no single reason to why is Bitcoin going up today but its is a collective power of multiple factors. BTC is Expected to reach $120k soon, however rising RSI points towards a cool down. Also, the market tends to take advantage of such situations. People are going in with huge confidence & greed which is a great time for the market to rekt them. Just in the last one hour, over $130 million worth of funds were liquidated, most of which came in from shorts. The market takes some steps back in order to retest the support and if it fails to do so, the price can plummet under panic. We might see huge inflows into the Bitcoin etfs as well but investors should exercise caution.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 03:39:35

Starting Dec. 5 at 11:00 am UTC, PEPE will be tradable against Tether’s stablecoin, USDt ($USDT), the exchange announced on Dec. 4. “Since its inception, PEPE has seen significant popularity among network participants, largely driven by social media and community support,” Binance.US stated. As of Dec. 4, PEPE held a market capitalization nearing $9 billion, according to CoinGecko. Memecoin Listings on the Rise Following President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, U.S. exchanges like Binance.US and Coinbase have been expanding their offerings of memecoins. Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s vice president of international policy, highlighted the trend in November, saying, “We’re talking more about some of the smaller tokens, some of the memecoin tokens.” In recent months, Coinbase has listed memecoins such as Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Binance.US also introduced Bonk ($BONK), a dog-themed memecoin, in November. Currently, memecoins collectively hold a market capitalization of over $130 billion, per CoinGecko. Mixed Reactions Memecoins have sparked debate within the crypto community. Influencers like Murad Mahmudov argue that memecoins serve a purpose by reducing speculative premiums in altcoins. Conversely, others like Jimmy Song view them as risky and speculative. The Story of Pepe Created in 2005 by artist Matt Furie, Pepe the Frog became an internet sensation and later a cryptocurrency symbol. While initially a “peaceful frog-dude,” Pepe stirred controversy during the 2016 U.S. election due to its use by alt-right groups. Despite the backlash, the Anti-Defamation League stated, “the majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted.”",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|PEPE|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 03:55:00

The price is consolidating near $2.20 and might aim for a fresh increase above the $2.45 level. XRP price started another decline and traded below the $2.40 level. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance. XRP Price Revisits Key Support At $2.20 XRP price made another attempt to clear the $2.70 resistance. However, it failed to surpass $2.70 and corrected some gains unlike Bitcoin and like Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.50 and $2.40 levels. A low was formed at $2.166 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $2.20 and $2.25 levels.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance or even $2.850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $2.500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support and the trend line. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.

(NASDAQ: MSTR) has purchased more than 402,100 Bitcoins to date, worth more than $40 billion. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of 15.4k Bitcoins, after raising $1.5 billion through stock sales. As a result of the continued Bitcoin adoption, MSTR shareholders have significantly benefited through value addition. Furthermore, the company has achieved a BTC yield of 38.7 percent quarter-to-date (QTD) and 63.3 percent year-to-date (YTD). BREAKING: MicroStrategy stock, $MSTR , surges 10% in overnight trading as #Bitcoin hits $100,000. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin position is now worth over $40 billion for the first time in history. CEO @Saylor says Bitcoin is just getting started. pic.twitter.com/FnVMPVHdRi — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 5, 2024 According to the latest market data, MSTR price has rallied more than 542 percent YTD, thus outpacing all of the Wall Street major indexes. In the past 24 hours, MSTR stock surged over 10 percent to trade at about $410.85 during the U.S. after-trading session. Consequently, the company’s valuation has rallied exponentially in the past months to hover about $83.9 billion at the time of this writing. Bigger Picture The notable rise of MicroStrategy over the past years, despite not having a major product in the market, has significantly influenced other companies around the world. The adoption of the strategic Bitcoin reserve has also been discussed at the national level, with the upcoming Trump administration expected to enact a similar law to purchase at least 1 million BTCs over the next five years. Consequently, Bitcoin price is on a trajectory to higher levels in the coming months amid heightened institutional FOMO and robust fundamentals.

XRP gained traction, especially after reaching $2.86, its highest level since 2018. The technical analysis suggests significant opportunities ahead. Chart Analysis and Observations The chart highlights XRP’s performance within a multi-year ascending trend line, which has served as a strong support framework since 2018. This long-term bullish trend underpins the cryptocurrency’s resilience and positions XRP for potential exponential growth. The pattern identified in the chart is an ascending triangle, a classic technical formation associated with bullish breakouts. This triangle is characterized by a horizontal resistance level and an upward-sloping support line. According to the chart, XRP has decisively broken out of this structure, signaling a strong upward trend continuation. #XRP – $17 or $27? – You Decide The answer is in the chart! Take a close look and decide – which one do YOU think is more plausible? $17 or $27? #XRPFamily : STAY STEADY & STRONG . We could face a major pullback ahead, but don’t let the FUD shake you. These pullbacks are… pic.twitter.com/26EzkDjETk — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 3, 2024 Key Levels to Look Out For Support at $1.22 (0.702 Fibonacci Level): This level, marked on the chart, represents a critical accumulation area. It is expected to act as a strong support level in the event of a pullback. Intermediate Resistance at $9.12 (1.272 Fibonacci Level): This resistance may slow XRP’s ascent before it attempts higher targets. However, this is below the final targets, suggesting that EGRAG CRYPTO is confident that the digital asset will surpass it. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Major Targets—$17 and $27 : These targets are derived from Fibonacci extensions and historical patterns. The $17 level is close to the 1.414 Fibonacci extension, while $27 is close to the 1.618 extension, a key extension level often signifying the cycle peak. Notably, the analyst has previously predicted a rise to these targets through a similar ascending triangle. The chart also emphasizes caution, warning of potential pullbacks before XRP reaches these lofty targets. As noted by EGRAG CRYPTO, pullbacks should be viewed as opportunities to accumulate rather than as deterrents to long-term positioning. How to Maximize Returns from this Cycle Egrag’s analysis highlights the importance of discipline during volatile phases. He advised investors to employ approaches like Dollar Sell Averaging (DSA) and to consider securing profits by withdrawing initial capital once comfortable levels are reached. These steps can mitigate risks while capitalizing on upward momentum. XRP is currently trading at $2.55, and although it has dropped over 6% from yesterday, it is up almost 80% from last week. The asset’s renewed attention from institutional investors has been a significant driver of its recent surge. As regulatory clarity improves and adoption increases, XRP’s utility in the financial ecosystem could further enhance its appeal, supporting the long-term bullish thesis outlined in the chart.

A major catalyst to BTC price rally is the appointment of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the next US SEC Chair after Gary Gensler steps down on January 20. Besides, institutional buying with strong inflows into BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) triggered the spurt for the new BTC ATH. Three Reasons Behind the Bitcoin Price Rally to $103K 1. Donald Trump Appoints Paul Atkins As Next US SEC Chair On Wednesday, December 4, Donald Trump finally made the announcement that SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins will be the next US SEC Chair replacing Gary Gensler. The appointment of pro-crypto Atkins has pushed Bitcoin price and the overall crypto market into a strong rally. This development has made the crypto industry optimistic about pro-crypto policies coming to the US very soon. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse immediately celebrated this development along with US Senator Cynthia Lumis calling it a big win for the crypto industry. Garlinghouse said that Atkins will bring some “common sense” back to the agency. Responding to this, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty wrote: “The triumvirate of Atkins, Peirce, and Uyeda at the SEC will not only bring common sense back to the agency, but true investor protection as well”. However, there are a few questions that remain for the next SEC Chair. It will be interesting to see whether Paul Atkins works with the US government to build the country’s strategic Bitcoin reserve. 2. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Crosses $50 Billion AUM Supporting Bitcoin Price Rally BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has finally crossed the important milestone of $50 billion in assets under management, which is supported by strong inflows and a Bitcoin price surge of $100K. The most important thing is that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF attained this milestone just within 228 days of launch. Bloomberg ETF Strategist Eric Balchunas noted that this rapid growth is unprecedented, with the next fastest ETF to reach the $50 billion mark being the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF ($IEFA), which took 1,329 days—over five times longer. This milestone highlights the demand for Bitcoin while strengthening IBIT’s position in the market. Besides, traditional BlackRock funds have also sought exposure to IBIT over the past few months. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been single-handedly driving all inflows into US Bitcoin ETFs this week. Just in the first three days of the week, IBIT has netted more than $1.6 billion in net inflows taking its total inflows since inception to more than $33 billion. For reference, its immediate competitor Fidelity’s FETH is one-third in size with $11.5 billion in inflows. 3. Russian President Vladimir Putin Recognizes Bitcoin Today’s Bitcoin price rally comes as the asset class continues to get approval from across the world. During a speech on Wednesday at the Russia Calling Investment Forum in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced strong support for Bitcoin and digital assets. He emphasized that no one can ban Bitcoin and that these technologies will continue to grow. Putin said: “Because these are new technologies and no matter what happens to the dollar, these tools will develop one way or another because everyone will strive to reduce costs and increase reliability.” BTC Becomes A $2 Trillion Asset Following the recent Bitcoin price rally to its new all-time high above $103,000, its market cap also surged past $2 trillion for the first time in history. As a result, the asset class is very much close to overtaking tech giants Alphabet and Amazon, to enter the list of top five global assets worldwide. The Bitcoin futures long positions have surged significantly with the funding rate surging by a massive 81%. Also, BTC’s daily trading volumes surged 50% surging past $100 billion and showing strong bullish sentiment.

Investors predict the BTC price rally could continue further to $120,000 by the end of December.

The reason behind being bearish on BTC was the rise of the other altcoins like XRP and ADA, which smashed $1 after being consolidated for a long time. However, after the star tokens take back control, these altcoins are experiencing a notable upward pressure. While bearish predictions below $2 may hover over the XRP price rally, the token may either extend the consoldaition or undergo a suitable upswing in a short while. The recent dump in prices has dropped XRP from the top 3 cryptos as Tether overtakes to reclaim the third position. This compels us to wonder whether the traders have booked their profits or continue to remain optimistic. This can be gauged by the exchange reserves, which hint at the traders mindset. The balance on exchanges shed light on the probable next move of the traders and indicates whether they are bullish or bearish over the token. Holding cryptos on exchanges suggests the traders are thinking of selling or swapping the token, which has been noticed recently. After the XRP price marked yealy highs, the exchange reserves piled up, suggesting the traders are preparing for a trade. However, the daily active address and the transaction count have both dropped, suggesting no immediate action could be taken. The markets have become bullish as Bitcoin has smashed the historic $100K milestone, which signals the liquidity flow back to the star token. However, after the rally cools down, these tokens are about to scale up and set up a monstrous rally. The short-term trade suggests the price is trading within a rising, expanding channel, and after the recent breakdown, the price is facing massive upward pressure. The RSI is plunging, which indicates the price may continue to drop and reach the lower support zone between $1.83 and $1.94, which is also the support of the wedge.However, the selling volume remains restricted compared to that of the buying, suggesting a strong rebound could be fast approaching. The Bitcoin price rally is expected to slow down after marking highs around $108,000, which could enable the altcoins to thrive. This could be when the XRP price may revamp a strong rise and surpass it’s previous ATH and achieve $4.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 05:24:11

Find out why experts are so bullish on the Rollblock platform, which is being tipped for stunning 50x returns from current levels. Hedera ($HBAR) Pumps On Worldpay Partnership News Hedera has dropped by 15% today, bringing the Hedera price down to support at $0.28. A large 52% drop in exchange-traded volume has indicated that Hedera traders are reluctant to step in at these levels and will be waiting for confirmation of Hedera’s ongoing bullish momentum. This is not surprising, as Hedera holders have recently enjoyed incredible 720% gains, with its price rallying from $0.04 at the start of this month. Recently, Worldpay announced that it will be using Hedera’s innovative proof-of-reserves system to operate as a trust layer for its stablecoin launch. Hedera will oversee the minting and backing of its stablecoins, in a move that should propel Hedera further toward the $1 level in the weeks ahead. Solana ($SOL) Drops Down The Rankings But Should Rally With ETF Approval Solana has recently fallen to 5th place in the CoinMarketCap top 10 crypto index, after Ripple overtook Solana in the rankings. Solana has seen a 3% pump today, which is encouraging but still lagging the double-digit returns of many of its competitors. Solana recently made a new all-time high with its pump to $263 before it faced a rejection down to support at $218. It has emerged recently that Grayscale has filed the paperwork for a dedicated Solana spot ETF fund with the New York Stock Exchange. If approved, this will see a wall of institutional money flow into the Solana ecosystem, which should propel Solana far beyond $300 during Q1 of 2025. Rollblock ($RBLK) Heading For Pole Position With Sports Betting Bonanza Since its launch earlier this year, Rollblock ( $RBLK ) has risen to the top of the crypto presale pile and attracted more than 22,000 early adopters who have come to see the vast potential Rollblock offers to disrupt one of the most lucrative industries out there. Rollblock uses the mighty power of the Ethereum blockchain to securely inscribe all of its casino transactions on-chain. This is a game-changer for the entire gaming space. The Rollblock platform is a fully functioning, community-backed GambleFi powerhouse featuring over 7,000 popular casino games and a brand-new sports betting league that allows armchair sports pundits to get involved and win stacks of $RBLK with their expert knowledge. $RBLK is looking like a future crypto gaming blue chip, thanks to its undeniable utility and attractive tokenomics, which will see a hefty portion of Rollblock profits reinvested each week in buying back the token on exchanges. This will result in 60% of these tokens being burned forever, and the remaining 40% finding their way back to stakers in the community. Experts are united in predicting a meteoric rise for Rollblock this year, as its price is set to appreciate rapidly from the current level of $0.037.

Jared Isaacman, billionaire fintech CEO and private astronaut, has been nominated to head NASA, while pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins has been tapped to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Billionaire Fintech CEO and Astronaut Jared Isaacman Tapped to Lead NASA by President-elect Donald Trump President-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 4 that Jared Isaacman, a billionaire fintech mogul and experienced astronaut, has been nominated as the next Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). If confirmed by Congress, Isaacman will succeed Bill Nelson, becoming the 15th leader of the space agency. Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4 Payments, a financial technology company that processes over $260 billion annually across more than 200,000 clients, is no stranger to the realm of high stakes, whether in business or in space. His appointment reflects Trump’s vision for a NASA that continues to prioritize commercial partnerships, technological advancement, and an ambitious return to space exploration dominance. Isaacman’s path to potential NASA leadership is unconventional yet highly fitting. He is widely known for his adventurous spirit and trailblazing accomplishments in both aerospace and fintech. In 2021, Isaacman cemented his name in space exploration history as the financier and commander of SpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, the first all-civilian spaceflight to orbit Earth. This groundbreaking mission was a showcase of private-public collaboration in the space sector. Not content with that achievement, Isaacman returned to orbit in September 2024 as the commander of the Polaris Dawn mission, during which he became the first private citizen to perform a spacewalk. Outside of his astronautic feats, Isaacman is an accomplished pilot certified on numerous civilian and military aircraft. His impressive résumé also includes a stint as a member of an aeronautical stunt team, where he flew jet aircraft in complex formations. In the business sphere, Isaacman co-founded and led Draken International, a prominent defense aerospace firm that provides tactical flight services for the US Department of Defense. This experience in defense and aerospace uniquely positions him to navigate NASA’s multifaceted operations, from scientific research to national security collaborations. President-elect Trump highlighted Isaacman’s dual expertise in business and space as central to his nomination. In a statement posted on Truth Social, Trump remarked, “I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Jared will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology, and exploration.” Trump’s transition team has signaled that Isaacman’s leadership is expected to align NASA’s goals with the administration’s broader emphasis on private-sector partnerships, innovation, and economic competitiveness in space. With Isaacman’s deep ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, his nomination may further strengthen NASA’s collaboration with commercial spaceflight companies. A New Era for NASA Isaacman’s pending appointment comes at a critical juncture for NASA. As the agency continues to pursue its Artemis program to return humans to the Moon and looks ahead to potential crewed missions to Mars, the integration of commercial and governmental resources has never been more essential. Isaacman’s entrepreneurial mindset and firsthand spaceflight experience could bring a fresh perspective to the agency’s strategic objectives. His track record in leading cutting-edge projects, including the groundbreaking Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn missions, suggests he will advocate for ambitious exploration initiatives. Observers expect him to focus on furthering advancements in space technology, enhancing NASA’s collaboration with private companies, and maintaining the US’s leadership in the global space race. Trump’s shake-up of federal leadership also includes the nomination of University of Maryland finance professor Michael Faulkender as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has reportedly emerged as a contender for Secretary of Defense after Pete Hegseth was dropped from consideration. While Isaacman’s nomination has drawn praise from many quarters, including the aerospace and fintech communities, it also faces scrutiny. Critics argue that his lack of experience in managing a large government organization could be a hurdle, while others highlight his close ties to commercial space firms as a potential conflict of interest. Supporters, however, point to his proven leadership in both the private and public sectors and his ability to inspire public interest in space exploration as key assets. His nomination signals a bold step toward integrating commercial ingenuity with NASA’s storied tradition of scientific achievement. Jared Isaacman’s pending appointment as NASA Administrator marks a pivotal moment for the agency as it navigates the intersection of government-funded exploration and private-sector innovation. With his unique blend of aerospace expertise and entrepreneurial vision, Isaacman could usher in a transformative era for NASA, ensuring its continued role as a global leader in space exploration. As Congress prepares to deliberate on his confirmation, all eyes are on the billionaire-turned-astronaut, whose journey from fintech to the stars may soon add another chapter as the head of one of the world’s most iconic space agencies. President-elect Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins to Lead the SEC In a bold move that signals a significant policy shift for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump also announced on Dec. 4 the nomination of Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner and pro-crypto advocate, to replace Gary Gensler as the agency's chief. Atkins, the CEO and founder of Patomak Global Partners, a prominent risk management consultancy, has long been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency innovation and blockchain technology. His appointment signals a sharp departure from Gensler’s tenure, which many in the crypto industry criticized as excessively combative and regulatory-heavy. In his announcement on Truth Social, Trump emphasized Atkins’ extensive experience and his advocacy for investor protection and transparency. “Paul is the CEO and Founder of Patomak Global Partners, a risk management consultancy. As Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, he has worked on and studied the digital assets industry. A former SEC Commissioner from 2002-2008, Paul strongly advocated for transparency and protecting investors.” Atkins’ nomination fulfills a campaign promise Trump made to crypto voters, where he pledged to bring regulatory clarity to the digital assets industry. The pro-crypto stance featured prominently in Trump’s keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, where he outlined his vision for fostering innovation in the United States through clearer crypto regulations and market-friendly policies. The nomination comes on the heels of Gary Gensler’s resignation on Nov. 21, a move many saw as inevitable after mounting criticism of his anti-crypto stance. Gensler, known for his aggressive approach to regulating the cryptocurrency sector, oversaw a record 104 lawsuits against blockchain companies and crypto firms between 2021 and 2023. These lawsuits, combined with unclear regulatory guidance, cost the industry an estimated $426 million in legal fees. The Blockchain Association was among the many groups that called for an end to what they described as “law-fare” against the sector. With Gensler’s departure, analysts and industry insiders are optimistic about a more collaborative approach under Atkins’ leadership. News of Gensler’s resignation and Trump’s pro-crypto election victory sparked a rally in cryptocurrency markets. Analysts predict this momentum could carry into 2025, fueled by expectations of reduced regulatory pressures and the potential approval of long-awaited crypto products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In the wake of Gensler’s resignation announcement, multiple firms, including Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, submitted applications for Solana (SOL)-based ETFs, signaling renewed confidence in the SEC’s openness to crypto innovation under new leadership. Katrina Paglia, chief legal officer at Pantera Capital, suggested that lawsuits targeting cryptocurrency firms and blockchain projects could “quietly go away” after Atkins assumes leadership at the SEC. Atkins’ Vision for the SEC Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, has built a reputation as a staunch advocate for balanced regulation. His work as Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017 is indicative of his commitment to fostering innovation while protecting investors. In his consulting role at Patomak Global Partners, Atkins has advised on risk management and compliance for fintech and blockchain companies, gaining extensive insight into the challenges facing the crypto industry. Observers expect him to prioritize clear guidelines and reduce regulatory ambiguity, fostering an environment where innovation can thrive without compromising investor protections. Despite the optimism, Atkins faces significant challenges in reshaping the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrencies. The agency’s legacy under Gensler includes entrenched skepticism toward the industry and a reputation for aggressive enforcement. Rebuilding trust and establishing collaborative relationships with blockchain firms will likely require time and strategic effort. Moreover, Atkins’ nomination will need to pass Senate confirmation, where lawmakers divided on crypto issues could raise concerns about his industry-friendly stance. Critics argue that a pro-crypto SEC chief might prioritize innovation at the expense of stricter consumer safeguards. Atkins’ potential leadership marks a turning point for the SEC, signaling a departure from adversarial policies and an embrace of cryptocurrency as a legitimate financial sector. Industry leaders and market participants hope this shift will pave the way for regulatory clarity, enabling the US to compete globally in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. As the crypto community awaits congressional confirmation of Atkins’ nomination, the stakes are high for the SEC and the broader financial landscape. If confirmed, Atkins will be tasked with balancing the twin imperatives of fostering innovation and maintaining the SEC’s mandate to protect investors. For now, the nomination offers a glimmer of hope for an industry that has long sought a regulatory framework conducive to growth and collaboration. The question remains: Will Atkins be able to deliver on the promise of a crypto-friendly SEC, and can his leadership usher in a new era of innovation and trust?",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-05 05:30:20

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to the waves of new contenders, the meme coin market is heating up. In December 2024, BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Popcat are three of the best meme coins to invest in now, and it’s not hard to see why. Let’s start with BTFD Coin, which is absolutely taking the crypto world by storm. As of its 7th presale stage, BTFD Coin has raised over $900,000 and sold more than 21 billion coins. At a price of $0.000064 per coin, it’s an exciting opportunity for early investors. And, with over 2,000 Bulls on board and growing, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins to invest in now. But BTFD Coin isn’t alone in making waves. Pepe Coin, named after the infamous internet meme, and Popcat, the meme-inspired coin with a loyal fanbase, are also gaining traction. Let’s dive deeper into each of these meme coins to understand why they’re all worth your attention right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Ready to Explode BTFD Coin has become one of the best meme coins to invest in now due to its massive presale success and strong community backing. The concept behind BTFD Coin, which stands for “Buy The Dip,” is simple yet powerful. It is about capitalising on the market’s downturns and buying when prices are low. It’s the mentality that many experienced crypto traders swear by, and it’s the heart of this coin. At its current presale price of $0.000064, BTFD Coin is attracting a lot of early investors excited about the future. The price is expected to rise to $0.0006 once the presale ends, which would offer early investors a substantial return on their investment. Think about investing $50,000 today at this price? Well, good for you, because this means you would secure a jaw-dropping 781.25 million coins. If the price rises post-presale, that investment could easily turn into a mind-boggling $468,750! Yet, what sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins is its focus on community, with its “Bulls Squad” forming a strong and loyal following. The coin also offers high staking rewards, with an impressive APY of 90%, making it an attractive option for those looking for passive income. The coin’s future plans include a fully-fledged Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that will reward users with BTFD coins, as well as continuous marketing efforts aimed at building its ecosystem. With such a dedicated community and a solid roadmap, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins to invest in now, and there’s no sign of it slowing down. Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin with Staying Power Named after the famous Pepe the Frog meme, this coin has been gaining massive popularity. With its unique branding and a devoted community, Pepe Coin is quickly cementing itself as a long-term contender in the meme coin space. Trading at $0.0000209, Pepe Coin has experienced steady growth throughout 2024. The coin’s roadmap focuses on increasing utility and expanding its ecosystem. Plans for the future include partnerships with influencers, integration into decentralised finance (DeFi) projects, and a potential Play-to-Earn game featuring the iconic Pepe character. These developments could increase demand for Pepe Coin, driving its value up in the future. But it’s not just the plans for expansion that make Pepe Coin so appealing—it’s also the strength of its community. With millions of fans worldwide, Pepe Coin has a solid following that’s ready to push the coin to new heights. As Pepe Coin grows, its presence in the meme coin market continues to solidify, making it one of the best meme coins to invest in now. Popcat: The Meme Coin That’s Popping Off Next up is Popcat, a meme coin that has exploded onto the scene thanks to its fun, relatable concept and a highly engaged community. Inspired by the viral Popcat meme and the clicking game that everyone was going on about a few years ago, Popcat Coin has caught the attention of meme coin enthusiasts around the globe. The current price of Popcat is $1.40, and while it may seem pricey in comparison, it’s important to consider the community and momentum behind it. Like BTFD Coin and Pepe Coin, Popcat Coin has built a passionate following that believes in its potential to make it big in the meme coin market. The coin is also available on several decentralised exchanges (DEXs), increasing its liquidity and accessibility. Popcat Coin has big plans for 2025, including the launch of an NFT marketplace where users can buy and sell exclusive Popcat-themed art. This integration with the growing NFT space will help fuel the coin’s popularity even further. In addition, Popcat Coin’s community-driven approach and fun meme culture ensure it will continue to attract new investors in the future. For anyone looking for the best meme coins to invest in now, Popcat Coin is a great option.

Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/no-sweat-dogecoin-will-hit-5-very-easy-in-2025-analyst/,"Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that has gained popularity and surpassed $60 billion in market capitalization, is once again attracting attention. While the year got off to a shaky start for DOGE, it has since seen a significant upswing. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst DOGE has mostly consolidated at $0.40, which begs some questions about whether its moment of glory has vanished. Recent research, however, points the other way, with specialists looking at possible price levels that would inspire DOGE aficionados once more. Technical Support Points Toward Development Important technical indications have helped to propel the price trajectory of DOGE. Currently at $0.26, the 50-day moving average has been a consistent support level that has helped it to climb to $0.44. The 200-day moving average, which stays constant at $0.15, shows DOGE’s long-term consistency. $DOGE $XRP money will flow into $DOGE My first target is 1$ I think we will reach 3-5$ very easy next year pic.twitter.com/hf5w8FUOUs — ProfessorAstrones (@Astrones2) December 2, 2024 These metrics indicate a strong foundation for future growth. Analysts like Professor Astrones believe DOGE could soon end its consolidation phase and start moving toward $1. Beyond that, he projects the coin could hit $3 to $5 “very easily” in 2025. It’s an ambitious goal, but Dogecoin has surprised the market before. XRP’s Role In Dogecoin’s Future The recent success of XRP is an interesting part of the possible rise in DOGE. In the past week, the price of XRP has doubled, giving some long-term users over 400% returns. The market value of XRP has grown to more than twice that of Dogecoin thanks to this rise. Astrones, on the other hand, says that the rising trend in XRP may soon slow down. That could make buyers want to put their gains back into Dogecoin, which would make more people want to buy it. In the crypto market, gains are often spread to other assets, which means that money is often moved around. Is Dogecoin Mirroring XRP? Other market observers have noticed an interesting similarity between the recent patterns of XRP’s prices and DOGE’s chart currently. They said that DOGE is making higher lows, which is a sign of a bullish trend, meaning the upward movement is going to be sustainable. If this is the case, Dogecoin will explode like XRP and move its price way past current levels. Related Reading: Cardano Rally Heats Up: Experts See 750% Jump Ahead DOGE is already showing resilience at $0.42 with a 1.5% gain over the last 24 hours. Of course, the road to $1 and beyond is not guaranteed, but the optimism in the market is rising. With strong technical support and the possibility of XRP-driven buying, Dogecoin may be just getting ready for the next big leap.

BTC added 7.2% in the past 24 hours, data shows, zooming to a $2 trillion market capitalization for the first time as it set a record just over $103,670. It has since lost ground to $102,500 in Asian afternoon hours as traders took early profits on the move. The asset has gained 50% in the past 30 days on increased institutional demand, rising ETF inflows, improved sentiment among traditional finance circles and optimism around Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency in the U.S. — one that has promised to make the country a hotbed for bitcoin activity. Spot BTC ETFs in the U.S. notched up $533 million in net inflows on Wednesday, data shows, with BlackRock’s IBIT crossing $50 billion in net assets for the first time. Such rapid price ascension has spurred fears of a local market top among some watchers that could send prices tumbling as low as $90,000. But a seasonally bullish holiday period, demand from ETFs and higher mainstream media attention could fuel more buying demand for BTC in the coming weeks, traders say. Here’s what three traders are saying about the current rally, and future moves. “With the positive headline of Powell’s comment that Bitcoin is digital gold and the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chair, BTC has finally reached 100k."" However, we believe there is more room for a rally, as there must be some demand waiting for BTC to break 100k, which will capture more public attention. Moreover, BTC remains small compared to other macro assets, and the growth of its market cap will attract large institutions that are now able to allocate a meaningful size.” — Presto Research investment analyst Min Jung “Bitcoin's recent surge past the $100,000 mark is not just a milestone; it represents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The confidence is spurred by an increasingly favorable regulatory environment in the U.S., particularly with the appointment of Paul Atkins to chair the SEC. This is likely to drive further institutional investment in the sector, giving Bitcoin more credibility and leading to a new wave of adoption.” — Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. “Although some speculators believe reaching $100k signals a market top, on-chain demand and macroeconomic indicators suggest Bitcoin still has a lot of momentum to push higher. This is further evident in the leading bearish narratives invalidated, such as the US presidential election and the regulator's stance towards crypto."" ""While long-time holders may deleverage their positions, mainstream media and retail market investors have only started to notice the incredibly fast rise of Bitcoin at this key level, which may add to more buying pressure from a fear of missing out.” — Nick Ruck, Director at LVRG Research.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-05 05:37:13

Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Eric Adams is still bullish, and even bragged about Bitcoin's growth since accepting his first three paychecks in BTC. Controversy also surrounds the U.S. government’s recent $1.9 billion Bitcoin transfer to Coinbase, and critics like Jason Lowery called the move a huge strategic mistake. Powell Dismisses Bitcoin’s Impact on Dollar Dominance Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently reiterated that Bitcoin (BTC) is more comparable to gold than it is a competitor to the U.S. dollar. At The New York Times-hosted DealBook Summit in New York on Dec. 4, Powell described Bitcoin as a speculative asset, similar to virtual gold. He brushed off the notion that Bitcoin is widely used as a form of payment or a reliable store of value, and specifically pointed out its high volatility. ”It’s not a competitor for the dollar. It’s really a competitor for gold,” Powell stated. Jerome Powell at the DealBook Summit (Source: New York Times ) Powell also addressed the idea that Bitcoin reflects a loss of faith in the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar, and rejected the claim. When asked whether he owns Bitcoin, Powell clarified that he is prohibited from holding it. While he is not opposed to crypto companies conducting business with banks, he did mention that it is still important to safeguard the financial system’s stability and consumer protection. Bitcoin’s recent price surge to over $99,000 reignited discussions around its role in the financial system. This rally has been partly attributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory in November, which is seen as a boost for the pro-crypto movement in the United States. Trump’s cabinet appointments, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Secretary of Treasury and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as Secretary of Commerce, could signal that the U.S. is taking a much more crypto-friendly approach. Additionally, Trump’s reported favouritism of crypto advocate Paul Atkins taking over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), after Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement, also proves that things are shifting for crypto in the U.S. While Trump has been quite critical of Powell’s policies , the Federal Reserve Chair made it clear he has no intention of stepping down, regardless of political pressure. NYC Mayor Eric Adams Defends Bitcoin New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is currently facing multiple criminal charges, recently referenced his Bitcoin holdings while mocking members of the press. After an event at the American LGBTQ+ Museum on Dec. 3, Adams responded to a question about Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s potential role in government by mentioning the Bitcoin he received while in office. Encouraging others not to fear Bitcoin, Adams quipped, “Remember y’all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin, who’s laughing now?” He recalled the criticism he faced for his decision to accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin, and stated, “Now you wish you would have done it.” Adams became New York City’s mayor in January of 2022, and announced his intention to take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin when the cryptocurrency was priced at around $61,000. Since then, Bitcoin’s value rose to approximately $102,000, which is an impressive increase. His decision came as part of a broader push among elected officials to adopt crypto-based salaries, after Miami Mayor Francis Suarez’s similar pledge. Adams wanted to position New York City as a hub for the cryptocurrency industry. He often promotes crypto-friendly policies and criticises restrictive legislation, like the state’s 2022 two-year moratorium on non-renewable energy-based proof-of-work mining. However, Adams’ tenure has been marred by legal troubles. In September, he was indicted on charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, bribery, and accepting campaign contributions from foreign nationals. If he is convicted and sentenced consecutively, he could face decades in prison. Despite these challenges, Adams is still advocating for cryptocurrency. Government’s $1.9B Bitcoin Move Criticized by Experts The U.S. government’s recent decision to transfer $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase attracted a lot of criticism from the crypto industry. Jason Lowery , a United States Space Force major and author, labeled the move a “strategic mistake,” and argued that selling Bitcoin fails to recognize the technology's significance. He also warned that actions like this could lead to future attempts by the government to reclaim the Bitcoin sold. He even compared it to the 1933 Executive Order 6102, which restricted gold ownership. The transfer was conducted on Dec. 2, and involved 19,800 BTC that was sent to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong completely agreed with Lowery’s sentiments, and suggested the government should keep its holdings. Other critics, including crypto educator Toby Cunningham , shared that any sold Bitcoin will very likely be quickly absorbed by the market. Despite speculation about an impending sale, analytics platform Spot On Chain suggested that the transfers might be custody-related rather than sales. Julio Moreno , the head of research at CryptoQuant, estimated that only 10,000 BTC were likely sold, with the rest moved to a new address. Spot On Chain data indicates the U.S. government still holds approximately 183,850 BTC, which is valued at $17.7 billion across various wallets. The transfer caused Bitcoin’s price to dip almost 3% to $94,500 before recovering. The lack of official confirmation of a sale also left traders with a lot of questions about the government’s intentions with its huge Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin Whales Remain Cautious While Mayor Eric Adams seems very bullish on Bitcoin, traders are taking a more cautious approach. This is especially due to the fact that BTC still continues to hover close to $100,000. As a result, whales adopted a more cautious stance and crypto analysts are pointing to mixed market signals. According to CryptoQuant contributor Onat Tütüncüler , a large inflow of Bitcoin to exchanges has been observed since Donald Trump’s presidential election win, which could indicate a potential risk of future sell-offs. However, there is no immediate selling pressure, which suggests that large holders are taking a “wait-and-see” approach. Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio chart (Source: CryptoQuant ) Tütüncüler also pointed out that the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) does not yet indicate serious profit-taking activity, which aligns with typical bull run behavior where traders hold Bitcoin in anticipation of more growth. Despite this, Bitcoin dominance dropped a lot since Nov. 28, which could hint at a possible rotation into other cryptocurrencies. BTC's price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitcoin is currently trading hands at $102,888.78 after hitting a new all time high price of $103,900.47 over the past 24 hours. Long-term holders, who bought their Bitcoin at an average price of $24,994, have seen massive unrealized gains.

At this price, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is well above $2 trillion, about $1.2 trillion higher than where it stood at the start of the year. November and now December have been the magic months for similar achievements. Bitcoin first broke through to five figures USD per one ($10,000) on November 28, 2017. It first reached four figures per coin ($1,000) on November 27, 2013. Bitcoin’s best-performing month historically, on average, is November – particularly during or after a Bitcoin halving year.

This marks a 7.62% sell over the past 24 hours. Amid the increased bullish momentum in the crypto market, Ethereum’s price records a 4.18% jump to surpass the $3,800 barrier. Currently, with a market cap of $461 million, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,829. Will this breakout rally result in a new 52-week high for Ethereum? Let’s find out. Ethereum Price Analysis In the 4-hour chart, the Ethereum price action showcases a rising channel pattern containing a bullish trend. Within the channel, the Ethereum price action showcases a breakout of crucial resistance at $3,700. Tradingview With 7 consecutive bullish candle streaks, the Ethereum price surged nearly 9% from the local support trendline and the 50-EMA line. The bullish turnaround started with the Morningstar pattern and peaked at $39.06. However, with the Morningstar reversal, the current 4-hour candle showcases two doji formations. With an extended price range, the candles are retesting the broken supply zone. This increases the possibility of a post-retest bounceback to challenge the overhead resistance trendline. Ethereum Technicals and Price Targets Based on supporting the bullish trend at hand, the MACDs and signal lines have given a positive crossover with a boost in bullish histograms. Furthermore, the positive alignment of the 20-day and 50-day EMA are acting as dynamic support levels. Hence, a bullish trend in Ethereum is likely to surpass its current 52-week high and challenge the overhead resistance trendline near $4100. On the flip side, the crucial resistance-turned-support zone at $3750 will likely absorb any surge in supply pressure. Will the bull run in ETH surpass $5,000? Find out now in Coinpedia’s well-rounded ETH price prediction ! FAQs Can Ethereum hit a new 52-week high? Yes, Ethereum is on track to break its 52-week high. The next target is $4,100, but it faces major resistance there. What is Ethereum’s key support level? The key support level for Ethereum is $3,750. If the price drops, this zone should help hold the bullish trend intact. What is Ethereum’s current price? Ethereum is trading at $3,829, showing strong momentum toward the $4,100 target.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 05:51:58

But things didn’t go as expected. The company announced on its X account that they’re holding off until they get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). While this is frustrating for fans of Ripple, the delay might actually work in their favor. What Makes RLUSD Different? What’s the deal with RLUSD? It’s not just another stablecoin trying to make a splash. The stable coin is designed to be pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. It will be backed by reserves like actual dollars, short term US Treasury securities and cash equivalents. But here’s the kicker: Ripple’s stablecoin is built to work across two major platforms, XRPL and Ethereum. That’s a big deal. It could open doors for Ripple to play a larger role in decentralized finance (DeFi), where stablecoins are already a critical piece of the puzzle. Ripple clearly wants RLUSD to go head-to-head with the market’s big players, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Earlier this year, Ripple tested RLUSD on Ethereum and its XRP Ledger, and the results seemed promising. Now, they’re waiting to launch it officially—and that means following the rules in one of the toughest regulatory environments, New York. Why the Delay Matters For some people the delay in launch might look like a problem. However, Ripple is very serious about going by the rules. They are waiting for NYDFS approval for their stable coin because they want it to be trusted, not just by crypto people but by institutions as well as regulators. This careful approach might slow them down, but it could also help Ripple stand out in a market where regulatory compliance is often overlooked. And trust is a big deal, especially when it comes to stablecoins. Ripple’s Bigger Picture Ripple isn’t just launching a stablecoin. They are changing how people see the company. For a lot of people, Ripple is only known as the firm behind XRP token. With the launch of RLUSD, they are positioning themselves as a leader in regulated digital finance. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has also been vocal about crypto regulation. He recently supported Paul Atkins for SEC chair, saying the agency needs someone who can bring common sense back to crypto policy. Ripple wants more than just to launch RLUSD—they want to influence how the entire crypto industry grows. What’s Next? Sure, the delay isn’t ideal. But Ripple is playing the long game here. If they get the green light from NYDFS, RLUSD could be a real competitor in the stablecoin market. It’s not just about taking on USDT or USDC. It’s about showing that Ripple can thrive in a regulated world. Ripple’s approach might seem slow, but it’s clear they’re aiming for something bigger. Trust, innovation, and a stablecoin that could shake up the market. The wait might just be worth it.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 05:55:17

According to Arkham Intelligence, the transfer involving 24,051 BTC valued at $2.47 billion took place on December 5 (UTC). The amount was sent to an address starting with “1N7j.” The exchange, which remained dormant since November 12, kicked off its activity at 02:45 (UTC), according to blockchain data.

Is this move bearish for Bitcoin? It’s unclear why Mt. Gox, which went bankrupt in 2014, moved these assets at this time.

However, these deposits were made at an average Ethereum price of $3,505, raising curiosity about the timing and purpose behind these moves. Adding to the excitement, just 8 hours ago, Sun deposited another 20,000 ETH, valued at $76.3 million, into HTX as Ethereum’s price broke past the $3,800 mark. Motive Behind The Transfer The scale and timing of these transfers have sparked plenty of chatter in the crypto space. Many in the crypto community suggest that Sun might be preparing for a big trade or looking to secure liquidity. Others see it as a strategic move, aligning perfectly with Ethereum’s upward trend. The heavy focus on HTX, where the bulk of the funds have been directed, raises additional questions. Could this be a show of trust in the exchange’s stability, or is there something bigger at play? Ethereum Price Analysis Ethereum is showing strength, gradually climbing from the $3,550 support zone. It recently broke above $3,800, reaching a high near $3,895, fueling optimism among traders. Ethereum chart analysis suggests that the next key challenges for ETH are $3,920 and $3,950. If the price manages to break through these levels, it could pave the way for a move toward $4,000 . A successful push above $4,000 might even lead to further gains, potentially reaching $4,050 or $4,120. On the flip side, if Ethereum struggles to clear $3,920, it could face a pullback.

By 2027, ADA/USD could achieve a value of $5.53. By 2030, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.98. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Thanks to its recent rally, Cardano has become the ninth-largest cryptocurrency, with its market capitalization exceeding $34.7 billion. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano? Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $1.20 Market Cap $41.94B Trading Volume $2.94B Circulating Supply 35.09B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $1.24 24-hour Low $1.15 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 35.08% 50-day SMA $0.597968 14-Day RSI 80.97 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Green Days 24/30 (80%) Cardano price analysis: ADA support at $0.4 and resistance at $1.1 ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day chart On December 04, the 1-day Cardano (ADA) chart indicates a strong bullish trend, with the current price at $1.200. The price has maintained its position above the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMAs) at $0.960 and $0.618, respectively. This highlights sustained upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 81.63, signaling an overbought condition that could lead to short-term price corrections. The Bollinger Bands show significant expansion, with the upper band at $1.302, suggesting increased volatility. ADA is experiencing positive price action but may face resistance near $1.300 due to overbought signals. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart for Cardano (ADA) shows a price consolidation near $1.201 after reaching a recent high of $1.211. The Balance of Power (BoP) indicator at 0.29 suggests bullish strength, albeit not overwhelmingly dominant. Meanwhile, the MACD (12,26) is displaying a bearish crossover, with the signal line at 0.040, slightly above the MACD line at 0.031, indicating potential downward pressure. Despite these signals, the price remains well-supported above $1.177, serving as immediate support. A breakout above $1.211 could propel the price higher, while failure to hold support might lead to a retest of the $1.100 level. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.913294 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.982742 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.988601 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.893906 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.597968 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.476387 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.458513 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.829377 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.700775 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.55771 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.461109 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.40401 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.394003 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.411673 BUY Cardano price analysis conclusion Based on both the daily and 4-hour charts, Cardano (ADA) shows a bullish scenario, but caution is warranted due to overbought RSI levels on the daily timeframe (81.63). The price, currently at $1.201, is testing resistance near $1.302. The 4-hour chart shows consolidation, with support holding at $1.177. However, the MACD displays a bearish crossover, signaling possible short-term corrections. If bulls maintain control, a breakout above $1.302 is likely, targeting higher resistance. Conversely, a failure to sustain momentum could lead to a pullback toward $1.100, especially if the bearish MACD divergence intensifies in lower timeframes. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2024, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to reach $5 by 2027, with a forecasted range of around $5.53. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $8.98 by 2030. While this brings it closer to the $10 mark, it is not expected to achieve that level yet. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $1, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $9. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

By 2025, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $3.08. Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021, when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. It then formed a local high at $0.810 on 14 March 2024 before dipping again to $0.401 in April 2024 due to heavy selling pressure as early investors rushed to cut their losses. From 13 April 2024, Cardano has been trading between $0.52 and $0.401, with strong support at the $0.4 mark. It has retested this zone twice and rejected it, which suggests that recovery may be possible once this consolidation period ends. In May 2024, Cardano made a local top at $0.51 and rebounded lower after retesting this resistance level. ADA is traded within the range of $0.317 and $0.423 in July after forming a local bottom at $0.317. In August, it formed strong support at the $0.33 mark but retraced towards the upside. During September, the price experienced a peak at $0.37. However, by October 04, it slightly declined, trading at $0.35 In early November, Cardano’s price was trading at $0.33. On December 04, the Cardano price went as high as$1.1999 with a trading volume of $2.95B",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-05 06:08:53

With a decentralized exchange that supports over 50,000 assets and a unique revenue-sharing model, Lunex Network seeks to transform crypto trading and asset management. Experts believe it will outperform established players like Avalanche and XRP by 2025. Lunex Network is set to disrupt the blockchain ecosystem by concentrating on privacy, user-friendliness, and scalability. Avalanche (AVAX) Saw An Over 120% Price Increase In November Avalanche has recently shown impressive price performance. Nearly 596,000 AVAX tokens were transferred into the Grayscale Avalanche Trust a few days ago, signaling growing confidence from major investors. This transfer highlights the strong interest of significant market players in Avalanche. The altcoin recorded a 120% gain in November 2024 and has maintained a price above $45 after breaking out of a year-long descending channel. On-chain activity supports this momentum, with active addresses increasing by 28.56% to reach 60,460. The Avalanche9000 upgrade has significantly strengthened the ecosystem. This upgrade reduced deployment costs by 99.9% and unlocked $40 million in grants for developers, enhancing the platform’s appeal to the broader crypto community. All these developments highlight Avalanche’s increasing prominence in the blockchain space. XRP (XRP) Becomes 3rd Largest Crypto By Market Cap XRP recently overtook Tether (USDT) as the third biggest cryptocurrency by market value. By December 1, 2024, XRP had a market cap of $143.8 billion, in comparison with USDT’s $134.5 billion. XRP’s price has jumped 16% to $2.68 in 24 hours and 433% in the past month. XRP also overtook Solana in market cap during the weekend. Ripple’s legal fight with the SEC and the possible approval of its RLUSD stablecoin have fuelled this particular price rise. Sources indicate that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) might approve RLUSD on December 4. This approval would enable Ripple to integrate RLUSD directly into RippleNet, strengthening its cross-border payment system and stabilizing XRP. XRP’s optimism also increased with the SEC leadership change expected shortly. Current SEC chairman Gary Gensler is departing by January 2025 and a more lenient stance toward Ripple is hoped to emerge under a brand new leadership. Some experts think new SEC leadership might result in a settlement or dismissal of the case. XRP remains 27.6% below its all-time high of $3.40 from Jan 2018 despite the latest rally. The latest surge restored investor confidence in XRP although some analysts point out it might be temporary and warn new buyers of the risks. Lunex Network (LNEX) Gives Full Control To The Traders Lunex Network is making waves in DeFi as a hybrid Web3 exchange. Lunex Network brings together the benefits of centralized and decentralized platforms without the typical disadvantages. The platform’s non-custodial structure provides users complete control of the assets, eliminating the security risks of central exchanges. Also, Lunex Network enables e-commerce and trading via its fiat-to-crypto on-ramping system with institutional-grade liquidity. The platform also stands out by prioritizing security and privacy. Lunex Network removes KYC requirements, giving users an anonymous trading experience. Additionally, its Lunex Pro subscription offers extra benefits like cashback rewards and anti-money laundering checks on wallet addresses, making it highly attractive to investors. Lunex Network uses smart contract technology to enable seamless trades. This innovation allows users to quickly swap more than 50,000 assets with some of the lowest fees in the market. The ongoing $LNEX token presale has surged by 200% , drawing early adopters and seasoned traders. Many are eager to benefit from Lunex Network’s potential for high returns and its ambitious roadmap. The crypto market is alive with innovation as projects like Lunex Network, XRP, and Avalanche push boundaries. Lunex Network is leading with its 200% presale growth, while XRP boasts a 345% year-to-date increase, and AVAX is gaining momentum from institutional backing. While XRP and Avalanche may have peaked, Lunex Network’s presale, priced at just $0.0036, remains a hot opportunity.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $897.60 by the end of 2027. By 2030, Monero’s price may surge to $1,466.22 Monero (XMR) stands out in the cryptocurrency space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions. This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security. The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero continues to progress, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth? Can it sustain its competitive edge in the ever-evolving crypto market? Will XMR recapture its ATH at $517.62? Overview Cryptocurrency Monero Token XMR Price $195.92 Market Cap $3.61B Trading Volume 24-h $180.91M Circulating Supply 18.45M XMR All-time High $517.62 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.213, Jan 15, 2015 24-h High $207.05 24-h Low $185.09 Monero price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $153.01 200-Day SMA $157.91 Price Prediction $405.69 (110.97%) F & G Index 19.71 (extreme fear) Green Days 16/30 (54%) 14-Day RSI 89.53 Monero price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Current Monero price rose to $210 as bulls crushed lower resistances. The XMR coin had risen by over 2.5% at the time of writing. Monero prices have sought support and resistance at $200 and $210, respectively. The Monero price analysis for December 5, shows high volatility as XMR rises to the $210.00 mark as bulls dominate the market. The price fell to the $200 mark but the momentum remained strongly bullish. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR rises to $210 as bulls charge through The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicated a bullish trend in the market as prices moved toward $160.00. The Bulls made a strong charge at the $175 mark. In recent days, the price rose to $210 as bullish pressure increased but corrected to $194. Monero (XMR) price rises to $152 The Indicators reflect the bullish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show positive signs. The MACD is bullish at 4.64 units, showing strong bullish sentiment, while the EMAs are also above the mean position, and their gradient turns positive as the price rises. The RSI also shares this sentiment, rising to around the 73.00 index level from the 30.00 mark, showing room for further upward movement in the short term. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest lower volatility, indicating that the $210.00 resistance may hold for the week. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows Monero making a sudden breakthrough as the price broke past the $180 level all the way to $210 within a 4-hour period. Monero (XMR) price struggles below $1 50 The RSI is at 62.18, suggesting that the asset is near the center of the neutral region. The MACD, at 1.46, shows bullish dominance across the 4-hour charts, which has decreased with recent candles. The sentiment is further supported by the EMAs, which show a declining slope. These indicators collectively indicate a consolidation forming at the current price level. Monero technical indicators: Levels and actions Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 158.25 BUY SMA 5 $ 156.08 BUY SMA 10 $ 154.05 BUY SMA 21 $ 153.65 BUY SMA 50 $ 152.81 BUY SMA 100 $ 157.47 BUY SMA 200 $ 149.60 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 153.42 BUY EMA 5 $ 152.66 BUY EMA 10 $ 151.83 BUY EMA 21 $ 152.59 BUY EMA 50 $ 156.38 BUY EMA 100 $ 157.49 BUY EMA 200 $ 155.46 BUY What to expect from Monero price analysis? 4-hour price chart by Tradingview Monero price analysis shows XMR has been in a bullish rally since early October. Despite the flash crash a few days ago, the bulls quickly bought the dip to recover the asset’s price back above the $180.00 mark. The bulls have crushed the short-term resistances held by the bears, and as the price enters the $210 level, the $200 provides a secure foothold for short-term movements. As such, traders can expect the price to halt its bullish rally as the buying pressure decreases. As such, the price can be expected to hover around the $205 price level across the next few days. However, the bulls need to guard the $200 and the $185 key support level to prevent a fall to the $150 level. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio. Why is XMR up? As bulls found support at $140, XMR made a swift recovery back to the $150 price level. The bullish market sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market translated well for Monero as the cryptocurrency soon saw a strong bullish rally in the first few days of December leading the price past the $200 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. Will XMR reach $250? Monero is experiencing a strong bullish rally that may reach the $250 mark before the year closes.’s Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors. Adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals make it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes. Recent news/opinion on Monero Justin Ehrenhofer, granting an interview to Coindesk, says: “One thing that keeps coming up is that privacy is always a battle – you always have people that are getting better and better about tracing… So privacy needs to keep getting better and better. The tools need to keep getting better and better. You can’t just stand still because if you stand still you become obsolete.” Start9Labs announced the integration of BTCPayServer to allow Monero transactions for e-commerce stores.

In a statement posted on its official X account, the company emphasized that the launch remains pending final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple reiterated its commitment to regulatory compliance, stating: “Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards.” Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. Stay tuned… — Ripple (@Ripple) December 4, 2024 The update comes as the crypto community awaits RLUSD’s release, which has faced a protracted approval process. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously indicated plans to launch the stablecoin months ago , but the timeline was extended due to regulatory considerations. XRP Community Reactions Ripple’s statement elicited varied responses from the community. Some voiced frustration, pointing out the extended timeline for the launch. One user remarked , “It was supposed to launch at the end of Q3, yet here we are at the end of Q4.” Others expressed optimism, with one user commenting , “It’s ok even if it doesn’t launch today. We all know it will launch soon and that will be a huge next step for XRP/Ripple into becoming a dominant market in the crypto world.” Many in the community also thanked Ripple for the update as a large section of the community anticipates the stablecoin’s launch today. The overall sentiment highlights the high expectations surrounding RLUSD and potential to enhance Ripple’s ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How Does this Affect XRP? The launch of RLUSD is widely seen as a significant development for Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, the XRP Ledger (XRPL). As RLUSD integrates with the XRPL, it is anticipated to drive increased activity on the network. This, in turn, could boost the utility of XRP, the native digital asset used as a bridge currency for transactions on the platform. Greater adoption of RLUSD and the XRPL would likely enhance liquidity and strengthen Ripple’s position in the digital payments market. Some in the community have proposed that RLUSD could help XRP climb as high as $10,000 . Not everyone shares these lofty targets, but the consensus is that RLUSD’s launch will significantly benefit XRP. The stablecoin’s launch also represents a strategic move to attract institutional users seeking compliant, stable, and efficient solutions for financial operations.

Its performance far outpaces traditional equities, solidifying its position as a premier digital asset. Ethereum Faces Challenges While Ethereum’s 34.9% YTD growth is significant, it lags behind its peers. This underperformance is largely attributed to declining market dominance amid rising competition from new Layer 2 solutions and alternative blockchains. Even the launch of the US-based Ethereum Spot ETF failed to fully offset this trend. Solana’s Resurgence Solana made an extraordinary recovery following the fallout from FTX’s 2022 collapse. Its market cap surged 134.3%, driven primarily by the 2023 price rally from $15 to $150 during the “meme coin mania.” Emerging Winners – TRON: Benefited from meme coin trends, achieving an 85.5% increase in market cap. – TON: Saw a 136.2% rise, fueled by the popularity of Telegram’s tap-to-earn games utilizing its blockchain. – Sui Network: Topped the list with a staggering 338.2% YTD market cap growth. This was driven by rising investor interest, robust on-chain activity, and enhanced dApp utility, bolstered by Circle’s USDC integration. How did the top 10 L1 coins perform in 2024? Our study shows that #Bitcoin 's market cap grew by 112.9%, #Ethereum by 34.9%, and #Solana by 134.3%—all outperforming the S&P 500's 24.8% YTD gain.

This prevented the token from breaking down the crucial range and validated the presence of the bulls. Presently, the DOGE price is facing significant bearish action, which may drag the levels lower, offering a good buying range for the bulls and the whales. Since the past few days, the whales have been constantly accumulating tokens and acquiring over 150 million DOGE. Besides, the number of large transactions between $100K and $1M has also surged to a large extent. This indicates that the whales are continuing with the same pattern as they did before by accumulating at the lows at around $0.4. After the price experienced equal pressure on either of the sides, the bears are trying hard to push the token lower. With a drop in the buyer’s strength, will the DOGE price again mark the lows at $0.4? The DOGE price suggests the bulls are relaxing a bit after displaying acute strength in the past few weeks. The Bollinger bands expanded heavily and contracted following a drop in the volume. Currently, the bands are going parallel to each other, suggesting a period of low volatility. The price, which is stuck within a symmetrical triangle, is expected to consolidate within a narrow range, signalling a sideways market trend with limited price movement. On the other hand, the RSI is decremental, forming lower highs and lows, substantiating the descending consolidation. Therefore, the DOGE price is believed to remain consolidated within the pennant for the next 10 days until it reaches the apex of the pattern. Currently, the market participants have shifted their focus back over the top 2 tokens, Bitcoin & Ethereum, and hence, after they book some profits, the liquidity flow could be back over the traditional altcoins. Therefore, the target of $0.55 to $0.6 for the Dogecoin price continues to remain intact, which could be achieved before the end of 2024.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 07:41:00

Digital asset market momentum has largely been driven by Donald Trump’s presidential election victory and the promise of a pro-crypto regulatory landscape in the United States. Since election day on Nov. 5, almost $1.5 trillion has entered the crypto market as total cap has surged a whopping 63% in just one month. Bitcoin Cap Hits $2T The crypto market cap is now up 24% from its previous peak during the 2021 bull market when it topped out at $3.08 trillion. This was 270% higher than the 2017 market cap peak of $830 billion, so a similar gain in this cycle could propel the market cap to around $11 trillion in 2025. Crypto assets have a long way to go since markets currently account for just 21% of the entire gold market cap, which is $17.9 trillion. Today’s record has been driven by Bitcoin, which surged to its own all-time high of just under $104,000 during early trading in Asia on Thursday. As a result, Bitcoin’s dominance has recovered to reclaim 57% following a substantial dip caused by altcoin momentum over the past couple of weeks. Bitcoin market cap has also exceeded $2 trillion for the first time ever, making it the world’s seventh largest asset, just behind Google parent Alphabet with $2.1 trillion capitalization. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor predicted that the Bitcoin market cap would reach a whopping $280 trillion by 2045, which equates to $13 million per coin. “Bitcoin flips Gold market cap 2037. That’s my guess,” said trader Bob Loukas. At the moment, it is just 11% of gold’s market capitalization. Altcoin Market Cap at ATH Ethereum has still failed to reclaim its psychological barrier at $4,000, but it is not far off it. The ETH market cap topped $460 billion as the asset spiked to $3,900 on Thursday morning. Aside from stablecoins, the next largest digital asset by market capitalization is XRP, which has $130 billion and recently flipped Solana, which has $110 billion. Total altcoin market capitalization has also hit a new peak of $1.85 trillion, surpassing its November 2021 peak, according to Coingecko. Remarkably, Ethereum and stablecoins alone comprise 35% of this total.

The milestone, achieved in just 228 days, dwarfs the previous record set by BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, which took 1,329 days to reach the same mark. According to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this underscores a seismic shift in Bitcoin’s role within institutional portfolios. The rapid ascent of IBIT is closely tied to a landmark year for Bitcoin itself. The world’s leading cryptocurrency recently breached the $100,000 threshold , peaking at $103,000 and recording a 150% gain in the past 12 months. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game-Changer for Adoption BlackRock’s IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, has played a pivotal role in simplifying cryptocurrency investment for traditional investors. Approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year, spot Bitcoin ETFs eliminate the complexities associated with direct crypto trading and custody. Farside Investors reports that IBIT recorded $570.7 million in inflows as of Wednesday’s market close. Analysts from Bitfinex highlighted that fresh demand from new investors has been instrumental in driving Bitcoin’s price to new highs despite ongoing profit-taking. “Strong ETF inflows and institutional buying have outpaced any selling pressure, enabling Bitcoin to maintain its bullish trajectory,” they noted. Pro-Crypto Momentum Adding fuel to IBIT’s momentum is the pro-crypto sentiment accompanying President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office . With anti-crypto SEC chair Gary Gensler stepping down, Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly former SEC commissioner, to lead the regulatory body. Analysts believe Atkins’ leadership could usher in a more collaborative approach to crypto regulation, fostering a favorable environment for further Bitcoin ETF growth. Additionally, Trump has proposed bold initiatives, including a U.S. Bitcoin reserve and protections for domestic crypto mining. Such policies could solidify Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate investment vehicle while elevating the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. As Bitcoin’s narrative evolves from a speculative asset to an institutional mainstay, ETFs like IBIT stand at the forefront , bridging traditional finance with the crypto revolution.

With an over 500% rally this year, MSTR has outperformed BTC and is on the path to attain new highs. As a result, it has become one of the top picks for hedge funds looking to ride the MSTR volatility. MicroStrategy Stock on Upward Trajectory Again MicroStrategy stock is once again showing strength by reversing from the lows of $350 last week, as Bitcoin breaks out of its consolidation phase. On Wednesday, the MSTR stock price gained 8.72% surging past $400 levels once again. Furthermore, the stock price jumps 10% in overnight trading as Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 milestone . The company’s Bitcoin holdings have now surpassed a valuation of $40 billion for the first time ever. Source: The Kobeissi Letter MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor revealed that the company raised $13.5 billion in November to acquire 149,880 BTC at an average price of approximately $90,231 per Bitcoin. This strategic move delivered a Bitcoin yield of 38.7%, equating to a net benefit of 97,500 BTC for shareholders, or an impressive 3,250 BTC per day. This amount translates to $10 billion. Amid the current BTC price rally, the company’s value of total Bitcoin holdings of 402,100 BTC, has surged past $40.8 billion. As a result, the company is sitting on a massive profit of $18 billion in its BTC pile. Bernstein analysts have already given the MSTR stock target of $600 suggesting another 50% gain from here. Hedge Funds Riding MSTR Volatility Eli Pars, co-chief Investment Officer at Calamos Advisors LLC, has played a significant role in acquiring over $6 billion in convertible notes issued by MicroStrategy this year. Like other firms, Pars uses the notes in market-neutral arbitrage strategies that capitalize on the heightened volatility of the underlying asset—Bitcoin. Calamos Advisors holds more than $130 million in MicroStrategy notes, employing a mix of long positions and arbitrage strategies to manage exposure and maximize returns. Pars said: “Convertibles are a way for issuers to monetize the volatility of their stocks, and MicroStrategy is an extreme example”. Additionally, MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds have captured the attention of Wall Street professionals, thanks to their attractive pricing, which offers the potential for substantial arbitrage profits. The company has emerged as the largest global issuer of convertible bonds this year. “The trade is attractive because the implied vol of the converts is way below realized vol or option implied vol,” said Pars. As the MicroStrategy stock surges, Michael Saylor continues to raise more money through stock sales and puts that back into Bitcoin. This pushes BTC price even higher, which triggers additional gains for MSTR, thereby creating a loop. The risk lies in the potential for Bitcoin’s year-long rally to reverse, which could lead to significant consequences for investors holding increasingly leveraged positions on its value. David Trainer, CEO of market research firm New Constructs LLC said: “It could be a giant house of cards that will crush many shareholders when it crashes. There is no fundamental benefit here. It has become a game of musical chairs, you play until the music stops and you just hope you can get out before the crash.” BTC price jumped 7% in the past 24 hours to hit a high of 103,900. Bulls maintain the price above $102K as the trading volume has increased by 75% in the last few hours, indicating a massive interest among traders.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 07:51:00

The community lost it and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor is even considering throwing a party in Malibu to celebrate. But of course Bitcoin’s breakthrough has made some people really unhappy and bitter. Peter Schiff, stockbroker and proud BTC hater, came up on X to throw cold water at the community’s celebrations. “It’s ironic that Bitcoin only hit $100k by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government,” he said . Peter added that without the government intervention he actually claimed to have foresaw, Bitcoin never would have made it. He attributed the asset’s entire performance this year to politics. In his words: “What couldn’t be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state.” It’s a bitter truth Though his crypto criticisms are always biased, Peter does make a great point here. Let’s be realistic. If Trump wasn’t just silly enough to take the crypto nerds serious, and if the nerds’ own elites didn’t have $100 million and Elon Musk to lobby with, we probably wouldn’t be where we are right now. But let’s also be fair. Everything the industry has managed to do this year (thanks to folks like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, and TRON’s Justin Sun) is just what Wall Street has been doing for literal centuries. Crypto stepped to the field this year, and played their own game better than them. Though to be fair, stock bros and crypto bros have been on the same side throughout the year so there was never any competition. Trump brought everyone together. So yes, Bitcoin needed the government to intervene for it to hit $100,000 this year. But it’s not just any government. It’s the most pro-crypto White House and Congress in the history of the world led by a man who proudly calls himself “crypto president.” Bitcoin didn’t need a president. It needed a believer, a strong-willed leader that can bring along like-minded believers. And get this, around five years ago, Peter posted, “Keep dreaming. Bitcoin is never going to hit $100,000!” No wonder he’s so mad. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao humorously responded to him two hours ago with an iconic “Don’t dream. Keep building!” Just earlier, New York City Mayor Eric Adams was telling a crowd “Remember y’all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin? Who’s laughing now?” It really is a party in the USA. Long Live, Trump! Meanwhile, the crypto president has become an awe to fellow world leaders, citizens, Wall Street , and Crypto Twitter alike. In the beginning of his crypto campaign (and perhaps even up until last month), everyone still had their doubts about his love for the industry. Wouldn’t have been the first, or even tenth time Trump has failed to fulfill campaign promises. We all know that. But the community was also worried because some of his economic policies will quite literally crush crypto, along with the stock market. The president is a very stubborn man. He wants to be in charge of the Federal Reserve , he wants to create a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, he wants to protect USD’s throne, and he wants to slap tariffs on at least five of the world’s most powerful countries. Even with the most basic knowledge of economics, it is easy to understand how these things – combined together, along with a side of Trump – will be impossible to achieve. It’s either Trump gives up his America First agendas for crypto, or vice versa. It’s highly unlikely that he would pick the latter, and with a good reason. Clearly, the man has the toughest job in the world right now. And he reports to office on exactly January 20th. That’s when it’ll start. A revolution, or a spectacular crash. No in-between.

Gox transferred approximately 24,000 BTC worth approximately $2.4 billion to an unidentified wallet address late Wednesday, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The recipient, an unmarked wallet identified as “1N7jW…1u8Yp,” took 24,051.75 BTC from Mt Gox’s cold storage, marking the first significant transfer from the defunct exchange since November 12. It remains unclear whether the latest transfer is linked to Mt. Gox’s planned repayment to creditors. Historically, similar large transfers have preceded repayments facilitated through centralized exchanges like Bitstamp and Kraken. Earlier this year, the exchange further extended the wait for creditors seeking compensation by postponing the repayment deadline from October 31, 2024 to October 31, 2025. Bitcoin Reaches $100,000 Milestone The transfer coincided with Bitcoin reaching a historic price milestone of surpassing $100,000 amid a prolonged market rally. Once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014 following a security breach that led to the loss of at least 850,000 BTC. This incident threw the cryptocurrency market into turmoil and left thousands of creditors demanding compensation. Wednesday’s transfer reignited speculation about the timing and scale of future distributions as Mt. Gox’s payout process continues. For now, the move highlights the enduring complexity of resolving one of the most infamous incidents in cryptocurrency history. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, on-chain data on Thursday indicated that the bankrupt crypto exchange moved a staggering 24K BTC after BTC price topped $100K. This transaction fueled skepticism among investors over potential creditor repayment plans. Mt Gox Transfers 24K BTC Sparking Market Skepticism According to data from Spot on Chain on December 5, Mt. Gox shifted 24,052 BTC worth a whopping $2.43 billion to a new wallet “1N7jW.” This transaction promptly followed Bitcoin’s price topping $100K, garnering notable attention. Although speculations of the wallet being an internal address loom, market watchers remain apprehensive as the defunct exchange has yet to pay its creditors. Further, on-chain data also pointed out that the exchange held 15,826 BTC, worth $1.63 billion, across 31 known wallet addresses to date. Besides, it’s worth mentioning that CoinGape reported Mt Gox to have moved 2,570 Bitcoins the previous month. Overall, the massive shift of funds amid ongoing creditor repayment plans remains a hot buzz in the market, with the abovementioned transfers further weighing in. Bitcoin Tops $100K At the time of reporting, BTC price gained nearly 5% intraday and is currently trading at $101.688. Its intraday low and high were $94,660.52 and $103,900.47. Notably, the flagship crypto surge came in response to Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies. A recent CoinGape report further revealed that Donald Trump finally announced Paul Atkins to serve as new SEC Chair , sparking crypto market optimism. Also, Coinglass showed a 9% increase in Bitcoin futures OI to $64.62 billion. Further, the derivatives volume soared 95% to $154.09 billion. Overall, this data flags heightened investor interest in the asset amid market maneuvers in its favor. Simultaneously, top crypto market analyst Ali Martinez reiterated in an X post amid this rising movement, revealing that the coin further eyes a $135,000 or even $159,000 target before a sharp 15-30% correction. This bullish anticipation rides the back of historical trends. Market enthusiasts continue to eye the flagship crypto for further price action shifts as Mt Gox continues to move heavy amounts amid a strong broader market.

The crypto tracker Lookonchain first spotted the unknown address, which moved 2,700 BTC to another wallet on Tuesday. The long-dormant wallet received the trove of BTC in December 2013, when the top crypto asset only cost $625.84. BTC was priced at $95,361 at the time of Tuesday’s transfer, meaning the USD value of the wallet’s holdings skyrocketed by a staggering 15,137.4% in 11 years. Data from BitInfoCharts indicates the long-dormant wallet did receive trace amounts of Bitcoin a handful of times over the last 11 years, though those transactions appear to be the result of dusting attacks. Dusting attacks involve hackers and scammers sending minuscule amounts of cryptocurrency (dust) to numerous personal wallets in an attempt to break the wallet holders’ privacy. The scammers then try to trace the transactional activity of targeted wallets in order to identify the people or companies behind them. Bitcoin is trading at $98,687 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 3% in the past 24 hours and is less than 1% down from its all-time high of $ 99,645, which it set on November 22nd.

This sharp tail-off has pushed XRP away from the position of the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, falling short of Tether’s ( USDT ) market cap of $135.8 billion.

XRP’s 24-hour trading volume also plummeted to $26.02 billion, nearly 40% down from yesterday. XRP futures trading volume drops sharply to below $16 billion on December 4, 2024, accompanied by a declining price trend, highlighting reduced market activity. | Source: crypto.news While the news of the postponement of RLUSD preceded the drop in price, speculations could be tied to the panic selling, as per Glassnode metrics. This is further highlighted in the increased selling pressure, where both price and trading volume has come down over $32 billion to $16 billion on Dec. 4, confirming that the market is in a cooling-off period at the moment. This could also have added to XRP’s ranking and its drop from the third largest crypto. What is next for XRP? The price could also be influenced by the surge in stablecoins the market is witnessing reflected by the 24-hour volume at $317.13 billion . Ripple’s success with its stablecoin is key to enhancing its On-Demand Liquidity platform, which facilitates swift cross-border payments and could drive XRP prices higher.

Gox News: 27,000 BTC Moved as Bitcoin Hits $104K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has soared past the $100,000 mark , reaching $103,403 as of now, a historic achievement for the crypto world. The rally represents a 7.6% surge within 24 hours, fueled by a mix of institutional support, global recognition, and growing regulatory optimism. With Trump’s support, Bitcoin has seen its long-awaited target before 2025. Recent events have helped boost Bitcoin’s price. While, Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, compared Bitcoin to gold, calling it a safe investment. Russian President Vladimir Putin also showed support for Bitcoin, saying it could make financial systems more efficient. Plus, the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair has raised hopes for better regulations in the crypto world. Mt. Gox Transfers Spark Concerns While Bitcoin enjoys its record-breaking run, market watchers are keeping a close eye on Mt. Gox, the defunct exchange that once controlled the majority of Bitcoin trading. Recently, a wallet associated with Mt. Gox moved 27,871 BTC, worth approximately $2.8 billion. Of this, 24,000 BTC was transferred to an unknown address, raising questions about the potential market impact of these activities. As per Arkham Intelligence, the exchange still holds 39,878 BTC, valued at $4.1 billion. However, the payout timeline for creditors has been extended from October 2024 to October 2025 due to ongoing verification processes. While some creditors have received fiat compensation, many are still waiting for payments in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. Historically, Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin movements have created price disruptions, with fears of massive sell-offs. However, analysts believe the market has largely priced in these effects, given the lengthy timeline for compensation. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin As Bitcoin pushes new boundaries, analysts predict even greater highs. Bitcoin veteran Kyle Chasse believes the $100K milestone could trigger a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out) buying among retail investors, potentially driving prices further upward. After this Bitcoins gala show, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, thinks Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the next two years. He believes it could even go as high as $500,000. Next year will be crucial for Bitcoin as Trump will officially take charge in the White House and bullish sentiments will run throughout January.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BCH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-05 08:05:03

The speculation initially surfaced with reports that former President Donald Trump might nominate Atkins for the position, leading RSR to skyrocket 90% in a single day. The situation intensified when, at 1:30 a.m., Trump officially confirmed his intent to nominate Atkins. In response, RSR surged by an additional 51% within hours. However, the market quickly reversed course when Atkins publicly stated that he was not interested in the role, causing RSR to shed its recent gains. 1/ OpenAI 姐妹篇之 $RSR 顾问愿不愿意当 SEC 主席 1️⃣ 此前受「特朗普或将提名 RSR 顾问 Paul Atkins 担任 SEC 主席」消息影响，RSR 一天暴涨炒 90% 2️⃣ 凌晨一点半，特朗普确定选择 Paul 担任 SEC 主席，RSR 短时暴涨 51% 3️⃣ 随后 Paul 表示不愿意接受该职位，RSR 迅速收回涨幅 4️⃣ 最新消息 Paul… pic.twitter.com/yO2DXX6W62 — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) December 4, 2024 The latest twist in the saga suggests that Atkins may still be a contender for the position. This renewed optimism has sent RSR climbing once again, reaching $0.027 before settling at its current price of $0.02196. Adding to the volatility, RSR’s market maker, GSR Markets, has been actively trading the token. Over the past two hours, GSR transferred 280 million RSR tokens, valued at approximately $6.66 million, to Binance. The firm’s frequent trading activity has played a significant role in amplifying price fluctuations in recent days. With Paul Atkins’ potential SEC nomination still in question, RSR traders are closely watching for further developments. The token’s price movements underscore the market’s sensitivity to regulatory speculation and the influence of key stakeholders like GSR Markets. As the story unfolds, investors should brace for continued volatility in the RSR market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ethereum's technical indicators, including moving averages and RSI, suggest a strong bullish setup, similar to past successful trades in DOGE and Bitcoin. If Ethereum retests its March high, ETHU could yield a 20% return; if it hits its all-time high, returns could reach 60%. Bitcoin's dominance is declining, suggesting Ethereum may lead the market; I'm planning to hold ETHU through 2024, with potential adjustments if ETH exceeds $4.5k first. Back in July, I initiated coverage of the Volatility Shares' 2x Ether ETF (BATS: ETHU ) with a 'hold' call and a cautious tone. In that piece, my view was that positions in funds like ETHU are not wise for long term investment. This is not what I'd expect to be a controversial view given that even the fund manager warns against using the product for long term investment. Rather, the primary utility of products like ETHU is for short term, tactical trades. Given that, I'm updating coverage of the fund, as I suspect longing ETHU shares will pay off handsomely between now and the end of the year. Fund Details and Objective Details ETHU Inception 6/4/2024 AUM $733.7 million Net Expense Ratio 0.94% Dividend Yield 0.30% Source: Seeking Alpha, as of 12/3/24 At 0.94%, the net expense ratio isn't the cheapest crypto-proxy that traders will find in the market. It's far less expensive to put on a straightforward spot ETF position through the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (NASDAQ: ETHA ) and pay 0.25% without the long term fund decay risk. But the lack of relative risk in something like ETHA is because the short-term reward of ETHA won't be as high as ETHU if the price of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) rises. The objective of the Volatility Shares' 2x Ether ETF is very simple because it's right in the name of the fund; ETHU intends to double the daily return of ETH. Key Risk The key risk in holding leveraged fund shares too long is capital decay. Leveraged funds are highly risky due to the fact that they are generally rebalanced daily. For a 2x long fund like ETHU, the leveraged fund shares can maximize gains very well when the underlying asset being leveraged is in a sustained uptrend. Thus, if these types of funds work as designed, on days when underlying assets increase by 1%, daily rebalanced leveraged funds should increase by 2%. Of course, if traders guess wrong they can lose a lot of capital as a 1% decline in the underlying will produce double the loss through funds like ETHU. Chop is not desired either as it will take only a few weeks for the fund to start under-performing the underlying asset, even to the upside. By taking a trading position in ETHU, one is making a short-term wager that the price of Ethereum will rally over a sustained period of time. I believe we have entered that sustained period for Ethereum. Ethereum's Technical Bull Case Earlier this month, I shared a more fundamental take on why I felt Ethereum was about to get its turn leading the market. Among my rationale, investor sentiment on the coin appears to be shifting if November capital flows are any indication. Furthermore, despite the proliferation of cheaper-to-use, less fragmented blockchain ecosystems, Ethereum is still the boss of DeFi. Beyond fundamentals though, traders often need a favorable technical setup as well before putting on any position, and I think Ethereum's setup is quite good. I generally try to keep my TA very simple. I'm not into Elliot Wave theory and I don't mess with Fibonacci levels. My approach is to simply look at relative strength, moving average trends, and breakouts. When I see the signal I want from all three, I put on the trade. TrendSpider The reason why I like this Ethereum chart so much is because I have all three elements that I want out of a chart. 50, 100, and 200 day moving averages all trending higher with the 50 set to cross the 200 RSI is back out of overbought territory after a strong rally from early November Multi-month resistance (red diagonal line) has been broken out and back-tested These elements were at play in Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) as well when I said that coin was set to run back in late-October. TrendSpider DOGE rallied over 200% following that piece. Ethereum's breakout back-test is nearly identical to the one I shared in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ) article for Seeking Alpha on November 5th when I said to buy the 'breakout shakeout.' TrendSpider Bitcoin's rally since that article has been over 30% in less than a month. I suspect Ethereum's return will be closer to that of Bitcoin rather than the wildly ridiculous 200% seen in Dogecoin over roughly the same time frame. TrendSpider But even if ETH just retests its March high of $4k per coin, ETHU should return close to 20% from current levels. If ETH tests its all-time high of $4,867 back in November 2021, ETHU should produce close to a 60% return. Closing Thoughts TrendSpider In the last two years, ETH is down about 60% against Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). We've certainly seen this happen before following the 2017 top. ETH's under-performance didn't end until 2020 when the next bull market began. I think we're seeing a similar setup today. Bitcoin dominance appears to be potentially peaking, having hit 60% via CoinMarketCap's measurement in mid-November. That figure is now closer to 53%. We've seen Bitcoin do it. We've seen meme coins do it. Even 'dino coins' have enjoyed a renaissance over the last several weeks. Based on my read on both the technicals and some of the fundamentals, I suspect ETH is going to get its turn leading the market. I'm partially expressing that view through shares of ETHU in addition to my spot ETF exposure and holding the asset directly on chain. I cannot stress enough that this ETHU position is a trade, not a long term investment. Thus, I'm still calling the fund a 'hold' rather than a 'buy.' I expect to keep the position on through the end of 2024. If ETH surpasses $4.5k per coin before that, I'll lighten or take it off entirely.",ETH-USD|ETHU,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-05 08:09:49

These transfers come from an address that received 39.91 million ONDO two months ago from a multi-signature wallet linked to the Flux Finance team. Hayes still holds ONDO tokens valued at $20.43 million, according to on-chain data. ONDO, a token representing the Real World Asset (RWA) concept, has seen a remarkable 72% price increase over the past week, signaling strong market performance. As RWA tokens gain traction for bridging traditional finance and blockchain, ONDO’s growth has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. However, Hayes expressed a contrarian view during this year’s Token2049 conference, suggesting that RWA tokens like ONDO could underperform in certain market conditions. He noted that a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve might spark a bullish trend for Ethereum (ETH). According to Hayes, tokens delivering higher returns than U.S. Treasury bonds, such as ENA, EHT, ETHFI, and PENDLE, are likely to emerge as market leaders, whereas RWA tokens could face challenges. 老黑 Arthur Hayes( @CryptoHayes ) 关联地址过去三小时向 #Gate 和 #Bybit 充值价值 866 万美金的 $ONDO 该地址曾在两个月前收到多签地址转移的 3991 万枚 ONDO（资金来源为 Flux Finance 团队地址），目前他仍持有价值 2043 万美金的代币 ONDO 作为 RWA 概念代表代币，近七天涨了 72%，很猛啊 pic.twitter.com/0E7fbCgThk — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) December 4, 2024 Hayes’ recent token movements have fueled speculation about his market outlook and intentions.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 09:11:00

The cryptocurrency beat analyst predictions of an insurmountable sell wall at $100,000 to smash past the level and move to its current $102,964. Market watchers had predicted BTC would cross $100,000 before the end of the year, but the asset has surpassed expectations with this latest milestone. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a significant increase, rising over 6% to $3,800. ETH is trading around $3,850, with buyers eying $4,000 if bullish sentiment persists. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) registered a substantial drop of almost 7% as its stunning rally cools. The drop in price means XRP is now the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with Tether (USDT) back in third. Solana (SOL) also saw its recent rally stall, with the price down almost 2% and trading at $232. Despite these drops, the crypto market cap registered an increase of 0.61% and currently sits at $3.55 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) Dips Due To South Korea Crisis Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from a slight wobble after briefly slipping below $95,000 before rebounding. The dip was triggered by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declaring martial law on Tuesday, plunging the country into a brief crisis. However, it was lifted after a few hours after the opposition-led national assembly passed a resolution to lift it. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Korea Premium Index registered a sharp decline, indicating a significant selloff. However, levels were back to normal once martial law was lifted. Institutional investors saw this as an accumulation opportunity, as shown in Bitcoin spot ETF data. Data from CryptoQuant also shows that 19,500 BTC was withdrawn from Coinbase, indicating investors are capitalizing on the smallest dips in price. Trump Nominates Paul Atkins As SEC Chair President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair. According to Trump, Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and the CEO of Patomak Partners, was a proven leader for common sense regulations. Atkins has also been a vocal opponent of the SEC’s enforcement approach to regulatory compliance. “He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” The SEC is currently led by Gary Gensler, who intends to step down on the day of Trump’s inauguration. Trump had promised to fire Gensler on his first day in office and make the US the crypto capital of the world. He also pledged to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Crypto Liquidations Hit $588 Million The crypto market experienced a wave of liquidations totaling almost $600 million. XRP led the liquidation wave with over $69 million, followed by Bitcoin (BTC), which registered $60 million, and Ethereum (ETH) with almost $58 million. XRP fell significantly after surging to a seven-year high, causing several traders hoping for the price to surge to $3 to lose positions. Dogecoin (DOGE) also registered a decline, leading to further liquidations. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance saw the most liquidations, with $222 million wiped out, 63% of which were from long positions. OKX and Bybit also witnessed considerable liquidations, with $134 million and $124 million. Binance, WazriX Owe Significant Sums In Taxes To Indian Government The Indian government has detected substantial amounts of unpaid goods and service tax (GST) payments by Binance and WazirX. According to India’s Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, the government discovered around $97 million in unpaid GST dues by several prominent exchanges operating in the country. The government has already recovered $14 million in taxes, penalties, and interest as part of an ongoing crackdown. According to Chaudhary, 17 crypto firms, including WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber were found to have evaded GST dues. While most firms have paid the penalties due, some, including Binance, have yet to settle their dues with the tax authorities. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has done it! The world’s largest cryptocurrency shot past the hugely significant $100,000 mark, buoyed by the news that the next Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Paul Atkins, holds favorable views about the crypto industry. Trump announced Atkins as his pick for SEC Chair, with markets expecting a smoother and friendlier regulatory environment under the former SEC Commissioner. With BTC setting a new all-time high above $100,000, the cryptocurrency’s value has more than doubled this year, up almost 45% over the past few weeks since Trump’s election victory. Mike Novogratz, the founder and CEO of crypto firm Galaxy Digital, stated, “We're witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream. This momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenization and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.” The milestone comes after 16 years as BTC stands on the brink of mainstream acceptance despite several prominent detractors and a history of controversy. Hong Kong-based crypto analyst Justin D’Anethan stated, “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it's a testament to shifting tides in finance, technology, and geopolitics. The figure not long ago dismissed as fantasy stands as a reality.” BTC fell to a low of $90,708 last Tuesday as sellers threatened to overwhelm buyers. However, it recovered to register an increase of 4.32% to go above $95,000 and settle at $95,883. BTC recorded a marginal decline on Thursday before resuming its upward trajectory, registering an increase of almost 2% on Friday and settling at $97,374. However, it was back in the red on Saturday, dropping to $96,263 after a drop of 1.14% before recovering on Sunday and settling at $97,026 after an increase of 0.79%. Source: TradingView BTC registered a substantial decline on Monday, falling to a low of $94,404. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $95,812, registering a drop of 1.25%.

Sentiment changed on Wednesday as BTC recovered to register an increase of almost 3% and settle at $98,581. BTC has rallied during the current session as it broke past the $100,000 mark, with the price currently at $103,034, with buyers firmly in control. With BTC continuing to push higher, buyers will look to surpass $105,000 during the current session. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) overcame considerable volatility and selling pressure at the beginning of last week to recover from a low of $3,255. ETH rallied on Wednesday to register an increase of almost 10% to go above $3,500 and settle at $3,657. However, buyers lost momentum as sellers took over on Thursday, driving ETH down by 2.09% to $3,580. The price recovered on Friday as ETH registered a marginal increase before rising by over 3% on Saturday to go above $3,700 and settle at $3,705. ETH faced considerable selling pressure at this level and as a result, could only register a marginal increase on Sunday to end the weekend at $3,710. Source: TradingView Buyers lost momentum as the week began on a bearish note, with ETH dropping almost 2% to a low of $3,559 before recovering and settling at $3,645. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH fell to an intraday low of $3,504. However, buyers prevented a further decline as ETH recovered from this level to reclaim $3,600 and settle at $3,618. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as ETH rallied over 6% to go above the resistance at $3,700 and settle at $3,844. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to take control. If buyers retain control, ETH could surge towards $4,000. On the other hand, if sellers retake control, ETH could drop toward $3,500 or lower, signaling that markets have rejected the breakout. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is looking to recover after dropping below the 20-day SMA earlier in the week. SOL registered a substantial increase after declining to a low of $222 last week. It rebounded from this level to register an increase of almost 5% on Wednesday and settled at $242. However, with volatility dominating the market, SOL fell back in the red on Thursday, dropping nearly 2% to $237. The price recovered on Friday, registering an increase of 2.41% and settling at $243. Despite a strong showing on Friday, SOL was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 2.33% to $237. Sunday saw a marginal decline as buyers prevented a drop below the 20-day SMA, with the price remaining at $237. Source: TradingView However, selling pressure intensified significantly on Monday as SOL plummeted almost 5% to go below the 20-day SMA and settle at $225. Sellers drove SOL to an intraday low of $215 on Tuesday as selling pressure persisted. Despite considerable selling pressure, SOL recovered from this level, rising almost 4% and settling at $234. However, it could not go above the 20-day SMA. SOL fell back in the red on Wednesday after buyers failed to sustain a move past the 20-day SMA. SOL reached an intraday high of $241 but lost momentum and fell to a low of $224 before settling at $229. The current session sees SOL up by 1% as buyers look to move past the 20-day SMA. A break above this level could see SOL rise to $250. On the other hand, if sellers retake control and drive SOL below $220, it could drop as low as $200. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) registered a significant rally on Monday but has dropped since as sellers look to lower the price. LINK has registered substantial gains since the US elections, with its latest rally beginning last week as it recovered from a low of $16.19, registering a significant increase to settle at $18.68 on Wednesday.

Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) fell towards the end of the previous week after registering a staggering increase of almost 25% last Wednesday. The price fell on Thursday as buyers lost momentum, and UNI registered a drop of nearly 6% to $12.78. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell by 1.51% to $12.58.

Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) is struggling to build momentum and go above $700, with sellers weighing the price down. TAO embarked on a strong rally on November 22 as it rebounded from the 20-day SMA. By the beginning of the previous week, it had gone above the 20 and 50-day SMAs as buyers seized the initiative. TAO rallied to an intraday high of $721 last Wednesday but lost momentum, allowing sellers to drive the price down to $561.

The flagship cryptocurrency had dipped to $94,587 on Wednesday but staged a remarkable comeback. Several key factors contributed to this unprecedented surge: #1 Fed Chair Powell Compares Bitcoin To Gold In a significant acknowledgment from the traditional financial sector, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed Bitcoin during the New York Times DealBook Summit. When questioned about the perception of Bitcoin as a symbol of faith or lack thereof in the US dollar and the Federal Reserve, Powell offered a nuanced perspective. “I don’t think that’s how people think about it,” Powell remarked. “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset, right? It’s like gold. It’s just like gold, only it’s virtual. It’s digital. People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar; it’s really a competitor for gold.” This comparison to gold, a traditional store of value, was probably seen by many as another strong legitimization of Bitcoin in the financial ecosystem. If your central bank owns gold, but rejects digital gold… they’re done. How did betting against digitalization work for kodak, blockbuster, sears, yellow pages, news papers, taxis, postal service, libraries, travel agents, etc? It’s the most obvious trade in history https://t.co/tdJp8XCTjO — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) December 4, 2024 #2 Russia’s Putin Signals Openness To Bitcoin Adding to the momentum, Russian President Vladimir Putin made comments during the Russia Calling forum that many interpret as an endorsement of Bitcoin. “Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody,” Putin stated. “And who can prohibit the use of other electronic means of payment? Nobody. Because these are new technologies. And no matter what happens to the dollar, these tools will develop one way or another because everyone will strive to reduce costs and increase reliability.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? The backdrop to Putin’s comments includes speculation about a forthcoming “Bitcoin Space Race” between global superpowers. President-elect Donald Trump, during his election campaign and at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, pledged to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. He even suggested that part of the US debt could be “paid off” with Bitcoin. David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and advisor to Trump’s team, emphasized the urgency of this initiative on X: “The Bitcoin Space Race is here. It couldn’t be more clear what’s happening. It must be a national priority to stand up the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the first 100 days of the Trump admin. We need an aggressive plan to grow USA’s proportional ownership of the Bitcoin supply.” It couldn’t be more clear what’s happening. It must be a national priority to stand up the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the first 100 days of the Trump admin. We need an aggressive plan to grow USA’s proportional ownership of the Bitcoin supply. https://t.co/a85wLNoXSS — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) December 4, 2024 #3 Strong Spot Demand And Institutional Interest The surge was underpinned by robust spot market activity and significant institutional participation. During the ascent, open interest in Bitcoin futures skyrocketed by more than $4 billion, according to data by Coinalyze. Funding rates also reached unprecedented levels, surpassing peaks seen two weeks ago when Bitcoin first hit $99,500. Importantly, the rally was driven by spot markets and not only derivative speculation, indicating a healthy and sustained demand. The infamous “Great Sell Wall” at $100,000, which had previously resisted upward movement, was decisively breached on the second attempt. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could ‘Easily Double’ In A Short Time, Predicts Hedge Fund CEO Market analysts are speculating that major players like Michael Saylor may have been behind the substantial buying pressure. Notably, MARA Holdings, Inc., the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company by market capitalization, recently raised $850 million through an offering of zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2031. While unconfirmed, there is a strong possibility that MARA utilized these funds to accumulate Bitcoin during the price run-up. Supporting this notion, CryptoQuant reported: “Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market. The Coinbase Premium Index highlights sustained buying pressure from US investors.” #4 Retail Market In Disbelief Despite the bullish momentum, retail traders appear to be in a state of disbelief. On-chain analytics firm Santiment observed that while whale accumulation continues to strengthen, retail sentiment remains cautious. Santiment noted: “With whale accumulation continuing to look strong, the only factor holding back $100K BTC history being made is retail traders’ excitement.” The firm highlighted that the start of December saw increasing skepticism and expectations of a significant price retracement following November’s historic gains. However, the current social media landscape reflects “hesitance and uncertainty from traders,” with a ratio of negative to positive commentary. “With numerous indications over the years that crypto markets move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, we should feel encouraged by our fellow traders’ FUD and high profit-taking,” Santiment added. “There may be a bit more of a battle between bulls and bears at this level, but we could see the long-awaited milestone come to fruition very shortly as long as key stakeholders continue their collection of more and more BTC.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,681.

BIT Mining said it had mined 84,485.42 LTC (worth $10 million at current prices) and 227,908,250 DOGE (worth a whopping $100 million) since it started its self-mining business. It reported having over 5,500 active mining machines, representing 1.32% of the global network hash rate in LTC, DOGE and the smaller Belcoin (BEL). Such gains on its DOGE operations came as the token’s prices have more than tripled since late September on repeated endorsements by technocrat Elon Musk and the proposal of a Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), a non-governmental department under the upcoming Trump administration. ""The recent rally in Litecoin and Dogecoin, fueled in part by Elon Musk's influence and the changing regulatory landscape in the US after the Trump win, has had a major impact on mining profitability,"" Dr. Youwei Yang, VP of Mining at BIT Mining, said in a statement. ""Many analysts predict this upward trend will continue through 2025, reflecting confidence in DOGE's potential and the broader growth of the cryptocurrency industry."" Mining is the process by which transactions for various cryptocurrencies are verified and added to the blockchain using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, which validate these transactions, in return for token rewards.

Institutional demand has played a key role in driving the market’s momentum and subsequently helping the world’s largest cryptocurrency to hit the milestone. According to CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium Index spiked, depicting sustained buying pressure from US-based investors. The premium indicates that Bitcoin is being traded at higher prices on Coinbase compared to other global exchanges, reflecting heightened interest among institutional and high-net-worth clients in the United States. What’s in Store For 2025 Zooming out, Bitcoin has been influenced by positive market trends, enhanced regulatory transparency in the US, and institutional participation through Bitcoin ETFs. Currently, the crypto market is riding a wave of optimism as governments and institutions globally adopt blockchain technology, creating a foundation for wider acceptance and investment in digital assets. This shift highlights the ecosystem’s maturity and its potential for long-term expansion. Analysts predict Bitcoin will continue to gain traction, pushing its price higher in 2025. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Binance’s Head of Regional Markets Vishal Sacheendran said, “In the next year, the outlook for crypto appears increasingly promising. As regulatory frameworks become more comprehensive, the industry is likely to see enhanced security measures, greater transparency, and improved accessibility for retail and institutional investors. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and, more recently, Bitcoin ETF options, has played a key role in the recent market rally and simplified access for institutional investors, allowing them to gain exposure and manage risks more effectively.” A Springboard, Not a Finish Line Presto Research views Bitcoin’s $100,000 milestone as a springboard rather than a finish line, highlighting its relative infancy compared to other major macro assets. With Bitcoin’s market cap still modest, it remains inaccessible for top-tier institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds, public pensions, and central banks, which require sufficient market depth to execute sizable trades. Presto expects $1 million to be the next pivotal milestone, where Bitcoin’s market cap would rival gold’s $18 trillion valuation, making it a viable option for these asset allocators. However, surpassing $100,000 brings challenges, particularly selling pressure from long-term holders (addresses holding BTC for 155+ days). Historical trends show significant hodler selling at new all-time highs, with ~1 million BTC already offloaded in this cycle for $62 billion at an average price of $67K. Encouragingly, this cycle lacks concentrated “relief selling” seen at prior peaks. Presto noted that demand growth, more than selling pressure, determines market tops, and strong demand signals – boosted by ETF approvals, crypto-friendly policies, and global liquidity expansion – could absorb selling pressure and sustain Bitcoin’s rally.

Table of Contents Ethereum records massive capital inflows during ongoing rally BNB loses investor confidence after several sandwich attacks Rollblock positions itself as top low cap crypto in Q4 altseason Ethereum is regaining momentum during this bull season as its institutional products reached a yearly high in net inflows. Meanwhile, BNB has lost its position in the Top 5 cryptos list after its smart chain network was manipulated by several Sandwich attacks. Amidst this sentiment, savvy traders are diversifying their wallets by investing in Rollblock’s new GambleFi project that is already poised for 880% gains. Ethereum records massive capital inflows during ongoing rally Ethereum is reclaiming its market dominance after losing investor confidence over the last few months. Ethereum has recorded a massive capital inflow worth $634 million over the last seven days which is typically a strong indicator of bullish dominance. In addition, Ethereum’s institutional products have also reached a new yearly high by exceeding $2.2 billion in net inflows. Despite these positive indicators, Ethereum’s price has crashed by 2.08% over the last 24 hours to its current selling price of $3,553.19. Even though Ethereum’s volume has also decreased by 1.28%, analysts believe Ethereum will continue its upward trend for the next few weeks after overcoming this brief correction. Since Ethereum’s RSI and MACD indicator are both suggesting more room for growth, Ethereum’s price could surge toward the $4,178 and $4,652 levels within the next few weeks. BNB loses investor confidence after several sandwich attacks BNB was gaining investor confidence when its smart chain network became infiltrated by sandwich attacks. More than 35% of the blocks on BNB Smart Chain were manipulated by Sandwich attacks in November because of BNB’s transparency and decentralization. Since these attacks artificially manipulate the price of an asset on DEXs, investors are losing confidence in BNB’s security protocols. BNB is currently trading for $732.09 after an intraday decline worth 0.84%. Since BNB’s Momentum Indicator and MACD level are both flashing sell signals now, analysts believe BNB could experience steeper losses if it doesn’t address these Sandwich attacks soon. If BNB investors begin booking profits, BNB’s price could crash to the $569.1 support.

Rollblock’s viral GambleFi project is bringing fun and thrill back to the obsolete world of crypto trading by combining online gaming with massive crypto earnings. Since Rollblock is already seeing a huge influx of savvy traders and high rollers in stage 8 of its presale, analysts are expecting a total of 880% gains for RBLK ahead of its official launch on the open market. Rollblock’s strategy to combine decentralized and centralized gaming into one crypto native iGambling platform is the main reason why this altcoin is already dominating the DeFi market. Instead of offering boring games like other play-to-earn tokens, Rollblock is bringing a variety of casino classics like roulette, poker, blackjack and slots to its ecosystem. In addition, Rollblock also has a variety of new web3-based titles such as KENO and Max Car Racing. The best part about Rollblock’s gaming library is that all 7,000+ games are fully audited and regulated by SolidProof and Gaming Curacao which ensures that the platform is 100% secure. To make things even better, Rollblock encrypts all financial data and bets on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain to give traders the most provably fair odds with no third-party manipulations. As traders play and win these games, they can accumulate more RBLK tokens that can be staked for a weekly passive income. Rollblock shares up to 30% of its weekly revenue with current holders as staking rewards through an open market buyback mechanism. As this massive buyback increases Rollblock’s demand, the supply cap of 1 billion tokens puts deflationary pressure on the token’s price. Although Rollblock is currently trading for $0.037 per token, analysts are already projecting another price jump within the next few days because of Rollblock’s high demand.

What is he likely to do?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-forced-choose-saving-bitcoin-usd/,"Donald Trump’s next financial war might not be with BRICS nations or even the Federal Reserve. It’s likely going to be with himself. The former president, back in power and already stirring up global drama, may soon face an impossible decision: save the U.S. dollar or bet big on Bitcoin. For a man who thrives on chaos, the stakes couldn’t be higher. On one side, Trump is aggressively defending the dollar’s dominance, threatening a 100% tariff on BRICS countries if they move forward with plans to ditch the greenback. On the other, his rumored Bitcoin reserve plan could make the U.S. the first major government to officially back crypto. These two positions cannot coexist. The outcome will define global trade, crypto markets, and America’s financial future. Trump’s BRICS problem The BRICS nations got tired of playing by America’s financial rules and have been meeting to figure out how to break free from the dollar. At a recent summit hosted by Trump’s buddy Russian president Vladimir Putin , they openly discussed creating their own currency or strengthening trade using local currencies. The goal was simply to reduce reliance on the dollar and, by extension, U.S. economic power. Trump isn’t taking it lightly. He fired off a warning on Truth Social, demanding that BRICS nations back down. “Any country trying to undermine the dollar will wave goodbye to access to the U.S. market,” he wrote. His response? Tariffs. Not just any tariffs, but a 100% tariff on all BRICS exports. Yeesh! Imagine the fallout. A tariff this extreme would send U.S. consumer prices through the roof. From smartphones to oil to basic food items, costs would skyrocket. American companies relying on imports from BRICS nations would face devastating disruptions. But Trump sees this as a necessary decision to protect the dollar. Still, the plan could backfire. His heavy-handed tactics will provoke the BRICS into speeding up their anti-dollar efforts. If they succeed, the global financial system could move away from America’s control faster than anyone expects. Even allies like Japan and the European Union might start exploring alternatives. The Bitcoin factor Trump’s plans involve the U.S. buying 200,000 bitcoins a year for five years, eventually creating a national reserve of one million bitcoins. But to be very honest, Bitcoin isn’t exactly a safe bet. Sure, it’s trading at $100,000 now, but its history is one of wild volatility. Prices can swing dramatically overnight. Using Bitcoin as a national reserve asset is like building a house on quicksand. The risks are massive, especially for the world’s most powerful economy. Then there’s the funding. Trump’s plan involves selling off U.S. gold reserves to buy Bitcoin. This is controversial for obvious reasons. Gold has been the go-to asset for stability during economic crises for centuries. Trading it for Bitcoin, which has only been around for 15 years, is a gamble that could backfire spectacularly. If Trump does make America go all-in on Bitcoin, he will have to inadvertently hurt the dollar, like the legendary Arthur Hayes predicted . A government-backed Bitcoin reserve would send a strong signal to global markets that crypto is the future. And while that would be quite amazing for us, it’d actually weaken confidence in the dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency. Investors might start dumping U.S. assets for crypto, triggering a financial revolution that even Trump might not be able to control. Is the dollar set for collapse? Financial experts are also sounding the alarm on Trump’s plans. UBS Wealth Management has advised investors to bet against the dollar’s continued strength. “We caution against chasing USD strength; instead, we suggest selling dollar upside potential for yield pickup,” they wrote in a recent note. UBS recommends shorting the euro below $1.05, the British pound below $1.25, and the Australian dollar below $0.63. Meanwhile, currencies like the Swiss franc are gaining attention as safer bets. UBS favors buying the franc above 0.90 against the dollar. Defensive currencies like the franc could become the go-to for investors looking to hedge against dollar weakness. Not all currencies will benefit equally. UBS warns that currencies heavily tied to U.S. exports, such as the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, could suffer if Trump’s tariffs disrupt trade. The same goes for China. Now to answer the big question:- Trump is likely to stick with the dollar. Despite his commendable Bitcoin ambitions, the risks of undermining U.S. financial power are too big, even for him. He’ll fight BRICS with tariffs, protect the dollar’s dominance, and maybe toss Bitcoin a bone to keep the crypto crowd happy. But when push comes to shove, the dollar isn’t just America’s currency, it’s its strong weapon. The president knows that, and he’ll play it safe when the stakes are this high.",OP-ED|BRICS|BTC|Fed|UBS|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-05 09:35:39

GameFi , a sector that combines gaming with decentralized finance, has faced a sharp decline after its initial surge during the 2022 crypto bull run, with a new report showing that 93% of projects have failed. A survey by ChainPlay, in collaboration with Storible, analyzed over 3,200 GameFi projects and found that many of their tokens have dropped an average of 95% from their all-time highs. The report also shows that GameFi projects have an alarmingly short lifespan, with an average of just four months before most fade. State of GameFi projects in 2024 | Source: ChainPlay “Compared to other crypto projects, such as memecoins with an average lifespan of one year and typical crypto projects with an average lifespan of three years, GameFi projects have an even shorter lifespan, highlighting their heightened instability and inability to sustain momentum.” ChainPlay You might also like: Nansen: GameFi market set for $301.5b surge amid ecosystem expansion Oddly enough, venture capital involvement in GameFi has also been hit or miss. While 42% of VCs have seen profits, with returns ranging from 0.05% to 1,950%, the majority (58%) have experienced losses, some as high as 99%, the data shows. Despite the overall downturn, top-performing VCs, including notorious firms such as Alameda Research , have continued to see returns, though many others have faced steep declines, ChainPlay says. Although GameFi has cooled from its 2022 highs, the sector continues to attract investment, albeit with more caution. In 2024, VC funding for GameFi totaled $859 million, a 13% decrease from 2023 and a sharp 84.6% drop from its peak in 2022.

Terra Luna joined the upside journey, soaring 21.13% on its daily chart as it climbed from $0.6520 to $0.7898. Notably, the solid jump saw the altcoin breaking free from a descending channel, signaling a significant buyer comeback. LUNA trades at $0.7200, and bulls target the vital resistance at $0.895. Breaching this obstacle could catalyze smooth upswings to $1.50. That would translate to a 108.33% surge from the current values. Furthermore, Terra’s price actions appeared to form a golden cross, confirming possible trend reversals. LUNA price ready for a 100% jump The latest breakout from a descending channel formation indicated a significant change in market sentiments. LUNA bulls target the crucial resistance barrier at $0.895. The level remains vital in determining whether Terra will sustain the latest breakout. Stability above $0.895 might catalyze a massive upswing to $1.50. That would mean a 108.33% surge from LUNA’s current price. LUNA price prediction: what technicals say Indicators support the asset’s bullish outlook. The emerging golden cross cements the chances of bullish reversals. This technical signal often confirms the beginning of a solid uptrend. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests a robust uptrend, with the MACD line well beyond the signal line. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index at 78 suggests overbought market conditions. That signals potential retracements for LUNA before uptrend resumption. Meanwhile, the social dominance hit 0.165 from 0.100 within a day. The hiked social attention can attract significant market interest to support stable rallies. Nonetheless, magnified social dominance often triggers massive volatility, with sentiments prone to rapid shifts in either direction. Further, Terra’s long-to-short ratio is 50.61% to 49.39% ( Coinglass data ), highlighting a near balance between buyers and sellers. The equilibrium reflects uncertainty in LUNA’s future performance. Nonetheless, a successful move past the $0.895 resistance would see buyers dominating. Also, the prevailing market sentiment suggests that price dips could be short-lived. LUNA price action The altcoin painted its daily chart green, up 10% from the opening price to hover at $0.7200 at press time. Source – Coinmarketcap Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by 55% to $368.35 million, magnifying trader optimism. Social metrics, technical indicators, and LUNA’s latest price moves suggest trend reversals. Nevertheless, the $0.895 resistance remains crucial for the token’s upcoming trajectory. Breaching this hurdle and a golden cross completion would catalyze impressive upswings to $1.50. However, caution remains paramount, as RSI’s overbought conditions and the evenness between sellers and buyers highlight possible volatility. Meanwhile, analysts remain confident about an altcoin season after Bitcoin’s surge past $100,000.

BTC Finally Goes Beyond $100K It has been a wild journey ever since Donald Trump won the US elections precisely a month ago. The primary cryptocurrency stood at around $68,000 at the time but started to surge in value immediately. It flew past its March all-time high and kept climbing in the following weeks to peak at $99,800 on November 22. After coming just inches away from going into six-digit territory, the bears finally came out to play and propelled a massive leg down that pushed BTC to under $91,000 a few days later. However, the bull run was unfazed and resumed in the following weeks. Just yesterday, bitcoin jumped from $95,000 to $99,000 and, earlier this morning finally blasted through the six-digit milestone. Moreover, it kept climbing and tapped a fresh all-time high of $103,500. Despite trading slightly below $103,000 now, BTC’s market cap has shot up to $2.03 trillion on CG.

DOGE, SHIB, BCH, DOT, SUI, and CRO are the other notable price gainers from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, BNB, TRX, AVAX, XLM, HBAR, and TON have dropped today, and so has XRP, which is somewhat surprising given Trump’s pick for the next SEC chair.

While market makers' hedging is likely to keep BTC supported at around $100,000, the heightened activity raises the risk of pullbacks for other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, tapped a record high above $103,000 early Thursday, following President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint pro-crypto Paul Atkins as chairman for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The breakout sent traders chasing the price rally, pushing funding rates for perpetual futures skywards, a sign of growing demand for and overcrowding in long positions.

Support may come from the options market, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. When options prices rise faster than that of the underlying asset — that is, when the so-called gamma imbalance is positive — market makers tend to sell their holdings to keep their net exposure neutral. They buy when it's negative, acting as a contrarian force and limiting price swings. ""BTC can be stable at around $100,000 in the short-term, helped by the hedging activity of market makers,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""This support from the options market may offset the impact of deleveraging to a certain extent."" The annualized funding rate for bitcoin surged to nearly 100%, surpassing rates for purely speculative tokens like DOGE, data from VeloData show. Other coins, such as XRP, CRO and XMR, also boast funding rates in excess of 100%. ""That EOD [volume weighted average price] suggests Saylor blew another few billion, and the [BTC] funding rates make me think this final move was purely lever-driven,"" said Felix Hartmann, founder and managing partner of Hartmann Capital, referring to Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin. ""Wouldn’t be shocked at a good old 20-30% bull market correction here. 80s are fair game."" Hartmann stressed the need for additional demand over and above MSTR's purchases to keep the bull run going, a view echoed by several observers on social media. They suggested that either the market continues to rally, justifying the costs associated with holding bullish bets, or turns lower in a sharp correction. Even with market makers' activity, bitcoin price volatility could return toward the end of the year. ""The positive gamma at $105,000 in options expiring on Dec. 27 could bring sufficient gravity, but after the expiry, it will disappear, boosting price uncertainty,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. Options are derivative contracts, offering the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call or a bullish bet gives the right to buy, while a put confers the right to sell.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRO,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-05 09:46:26

Trump’s Announcement The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to experience a leadership overhaul with the appointment of Paul Atkins as its new chair. Following the resignation of Gary Gensler, President-elect Donald Trump announced Atkins' nomination, signaling a likely change in regulatory priorities, particularly concerning the crypto industry. President-elect Trump shared the news via Truth Social, describing Atkins as a proponent of ""common sense regulations"" and a supporter of innovative capital markets. Trump emphasized Atkins' recognition of digital assets as central to America's economic advancement. This appointment reflects the administration's intent to foster a more crypto-friendly environment. Transition From Gensler’s Tenure Gary Gensler, who will step down in January, led the SEC with an aggressive regulatory agenda. His tenure was marked by over 40 rules aimed at increasing transparency and mitigating financial risks. However, his approach drew criticism, especially from the crypto sector, which accused the SEC of pursuing enforcement actions without providing clear regulatory guidance. Gensler's focus on enforcement led to lawsuits against numerous crypto firms for allegedly operating outside existing securities laws. While he classified Bitcoin as a commodity, Gensler avoided clear stances on other cryptocurrencies, leading to uncertainty within the industry. Atkins’ Regulatory Philosophy Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, is expected to pivot the agency's regulatory stance. Known for his conservative approach to governance and support for market innovation, Atkins will likely adopt policies aimed at capital formation and provide clearer regulatory guidelines for the crypto space. Atkins has been a vocal advocate for the digital asset industry, co-chairing the Token Alliance at the Digital Chamber of Commerce since 2017. Through his consultancy, Potomak Global Partners, he has advised digital finance firms on navigating regulatory complexities. His leadership style is characterized by collaboration and maintaining strong professional relationships, in contrast to Gensler's contentious approach. Industry and Political Response The appointment has been well-received by many within the financial and crypto sectors. Eric Pan, CEO of the Investment Company Institute, called Atkins a ""supremely well-qualified nominee,"" citing his extensive experience and commitment to fair markets. Trump’s selection of Atkins aligns with his broader vision for making the U.S. a global leader in crypto innovation, including promises of clearer regulatory frameworks and potential initiatives like a national Bitcoin reserve.

Analysts Weigh In",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-crosses-3800-is-the-god-candle-nearing-analysts-weigh-in/,"Ethereum (ETH) appears to be finally waking up from its slumber as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has jumped 8% in the past 24 hours, surpassing the key $3,800 price level. Is An ETH God Candle On The Horizon? Ethereum’s rise appears to align with declining Bitcoin (BTC) dominance. This important metric is tracked to gauge the proportion of the total crypto market cap commanded by the top cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory According to the chart below, BTC dominance has been falling dramatically over the past two weeks – sliding from 61.1% on November 20 to 54.9% at the time of writing. As previously reported, trading firm QCP Capital highlighted BTC dominance sliding below 58% as a key condition that could signal the onset of the altcoin season. With ETH now surpassing the $3,800 level, analysts are weighing in on how far the digital asset can rally. Crypto analyst @venturefounder shared his target for ETH on X, pointing to a prolonged cup-and-handle pattern forming for ETH since November 2021. He noted that if ETH decisively breaks $3,800, it could climb as high as $7,346. Similarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared his insights on ETH’s recent price action. Martinez emphasized that the $3,300 support level could be a ‘potential buying opportunity’ should the digital asset pullback from its recent surge. Martinez added that his mid-term target for ETH remains $6,000, while the long-term target is $10,000. The analyst also highlighted the Ethereum network’s steady growth over the past month, with more than 134,000 new Ethereum addresses added daily. Another crypto enthusiast, @MisterSpread noted that if ETH breaks the $4,000 area, there is a “high chance we see a God candle to $5,000.” Indeed, ETH breaking out of a three-year long downtrend and attempting to establish a new all-time high (ATH) has piqued the attention of the entire crypto industry. Ethereum Fundamentals Continue Getting Stronger Although BTC has led much of the current crypto rally, experts believe Ethereum might be the time to shine due to the multiple positive developments in the top smart contract platform. For instance, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) are finally attracting large daily inflows, rivaling BTC ETFs consistently. Further, several proposed network upgrades – including the Ethereum Improvement Proposal-7781 and the possibility of reduction in the amount of ETH required to participate in network staking could serve as catalysts for ETH to hit a new ATH. That said, concerns remain about ETH’s ‘ultrasound money’ narrative due to the inflation surge witnessed in the cryptocurrency’s issuance rate. ETH trades at $3,820 at press time, up 8 % in the past 24 hours.

Despite this bullish outlook, top SOL addresses gobble Rexas Finance (RXS) and XRP. These cheaper coins provide tantalizing opportunities for huge upside, including a quick 27x ROI. Solana (SOL): $302 Reachable as Bullish Momentum Grows As investor confidence boosts Solana (SOL), the cryptocurrency is approaching $302. SOL is trading at about $236.49 as of this writing, well below key resistance levels. After its reached an all-time high of $263.83 on November 23, 2024, Solana is now aiming fofr $300. According to some analysts, Solana may hit $302 by year’s end. The growing decentralized exchange (DEX) activity and record transfer volumes make Solana popular. Solana-based coins have surged dramatically in the past month; the network’s market capitalization reached $121 billion. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) increases the DeFi market since it surpasses the $6.21 billion BNB Chain. Analysts predict Solana’s next breakout to occur between $271 and $309. However, some have cautioned that correction may precede price hikes as Solana enters the overbought zone. SOL is one of the most talked-about crypto assets today due to increased demand for Solana’s low-fee, high-throughput network. SOL Addresses Gobble Up 2 Cheaper Coins 1. Solana Investors Accumulate Rexas Finance (RXS) As they Eye 27x ROI A key asset tokenization disruptor, Rexas Finance (RXS), is changing how real-world assets (RWAs), including real estate, artwork, and commodities, are bought, sold, and exchanged. According to Rexas Finance whitepaper , the platform tokenizes high-value assets to allow ordinary investors to access previously inaccessible markets, unlike other cryptocurrency ventures focusing on speculative use cases. Imagine investing in fractions of premium real estate, rare art, or high-demand commodities using blockchain and tokenization. Using blockchain, Rexas Finance makes illiquid markets more accessible to investors by improving liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. The presale result alone shows the project’s potential, with 196 million RXS tokens sold, and $19.68 million raised. The RWA crypto project has quickly completed seven presale rounds and is currently in Stage 8. With RXS costing $0,10, early investors anticipate significant gains as the token’s price rises to $0.20 after listing on major exchanges. It’s even more interesting that Rexas Finance selected public presale over VC funding, ensuring the project’s long-term survival by keeping it decentralized and accessible. Recent listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko make RXS easy to track and trade, which may explain Rexas Finance’s popularity. Its Certik assessment ensures that the platform meets the highest security standards and reassures investors that their money is safe. If that wasn’t enough, Rexas Finance is giving away $1, with the top 20 winners receiving up to $50,000 in RXS tokens. This program should increase community interaction and strength. The rally potential is the actual story. Rexas Finance is in the last phases of its presale, preparing for its exchange listing on at least three tier-1 crypto exchanges worldwide. Once the coin goes public, early investors may enjoy a 27x ROI, and analysts expect RXS to be the next big token in 2024. Now is the time to invest in Rexas Finance before its full potential. 2. XRP: Another Crypto SOLANA (SOL) Top Addresses are Accumulating While many are interested in Solana (SOL)’s value increase, top SOL addresses are also buying XRP and making significant gains. XRP is now trading at about $2.41, with recent indicators suggesting a rise above $5 in the next months. XRP is now the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is making news owing to its momentum. Due to strong institutional interest, a likely Ripple-SEC case resolution, and a rising DeFi presence on its ledger, XRP may mount a notable price rally. Analysts anticipate a significant price increase following the settlement of the SEC lawsuit. During altcoin season, whales may acquire XRP, a low-cost alternative to Solana, potentially yielding tremendous gains. XRP is poised for a 2025 breakout, so investors seeking a 27x ROI should watch its price over the next several months. Solana (SOL), Rexas Finance (RXS), and XRP—The Best Options for Explosive Gains The crypto community is interested in Solana’s run to $302, but investors seeking 27x ROI may also choose Rexas Finance and XRP. Both ventures offer value, but Rexas Finance’s presale could rise significantly before its public launch. Help Rexas Finance become mainstream now to secure your seat in the next major increase.

Despite a brief consolidation phase, SOL recently reached new highs, signaling a surge in market confidence. With Bitcoin maintaining a price above $100k, analysts predict that Solana’s bullish trend will accelerate. The growing positive sentiment surrounding Solana indicates that further price gains could be on the horizon, making SOL increasingly attractive to investors. Solana Price Poised for Acceleration: Raoul Paul Raoul Paul, a popular investor shared an X post stating that the Solana price is poised to accelerate soon. According to the analyst, SOL has shown increasingly bullish indicators that hints at a significant upward movement. Solana’s chart showcases a descending triangle, often signaling consolidation before a breakout. The all-time high (ATH) at $260 remains a key resistance level. Breaching it could trigger the “acceleration” analysts predict, unleashing stronger bullish momentum. Overcoming this hurdle would mark a pivotal shift, signaling long-term bullish continuation. Source- Tweet Will SOL Price Hit $500 Following the Market Surge? Solana price has emerged as one of the top contenders for major price gains as the cryptocurrency market experiences a surge of bullish momentum. Bitcoin surpassed the $100k mark for the first time, breaking through a significant resistance level that had held strong for weeks. This milestone has sparked a ripple effect across the market, with altcoins, including Solana, seeing a noticeable uptick in price. As Solana continues to perform strongly, the SOL could be on track to hit the $500 mark, especially if the broader market trend remains favorable. At the time of writing, the SOL price is $235, reflecting a 45% monthly increase. The cryptocurrency recently experienced notable growth, with its 24-hour price range fluctuating between $223 and $238. Solana’s performance remains strong, although it is currently 11% below its all-time high of $263.83, recorded on November 23, 2024. Over the past month, SOL has maintained an upward trend, showcasing resilience amid market fluctuations. If the bullish trend mounts more pressure, the Solana price prediction could surge to $300, then $500 following the market surge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55, indicating a neutral position. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a minor bearish crossover. Solana Price Chart: TradingView Solana’s strong bullish momentum, fueled by Bitcoin’s surge and increasing adoption, positions SOL for potential significant gains. With continued market optimism, SOL may break past its current resistance levels, eyeing $300 to $500 in the near future.

Additionally, the surge was accompanied by a sharp increase in social sentiment and the liquidation of $132 million in short positions. Meanwhile, Mt. Gox transferred 24,000 BTC shortly after the milestone, which raised questions about its possible market impact. North American miner Hut 8 is getting ready to take advantage of Bitcoin’s access as it announced plans to expand its Bitcoin reserve through a $500 million stock repurchase program. Bitcoin Breaks $100K While Altcoin Gains Fade Away Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed its position as the dominant force in the crypto market after hitting a massive milestone by surpassing $100,000 for the first time ever on Dec. 5. Bitcoin's dominance , which is a measure of its share in the total crypto market value, rebounded sharply to 57% after falling to a recent low of 54.7% on Dec. 4. The surge to a new high of $104,000 was a dramatic reversal for Bitcoin, which has been stuck in consolidation around the $95,000 level while altcoins stole the spotlight. BTC’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Leading altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), and XRP recently reached all-time highs. This led to a dip in Bitcoin's dominance, but the trend reversed after Bitcoin surged past the six-figure threshold. Analysts like Income Sharks humorously suggested that Bitcoin’s rise was a reminder of its ”king” status in the middle of the altcoin frenzy. The market’s excitement was mirrored by the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index , which climbed to a high of 94 on Nov. 22, when Bitcoin was nearing $99,000, before settling at an “extreme greed” level of 84 after the latest rally. Social sentiment also reflected the euphoria in the market, and Google Trends reported a sharp increase in Bitcoin-related searches on Dec. 5. Bitcoin’s quick ascent also led to large market liquidations, with over $132 million in short positions wiped out in just four hours, according to CoinGlass . Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was just as excited about BTC’s achievement, and shared his thoughts about Bitcoin’s exceptional performance. Armstrong pointed out that $100 invested in Bitcoin at the time of Coinbase's founding would now be worth close to $1.5 million. The crypto industry is already calling Dec. 5 “$100K Day,” and many people are celebrating the cryptocurrency’s historic achievement. Mt. Gox Transfers 24K Bitcoin After $100K Break The long-defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved more than 24,000 Bitcoin, which is valued at approximately $2.5 billion, to an unknown address very shortly after Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 milestone. Data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that the exchange transferred 24,051 Bitcoin to an address with no prior activity at 2:45 am UTC. This was its first big transaction since Nov. 12. The timing of the move coincided with Bitcoin’s price surge, and the transaction was executed just 12 minutes after it crossed $100,000 and less than 30 minutes before it peaked at $104,000 on Coinbase. The reason for the transfer is still unclear, though similar movements in the past have been linked to preparations for creditor payouts. Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014, and has been working to resolve claims from creditors who lost access to their Bitcoin more than a decade ago. While these large-scale transfers raise some concerns about potential sell-offs that could impact Bitcoin’s price, some analysts believe the market has already accounted for the sell-side pressure as these creditor repayments have been anticipated for years. Many creditors also revealed that they are reluctant to sell their Bitcoin despite finally regaining access. A July poll on Reddit suggested that most recipients were holding onto their funds, even after the exchange started processing initial payouts earlier this year. The Mt. Gox trustee also recently extended the repayment deadline to Oct. 31, 2025. Mt.Gox Bitcoin holdings (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) After the latest transfer, Mt. Gox still holds a very large reserve of 39,878 Bitcoin, valued at around $4.1 billion. The latest move reignited discussions about its impact on the market, and some see it as a bearish signal. Hut 8 Plans Bitcoin Reserve Many companies are running to get their piece of the Bitcoin pie after its recent success. Hut 8, a North American Bitcoin mining company, launched a $500 million stock repurchase program to fund growth initiatives, including buying Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. The at-the-market (ATM) offering program will allow the company to sell up to $500 million in common stock. The proceeds will be directed toward developing power and digital infrastructure, expanding its Bitcoin reserve, and addressing corporate needs like capital expenditures and debt repayment. CEO Asher Genoot shared details about just how important the ATM and stock repurchase programs are in navigating volatile markets. They also play a major role in strengthening the company’s treasury management strategy. Under the new capital management plan, Hut 8 may repurchase up to 4.68 million shares of common stock, representing 5% of the total outstanding shares, over the next year. Hut 8’s stock (HUT) rebounded strongly after the announcement was made on Dec. 4, and surged 326% to $27.03 since its January dip to $6.33 that was caused by a short-seller report that unsettled investors. The firm recently filed a motion to dismiss a shareholder class-action lawsuit, and called it opportunistic Hut 8 became the latest of many companies adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Other firms, including AI education tech company Genius Group, biopharmaceutical firm Hoth Therapeutics, video platform Rumble, Canadian wellness company Jiva Technologies, and Semler Scientific all announced similar strategies recently. Paul Atkins Nominated as SEC Chair by Trump Bitcoin’s price could be boosted even more after President-elect Donald Trump officially nominated Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, to succeed Gary Gensler as the head of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an announcement on Dec. 4, Trump praised Atkins’ experience as a former SEC commissioner and his work as CEO of Patomak Global Partners. Trump also mentioned Atkins’ role as Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, where he focused on the digital assets industry. Atkins is known for his commitment to transparency and investor protection during his tenure at the SEC from 2002 to 2008, and was a key part of Trump’s campaign promise to appoint a crypto-friendly SEC leader. Atkins’ nomination happened after the resignation of Gary Gensler, which was announced on Nov. 21 after widespread criticism from the crypto industry. Gensler’s tenure was riddled with aggressive regulatory actions, and the SEC even filed 104 lawsuits against crypto firms between 2021 and 2023. These legal battles reportedly cost the industry $426 million in legal fees. The Blockchain Association criticized the SEC under Gensler for not providing clear regulations, and called for an end to what they described as “law-fare” against the crypto sector. Gensler’s departure already sparked optimism in the crypto market, and many analysts predicted an extended altcoin rally heading into 2025. The resignation also led to a surge in filings for Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and firms like Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares quickly submitted applications after the announcement. Pantera’s chief legal officer, Katrina Paglia, also suggested that many of the SEC’s lawsuits against blockchain projects and crypto firms could be quietly dropped under new leadership. Overall, the crypto industry sees Atkins’ nomination as a pivotal step toward clearer and more favorable regulation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-05 10:03:57

Cathie Wood Praises Incoming SEC Chair, Highlights Bitcoin's Growth Potential Speaking about the leadership transition, Wood said Atkins is expected to reverse regulatory restrictions placed on digital assets by outgoing Chairman Gary Gensler and strengthen protections of private property rights in the digital space. Wood’s comments echo a growing sentiment in the financial sector about Bitcoin’s transformative potential, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also commenting on the subject, describing it as a “virtual digital version of gold.” Powell noted that the gold market is worth around $15 trillion, while Bitcoin's market value is only $2 trillion, drawing attention to the huge difference in value between the two. “Bitcoin is still in its early stages,” Powell said. “It represents much more than gold when you consider its utility and potential in the digital economy.” Wood echoed this sentiment, emphasizing Bitcoin’s expanding role as a store of value and its capacity to disrupt traditional financial systems. Wood's comments come amid growing interest in Bitcoin as institutional investors increasingly view the cryptocurrency as a critical asset class. As regulatory clarity increases under new leadership, market participants predict that Bitcoin and other digital assets will gain greater legitimacy and adoption. *This is not investment advice.

Could that finally change during the ongoing bull cycle? Perplexity weighs in. On September 4, the project celebrated 2,000 since its official launch, which took place on March 14, 2019. Since then, it has amassed over 15 million customers who have completed the necessary KYC verification. However, the actual mainnet of the project, which promises to allow people to mine crypto directly from their smartphones and change the complexion of the Internet, is yet to be released to the public. Moreover, the team recently announced another extension for users to submit KYC applications from November until December 31, 2024. This is the second such extension, as the deadline was initially set for September. The current deadline coincides with the official mainnet and token launch date. Although the team continues to reassure that both will indeed launch on the last day of 2024, the community’s doubts have gone through the roof. As such, we decided to ask the popular AI chatbot – Perplexity, about its views on whether Pi Network’s mainnet will indeed see the day of light on December 31 or even during the ongoing bull cycle. It answered that the more favorable market conditions should definitely incentivize the team to follow through with the promised launch, as they can benefit from the overall landscape. “The broader cryptocurrency market conditions play a crucial role in determining the timing of the mainnet launch. A bullish market can enhance user interest and investment in the Pi Network, while a bearish market could lead to hesitance among potential users and investors,” – said the chatbot. Although it has not officially launched, the PI token has surged in price to $50, and Perplexity predicted that it could go as high as $100 even before its public release.

The IDO offers investors the opportunity to acquire STAGE tokens at an initial price of $0.00125. With a funding goal of $300,000 and a pre-valuation of $12.5 million, this IDO marks a critical step in the project's roadmap. A total of 240 million tokens, representing 2.40% of the total supply, have been allocated for this round. The token distribution follows a structured timeline to ensure sustainability and investor confidence. At the Token Generation Event (TGE), 15% of the purchased tokens will be released. This will be followed by a one-month cliff and six months of daily vesting, providing a phased approach to long-term investor engagement. This method also aims to mitigate market volatility and encourage token stability over time. STAGE has chosen ChainGPT as the platform for its IDO due to its AI-driven capabilities and secure environment for decentralized fundraising. ChainGPT integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain, creating a transparent and efficient mechanism for projects like STAGE to raise funds and attract investors. This collaboration highlights ChainGPT’s growing role in blockchain-based funding and innovation. Investors interested in the STAGE IDO can participate directly through ChainGPT’s platform, ensuring accessibility and ease of use. The IDO is part of a larger plan, as STAGE has additional funding rounds scheduled on platforms such as Decubate and Eesee. These multi-platform IDOs reflect the project’s ambition to secure widespread market support and funding for its development. The success of the IDO on ChainGPT will play a significant role in demonstrating market interest and confidence in STAGE’s vision. With its structured distribution plan and focus on long-term growth, STAGE aims to establish itself as a significant player in the blockchain space.

Over 100M Downloads Although it has not yet seen the release of its mainnet, Pi Network has become one of the most talked-about cryptocurrency projects, with a growing community of engaged users. This narrative received further validation earlier this week when Pi’s app reached a massive milestone of over 100,000,000 downloads on Google Play, which CryptoPotato was able to verify independently.

These numbers come even before the official launch of the network’s mainnet and token, both of which are scheduled to take place on December 31, 2024. However, this release date was put in doubt after the most recent deadline extension for the KYC verifications. You can check what Perplexity thinks about the mainnet launch here .

The team outlined an update about the number of users who have become compliant and identity-verified with the project’s requirements, which has shot up to over 14 million.

While these results indicate a significant strategy change in the cryptocurrency mining industry, BIT Mining announced that Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) mining yielded much more profitable results compared to Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Accordingly, BIT Mining announced that its strategy of focusing on mining Dogecoin and Litecoin is three times more profitable than mining Bitcoin alone. BIT Mining, which previously only mined Bitcoin, started mining Dogecoin and Litecoin in May 2023. The company stated that it had mined cryptocurrencies worth a total of $105.5 million by November 27. The company stated that it had mined $94.8 million worth of DOGE and $10.7 million worth of LTC as of November 27, but did not specify how much of the mined DOGE and LTC it held. BIT Mining Vice President and Chief Economist Dr. Youwei Yang also stated the following in his statement: “According to the announced figures, mining LTC and DOGE has proven to be almost three times more profitable than mining BTC alone. “The changing regulatory environment in the US, particularly following Elon Musk's influence and Donald Trump's victory, has had a major impact on mining profitability.” BIT Mining currently has over 5,550 active machines capable of mining Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bellscoin (BEL), representing 1.32% of the total network hashrate for these three altcoins, making it one of the largest participants. *This is not investment advice.

In his announcement of the nomination, Trump wrote that Atkins ""recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,"" providing assurance that the new SEC head will reverse Gary Gensler's hard-line stance against cryptocurrencies. The highest-profile token ( BTC-USD ) climbed to $102.5K at 6:37 AM ET. Since Nov. 6, when Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president, BTC has jumped 48%, underscoring investors’ optimism about Trump’s commitment to a favorable crypto environment. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) climbed 5.9%, dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) gained 7.3%, solana ( SOL-USD ) rose 1.6%, cardano ( ADA-USD ) increased 0.4%. With bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dominating headlines, crypto-focused stocks, such as MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ) +6.7%, Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) +3.4%, MARA ( NASDAQ: MARA ) +5.4%, Riot Platforms ( NASDAQ: RIOT )+4.6%, all changed hands in the green during premarket trading in the U.S. In addition to optimism over Trump’s crypto plans, bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) meteoric rise has been backed by two catalysts: MicroStrategy’s ( MSTR ) aggressive BTC-buying program and the market debut of options tied to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( NASDAQ: IBIT ).

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 11:53:00

37251024,https://finbold.com/?p=216987,1733399683,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Here’s how much NYC mayor Eric Adams is up his Bitcoin bet,https://finbold.com/heres-how-much-nyc-mayor-eric-adams-is-up-his-bitcoin-bet/,"Cryptocurrencies have gone a long way from an obscure asset class to a mainstream investment. Along that way, they have unsurprisingly become a topic of political discussion. The debates span more than just regulations — in recent times, the stances taken toward digital assets are becoming more and more of a chasm between the two major political parties in the United States — the Democrats and the Republicans. It comes as little surprise that Republicans are broadly supportive of the new asset class. A focus on deregulation and free market principles meshes well with cryptocurrency. Likewise, it’s not exactly shocking that Democrats, who usually favor stricter regulation, are lagging behind their rivals in terms of crypto adoption. There are outliers, of course — Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, for instance, is perhaps the highest-ranked Democrat to voice pro-crypto opinions . He’s not the earliest adopter in his party, however — that title most likely belongs to Eric Adams, the controversial mayor of New York. Back in 2022, Adams was the target of widespread mockery over his decision to receive his first three paychecks in the form of Bitcoin ( BTC ). In an event at the America LGBTQ+ Museum on December 3, the mayor of the ‘Big Apple’ reflected on that period — and seems to have gotten the last laugh. Here is how much those three paychecks could be worth right now. Adams received a tidy sum of Bitcoin back in 2022 Before actually taking office, then mayor-elect Adams announced his intention to receive payments in the form of BTC in early late 2021. As of early January that year, Adams had not yet received his first paycheck, as covered by Finbold . Once taxes are taken into account, each check would have netted Adams roughly $10,000, per publicly available data . He assumed office on January 1 — so for the sake of simplicity, we will assume he received his first check on February 1 — and subsequent checks on March 1 and April 1 of 2022. At the time of the first check, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $38,650. On March 1 2022, the leading digital asset had a price of $43,230, and at the time of the third paycheck, it was trading at $45,530. At press time, BTC was trading at $102,632. BTC price YTD chart. Source: Google Finance Now let’s compare that price with the prices at the time Adams was paid. The price of the premier cryptocurrency has rallied by 165.54%, 137.40%, and 125.41%, respectively since then. The average gain is thus 142.78% on an investment worth $30,000 — in other words, Adams’ BTC is now worth roughly $72,834, a gain of $42,834.

Bitcoin Price Today: What Comes After New All-time High? Although the US transferring nearly $2 billion BTC dampened the mood, Bitcoin price held its own and trigger a massive impulsive move that set up a new all-time high (ATH) of $104,698 in the late America session on Wednesday. Bitcoin price today is up No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago% and trades at No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago. Value of BTC trades at No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago, bringing the year-to-date gain from 56% on October 20 to 120% as of December 5. The YTD performance has slumped due to the recent BTC crash. Although many altcoins have shot up over triple digits, Bitcoin is catching up. Ethereum price’s YTD performance is lackluster, stands at 45%, and is well below BTC. Although Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s popularity is due to its first-mover advantage and its being a secure, decentralized network. In addition, many narratives, like digital gold, inflation hedges, and uncorrelated assets, have kept BTC at the forefront of the crypto market since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin to End 2024 on Positive Note Industry veterans’ speculation of a bull run post-US elections was right, and Bitcoin is likely to end November 2024 on a positive note. Many even expect a six-digit target for BTC by the end of November, and this is due to the historical returns . History shows that Bitcoin has always performed massively in the fourth quarter. Historical Bitcoin Price Performance With that said, if Bitcoin price hits a new ATH in November or December, Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which stands at No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago, could finally hit the $2 trillion mark. Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization While Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago, with Ethereum, the duo controls nearly 65% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Despite the seven-month consolidation, Bitcoin’s $1.93 trillion market cap remains strong, anticipating it reaching $2 trillion before 2025. BTC: A composition of 24-hour Trading Volume Being the top crypto has its benefits; more people tend to flock toward the asset. Likewise, BTC’s 24-hour trading volume stands at No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, contributes a major portion of this volume. Binance’s share of BTC’s 24-hour trading volume comprises spot and perpetuals trading. While spot volume hovers around 11%, perpetual volume is 41%. Exchanges like OKX, Bitget, etc, follow Binance. Key Bitcoin Upgrades With a market cap of $1.93 trillion, it is necessary for the network to remain secure, decentralized, and scalable. This is possible by upgrading the Bitcoin network regularly. Here are some notable upgrades the Bitcoin network has received or planned to receive since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin Network Upgrades Since 2009 Here are some key milestone upgrades to the Bitcoin network over the past decade. 2020-2024: Taproot Upgrade (2021): Improved Bitcoin’s smart contract functionality, allowing for more complex transactions and enhanced privacy.Muir Glacier Upgrade (2020): Delayed the “ice age” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring the continued smooth operation of Bitcoin. 2017-2019: Segregated Witness (SegWit) Upgrade (2017): Increased the block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed on the network, and improved the overall scalability of Bitcoin.

The Tesla & SpaceX lead recently commented on X, calling the nation’s BTC reserve portfolio “impressive.” In light of the flagship crypto recently topping the highly optimistic $100K mark, this saga has sparked noteworthy discussions among crypto enthusiasts surrounding the coin’s market potential. Elon Musk Lauds Nayib Bukele Over El Salvador’s Bitcoin Reserve In an X post on December 5, the Tesla & SpaceX lead called El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve “impressive.” This statement by Elon Musk comes against the backdrop of Nayib Bukele and the nation’s BTC bets paying off. Notably, Bukele posted on X, revealing the nation’s reserve portfolio. Per the post, the Salvadorean government’s $333.59 million investment now boasts a total value of $603.34 million. The total profit on this investment marked gains worth 124%. In turn, this saga has echoed a market frenzy. Meanwhile, the latest data by Arkham Intelligence indicated that the Salvadoran government address is still investing 1 BTC every day. The entity currently holds 5,955 BTC, with a massive profit, as mentioned above. Overall, this massive buying has in turn underscored the asset’s immense market potential. Simultaneously, the flagship crypto continues to solidify bullishness among investors, topping the $100K mark recently. BTC Reaches New ATH It’s noteworthy that Bitcoin hit a new ATH at the $103,900 mark recently, offering significant aid to El Salvador’s reserve, as also spotlighted by Elon Musk. At press time, BTC price gained roughly 8% intraday to reach $102,441. Its 24-hour low was recorded as $94,660. Intriguingly, the flagship crypto sees a bull run in light of Donald Trump’s reelection to the white house. Subsequently, with Trump appointing Paul Atkins as the new SEC commissioner , market sentiments over future movements remain optimistic. Although it’s also worth mentioning that the defunct crypto exchange Mt Gox was recorded moving heavy amounts of the crypto, market sentiments mainly remain bullish in Q4. A top analyst, Ali Martinez, further revealed that the coin eyes more gains ahead before a major correction hits.

Though such a move is undoubtedly good for BTC bulls and ensures the majority of long positions are in the green, it bodes ill for those investors who wagered the world’s premier cryptocurrency could not sustain the positive momentum. Specifically, at press time on December 5, $110,000 is shaping up to be a highly painful level for those who bet Bitcoin’s price will drop. Approximately $8 billion worth of shorts will be liquidated once it is reached, according to data retrieved by Finbold from CoinGlass on Thursday. Bitcoin price and liquidation chart.

No matter the next step BTC faces, the December 4 and December 5 rally ensured the coin is up 6.20% in the last 24 hours, 7.83% in the last week, and a staggering 48.96% in the green in the last 30 days. Bitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold The most recent move was, by all accounts, driven by two separate events in the political sphere on Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell rejected the notion that Bitcoin is a competitor to the American dollar but, in the same motion, lent it credence by likening the digital asset to the world’s biggest commodity: gold. On the same day, former president and President-Elect Donald Trump unveiled Paul Atkins as his pick for the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair. As a co-chair of the Token Alliance , a pro-cryptocurrency lobbying group, Atkins starkly contrasts the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, who is widely seen as a villain inside the community. The two latest developments come amidst an overall bullish shift in attitude that emerged from Trump’s re-election. The incoming Republican administration is considered better for business, trading, and digital assets by most investors and is set to bring numerous pro-crypto individuals into power. Furthermore, some of the departures from the U.S. government have themselves proven powerful tailwinds for various coins and tokens in the cryptocurrency market , with Gensler’s announced January 20 resignation driving a particularly strong rally for XRP .

Among these, HTX DAO’s governance token $HTX emerges as a standout, undervalued asset with huge growth potential. With its robust brand legacy, innovative ecosystem, and deflationary tokenomics, $HTX is well-positioned to lead the charge. Compared to similar tokens, $HTX, backed by HTX DAO and leading exchange HTX could be one of the top performers in 2025. HTX Exchange: A Multifaceted Leader in the Crypto Sphere 1. A Decade-Long Global Brand HTX has consistently ranked among the top-tier exchanges since its inception, establishing itself as a trusted global brand. Spanning over a decade of market cycles, this pioneering exchange has gained a strong reputation and a global user base. HTX now serves users in numerous countries and regions, building strong trust through localizing operations. HTX’s globalization strategy is a key contributor to its competitive strength. Through meticulous localization efforts across Europe, Asia, and beyond, HTX has diversified its market exposure, minimizing risks tied to regional fluctuations and unlocking new growth horizons. This strategy helps attract more users and strengthens the value of the $HTX token. 2. A Diversified and Thriving Ecosystem HTX has transitioned from a standalone trading platform to an all-encompassing crypto ecosystem, spanning trading, earning, staking, GameFi, DeFi, and NFTs. This diversification has allowed HTX to remain ahead of the curve, leveraging trends like decentralized finance and non-fungible assets.

Bitcoin has surged past $100,000, driven by a number of factors , including President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of supposedly crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to lead the SEC. Most analysts are bullish, anticipating further gains toward $120,000 and higher, and it's not hard to see why. As Newton's first law states, an object in motion maintains its speed and direction unless acted on by an outside force. The wider market is poised to benefit from bitcoin's milestone, especially as the six-digit price may be too steep for many retail investors, prompting them to consider alternative cryptocurrencies. Ether, in particular, is likely to benefit because the spread between the Ethereum staking yield and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury has narrowed recently, with the Treasury's return dropping to 4.2% from 4.5% in the past two weeks. Note, however, that a whale address moved 11,753 ETH to exchanges in the past 24 hours, raising price volatility risks. Additionally, the Bitcoin layer-2 network Stacks' STX token is gaining considerable attention on social media, with one observer referring to the SEC-compliant token as a "" de facto BTC staking provider ."" STX has surged 56% this quarter, though at $2.80 it remains well below its record $3.84. Keep an eye on this one. In traditional markets, BTC's rise has lifted spirts of crypto-related equities, with self-described bitcoin development company MicroStrategy up over 6% in pre-market trading. Copycat Semler Scientific has gained over 7% and MARA Holdings more than 6%. Still, there are several external forces that may stall BTC's momentum. ""Risks are centered around escalating conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, along with dramatic shifts in interest rate expectations from the Fed,"" trading firm Zerocap's CIO Jonathan de Wet told CoinDesk, adding that the Fed's potential hawkish turn next year may take the wind out of BTC's sails. Sergei Gorev, head of risk at YouHodler, said risks could emerge from an ""overheated"" S&P 500. ""While the price increase may continue, it likely won’t be significant,"" he said. Many"" technical indicators suggest a potential correction, prompting algorithmic traders to seek entry points for short positions to address divergences on the charts."" Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, and several others say the crypto market itself looks overheated and is at risk of correction. ""The Fear and Greed Index has climbed above 80, signaling extreme greed among investors. Smaller-cap assets are seeing explosive gains, drawing in retail participants eager to capitalize on the bull run. While this strategy could be lucrative, it carries significant risks in such unpredictable conditions,"" Fournier told CoinDesk. So, stay alert out there!

Viral sensation Haliey Welch launched a token on Solana late Wednesday. The token, backed by a management team, a foundation in the Cayman Islands, and a SAFT agreement with private investors who all claimed to ensure the longevity of HAWK — a token themed after Welch’s popular “hawk tuah” catchphrase. The token initially saw its market cap soar to $490 million before dramatically crashing to less than $40 million with 20 minutes. The wild price action drew parallels to a classic “rug pull,” or a token that benefits early buyers by pumping several multiples after issuance only to drop more than 90% in the hours or days afterward. On-chain sleuths such as Bubblemaps allege over 96% of HAWK tokens were held in a single cluster — or a collection of related wallets — that sold tokens when prices rose. Welch and her team have responded to some of these allegations, denying that insiders sold tokens at launch and claiming that the initial high trading fees were implemented to prevent snipers — or bots that purchase large amounts of a token after issuances to corner supply. Several messages sent to Welch’s team to shed light on the allegations were unanswered in Asian hours. Derivatives Positioning The market looks overheated and faces pullback risks, with BTC's perpetual funding rates more expensive than those of speculative tokens such as DOGE. Traders are increasingly focusing on ETH, as evidenced by the new high of 6.86 million ETH in ether futures and perpetual futures open interest. BTC's OI is yet to confirm the new spot-price high. BTC calls, however, are more expensive than ETH on Deribit, according to 24-delta risk reversals sourced from Amberdata. Long dealer gamma at the $105,000 strike options suggests potential for range play. BTC, ETH options flows mostly leaned bullish, but a large block trade saw an ETH trader sell the December expiry straddle at $3,800, collecting over $2 million in premium. Selling straddle represents expectations for price consolidation and volatility drop.

While You Were Sleeping Traders See Even More Bitcoin Buying Pressure as BTC Sets New Record at $103K (CoinDesk): Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, reaching $103,670 before easing to $102,500. The 50 percent monthly gain reflects higher institutional interest, record ETF inflows, growing acceptance from traditional finance and optimism about Donald Trump’s presidency, which is expected to create a more favorable environment for bitcoin in the United States. Euro’s Outlook Gets Even Murkier After French Government Falls (Bloomberg): The euro faces pressure after Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s government was ousted in a no-confidence vote, increasing fears of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in France. Rising borrowing costs, a widening deficit, and uncertainty over the budget are compounding risks for the single currency, which has fallen 2.7% against the dollar since June. South Korea President Replaces Defence Minister and Battles Impeachment (Financial Times): South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol accepted Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun’s resignation on Thursday amid backlash over the failed attempt to impose martial law.

Binance's BNB Hits Fresh Record, Breaks Out of 3-Year Range as Altcoin Rotation Accelerates (CoinDesk): BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, climbed to an all-time high of $793 on Wednesday, driven by growing interest in altcoins and hopes for Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. The rally was also supported by reduced regulatory pressure on Binance, token supply cuts through burns, and rising activity on the BNB Chain. Dovish BOJ Member Strikes Cautious Tone on Inflation, Wages (The Wall Street Journal): Bank of Japan board member Toyoaki Nakamura downplayed expectations for an imminent rate hike, citing doubts about reaching the 2 percent inflation target. His comments weakened the yen to 150.70 per dollar. Economists are divided on whether the BOJ will act at its Dec. 18-19 meeting or wait because of U.S. leadership changes. Ethereum's Justin Drake Sees No Threat From Solana, Says Its ‘Golden Era’ Will End (CoinDesk): In a CoinDesk interview, Ethereum developer Justin Drake said that his recent Beam Chain proposal focuses on enhancing the long-term security of Ethereum’s layer-1, not competing with Solana. He suggested that Ethereum’s layer-2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, are designed to handle performance demands like those Solana targets.

You might also like: The future of crypto security: Trustless MPC is the next big thing | Opinion Decentralized private AI agents are the answer. They provide a truly innovative solution to combating risks by harnessing large language models and predictive analytics to detect fraud, prevent security breaches, and safeguard users in real time. Here’s how. 1. Identifying anomalous behavior with LLMs Large language models, known for their proficiency in understanding natural language, are becoming more commonly adapted for security roles in crypto––and with good reason. These models are ideal for spotting suspicious patterns in transaction data and identifying anomalies that signal fraud. For example, LLMs can analyze user behaviors, standard transaction amounts, and wallet activities to detect deviations from the norm quickly. This allows AI agents to flag potential scams, like phishing attempts or unusual withdrawals, well before funds are compromised. LLMs are constantly learning from a wide variety of inputs like past user behaviors, transaction histories, and even external market conditions and real time intelligence, allowing them to develop a refined sense of “normal” activity, which makes it increasingly difficult for hackers to bypass their intelligent systems. This ability to adapt is particularly valuable in crypto, where trading habits can vary widely, and fraudulent behavior follows certain patterns. LLMs are capable of evolving quickly with changing threats, which is crucial for keeping up with the dynamic crypto landscape. 2. Predictive analytics to assess and mitigate risks Predictive analytics, powered by AI agents, play a critical role in assessing the risk of each transaction. In fast-paced crypto trading, where assets can shift value in minutes and transactions are often irreversible, the stakes are high. Predictive models leverage historical data to forecast potential risks tied to specific trades, wallet addresses, or platforms, allowing users to make informed decisions. These analytics use indicators such as past scam wallet addresses, trends in phishing websites, and hacking attempts to assign risk scores to each transaction. For instance, an AI agent can recognize the security risk associated with an unfamiliar address tracked from known ongoing hacks and phishing before a transaction by cross-referencing it with security data in real time. It can alert the user to potential threats or even block the transaction altogether, significantly reducing the chance of funds falling into the hands of scammers. 3. AI agents in action: Real-time fraud prevention and alerts Beyond detection, decentralized private AI agents play an even more important role in preventing fraud by operating autonomously on both users’ devices and custody systems, assessing every transaction before it occurs. If an agent detects unusual behavior, like an attempt to transfer a large sum to an unverified address, it can instantly alert the user, request verification, or, if necessary, block the transaction entirely. This real-time functionality is critical in crypto, where transactions happen almost instantly. Unlike traditional financial systems, which often require time-consuming fraud investigations and response times, decentralized AI agents act within milliseconds to prevent breaches before they escalate. Plus, with localized operation, users benefit from increased privacy, as all data remains within the device, away from centralized servers where it could be vulnerable to attacks. 4. Localized operation An additional aspect of decentralized private AI agents is their ability to run locally on users’ wallets and custody systems rather than relying on cloud infrastructure. This design significantly enhances security and privacy, creating an invisible layer of protection. Externally, these AI agents appear as standard private crypto wallets, indistinguishable from any other. The fact that they house advanced AI capabilities is known only to the user. This operating mode makes it exceptionally difficult for attackers to identify and target wallets enhanced with these autonomous security features. Since the AI runs locally, hackers first need to locate the physical device hosting the wallet—an immensely challenging task due to its anonymity. Even if they succeed, they face the added complexity of breaching the wallet’s robust defenses, which are powered by LLMs and predictive analytics designed to counteract phishing, malware, and fraud. 5. Enhancing security with multi-layered insights LLMs add an extra layer of security by continuously cross-referencing external data sources, such as recent scam reports or new hacking techniques. In doing so, they generate insights that not only protect individual users but also help secure the entire crypto community. For example, if a new phishing technique or malware variant is detected in one part of the network, the AI can update its detection algorithms across all nodes to proactively warn users, enhancing network-wide security. Takeaways By integrating LLM-powered AI agents with predictive analytics, decentralized private AI solutions are reshaping crypto security. These agents not only detect and prevent fraud but also enhance user trust by enabling secure, private transactions. Their predictive capabilities allow users to approach crypto trading with more confidence, knowing that AI agents are constantly working on their behalf to assess and mitigate risks. Ultimately, private AI agents armed with LLMs and predictive analytics offer a next-gen approach to tackling the security challenges in crypto. By combining real-time fraud detection, proactive alerts, and risk assessment, these AI-driven tools allow users to trade and transact with peace of mind, setting a new standard for safety in the evolving digital economy.

How does this impact investors? On Dec. 5, HashKey posted an official statement that explains the allocation of HSK tokens for team members. The notice stated that HashKey allocated 30% of its 1 billion token supply for the internal team which follows an unlocking period that consists of a minimum 3-month lock-up period and a 35-month linear release. “We’d like to clarify key aspects of HSK’s tokenomics and team incentives structure: HSK has a total supply of 1 billion tokens, with 300 million allocated for team incentives,” HashKey wrote in the firm’s official statement . HashKey said that the 30% token allocation for team members was done to support the growth of HashKey’s ecosystem. The firm claimed that the tokens will be used for licensed exchanges, investment services, tokenization and infrastructure solutions. Tokens can also be used for exchange fee payments, trading discounts and accessing community incentives. Therefore, current team members and former employees who hold HSK have to adhere to the firm’s token management policies, which regulate issuing, holding and selling tokens in accordance with the lock-up schedule. You might also like: Hong Kong’s HashKey announces new launch date for HSK native token Moreover, the Hong Kong -based crypto exchange clarified that employee resignation does not allow former team members to get an early or full token unlock. This is done to prevent former employees from cheating the system and selling tokens before the unlock period. As previously reported by crypto.news, HashKey first opened deposits for HSK on Nov. 7 at 07:00 UTC, while spot trading for the HSK/USDT pair started on Nov. 26 at 10:00 UTC. The opening of HSK withdrawals occurred on the next day, Nov. 27 at 10:00 UTC. In the initial announcement, the exchange explained that it had prepared a supply of 1 billion tokens, with 65% of the tokens being allocated to marketing and business development while 30% of the supply went to the HashKey team. What does the 30% HSK allocation for team members mean for investors? On one hand, allocation of tokens before a new launch is common practice in the crypto sphere. It is meant to incentivize team members and align their interests with the success of the project. That way, they will be more motivated to work harder to develop the project. In HashKey’s case, the 36-month linear release period suggests the team is committed to the project’s long-term development. The unlocking period also reduces the risk of a pump-and-dump happening, because team members are unable to sell tokens quickly to gain profit within the period. On the other hand, setting aside a chunk of the token supply for team members means that there are fewer tokens available in circulation. Usually when the portion reserved for insiders is too high, there will be higher pressure for insiders to sell tokens. When the lockup period ends and tokens start unlocking, the team could still potentially sell their tokens to realize profits, which would in turn increase supply and potentially lower prices. Therefore, investors would need to keep an eye on the unlocking timeline and the project’s development milestones. According to data from CoinGecko , HashKey’s platform token is down 9.4% in the past day. HSK is currently trading hands at $1.31 at the time of writing. In the past week, the token has gone up by nearly 20% and has a fully diluted valuation of $1.3 billion. Though, there is no information about how many tokens are circulating on the market right now.

Positively, the technical indicators SMA & MACD continue recording bullish sentiment, hinting at a potential reversal. The HBAR altcoin is currently trading at a discount of 46.71% from its ATH of $0.5701. Despite Bitcoin price achieving the $100k mark and major altcoins recording a massive price rally, the Hedera price has experienced a major setback after repeatedly failing to break out of its important resistance level above the $0.337 mark. Is the dream run of Hedera over? Or will this altcoin make a strong bullish comeback and smash its multi-year high during the upcoming weeks? In this article, we have covered the short-term price analysis of the Hedera (HBAR) crypto token. HBAR Price Records a Strong Bearish Reversal This Week! The Hedera price has dropped ~7% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $3.419 billion. Moreover, it has dropped over 23% this week, highlighting an increase in the selling pressure. However, in the longer time frame, it has soared ~600%, hinting at a possible reversal this month. TradingView: HBAR/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) witnesses a decline in its green histogram. However, the averages show a massive uptrend in the daily time frame. This indicates a mixed price sentiment for the 18th largest crypto token in the market. On the other hand, the SMA indicator has been supporting the Hedera price chart since the beginning of November. This highlights a long-term bullish price action for the altcoin. Will HBAR Price Go Up Again? If the bulls hold the Hedera price above its support level of $0.278, this could result in this altcoin retesting its resistance level of $0.337. Reportedly, if the bullish sentiment intensifies, this could push the price of it toward its 52-week high of ~$0.393 this month. On the contrary, if the bears regain momentum, the HBAR coin price could breach its $0.278 level and plunge toward its low of $0.231 this December.

The optimism saw metaverse tokens extending their gains , with Sandbox (SAND) outshining. Consecutive gains throughout the previous month saw SAND surpassing $1 to explore $1.0616 during Wednesday’s late session. The impressive price increase, up 60% and 310% in the past week and month, has made many Sandbox investors profitable. IntoTheBlock data shows that 50% of SAND holders are making money at current prices. Meanwhile, 38% experience losses while 12% are at break even. Source: IntoTheBlock SAND price at new highs The altcoin painted its daily chart green after climbing from the opening price of $0.8784 to $1.0616. SAND trades at $0.95 after cooling from its latest high, but everything seemingly points to more gains. Source: Coinmarketcap The 90% surge in daily trading volume to $3.80 billion confirms massive trader optimism behind Sandbox’s performance. Technical indicators support the bullish stance for SAND. The 50 and 200-day exponential moving averages form a golden cross in the 1D timeframe, confirming robust bullishness in play. Furthermore, stability above the $0.90 support sets the stage for impressive upswings. The altcoin will likely recapture $1.07 and extend toward $1.250. Such sentiments will likely trigger more uptrends for SAND, opening the path to the $1.50 target. That would result in a 58% upsurge from prevailing prices. On-chain data supports extended surges On-chain stats further add to SAND’s improving bullish stance. Net network growth shows a 0.80% increase, indicating heightened investor activity, which could attract significant demand. Furthermore, nearly 4% of transactions were profitable at press time, confirming that most Sandbox investors were profitable. Such trends often lead to amplified buying momentum. Also, large transactions have surged 12.06%, suggesting accumulating by whales or institutional players. That reflects confidence in SAND’s upcoming price movements. Last but not least, the 0.07% concentration shows a significant number of wallets control SAND’s supply. That could moderate volatility if whales decide to offload. Source: IntoTheBlock SAND exhibits bullish indicators, supporting the upward narrative to$1.50. Broad market sentiments align with SAND’s anticipated surge. The Altcoin Season Index explores yearly peaks, currently at 87/100 ( Coinmarketcap data ). That means 87 of the top 100 digital assets by market cap have outperformed Bitcoin within a 3-month timeframe. Scores above 75 suggest an altcoin season, whereas 25 and below indicate a BTC season. The current readings show the market is in an alt season. The previous altcoin season, in HI 2021, saw the top 100 alts skyrocketing by 174%, while Bitcoin gained only 2%. Analysts expect such trends in the upcoming weeks or months, conditions which would see SAND hitting its targets and printing new ATHs.

Data from SosoValue shows that IBIT currently has $50.60 billion in AUM. The AUM refers to the total value of Bitcoin managed by the fund. In the context of a spot Bitcoin ETF, the AUM is directly tied to the value of the BTC held by the ETF, as it aims to mirror the price movements of the digital asset in the spot market. Five-Times Faster According to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , it took IBIT only 228 days to reach this milestone, adding that the previous record holder, BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), took 1,329 days to achieve the same. This means that IBIT achieved this feat 5x faster than any ETF ever launched. Among the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January, BlackRock’s IBIT has continued to outperform others in multiple metrics. Within five months of its release, it surpassed the pre-existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in AUM. IBIT is also the highest in terms of historical net inflows. On its most recent trading day (December 4), the fund pulled in the highest inflow amongst its peers, totaling $571.71 million. This took its historical net inflow to a staggering $33.34 billion, according to Sosovalue. Increasing Institutional Investment in Bitcoin IBIT’s rapid growth reflects heightened investor confidence in Bitcoin exposure via traditional financial instruments. Moreover, the approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have driven increased institutional investment in BTC. As of the time of writing, the total net asset value (NAV) of spot Bitcoin ETFs stands at $108.23 billion, representing 5.54% of Bitcoin’s market value. The fund’s historical cumulative net inflow has crossed $32.29 billion. Meanwhile, the heightened activity around these ETFs coincides with a significant upsurge in the price of BTC. The original cryptocurrency rose 6% to hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $103,679 earlier Thursday.

Top Analyst Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-next-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-will-the-rise-continue-top-analyst-explained/,"While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the critical level of $ 100,000, there is no full consensus in the market. While some analysts expect a pullback or a sideways movement from here, some analysts expect the rise to continue. At this point, Nick Forster, founder of decentralized options protocol Derive, said that he does not expect BTC to move sideways around $ 100,000 for a long time. Forster said that breaking the $100,000 psychological price barrier would attract more interest and push the price higher. “I don't think we're likely to see much consolidation around 100,000. I expect the rally to continue. Because breaking $100,000 will attract new participants to the market and change the minds of existing investors. This also points to more volatility and potential upside.” The analyst also stated that investors may turn to altcoins from now on, predicting that there may be a further return to Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins. “ETH has been lagging the market so far. But I expect that to change now. As a reminder, ETH has historically outperformed Bitcoin after reaching previous all-time highs or major milestones,” Forster said. *This is not investment advice.

37254788,https://invezz.com/?p=2370398,1733406858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Brazil sees surge in Bitcoin ATMs as cryptocurrency adoption grows,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/05/brazil-sees-surge-in-bitcoin-atms-as-cryptocurrency-adoption-grows/,"In recent years, Brazil has seen a significant increase in cryptocurrency usage, evidenced by the proliferation of Bitcoin ATMs nationwide. This increase reflects Brazilians’ growing acceptance of digital assets and a shift toward innovative financial technologies. CoinATMRadar data shows nine Bitcoin ATMs in Brazil’s largest cities, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Petrópolis, São Bernardo do Campo, and Bauru. This represents a significant increase from just four ATMs in 2021, demonstrating the rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies by Brazilians. The proliferation of these machines facilitates Bitcoin buying and selling, offering convenience and accessibility often lacking in traditional banking. Coin Cloud is leading the charge for ATM expansion Coin Cloud has played an important role in this ATM expansion, taking substantial steps to improve the availability of Bitcoin ATMs in key urban areas. The company’s plan seeks not just to meet current demand, but also to promote a greater knowledge and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Brazil. Coin Cloud is well-positioned to boost Brazil’s prominence in the cryptocurrency environment, with plans for additional expansion in the works. Globally, the surge is not exclusive to Brazil. CoinATMRadar claims that there are now over 38,000 Bitcoin ATMs in 67 countries. These ATMs are facilitated by 362 firms and built by 39 different producers, suggesting a strong global interest and investment in Bitcoin infrastructure. This global trend reflects the growing acknowledgement of cryptocurrencies as genuine financial tools, igniting critical debates about their economic impact. Brazil in the Latin American crypto-sphere Brazil’s cryptocurrency infrastructure falls somewhere between its Latin American neighbours. Colombia now leads the region with Bitcoin ATMs, with 46, followed by Panama (17) and Argentina (13). This background exposes an intriguing dynamic, implying that, while Brazil has made tremendous progress in embracing Bitcoin ATMs, there is still enormous space for expansion, especially when examined through the perspective of regional peers. Despite lagging in terms of overall ATM numbers, Brazil is undergoing a significant cultural movement toward Bitcoin acceptance. The expanding number of Bitcoin ATMs shows not just an increase in digital asset usage, but also changing customer behaviour and attitudes toward financial technology. As cryptocurrencies become more widespread, more Brazilians are expected to include them in their financial portfolios. Future outlook for cryptocurrency adoption in Brazil The popularity of Bitcoin ATMs in Brazil is expected to expand even more as demand for cryptocurrency rises. This predicted rise is driven by a younger, tech-savvy population, more knowledge of financial technology, and a general demand for alternatives to traditional banking systems. The accessibility of Bitcoin ATMs will only help to further establish cryptocurrencies in the Brazilian economy. Furthermore, as educational programs surrounding cryptocurrencies increase, more Brazilians are likely to regard Bitcoin and other digital assets as legitimate means of conducting transactions rather than speculative speculations. This cultural shift could accelerate the development of a more robust cryptocurrency ecosystem in Brazil, benefiting both consumers and companies. Overall, the proliferation of Bitcoin ATMs around Brazil represents the beginning of a fundamental shift in how cryptocurrencies are seen and used in the country. While problems persist, the favourable trajectory shows that Brazil is on the verge of a broader financial technology revolution, one that has the potential to redefine economic participation for millions of its inhabitants in the years ahead.

This unprecedented growth coincided with key developments, including Mastercard's partnership with Crypto.com to introduce prepaid crypto card services in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Mastercard Partners with Crypto.com to Launch Prepaid Crypto Card Services in GCC Mastercard has granted a license to Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com to launch its prepaid payment card services in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The rollout will commence in Bahrain in January 2025, with plans for expansion across the rest of the GCC. This partnership represents a significant step forward in integrating cryptocurrency with traditional financial systems, leveraging Mastercard's global network to deliver enhanced payment solutions in a region known for its progressive approach to blockchain and digital currencies. According to Mastercard's official announcement, the new prepaid card will be integrated into Crypto.com’s ecosystem, allowing users to fund their accounts through the Crypto.com app. Customers will have the flexibility to use e-money wallets or third-party-issued credit and debit cards to load their accounts. The card will cater to all five tiers of Crypto.com’s offerings, including the premium ”Black Obsidian” card, which provides rewards of up to 8% and card payouts in US dollars. The tiered structure ensures inclusivity, offering benefits to both casual users and crypto enthusiasts who invest heavily in the platform. The announcement has stirred excitement within the cryptocurrency community, with many praising the partnership as a strategic move that enhances Crypto.com’s services in a region that previously lacked Visa-backed offerings. Social media platforms, particularly X, have been abuzz with discussions surrounding the implications of the partnership. One account associated with the Crypto.com community clarified that the Mastercard-backed cards would primarily serve the GCC region, where Visa-backed Crypto.com cards are currently unavailable. This move ensures that users in these markets gain access to seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions without disrupting Visa-backed offerings in other regions. Strategic Expansion in the GCC Region Bahrain will serve as the launchpad for Crypto.com’s Mastercard card in January 2025, with plans to expand into other GCC countries, including Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The GCC region is emerging as a hub for blockchain and Web3 innovation, making it an attractive market for cryptocurrency platforms. Governments across the region have shown a strong commitment to fostering fintech and blockchain ecosystems, creating a fertile ground for partnerships like this one. Amnah Ajmal, Mastercard’s Executive Vice President of Market Development, said, “Crypto.com will now have access to our global network, enabling transactions wherever Mastercard is accepted, our innovative payment solutions powered by cutting-edge technology, and our comprehensive tools for enhancing transaction security and fraud protection.” This partnership signals a growing trend of major financial institutions embracing cryptocurrencies, bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance. Mastercard’s decision to integrate with Crypto.com aligns with its broader strategy to expand its presence in the Web3 space, enabling users to transact seamlessly across diverse markets. The move also highlights the competitive dynamic between Mastercard and Visa as both companies seek to secure a foothold in the expanding cryptocurrency payments industry. While Visa has been a long-standing partner of Crypto.com in other regions, the Mastercard-backed cards mark a strategic diversification for Crypto.com in the GCC. The GCC’s progressive regulatory environment and tech-savvy population create ideal conditions for the success of such initiatives. By offering secure, convenient, and reward-rich payment solutions, Crypto.com and Mastercard are likely to drive increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in the region. The Mastercard-Crypto.com partnership is a major milestone in the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency as a mainstream financial tool. By targeting the GCC region, the collaboration not only taps into a market ripe for innovation but also paves the way for other cryptocurrency exchanges to explore similar ventures. With the rollout beginning in Bahrain in January 2025 and plans to expand to other GCC nations, this initiative could accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions, transforming the financial landscape of the region. Cryptocurrency Trading Volumes Surge to Record $10 Trillion in November Amid Pro-Crypto Sentiment In a related development, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) witnessed an unprecedented surge in trading activity last month, with total volumes across spot and derivatives markets exceeding $10 trillion for the first time, according to a Dec. 3 report from CCData . This milestone represents a more than 100% increase from October’s figures, driven by renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency sector following the US presidential election. The report highlighted that the $10 trillion mark was a significant milestone in the evolution of centralized crypto trading, fueled by positive market sentiment after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Market participants interpreted the election results as a signal for potential regulatory reforms favoring digital assets. CCData attributed the dramatic increase to traders and investors capitalizing on a bullish market environment. The anticipation of a crypto-friendly policy landscape under the new administration spurred an influx of trading activity, with both institutional and retail participants eager to seize the moment. The report noted that spot markets played a pivotal role in the November trading frenzy, with volumes soaring by nearly 130% to $3.4 trillion. Several prominent exchanges recorded all-time high monthly trading volumes: Upbit Bybit Crypto.com Gate.io Bullish Notably, shares of Galaxy Digital, a crypto trading desk, surged by 25% on Nov. 5 as well, marking the firm’s most active trading day of the year. The spike coincided with the market's response to the election results, signaling widespread investor confidence in the potential for industry growth. Crypto derivatives also saw a remarkable uptick, with trading volumes climbing nearly 90% month-over-month to reach almost $7 trillion. The heightened interest in derivatives trading was attributed to the introduction of new products and the expanding role of institutional participants. One key development in November was the launch of Arkham’s digital asset derivatives exchange on Nov. 6. Designed to target retail traders, Arkham’s entry into the market signaled growing competition with established platforms such as Binance. The addition of innovative derivatives offerings underscored the increasing sophistication of crypto markets. Crypto Options Bolster Derivatives Growth Another critical factor in the derivatives boom was the growing popularity of crypto options, particularly those tied to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved the listing of BTC ETF options in September, paving the way for their debut in November on major platforms like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. On Nov. 18, BlackRock’s BTC ETF options achieved nearly $2 billion in exposure on their first trading day. This milestone signaled strong institutional interest and highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to gain further traction as a mainstream financial asset. Investment managers expressed optimism about the role of BTC ETF options in driving institutional adoption. One analyst noted, “The US debut of spot BTC ETF options could unlock extraordinary upside for Bitcoin holders and solidify its position as a critical asset in the modern portfolio.” Options trading, which involves contracts granting the right to buy or sell assets at predetermined prices, has long been a tool for managing risk and leveraging market positions. Its introduction to crypto ETFs represents a significant step forward for the market’s maturation. Looking ahead, the anticipated regulatory clarity under the new US administration could further boost investor confidence. The growing accessibility of innovative financial products, such as BTC ETF options, is likely to enhance institutional participation and drive market liquidity. The $10 trillion trading volume milestone in November is a watershed moment for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and the broader crypto industry. With positive market sentiment fueled by Donald Trump’s election victory, traders and investors have positioned themselves for a new era of pro-crypto policies and increased institutional engagement. As the market continues to evolve, the continued adoption of innovative products like BTC ETF options show the potential for sustained growth and broader acceptance of digital assets. The unprecedented trading volumes in November are not just a reflection of the crypto sector’s current momentum but a glimpse into its promising future.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-05 13:58:59

By 2027, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $4.28. The EOS price in 2030 could reach a maximum possible level of $13.16 and an average forecast price of $11.36. EOS is a fully decentralized network that supports the development, hosting, and execution of large-scale decentralized applications (dApps), offering significant advantages in scalability and user experience. The cryptocurrency entered the crypto market in 2017 and has experienced a significant journey, including a record-breaking $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Despite its initial promise as an “Ethereum killer,” it has faced various challenges impacting its market performance and reputation. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $1.352 Market Cap $2.10B Trading Volume $986.99M Circulating Supply 1.53B EOS All-time High $22.89 Apr 29, 2018 All-time Low $0.4802 Oct 23, 2017 24-hour High $1.37 24-hour Low $1.27 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 1.107 Volatility 27.40% 50-Day SMA $ 0.583 14-Day RSI 83.68 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Green Days 19/30 (63%) 200-Day SMA $ 0.623 EOS price analysis: Bullish swing results in a hike above $1.352 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed an increasing trend at $1.352. Cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.72% of its value during the day. EOS coin prices are seeking a support level around $1.345. On December 5, 2024, EOS coin price analysis revealed an increasing market trend for the cryptocurrency. Coin value has spiked up to a $1.352 high over the last 24 hours. However, from an overall perspective, the cryptocurrency lost up to 0.72% of its value. The bulls have been reigning in the market for the past few weeks, and today a further upturn was recorded as well. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of EOS coin confirmed an upward market trend for the currency. EOS/USD value has launched up to $1.352 over the span of the past 24 hours. However, the overall market sentiment continues to remain negative. Since the volatility is expanding rapidly, there is a higher chance of a reversal soon. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines the market volatility. As this distance is expanding massively, this indicates a rising volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the support band, has shifted to $1.345. Whereas, its lower limit, serving as yet another support, has moved to a $0.415 low. EOS/USD 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator resides within the overbought area. Its value has improved up to 86.83 over the period of the last 24 hours. This increasing movement depicts the highly positive market situation. The continuously ascending curve refers to a persistent uptrend. As the buying activities are growing rapidly, this marks a relatively balanced trading environment. EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of EOS coin confirmed a downward market trend for the cryptocurrency. The EOS/USD value has dropped down to a $1.359 low during the past few hours of the day. Despite the bullish swing in the earlier hours, currently the market trend is relatively on the bearish side. The distance between the Bollinger bands remains unchanged. This unchanged distance marks a constant volatility, signaling a lower market unpredictability for the coming hours. Currently, the upper Bollinger band has moved to a $1.517 high, securing the resistance point. Whereas, the lower Bollinger band has shifted to a $1.00 low, signifying available support. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is present close to the overbought limit. However, its value has dropped down to 62.94 in the last four hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph marks a rising bearish resistance. As the selling activities have been intensifying in the past few hours, further descent might be observed soon. Currently the cryptocurrency is on the losing side, as the bears have taken over the market. EOS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.866 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.881 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.843 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.742 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.583 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.538 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.623 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.719 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.645 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.572 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.529 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.513 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.535 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.600539 BUY What to expect from EOS price analysis EOS price analysis gives out a highly bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has spiked up to a $1.352 high over the last 24 hours. Conversely, the overall market sentiment remained negative, as evidenced by the 0.72% loss. The cryptocurrency price has been climbing quite steadily through the past few weeks, leading to substantial recovery. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to depict a bullish scenario for the current market situation. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen fewer green days in the last month. The coin’s price dropped by 25% over the last year and 85% over the last three years. However, the circumstances can change, and a turn in the upper direction cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2024), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.764. Why is EOS up? EOS is in ascent with bullish pressure affecting on its price action. The coin has increased up to $1.352 in the past 24 hours, and bulls have made all efforts. EOS will increase further if sufficient support from the buyers is experienced. Will EOS Recover? EOS is currently trading in its lower historical price envelope. The coin enjoyed some bullish action from late October 2023 until March 2024, but that did not match the price levels it had previously seen. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price will remain low. Will EOS reach $1? EOS’s immediate resistance level is at $0.59. In July, EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach the $1 level by the end of 2025 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2029. Will EOS reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly by 2032. Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—one blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $6 by 2030, but the speculations can change at any time.

We expect EOS to reach a maximum price of $1.23 during the year. EOS historic price sentiment In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with price mostly trending near $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month and the coin is trending near $1.1 at the start of December.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-05 13:59:00

During ann interview at the Emergence Conference in Prague on Dec. 5, Paolo Ardoino stated that Tether ( USDT ) has made more than $13 billion in profits. Tether currently has more than $135 billion in market cap and more than $6 billion in additional excess equity. Those funds are used to expand on Tether’s ever-growing stablecoin investment portfolio. “When the stable coin and the rest has been invested outside the preservers as a separate point of view from a separate company, called Tether investments have been invested in different areas,” said Ardoino. One of those areas is Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining. Ardoino revealed that he and the Tether team are “big fans” of Bitcoin mining and would like to actively participate in securing Bitcoin’s finite supply so that it does not become too decentralized. He admitted that Tether has invested in Bitcoin mining firms in smaller countries as well as in Central and South America. “With Bitcoin, we cannot rely on two or three companies to mine, to be 90% miners. And so we need to add additional forces from across the world to make Bitcoin safe. So that’s one of our main immature investments,” said Ardoino. You might also like: Major Bitcoin miners spent $3.6 billion on infrastructure Another area of interest for Tether is TradFi and coin trading. He said that Tether has initiated a few deals in the TradFi world and has acted as “a short term lender” for people in different operations. In addition, Ardoino said that Tether has been exploring the use of Tether for cross-border payments, specifically in commodity trading. He believes stablecoins can become a “game-changer” in the field of commodity trade as it can simplify the payment process immensely. Compared to regular credit transfers that usually take longer, USDT arrives much faster after being sent through the blockchain, and the payment will be confirmed in only a matter of seconds. “So that’s one of the areas where we are planning to dedicate a lot of resources because we can see how the USDT could be a game-changer,” said Ardoino. In addition, Tether has also been investing in a range of “small companies all around the world,” Ardoino added, with many of them located in developing countries within emerging markets. Other investments that Tether has continued from past dealings are the brain-computer interface tech company Blackrock Neurotech and AI infrastructure firm Northern Data Group.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio For 30-Day Traders Has Declined Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the trend in the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. The MVRV Ratio here refers to an indicator that keeps track of how the value held by the BTC investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value that they initially put in (the realized cap). Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin See Lack Of Euphoria: Why This Is Bullish When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the market as a whole is in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the investors. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio for the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather that of two specific holding ranges: 30-day and 365-day. The indicator corresponding to these ranges provides insight into the profit-loss breakdown of the monthly and yearly buyers of the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio for the 30-day and 365-day traders over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio for the 30-day investors had shot up to significant levels last month as the asset’s all-time high (ATH) exploration had taken place. Since the cryptocurrency has fallen to its consolidation phase, though, the metric has observed a cooldown. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted three zones for the indicator based on the historical trend. It would appear that the earlier increase had seen the metric surge into the ‘danger’ region, but with this decline, it’s now back inside the ‘healthy’ range. More specifically, the indicator has a value of 4.2% now, which is just inside the +5% to -5% range of the healthy zone. From the chart, it’s visible that the metric was last at this level on 26 November, just after which BTC observed a rebound. Generally, the tendency of the investors to sell goes up the higher amount of profits that they own, so high values of the MVRV Ratio can be a bad sign for the asset’s price. This is why the indicator being higher than 5% corresponds to the danger zone. Related Reading: Strong Bitcoin Rise “Expected Within 1-2 Months,” Quant Explains Why With the MVRV Ratio of the 30-day traders making a return into the healthy range, it’s possible that Bitcoin may be able to see a resumption of its rally or at least, avoid a further drop. The indicator for those who bought within the past year sits at more than 37%, but usually, investors who have been holding for so long don’t tend to sell easily, so these high profits may not be an immediate threat to BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $94,900, down 1% over the last week.

A tangled web of Russian intelligence operatives, cocaine traffickers, and cybercriminals funneled dirty money through London, Moscow, and Dubai, using crypto to dodge sanctions and mask their operations. The network was fueled by Tether’s USDT stablecoin, which basically served as the secret handshake between organized crime and geopolitical espionage. “Operation Destabilise” uncovered this sprawling underworld spanning over 30 countries, exposing the murky marriage between gangsters and governments. For Russian spies and sanctioned elites, crypto became a lifeline. For drug cartels and ransomware gangs, it was the perfect tool to clean up piles of illicit cash. From cocaine cartels to Kremlin agents At the heart of the scheme were two companies—Smart and TGR. These guys reportedly acted as financial hubs for criminals who couldn’t rely on traditional banks. Cocaine traffickers like the Kinahan cartel, infamous for contract killings, moved their cash into this pipeline. Meanwhile, Russian intelligence agencies leaned on the same network to sidestep sanctions and fund espionage. It was a dirty money laundering machine that worked with ruthless efficiency, leaving no trail for investigators to follow—at least until now. Here’s how it worked. Criminals in countries like the UK handed over physical cash to couriers. That cash was then processed through businesses linked to the network. The equivalent value was provided in crypto, often in different countries, making the money virtually untraceable. USDT became the favored currency, replacing Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, USDT is stable, pegged to the US dollar, which means criminals didn’t have to worry about value fluctuations while their shady deals played out. Rob Jones, the NCA’s director-general, described the operation as the most significant money laundering case they’ve ever handled. “It’s McMafia meets Narcos,” he said. A global web of illicit deals The NCA’s investigation revealed just how deeply entrenched this network was. Over a four-month period, the operation collected cash from 55 locations across the UK, including England, Scotland, Wales, and the Channel Islands. TGR and Smart facilitated these collections, allowing 22 criminal groups to clean their money. The Russian state-run media group RT, already sanctioned, used the same network to secretly fund a UK-based Russian-language media organization. If that wasn’t enough, the crypto pipeline also allegedly helped Russia acquire Western technology for its invasion of Ukraine. Garantex, a crypto exchange sanctioned by both the UK and US, featured prominently in this sordid tale. Transactions linked to Garantex were tied to weapons components for Russia’s military. The scale of money laundering in the UK alone is staggering. NCA officials estimate that over £100 billion is laundered through or within the UK every year, with £5 billion of that involving crypto. The COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated the problem. The NCA seized £20 million in cash and crypto and arrested 84 individuals. Among them was Ekaterina Zhdanova, a Moscow-based businesswoman who ran TGR. Known for gracing the covers of Russian business magazines, Zhdanova allegedly funneled over $100 million to the UAE for a sanctioned Russian oligarch. She also bypassed “know your customer” checks to purchase British properties. Currently in custody in France, Zhdanova has become the face of this scandal. But she wasn’t alone. TGR’s leadership included George Rossi, Elena Chirkinyan, and Andrejs Bradens, all sanctioned by the US Treasury.

In an effort to fill the critical infrastructure necessary for users to transact globally with merchants instantly, Holyheld’s BRRR protocol aims to connect public blockchain networks, traditional payment, and card networks to create a global layer of real-time payments. “This opportunity consolidates our lead in the market, and fuels our drive to redefine how real-time clearing of payments should work,” said Anton Mozgovoy, Holyheld CEO. “With our technology of global stablecoin orchestration, we’re well-positioned to transform how users and businesses conduct business today with payments of tomorrow.” BRRR’s protocol is used to power Holyheld’s app, a leader in the European market in the segment of Web3 payments apps, which offers a cash account with a debit card available to residents of 30 European countries. Users of the Holyheld app can connect any self-custody wallet and use their cryptocurrency for daily purchases. This enables traditional consumer behaviors, like swiping or tapping a credit card or mobile device for payment, while users maintain self-custody of their funds. “This funding is an essential step as we work towards our vision of enabling crypto customers and fintechs to build new payment settlement and reconciliation solutions using crypto.” Dr. Anton Zagorodnikov, Holyheld co-founder and CTO, added. The new funding will allow Holyheld to continue expanding the protocol to more clients and payment networks globally. Holyheld has integrated over one hundred leading crypto protocols across 15 blockchain networks. The company’s BRRR has also orchestrated over $100M in volume since its launch in April of 2023. “Holyheld turns any self-custody wallet into a personal IBAN and a debit card, which enables users to have a frictionless digital wallet experience,” said Chris Abshire, principal, Toyota Ventures. “We are excited to work with Holyheld’s team as they build the leading on-chain clearing house.” To learn more about Holyheld, users can visit https://holyheld.com/ or https://holyheld.com/BRRR About Holyheld Founded in 2022, Holyheld is committed to enabling crypto customers and fintech to build new payment settlement and reconciliation solutions using stablecoins.

Both of these altcoins are primed to run hard. That said, all eyes are still on Bitcoin. As soon as Bitcoin pauses in its latest upside bid, look for $ETH and $SOL to do some serious catch-up. $ETH breaks out of 2-year triangle Source: TradingView The $ETH (ETH/USD) price is already doing much to reverse the long period of relative inaction relative to the extraordinary feats of $BTC. A breakout of a triangle in force since late 2021 is definitely a fillip to the $ETH bulls. There is still the rest of this week to go before this breakout is confirmed, but things are looking very good so far. The next target for the bulls is to make a higher high, which the price is not very far from doing. That said, the current level is very strong resistance. $4,860 is the all-time high if this can be held above. Have $ETH bulls finally arrested the slide against $BTC? Source: TradingView Looking at the $ETH price against its $BTC pair (ETH/BTC) it can be seen that $ETH still has much to do. It appears that the $ETH bulls may have arrested the slide at the 0.036 BTC horizontal support, but the descending channel must be broken to the upside. $SOL breaking out of bull flag Source: TradingView The $SOL (SOL/USD) price is currently breaking out of a bull flag. This is in the daily chart, so the bulls will need to keep the price above the top trendline of the flag until close of play on Thursday for this to be a confirmed breakout. The measured move for the flag is to $330. $SOL about to resume uptrend against $BTC Source: TradingView The $SOL price against its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC) has much more potential than the (ETH/BTC) pair. It can be seen that despite a terrible bear market for $SOL, when it lost 90% of its value against $BTC; this bull market has seen $SOL record some great gains against $BTC so far. The price is currently traversing sideways within a wedge pattern. Given that the price entered the pattern from below, and the trend is up, it might be expected that $SOL breaks out against $BTC at some point. Currently near the bottom of the wedge, a bounce from here could send the price back to the top of the wedge and that potential breakout.

Developed by a global team of 13 passionate builders, Evrloot offers a rogue-like, light-MMO experience in a medieval fantasy world, combining deep gameplay with innovative on-chain mechanics. Evrloot distinguishes itself from most Web3 games with a unique approach: Build a fun on-chain game first, talk later. The game empowers players by treating NFTs as save games, making progress and achievements tangible and tradeable on-chain. Players’ in-game experiences—whether mastering fishing or crafting a powerful weapon—are captured as soulbound or equipable ERC-6220, essentially NFTs 2.0 that can be seamlessly accessed across ecosystems, ensuring every victory stays with the players. Players will have the opportunity to explore idle missions, tactical auto-battler dungeons, and on-chain crafting systems. Key features include: Idle Missions: Players can deploy special bait to send their character on a six-hour fishing expedition, offering the chance to discover rare items. Crafting: Resources such as fish and herbs can be combined to mint health potions. Tactical Dungeons: Players equip their loot to navigate dangerous dungeons. Only those who exit safely keep their spoils, which are minted on-chain. NFT Trading Marketplace: Valuable items, such as a ‘Damaged Battle Axe,’ can be exchanged for health potions and other resources through the game’s native marketplace. Evrloot began as a passion project from Polkadot fans who believed NFTs could do more than just exist as collectibles. The game has grown steadily during its beta phase, recording over 1.5 million on-chain transactions on Kusama and Polkadot and fostering a community of around 400 NFT owners. It peaked at 1,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) during the successful “Pink Event.” For the full release, the game will launch on Moonbeam, with a seamless onboarding experience featuring wallet and gas abstraction. Evrloot’s launch prioritizes accessibility. Players can dive into the full gameplay experience without barriers—no crypto wallet or upfront payment required. As they progress, players have the option to upgrade their free-to-play characters to NFTs for enhanced features. However, the game ensures that free players enjoy the complete experience without any pressure to upgrade. Tobi “Deckard” Amann, CEO of Chainfood Studio, the developers of Evrloot shared, “Our goal with Evrloot is to create an immersive and thrilling Dark Fantasy Web3 world that prioritizes fun and player enjoyment, transforming the world into a canvas for its players. Through their in-game actions, players shape the story and forge the lore of this world. As RPG enthusiasts, creating a canvas like this has always been our dream—and with Evrloot, we’ve found an exciting and ethical opportunity to bring our vision fully on-chain.” “I am very excited to see Evrloot enter its next growth phase. Chainfood studio has a very special game in Evrloot with a fiercely loyal community – moving to a Free-To-Play model will give them a lot more exposure and will allow a lot more players discover what makes this game so special.” said Sicco Naets, Head of Ecosystem Development at Moonbeam. Evrloot’s player onboarding uses a gamified affiliate campaign. Players join in-game clans that link back to the affiliates that brought them to the game. Being part of an active in-game clan not only shows player alliance with existing communities, it boosts the points they can potentially earn that are important for Phase II of the campaign. Players join for free and can optionally upgrade to one of 1299 exclusive NFT 2.0 Characters. With freemium upgrades, cosmetics, and marketplace fees driving the business model, Evrloot offers a sustainable economy without compromising the player experience. While Evrloot operates without a token at launch, players are able to gather Points by completing tasks and referring friends. Evrloot will also run a giveaway campaign to coincide with the game’s launch. Players who participate in specific in-game activities will have the chance to win 1 of 3 exclusive merch packs featuring original hand-drawn concept art on hand-made medieval paper, an Evrloot T-shirt, and stickers. Players can enter by joining the “🐂⭕️” clan for at least one day between the release date and December 21st. Winners will be drawn on December 21st and contacted via X (if linked in-game).

This purchase was made between November 25 and December 4, 2024, utilizing proceeds generated from the company’s at-the-market (ATM) offering. The acquisition occurred at an average price of $96,779 per Bitcoin, including related fees and expenses. Semler Scientific Purchases Additional 303 BTC For $29M, Boosts Holdings to 1,873 According to a recent press release , Semler Scientific has expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the purchase of 303 Bitcoins for $29.3 million. These acquisitions were made during a 10-day period ending December 4, 2024. They reflect an average acquisition price of $96,779 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. Following this purchase, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings have grown to 1,873, valued at an aggregate purchase price of $147.1 million. The company’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy will leverage its capital markets activity to increase digital asset holdings. Most recently, the healthcare company announced the acquisition of 297 Bitcoin for a total of $29.1 million between November 18 and November 22, 2024. This brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,570 BTC, valued at approximately $117.8 million. The company purchased these Bitcoins at an average price of $97,995 per BTC, including related fees. ATM Offering Fuels Bitcoin Purchases Notably, to fund its recent Bitcoin acquisitions, Semler Scientific utilized proceeds from its ongoing at-the-market (ATM) offering. On November, the company filed a prospectus supplement to its existing registration statement, increasing the total offering to $100 million. As of December 4, 2024, the company has generated $79.8 million in gross proceeds through this ATM offering. This is being managed under a Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. The additional funding supports the recent Bitcoin purchases and positions the company to further execute its corporate initiatives. Consequently, Semler Scientific has managed to acquire substantial Bitcoin holdings while maintaining liquidity. In addition, Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield, a performance metric that evaluates the return on its BTC acquisition strategy. From October 1 to December 4, 2024, the company reported a BTC Yield of 54.7%, while the cumulative yield since adopting its Bitcoin treasury strategy in July 2024 reached 78.7%. This performance metric underscores the company’s approach to increasing shareholder value through Bitcoin investments. The reported BTC Yield reflects the alignment of its acquisition strategy with market dynamics and capital generation efforts. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $103,242, up 7% in the past 24 hours. Its market cap has reached $2.04T, with a 24-hour trading volume of $132.57B, marking a 116% increase. The price rebounded strongly from $95,980 to over $103K, maintaining upward momentum. Following the recent BTC rally, Bitcoin adoption has been on the rise, with more companies integrating crypto into their corporate strategies. Worksport, a US-based manufacturer announced its decision to adopt Bitcoin and XRP as part of its corporate treasury, with the company set to purchase up to $5 million in these digital assets.

Quaglini said during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) surge past the $100,000 psychological barrier marked the beginning of its institutional phase, following earlier technological advancements and the retail boom after exchanges became established. He predicted that mass sovereign demand for BTC would drive the cryptocurrency to even greater heights. Quaglini foresees fierce competition among the world’s 195 countries once Bitcoin gains widespread acceptance in the U.S. Trading data shows that 75% of BTC’s circulating supply is inactive , highlighting long-term holding strategies by current buyers. This scarcity could trigger “fear of missing out among nations aiming to acquire the $2 trillion crypto asset. You might also like: President Trump confirms Paul Atkins as top pick for SEC chair Bitcoin reserve race Quaglini’s remarks align with sentiments from industry executives and analysts who believe U.S. Bitcoin adoption has dispelled lingering reputational risks around the cryptocurrency. Nominations like Paul Atkins for Securities and Exchange Commission chair and news of a crypto czar post in the White House have further fueled BTC optimism for a Trump 2.0 administration. Sovereign governments increasingly looked toward BTC as President-elect Donald Trump and American policymakers moved to create strategic reserves. Chamber of Deputies member Eros Biondini proposed allocating 5% of Brazil’s national foreign investment treasury to BTC. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin described Bitcoin as unstoppable and censorship-resistant. The nation legalized BTC as property and has standardized crypto mining. Polish presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen pledged to establish a national BTC reserve, if elected, as crypto.news reported in November. The Bitcoin “gold rush” foreseen by Quaglini may have begun its first lap before 2025, and local jurisdiction could join the jockey. Previously, Satoshi Act Fund founder Dennis Porter said over 10 U.S. states advanced toward BTC reserve laws. Vancouver Mayor Ken Shim also submitted a bid to buy BTC with the city’s treasury.

Dawgz AI emerges as the new crypto sensation, sparking comparisons to Dogecoin’s meteoric 2021 rise Table of Contents The Dogecoin story Dawgz AI: Poised to follow Dogecoin’s footsteps How to purchase Dawgz AI Conclusion The cryptocurrency market has been dominated by tales of unbelievable gains, where every bull run spotlights a token stealing the show. Dogecoin (DOGE) went from a humorous meme coin to a financial phenomenon in 2021, delivering life-changing rewards. All eyes are now on Dawgz AI (DAGZ), a new contender that is drawing comparisons with Dogecoin’s explosive rise. Can Dawgz AI really be the next meme coin to turn a modest $1000 investment into a staggering $2.8 million like DOGE? You might also like: The path to AI: Decentralized, embodied, and on-chain | Opinion The Dogecoin story Dogecoin, which emerged in 2013 as a joke inspired by the “DOGE” meme featuring a Shiba Inu, shocked the world by reaching a market cap of $62 billion in 2021. The meme coin’s price skyrocketed after Trump won the U.S. presidency, closing at $0.42191 on Dec. 1—a stunning 82,073% gain from the time it was created. Dogecoin’s price may continue its strong upward movement when Bitcoin passes $100,000 since the two have a correlation coefficient of 0.98 . According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X (formerly known as Twitter), Dogecoin is poised for a massive 2,400% rally against Bitcoin. This would lead to massive returns for those holding DOGE, especially early investors. Dawgz AI: Poised to follow Dogecoin’s footsteps Much like the early days of Dogecoin, Dawgz AI positions itself as the breakout meme coin of 2024. By combining the power of artificial intelligence with the fun, community-driven meme culture, DAGZ is here to change the game in the meme coin space. The token applies AI to help users maximize their crypto returns and allows for a very interactive and engaging community. Dawgz AI’s unique approach By leveraging AI, DAGZ has created a sophisticated trading system that is able to analyse the market and only execute high-probability trades. This technology is designed to assist investors in generating returns without the necessity of continuous monitoring the market, thereby addressing one of the main challenges associated with cryptocurrency trading. The token’s presale, which launched on November 14, raised an impressive $260,000 by November 30, highlighting the project’s potential. Currently priced at $0.00177, the token is expected to rise to $0.00702 once it launches on major exchanges, giving early investors the chance to position themselves for significant gains. Sow the Seeds of your Future now⏳ Reap the Rewards at Launch 🌱 pic.twitter.com/28qdJeOXfc — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) November 27, 2024 Dawgz AI’s token distribution and community focus Dawgz AI has its tokenomics planned to lead to long-term growth: 30% of the total supply is allocated for presale, 20% for staking rewards, 10% for liquidity pools, and 24% for marketing. The project gives out 15% to the community in the form of rewards and puts 1% toward its foundation. Such distribution ensures a balanced approach, rewarding early adopters while creating visibility through creating an active community. DAGZ fosters community engagement by organizing meme contests and events that give users a sense of belonging and encourage them to actively contribute to the development of the platform. This will not only increase user loyalty but also allow innovation as the platform evolves in line with the needs and creativity of its community. Dawgz AI’s smart contract was rigorously audited by SolidProof to identify vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and potential security risks before it was deployed on the blockchain. With its innovative use of AI and strong community engagement, Dawgz AI is positioned to follow in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. As the meme coin landscape continues to evolve, DAGZ could be the next breakout token, transforming modest investments into substantial rewards. How to purchase Dawgz AI Interested investors can participate in the presale by connecting their wallet on the Dawgz AI website and then buying DAGZ tokens using ETH, USDT, SOL, BNB, or USDC. After the presale has ended, users can claim their tokens in their wallets. Users who are interested in staking can stake their tokens before claiming. Simply press the buy button and stake. Keep an eye out for announcements on token listings and exchange partnerships to maximize investment. Conclusion In 2021, DOGE showed the world how strong meme coins can be. Now Dawgz AI looks ready to do it all over again. Dawgz has an AI-powered smart trading system and a supportive community that makes this a fantastic opportunity for any investor wanting to find the next big cryptocurrency. Having had a strong start, a presale that already raised a lot of money, and an extremely bright future ahead, DAGZ is likely the one that would turn a $1000 investment into $2.8 million.

Prosegur Crypto’s strategic expansion into the Latin American crypto asset custody industry has reached a key milestone, as revealed in a detailed press release to Cointelegraph in Spanish. The newly built facility is intended to provide both digital and physical security for institutional assets, reinforcing Prosegur’s commitment to embrace the evolving and increasingly important trend of crypto asset management in the region. Prosegur Crypto: leading the way in digital asset security Prosegur Crypto, Prosegur Cash’s institutional digital asset custody branch, has adopted strict high-security standards in its newly inaugurated bunker. This facility was precisely built with a dual focus on physical and digital security, resulting in a strong environment for the protection of precious digital assets. This modern bunker in Buenos Aires enhances Prosegur’s current facility in São Paulo, Brazil. This positioning strategically places Prosegur as a top provider of comprehensive crypto custody solutions in Latin America. Prosegur has received official approval from the Argentinian National Assets Commission (CNV) to operate in the country, coinciding with the debut of the Buenos Aires Bunker. This essential regulatory authorization strengthens the company’s commitment to compliance and operational legitimacy. Prosegur’s successful navigation of the complicated regulatory landscape demonstrates its commitment to providing a secure and trustworthy environment for crypto asset custodianship. Prosegur’s hybrid approach to crypto custody Prosegur’s novel security strategy incorporates many levels of protection, combining offline physical infrastructure with military-grade cryptographic security procedures. This architecture is intended to provide optimal protection against a wide range of potential dangers. According to corporate spokespersons, private keys connected with crypto assets will be securely housed within the facility’s reinforced grounds, considerably reducing the risk of cyberattacks, which have become increasingly common in today’s digital landscape. This hybrid security strategy distinguishes the Buenos Aires crypto bunker as a one-of-a-kind and extremely secure institutional digital asset custody solution in the Argentine market. Prosegur Crypto’s Executive Chairman, José Ángel Fernández, highlighted the facility’s strategic significance. “With this crypto bunker, we reinforce our position as leaders in digital asset custody in Latin America, offering a solution that combines our extensive expertise in physical security with cutting-edge technological innovation,” he said. This powerful message demonstrates Prosegur’s constant dedication to upholding the highest industry standards and leading the way in safe and effective asset management methods. Prosegur Crypto and Argentina’s digital transformation The debut of the crypto bunker aligns with the substantially increased popularity of cryptocurrencies in Argentina. According to Chainalysis’ report, Argentina ranks 15th internationally in the use of crypto assets, indicating a significant and developing trend in the country’s financial behaviour. The country’s continued challenges with high inflation rates and significant currency instability have prompted both individuals and businesses to seek other financial solutions, such as digital assets, which are regarded to be more stable and reliable. However, Prosegur Crypto’s service is more than just custodianship; it also wants to assist the tokenization of a variety of physical assets, including precious metals such as gold, as well as a wide range of financial assets oriented at investors. The company intends to provide specialized services targeted to the specific demands of financial institutions, government organizations, and investment funds, ensuring a safe environment for properly managing and administering digital assets. This strategic direction demonstrates Prosegur’s comprehensive and forward-thinking approach to meeting the changing needs and difficulties of Argentina’s dynamic financial environment. The future of crypto custody The expanding legal framework governing crypto assets in Argentina, particularly under the supervision of the CNV, places Prosegur as an important ally for businesses seeking compliance in this complicated industry. This collaboration position is critical as a growing number of businesses strive to meet new legal requirements while also guaranteeing the security of their digital assets. Prosegur Crypto strives to make compliance transitions more seamless, establishing an environment in which innovation and regulatory adherence can coexist efficiently, ultimately benefiting all parties. As bitcoin use grows and there is a growing emphasis on security measures, Prosegur is well-positioned to maintain its leadership position in the Latin American digital asset environment. Prosegur’s recent entry into Argentina with its comprehensive crypto asset custody solution reflects more than simply the company’s dedication to meeting the pressing demands of a fast-evolving financial environment. It also highlights the huge and growing interest in cryptocurrencies, as well as the continuing regulatory reforms influencing the future of digital banking in the region. Prosegur Crypto is positioned to take the lead in this disruptive journey, assuring the security, compliance, and innovative growth of digital assets across Latin America.

Market experts and analysts are discussing factors that led to the historic move and speculating about how high bitcoin can go, given the current state of the market. CryptoPotato received remarks from analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex and the on-chain analytics platform Nansen. Additionally, founders of traditional finance firms heavily invested in the leading digital currency dropped their opinions on the win. Analysts React to BTC Above $100K According to Bitfinex analysts, the halving earlier this year influenced bitcoin’s move past $100,000. Following the event in April, BTC supply was reduced by half, as was its emission rate and inflation, leading to a slow supply shock. The United States Federal Reserve avoided a “plausible recession” and a major job market crisis, contributing to bitcoin’s ascent to $100,000. To Bitfinex analysts, preventing a real estate collapse despite rising housing loan default rates added to macroeconomic stability, creating a favorable environment for BTC to thrive. Another factor is Federal Reserve Chairperson Jerome Powell’s comparison of BTC to gold at the New York Times DealBook Summit on December 4. He said the leading cryptocurrency competes with the precious metal, not the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin Short-term Target at $112k Top on the list is the emergence of the crypto-friendly Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States. During his campaign, Trump took a pro-crypto stance and won over the digital asset community. Now, he has appointed the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nansen’s Principal Research Analyst, Aurelie Barthere, said Atkins’ nomination helped bitcoin’s last leg to $100,000. As BTC continues its surge, Bitfinex has placed its short-term target at $112,000 – the asset was worth $101,820 at press time. Analysts asserted that trading activities will decline over the holiday period; however, the market will continue to see long-term holder distribution. From Nansen’s perspective, December’s positive seasonality should prevent any major corrections in bitcoin’s price. However, traders’ expectations could be disappointed if Trump prioritizes tariff and immigration-related policies after his inauguration on January 20. Regardless, Richard Teng, CEO of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, believes Bitcoin’s journey to $100,000 is a testament to how bold ideas can shape the digital future. Cathie Wood, founder of the asset manager Ark Invest, said : “Even after breaking through $100,000, bitcoin still is in early innings.” The post Experts and Analysts React to Bitcoin’s Surge Past $100K: What’s Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Adoption,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-05 15:48:29
37258474,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623286,1733413851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37258474.jpeg,Semler Scientific announces another 303 BTC purchase as price breaks records,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/semler-scientific-buys-another-303-btc/,"Corporate buyers for Bitcoin (BTC) have entered a streak, as the leading coin’s price is close to record levels. This time, Semler Scientific announced its latest purchase of 303 BTC. Semler Scientific is rising in the ranks of corporate buyers. As Bitcoin (BTC) set new records above $104,000, Semler Scientific announced its latest purchase. Announcements of corporate buying are made after the fact but still work to support the market sentiment. The company has taken up the model of buying BTC to achieve yield for its shareholders. Semler Scientific used its own cashflows to acquire a bigger BTC treasury. The company has also considered issuing debt or convertible bonds to acquire more BTC. After the latest purchase, BTC retained its new level for the day at $102,597.80. Semler Scientific’s purchase is relatively small compared to the latest additions of MicroStrategy and Mara Holdings but still signals a readiness for building bigger corporate treasuries. In the past four weeks, fundraising and BTC purchases accelerated, turning into a staple for boosting BTC sentiment. The latest MicroStrategy purchase happened as BTC dipped under $90,000, before continuing to its record rally. Unlike passive holders like Tesla, Inc., Semler Scientific also aims for yield for its shareholders, hinging on BTC’s appreciation. Semler Scientific is on track to join the top 10 corporate holders. Long-term predictions see almost all big companies adding some BTC to their treasuries. Semler Scientific achieves high yield, while shares rally Semler Scientific was formerly a medical technology company but pivoted to crypto ownership in May. The company has built up a relatively small treasury of 1,873 BTC. After the latest purchase, Semler Scientific achieved a cost basis of $78,553 per BTC. The latest purchase was completed at an average price of $96,779 per BTC. The new addition follows purchases by MicroStrategy and Mara Holdings , expanding the trend of yield-bearing BTC treasuries. Semler Scientific has achieved a higher yield of 54.7% to date. Semler Scientific is a relatively late arrival to the BTC buying game and has a higher cost basis. The rising BTC price, however, is not slowing down corporate buying. Instead, most of the top 20 corporate holders have updated their treasuries in the past few days. Joining the corporate holder trend had a double effect on Semler Scientific. The company’s shares rallied from a low of $23 in September, up to their current one-year peak of $63. SMLR is still far from its post-pandemic high of $149.99. Most corporate stocks tied to BTC purchases have rallied by 100% with ease, based on adopting MicroStrategy’s playbook of buying more BTC. Semler Scientific is one of the few entrants from outside the selection of mining companies. Backed by BlackRock and Vanguard, the company did not hesitate to raise another $50M share sale in November, in preparation for more BTC purchases. Corporate buying adds to bullish sentiment The recent corporate buying spree is adding to the bullish sentiment of the latest BTC rally. While the purchases are not gigantic on the scale of traditional finance, they are creating a supply crunch for BTC. Easily available BTC for big transfers are becoming scarce, as more large entities are holding their coins closely. The recent corporate reserves combine with ETF buying and holding to create a new category of BTC owners. On-chain data shows whales hold a relatively small amount of BTC. On the other hand, as a whole, corporate owners are advancing in their control over the supply of 21M coins. In total, BTC in the hands of corporations, ETF, and large-scale government holdings, already covers 13.60% of all BTC. That scale of holding of more than 2.8M BTC already surpassed the miner reserves of 1.91M BTC. The amount is still relatively lower compared to Satoshi Nakamoto’s initial holdings, as well as supposedly lost or locked BTC. Corporate buying was already observed months ago, with warnings that retail traders may be selling too fast. After months of sideways trading for BTC, the year-end rally turned even more profitable for companies that built BTC treasuries.

These inflows in the last 72 hours follow a wider bullish turnaround in the market as coins shake off losses recorded at the start of the week. Tron’s momentum has increased analysts’ projections for an imminent altcoin season as early as January 2025. TRX attracted bulls as trade activity spiked in the ecosystem. The total crypto market cap gained 2.56%, surpassing $3.47 trillion, while volumes grew 21%. In the last 72 hours, TRON has been up 17%, taking its market cap above $28 billion. Daily trading volumes grew 116% which is a sign of bullish activity. Weekly gains for the asset stand at 28%, while monthly inflows rose to 47%. TRX is up 102% this year, consistently hitting levels not seen in several months. Why Is Tron Surging? Tron’s rise is due to several factors, including investments, its founder, and other activities. The token continued its positive tempo after Justin Tron announced a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance. The move sparked renewed interest in Tron as Donald Trump’s win soared market prices on the back of anticipated crypto regulations. “ We are thrilled to invest $30 million in World Liberty Financial @worldlibertyfi as its largest investor. The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and Bitcoin owes it to @realDonaldTrump! TRON is committed to making America great again and leading innovation. Let’s go!” Sun wrote on X. This remains the game changer for many assets as whales increase wallet holdings with speculation of growing adoption. Furthermore, Google searches for the asset are up threefold, with skyrocketing demand. Altcoin Bulls Await Season The crypto market is moving towards an altcoin season , usually characterized by capital flows from Bitcoin to other crypto assets. Multiple analysts have flagged spikes in top altcoins in the last few months as many break or test all-time highs. A major reason for this is the declining Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin’s dominance plunged below its two-year support as funds trickled into other assets. The rise of Bitcoin to new highs after Trump’s win led to profit-taking by several whales. Some assets were withdrawn, while others were converted to altcoins in anticipation of a bull phase. Although Ethereum struggles, XRP is up 21% this week, while Cardano surged 18% in the same time frame.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-05 15:57:27

By contrast, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown just 133% and 71%, respectively. Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s founder, pointed out how well the cryptocurrency has been doing, saying that traders often focus on short-term price movements and fail to look at the bigger picture of BNB’s growth story. Key Drivers Behind BNB’s Rally Robust DeFi Ecosystem on Binance Smart Chain The Binance Smart Chain ecosystem has gained significant traction, amassing up to $6 billion in total value locked , thus positioning it as the fourth largest DeFi platform in the world, after Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. Moving on to the BSC-based DEX protocols, the volume for the last 30 days was $9.91 billion, while the cumulative is $1.17 trillion. Deflationary pressure is supported through the consistent coin burns seen on BNB. To date, in the recent quarter, Binance burned 2.02 million coins. With this, Binance hopes that over a longer-term focus, the entire supply could taper down to just 100 million coins for scarcity, encouraging price appreciation in return. Utility Addition Through Stablecoin BFUSD The introduction of BFUSD has really increased the utility of BNB, Binance’s new 20%-yielding stablecoin. This new offering would attract investors and create fresh momentum for the coin. Regulatory Clarity Regulatory uncertainties, especially those surrounding Binance, have reduced. Changpeng Zhao recently settled all legal issues in the U.S. There are fewer market fears now, ensuring more stability for Binance and its coin, BNB. Technical Indicators Show More Upside The BNB technical charts indicate more growth ahead: Cup and Handle Pattern: The formation of the bullish pattern on the weekly chart points to a possible 70% rally toward $1,170. Murrey Math Lines: The movement of the coin above the “weak, stop & reverse” level could propel it to as high as $875. For now, however, if it drops below $625, the prediction will be void. Conclusion With strong fundamentals, robust technical indicators, and reduced regulatory concerns, BNB is well-positioned to continue higher. If the current trends continue, BNB could achieve new highs, targeting $1,170. Investors, however, should monitor key support levels to manage risks.",Blockchain|Altcoins|BTC|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-05 15:58:17
37258352,https://blockworks.co/news/sec-chair-nominee-crypto-past,1733414400,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,What SEC chair nominee Paul Atkins has previously said about crypto,https://blockworks.co/news/sec-chair-nominee-crypto-past,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto is “really exciting,” former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins said in a podcast interview last year. In that same interview, he noted that the FTX collapse just happened to occur in crypto but essentially, fraud is fraud. He compared Sam Bankman-Fried’s actions to Bernie Madoff’s. Aside from public appearances, it’s clear that Atkins — who, in case you somehow missed it, is officially President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to take over the SEC — is not only knowledgeable about crypto but has been active in the space for years. On paper, Atkins looks pretty pro-crypto, but I was curious to get some idea of who Atkins is and what he’s like. Which, of course, could give some readthrough on how he’d lead the SEC if he were to take the helm — which, as my colleague Casey Wagner pointed out — won’t be for a while because he has to get through the nomination process. The deal’s not done yet, so temper your expectations. He’s been a part of Securitize’s advisory board since 2019, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told me. “He’s definitely going to bring a different attitude toward the space that is less about enforcement actions and litigation and more about figuring out what’s the right regulation for letting this industry flourish,” he continued. Domingo knew of Atkins from his SEC days and from his work as co-chair for the Token Alliance which was launched by the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Atkins, Domingo said, is likely going to be “less controversial” and he’s more likely to have “a dialog with the industry participants to figure things out … Not having this animosity toward the industry, but somebody can sit with people and understand, you know, what needs to be done, so that there is investor protection and there is a certain type of regulation, but at the same time, the industry can actually grow.” In the Free the People podcast episode I mentioned above, Atkins said it was “too bad” that a lot of crypto companies “couldn’t comply” with the current rules “the way they’re written.” He also praised Hester Peirce, who he previously worked with. “If the SEC were more accommodating and would deal straightforwardly with these various firms, I think it would be a lot better” for crypto companies to work directly in the US instead of going overseas, Atkins said. While Domingo’s sad to be losing Atkins as an adviser, the US is gaining a “really good” potential leader of the SEC, he said.

The ETHA ETF from BlackRock and the FETH ETF from Fidelity are leading the charge. Together, they have brought in about $140 million. The support of major financial institutions is boosting activity and demonstrating that Ethereum is becoming popular in the conventional finance sector. This flood of capital demonstrates how Ethereum may unite centralized and decentralized financial systems. Analysts Anticipate Mid-Term Target Of $6,000 For Ethereum According to market experts, the level of support for Ethereum stands at $3,300. This is a safe place for investors to start because it strikes a good balance between risk and return. Analysts propose a mid-term price target of $6,000 in case Ethereum continues its ascent. Some analysts even anticipate a long-term price of $10,000. If #Ethereum $ETH experiences a pullback, keep an eye on the $3,300 support level — a potential buying opportunity.

This has raised the possibility of the foremost meme coin rallying to $16 in this market cycle. Dogecoin Price Replicates 2021 Bullish Pattern In an X post , Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price has repeated a similar pattern from the 2021 bull run . His accompanying chart showed that the pattern led to a massive god candle for Dogecoin in the previous cycle. In line with this, the crypto analyst raised the possibility of DOGE witnessing another god candle that will send its price to $16. Trader Tardigrade remarked that DOGE would be big, suggesting that the Dogecoin price could reach this price level. On several occasions, the crypto analyst has predicted that Dogecoin could reach this price target in this bull run . Recently, he stated that between $10 and $30 would be the top for the foremost meme coin in this market cycle. Meanwhile, he also stated that the Dogecoin price could reach $30 by March 2025 if it mirrors the 2021 bull run. Meanwhile, Dogecoin looks to share similarities to the 2021 bull run compared to any other cycle, which suggests that it could replicate the parabolic rally recorded during that period. Even before the DOGE bull run began, Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price was flashing the same pattern that led to the 28,000% surge in 2021. This projected rally to $16 in this market cycle remains possible. Besides Trader Tardigrade, crypto analysts like Ali Martinez have also indicated that Dogecoin can reach this $16 target. Martinez stated that the Dogecoin price could rise as high as $23 in this market cycle. He explained that this could happen if the foremost meme coin reached the 2.272 Fibonacci level. DOGE To $1 Is Imminent In the meantime, a psychological short to mid-term target for the Dogecoin price remains at $1, and crypto analyst Master Kenobi has predicted that DOGE will soon reach this target with Bitcoin above $100,000 . Based on his recent analysis, Dogecoin’s next leg to the upside could begin anytime now, as it has recorded a consolidation similar to the previous cycle. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also alluded to this consolidation period in the previous cycle while suggesting that the next leg up is loading. He noted that in the last cycle when the Dogecoin price had its first major leg up, it consolidated for 24 days after that move before recording another leg up to the macro golden pocket. If Dogecoin were to follow a similar path, he predicts that the next leg will start by the end of this week, and the meme coin will begin its rally to the macro golden pocket which is at $3.80 to $4. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.43, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoin News|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-05 16:00:18

Bitcoin, the market leader, is on a parabolic rally after surging past the $100,000 barrier for the first time on Wednesday. This represents a staggering 120% year-to-date return. But if ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood is to be believed, this is only the beginning. Bitcoin Is A “Much Bigger Idea Than Gold” In a recent post on the X platform, Cathie Wood, CEO and founder of ARK Invest, shared her thoughts on the recent appointment of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as the next U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair. Wood noted that Atkins will “free digital assets from Gary Gensler’s chokehold and protect private property rights in the digital world.” She also highlighted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently likened Bitcoin to gold. “It’s like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” Powell said on Wednesday. However, the ARK boss suggested that the notion of Bitcoin is bigger than gold, particularly because of its borderless nature. She quipped: “Indeed, ARK Invest believes that Bitcoin is a much bigger idea than gold.” Wood then compared Bitcoin to gold, noting that the precious metal boasts a $15 trillion market value. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a market capitalization of $2 trillion at press time — which signals that it has more room to grow. Bitcoin reached the highly coveted $100,000 milestone yesterday, over 15 years after its enigmatic inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, launched the OG crypto. “Even after breaking through $100,000, Bitcoin still is in early innings,” Wood asserted. Crypto-Friendly Trump 2.0 SEC Bitcoin’s upsurge to historic highs has in large part been spurred by Donald Trump’s historic presidential election win on Nov. 6. The pro-crypto President-elect has congratulated Bitcoin enthusiasts on the heels of BTC crossing $100K: “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Ending the SEC’s crypto crackdown by appointing a crypto-friendly person to replace Gensler was one of Trump’s promises to crypto voters on the campaign trail and a highlight of his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. The Bitcoin rally is expected to continue into 2025 as the crypto foe leaves office on January 20. It remains to be seen whether Trump fulfills his other promises of establishing a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve and dominating the crypto mining industry.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-05 16:02:30

Its price was worth $101,791 at press time, and it hit an all-time high of $103,587 just this morning. The only giants worth more than Bitcoin right now are Apple and Microsoft. The apex crypto has managed to surpass Amazon, Alphabet, and even Nvidia in terms of market value. The broader crypto market also saw a sharp increase, with its total capitalization climbing to $3.5 trillion. Bitcoin is taking it this year Bitcoin is up 140% in 2024, with nearly half of that growth occurring after the recent U.S. presidential election, with optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies expected under President-elect Donald Trump. The announcement of Paul Atkins as the nominee for SEC chair has been a driving factor in the $100,000 milestone. Atkins is a crypto advocate, a contrast to outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose tenure was aggressive. From its creation during the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin has defied critics, steadily building a foundation for adoption. Its original purpose, outlined in the Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create a peer-to-peer financial system free from centralized control. That vision is now resonating with major institutions. The bull run is also closely tied to increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. And Trump’s administration has laid the groundwork for policies that could further boost Bitcoin. Proposals include eliminating taxes on crypto transactions, creating a national Bitcoin reserve, and encouraging public crypto IPOs, so it’s justifiable that everyone is super bullish right now. Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital said , “Over the long term, I’m bullish. It won’t be a straight lineup, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.” Trump is also expected to announce who will be the first-ever White House Crypto Czar on Inauguration Day.

Trump Taps Crypto Supporter Paul Atkins To Lead SEC In Trump’s Wednesday announcement, he described Atkins as a “proven leader.” “He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of investors, and that provide capital to make our economy the best in the world,” Trump wrote. “He also recognizes that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before.” Atkins served as an SEC commissioner for six years (from 2002 to 2008) following his appointment by President George W. Bush. He will succeed outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who previously announced he’d step down on Jan. 20 when Trump is sworn into office as the next U.S. president. Ripple CEO Bradley Garlinghouse hailed Atkins’ appointment as an “outstanding choice.” Garlinghouse thinks that Atkins will bring “common sense” back to the Commission. “Along with Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto, restoring freedom of choice, economic growth, and innovation,” the Ripple boss added. Crypto Industry Highly Optimistic Amid Gensler’s Departure Current SEC czar Gensler has gained notoriety for his aggressive anti-crypto stance. During his tenure, the regulator unleashed a handful of enforcement actions against prominent crypto companies such as Binance , Coinbase , OpenSea , Kraken , and Consensys , among others. The SEC also categorized several major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), Cardano’s ADA, and Polygon (MATIC) as unregistered securities, drawing the ire of most crypto community members. Notably, crypto prices have been soaring following news of Gensler’s voluntary exit and Trump’s election victory. Moreover, filings for U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged after his resignation announcement, with Bitwise , WisdomTree , Canary Capital , and 21Shares all submitting applications to the SEC. Meanwhile, ahead of the incoming regulatory leadership transition, 18 states have lodged a lawsuit against the SEC and its current commissioners, including Gensler, over its crackdown on the crypto industry.",Cryptocurrency|News|Brad Garlinghouse|Ripple,EN,0,0,ADA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MATIC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-05 16:10:50

Chainlink price has strong technicals as it has just moved above the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. It has also formed a bullish pennant pattern, which is made up of a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. In most cases, this pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. LINK has formed a golden cross on Nov. 22, as the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages flipped positively. With these indicators, LINK’s next target could be $40, representing a 73% increase from its current level.

The company has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, now sitting on 1,873 BTC, with an average purchase price of $78,553 per Bitcoin. Between November 25 and December 4, 2024, Semler acquired 303 BTC for $29.3 million, averaging a cost of $96,779 per Bitcoin. This aggressive move is part of their broader strategy to integrate Bitcoin into their financial operations, which they claim aligns with shareholder interests. Semler Scientific has reported a 13.32% drop in short interest, with 892,000 shares now sold short, representing 13.28% of its tradable shares. Based on current trading volumes, it would take traders an average of 1.46 days to cover these positions. Funding the Bitcoin Buying Spree To fund these purchases, Semler leveraged an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering through its partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Initially, they aimed to raise $50 million, but later doubled the offering to $100 million. As of now, they’ve generated $79.8 million in gross proceeds, fueling their Bitcoin acquisition strategy. What is BTC Yield? Semler has introduced a unique metric called BTC Yield to gauge the performance of its Bitcoin holdings. BTC Yield reflects the percentage change in the ratio between Bitcoin holdings and outstanding shares. Since the company adopted its Bitcoin treasury strategy in July 2024, their BTC Yield has reached an impressive 78.7%, with a 54.7% boost recorded in the most recent period. However, BTC Yield isn’t a profitability metric. It doesn’t represent traditional financial gains but instead highlights how Bitcoin investments align with shareholder equity. Balancing Risks and Opportunities Eric Semler, the company’s chairman, expressed optimism about their crypto strategy, emphasizing its potential for long-term shareholder benefits. Beyond Bitcoin, Semler is also seeking approval for options trading on their stock, signaling a diversification of their financial approach. That said, the company acknowledges risks, including Bitcoin’s volatility and their reliance on equity sales to fund acquisitions. Moreover, Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy reflects an assertive stance in the crypto market, with an average purchase price of $78,553 per BTC.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI merges blockchain and AI to tackle key challenges like bias, scalability, and transparency, with its PoI consensus and AIVM. Table of Contents Overview What is Lightchain AI? Features Tokenomics Roadmap Pros and cons Conclusion Blockchain and AI are both phenomenal technologies, and the combination of these two holds the power to bring impactful change in the world. But just as there are opportunities, there are also several obstacles along this intertwined path. The first significant issue is that most AI systems are centralized and cannot be trusted with sensitive information. There’s certainly a possibility of data breaches and misuse. Second is the problem of bias . Most AI systems reflect the biases of their creators. A good example is how OpenAI’s ChatGPT responds to different political questions. A heavy bias is present in most, if not all, of the large LLMs that exist today. This is why governance and voting on the path forward of these models is important in maintaining a free and open ecosystem that isn’t bound by VCs and governments. Another problem is scalability. This issue seems to plague both AI and blockchain alike. And last but not least, there’s the lack of transparency. AI, unlike blockchain, is often not transparent , which discourages tech enthusiasts. However, there’s a new project at the intersection of blockchain and AI that addresses all of these issues — Lightchain AI. Let’s assess this project to learn more about its merits and demerits. Overview Website: https://lightchain.ai/ Blockchain: Lightchain AI blockchain Sector: AI and blockchain Token: LCAI What is Lightchain AI? Lightchain AI is a decentralized platform that integrates AI with blockchain. And it does this with the help of two programs. One is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), and the second is Proof of Intelligence (PoI). With the help of these two solutions, Lightchain AI aims to solve the scalability, privacy, and trust problems that currently exist in the crypto blockchain space. It also strives to help eradicate bias from AI models and LLMs. The team at Lightchain AI states that the platform provides an equitable, efficient, and privacy-preserving ecosystem for developers and participants. Let’s take a look at its features to gauge if these claims are true. Features Proof of Intelligence Proof of Intelligence is a consensus mechanism made to reward nodes for both providing resources to contribute to AI-intensive tasks as well as solving blocks. How does it differ from the popular Proof of Work or environment-conscious Proof of Stake? PoI gives incentives for contributions to AI development in the ecosystem. How does it work? First, the participating nodes receive modular AI tasks, according to their power level. Tasks include activities such as training machine learning models or running inference operations. Next, the nodes execute these tasks and produce cryptographic proofs, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). Then, the network checks these submissions using metrics such as accuracy or efficiency. Once these are validated, nodes are rewarded with Lightchain tokens. This method has a whole list of benefits. It is energy efficient, scalable and provides opportunities for nodes of different sizes and power capacities to take part. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine According to the Lightchain AI whitepaper, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine is a “specialized virtual machine that optimizes the execution of AI-specific tasks within the Lightchain AI ecosystem.” Basically, it’s a tool that has been built to handle complex AI tasks on the blockchain. This AI layer helps AI integrate well with blockchain, so that the whole program works in a smooth and effective manner. The AIVM also creates a secure and scalable environment for running AI models. This model even works with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. But, what’s most striking about this AI layer is that it is capable of evolving through the collaborative efforts of developers. In short, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine works like the heart of the ecosystem, pumping lifeblood to all the different parts of the system to make sure it’s all alive and kicking. Tokenomics The Lightchain Token ( LCAI ) is the token of the Lightchain AI ecosystem. This token is mainly used for three key purposes: Payment for AI tasks, staking for governance participation and access to premium AIVM features. The token distribution is carefully planned to support growth and avoid centralization. The total supply of tokens is allocated across different areas (see picture below). 40% of the tokens (4 billion LCAI) are reserved for the presale. 28.5% (2.85 billion LCAI) is dedicated to staking and rewards. 15% (1.5 billion LCAI) is set aside for liquidity and exchange listings. 6.5% (650 million LCAI) goes to the treasury and reserve. 5% (500 million LCAI) is allocated to the team. Another 5% (500 million LCAI) is for marketing and partnerships with Key Opinion Leaders. Lightchain AI also uses a smart economic design. When it comes to inflation control, initial inflation rates fund early ecosystem growth but decrease over time. The token burning mechanism is deflationary where a portion of transaction fees and AI task payments is burned. When it comes to pricing, gas fees for computational tasks are calculated dynamically based on task complexity and network load. Roadmap The Lightchain AI roadmap works in three key phases. In Phase 1 (Prototype Development), the team focuses on building the Proof of Intelligence consensus and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine. They also work on governance structures and community engagement. In Phase 2 (Testnet Rollout), the team conducts testnet deployment, performance optimization, and feedback gathering. The Testnet will act as a playground for developers who wish to perform bug bounties and other types of developer initiatives. Finally, in Phase 3 (Mainnet Launch), the team conducts the full activation of PoI and AIVM, and uses Validator and Contributor nodes. They also aim for partnership expansion. Currently, the team is in the Phase 1 phase of the roadmap. Pros and cons With its real-world utility, deflationary tokenomics and smart integration of AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI undoubtedly has a whole list of pros that attract both developers and investors looking for the next big thing. But are there any cons? While both the AIVM and PoI are exceptional feats of technology, they do appear to be overly complex. Lightchain’s PoI sits at the core of dividing work between nodes that join the network from computational AI tasks and solving blocks. The AVIM is a decentralized autonomous organization, which is similar to the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). However, the AVIM is upgraded and voted on based on the holder’s LCAI. While PoW and PoS offer rewards to miners who either stake ETH or provide resources, PoI solves two issues: an upgradable AIVM that is not static, and it resolves the centralization of the EVM by providing an AVIM, which is voted on upgrades by the token holders. Conclusion Lightchain AI is a blockchain ecosystem that runs on artificial intelligence. With smart solutions like the PoI Consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), the Lightchain AI team aims to create a more fair, open, and free AI model. Currently in its presale, the project is gaining considerable traction both on social media and in mainstream media.

According to an official release sent to CryptoPotato, Binance On-chain Yields will enable users to participate in on-chain protocols and earn rewards using their accounts on the crypto exchange. Binance Announces On-chain Yields With Babylon The new Binance feature will be kickstarted with the Babylon Bitcoin Staking product on December 10 at 10:00 UTC; however, subscriptions will be made available by 06:00 UTC on December 9. Babylon is a protocol that allows bitcoin (BTC) holders to stake their bitcoins and earn rewards. Babylon BTC Staking will launch with a limited quota of 1,000 BTC available to users on a first-come, first-served basis. Binance said the minimum and maximum subscription amounts per account are 0.05 BTC and 5 BTC, respectively. Users can earn rewards in the form of Babylon points by staking their bitcoins on the protocol. To celebrate the launch, users will enjoy an additional 12% in rewards tied to Babylon Cap-3 progress. Babylon Cap-3 refers to the third cap of the protocol’s Phase-1 mainnet scheduled for launch on December 10 and to run for 1,000 blocks on Bitcoin , which is roughly one week. Binance to Onboard More On-chain Protocols Binance intends to expand its on-chain yield offerings and is already working with more protocols. The exchange noted that this new feature will simplify access to on-chain protocols, eliminating the need for complex setups. “Users can explore high-yield opportunities to earn rewards in tokens, points, and more – all directly within the Binance ecosystem. By managing all on-chain protocol integrations and operations, Binance ensures a user-friendly and accessible process for everyone. Users can benefit from flexible redemption options with shorter processing times, enhancing convenience and accessibility,” the crypto trading platform said. Although Binance believes On-chain Yields provide a good opportunity for users to make more money, the entity warned that the offering is a high-risk product. There is no guarantee of principal or returns, the protocols suffer smart contract vulnerabilities and technical issues, leading to failure and asset loss, and market volatility could affect the yields. Meanwhile, Binance claims to be the first centralized exchange to offer the on-chain yields service.

According to the Bloomberg report, the job cuts impact under 6% of the workforce. Despite these reductions, the firm said that it remains committed to expanding geographically and improving efficiency and productivity through artificial intelligence (AI). In June, Circle reported employing 882 individuals. A spokesperson was quoted saying , “Circle regularly reviews our investments and expenses. This includes investing in teams and operational infrastructure that need to grow, while marginally reducing spend and some roles in other areas of the business.” Circle, however, has refrained from publicly confirming the development. Earlier this year, the fintech firm submitted a draft registration for an initial public offering (IPO) to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, keeping the filing confidential after a failed SPAC deal in 2023. In October, CEO Jeremy Allaire confirmed that Circle remains committed to its public listing plans and has no need to raise additional funds through private markets In a related development, Circle announced this week that USDC became the first stablecoin to meet the VRCA standards set by Canada’s OSC and CSA. These new rules aim to advance investor protection and regulatory clarity in the country’s growing crypto sector. Meanwhile, the stablecoin market has reached over $203 billion in value, according to CoinMarketCap data. This growth comes after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election as the Republican nominee triggering a market-wide rally. Tether’s USDT continues to dominate, holding a commanding share with $136 billion in circulation, reflecting its widespread use in trading and DeFi. Circle’s USDC follows with $41 billion, solidifying its position as a reliable alternative for institutional investors.

According to Ardoino, Tether’s market capitalization has risen significantly recently. This surge is somehow related to BTC flipping $100,000 . USDT: A Key Player in the Crypto Ecosystem Ardoino says Tether’s market cap grew by around $16 billion within three weeks. He maintains that a notable catalyst to the growth can be linked to the significant inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Tether CEO says the ETF market saw an uptick in activity as many institutional investors embraced Bitcoin after the U.S. election. Additionally, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy’s massive purchase of Bitcoin also supported the inflow. According to Ardoino, more investors snapping Bitcoin and investing in ETF products positively affected Tether’s USDT. Since Tether is the largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, many investors and traders have favored USDT. When moving cash from the traditional financial world into the digital crypto space, USDT is usually the medium for such transactions. This has supported stablecoin is growing rapidly in market capitalization. Ripple Effect on Bitcoin’s Success According to the report , Tether’s USDT recently soared past $200 billion per the total supply for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. USDT remains the most popular stablecoin globally and has benefitted from Bitcoin’s positive sentiment and bullish run. In the days after the U.S. election and Donald Trump’s victory , the price of BTC soared astronomically, and the psychological $100,000 price mark was tested for days. As many investors, including new entrants, flocked to profit from the bullish run, they had first to swap their cash for USDT. ETF Inflows Bolster USDT Meanwhile, Farside Investor data shows that from Monday till Wednesday this week, when Bitcoin finally breached $100,000, ETF products registered significant inflows. The total inflows on the days above were $353.6 million, $676 million, and $556.8 million, respectively. The data supports Ardoino’s explanation of how ETF products have supported USDT’s surge. At this writing, USDT is battling market volatility and trading at $1.00, a 0.01% rise in the last 24 hours. In earlier trading, the stablecoin had plunged to a low of $1.0001 before its rebound to its current level.

This comes on the heels of Grayscale’s interest in spot Solana ETFs and institutions citing reasons for Solana’s sustainability. New data from on-chain analytics firms show four whales moving assets off exchanges to other custodians, showing possible long-term holding plans. The first whale withdrew 18,500 SOL worth approximately $4.2 million from Binance. The second came a few hours later as a whale transferred 46,103 SOL worth $10.85 million to another custodian. Subsequently, another large holder moved 100,010 SOL worth $22.46 million from Binance. Finally, a few hours ago, a transfer of 20,897 SOL worth about $5 million was sent out of Binance. Overall, these four whales moved 185,510 SOL ($42.46 million) in the last 24 hours. This influenced many retail traders to pick up smaller assets in anticipation of price gains. Institutions Drive Solana’s Growth The rise of SOL this year has largely been driven by institutional investment. A glance at CoinShares Weekly Fund flows shows whales have leaned toward the asst compared to other altcoins. Solana has outpaced Ethereum this year despite the latter having more growth potential. Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF application also saw new upticks in the past day, with traders setting new price targets. A major reason for Solana’s activity surge is its growing meme coin ecosystem . Solana meme coins surged to a market cap above $19 billion as users rolled out new assets. The rising sentiments that followed Donald Trump’s win were another bull catalyst that spiked SOL’s price alongside other coins. Positive crypto regulations will attract global interest away from the current uncertain waters. Traders Set New Targets For SOL Solana’s price stands at $239 after soaring above 270% since December 2023. Consistent bullish drivers place the asset in the green zone on multiple periods. Crypto trader @cryptojelleNL wrote on X (formerly Twitter) Manson an incredible bull case scenario for Solana at $600. While this figure remains high, bull drivers and positive macro can push the asset to new highs. “ $SOL broke its previous ATH, and now forms a falling wedge right on top of the 25-day EMA.

In a post on X, Yakovenko noted that the upside of moving to the US is limitless for these startups. Although the crypto executive admitted that operating in the US comes with significant legal costs, he believes the US market has great potential, making it ideal for startups to thrive. He said : “You should prepare for moving your crypto startup to the US. The lawyers will still carve a pound of flesh out of your startup, but once the rules are clear the upside is unbounded. US is the largest unified free market economy in the world.” His comments reflect the current sentiments in the US about how the Donald Trump administration will be favorable to the crypto industry. These expectations have fueled a market rally that has seen Bitcoin surpass $100,000 for the first time, with many altcoins also soaring in value. However, some users believe that startups may not need to move to the US before they can attract users from within the country. Yakovenko did not fully agree with this opinion, noting that he believes regulatory clarity in the US could make it harder for offshore crypto companies to access the US market. Trump’s presidency is changing the US stance on crypto Meanwhile, several people agree with Yakovenko’s comments. Jeremy Allaire , the CEO of USDC stablecoin issuer, Circle, noted that that is why the company is relocating its global headquarters to the World Trade Center in New York City. This highlights how things have changed in the US in less than a month since Trump won the presidential election. Before then, the general sentiment among crypto stakeholders had been to leave the country for more favorable jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbeans. While some, such as Bittrex and Nexo, left the country completely, more notable US-based companies, such as Ripple, Gemini, Coinbase, Circle, and Kraken, all made efforts to expand abroad in 2023 and discussed their plans to leave due to the regulatory regime in the country. However, all these companies now appear focused on strengthening their base in the US market while waiting for the expected regulatory clarity that will come with the Trump Administration. For instance, Ripple is currently finalizing plans to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin, while Circle is reportedly planning to go public. Trump’s appointments boost optimism about regulatory clarity Despite optimism in the crypto market, several jurisdictions still have clearer and more crypto-friendly regulations than the US. However, all signs suggest that the US could soon rival other jurisdictions like Singapore and UAE in crypto-friendliness while boasting more liquidity. So far, Trump has already appointed pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman to replace Gary Gensler. Atkins, who was a Republican commissioner between 2002 and 2008, has been known to support the crypto industry. He has advocated for regulatory clarity within the US to prevent firms from leaving the country, and his appointment appears to be one of the catalysts for Bitcoin’s surge above $100,000. Meanwhile, Trump also appointed Scott Bessent, who has a history of supporting crypto, to become the Treasury Secretary. The appointment of these two individuals with pro-crypto leanings to key positions in government, coupled with the strong presence of pro-crypto Congress members, has boosted the confidence of industry stakeholders in the Trump administration.

Pepe Unchained (PEPU) raised $73 million on presale as the FOMO reached a fever pitch, and has now announced that it will be listed on crypto exchanges on Tuesday, December 10th at 2pm UTC. Initially that is expected to be Uniswap - follow the project’s Twitter (X) to be notified of the correct links to Uniswap or DEX aggregators like DEXTools and DEXScreener - beware of fake tokens that are listed before the official listing. As with any crypto ICO, admins will not DM you first - beware of accounts imitating admins which send unsolicited DMs. Pepe Unchained Presale: SOLD OUT! 🐸The token launch and claim will begin at 2 PM UTC on Tuesday, 10th December.Thank you all for joining us on this journey—it’s going to be a wild ride! pic.twitter.com/O6aMOfaha8 — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 5, 2024 A top-tier centralized crypto exchange is also reportedly set to be revealed alongside the DEX listing. Whales Buy PEPU Just Before ICO Sells Out Pepe Unchained has appealed to whales from the very start of its ICO. Back in July, a whale purchased $500k worth of PEPU in a single transaction. Similarly, another whale stacked over $220k worth of the meme coin in 4 separate transactions, data from Etherscan reveals. $50k buys in a single transaction were almost daily occurrences for Pepe Unchained. In mid November, a deep-pocketed investor swapped over $150k worth of ETH for PEPU. Just a few minutes later, another whale purchased $120k worth of the meme coin. That could bode well for its performance on exchanges once listed next week. Pepe Unchained Goes Viral In Closing Days of Presale 2024 has seen an influx of new meme coins, especially with the hype about the upcoming ‘meme coin supercycle’. Donald Trump’s re-election, Elon Musk’s continued backing of memes and meme coins and the Fed’s rate cuts have resulted in extreme bull market euphoria. Experts are also projecting an influx of retail investors as the Bitcoin price has now hit $100k and Dogecoin has also rallied close to its former ATH. With such a backdrop, even run-of-the-mill meme coins can deliver outsized returns. However, Pepe Unchained isn’t an ordinary meme coin. PEPU is a high-utility meme coin with many in-demand features. For instance, holders will soon be able to enjoy extremely low trading costs and instant transactions, features missing in most new Ethereum coins, thanks to Pepe Unchained’s Layer-2 chain. Pepe Unchained L2 Sneak Peek!What we're building is not just a new chain, but an entire ecosystem.🐸Pepe Unchained L2🐸Block Explorer🐸DEX🐸Bridge🐸Advanced Analytics🐸Builder GrantsPepe Unchained is coming. And it's going to shake up the crypto space. pic.twitter.com/ZVnvgO6MGF — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) September 26, 2024 This is the perfect formula to attract retail investment, along with the project’s staking pool which is currently offering passive income at an APY of 52%. Similarly, Pepe Unchained is launching a meme coin launchpad on Ethereum, a direct competitor to Solana’s Pump Fun. Builders on Ethereum no longer need coding skills or a development team to launch a high-potential meme coin. Pepe’s Pump Pad will do it for them in just two clicks. They can even apply for developer grants through a program called Pepe Friends With Benefits. Pump.fun has been a remarkable success and has launched billon-dollar meme coins like $GOAT and $PNUT. It saw nearly $80 million in revenue in November. ⚡ JUST IN: Pump. fun posts record $79M in November revenue, making up 35% of total earnings since launch. pic.twitter.com/AzjxTMc2AT — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) November 28, 2024 It’s possible that Pepe’s Pump Pad will see similar success, especially since Ethereum has a much larger user base as compared to Solana. Pepe Unchained - Next 100x Meme Coin? Several prominent crypto influencers are bullish on Pepe Unchained’s upside potential. For instance, YouTuber ClayBro, with over 130k subscribers, projects that PEPU could make ‘millionaires’. In another video, he expects that Pepe Unchained could be one of the best-performing meme coins of late 2024. Similarly, Nass Crypto, who has over 1 million YouTube subscribers, is impressed with the meme coin’s unique value proposition. His recent video has over 111k views. However, those who missed the presale will now need to buy Pepe Unchained on exchanges on Tuesday from 2pm UTC - follow the official socials for the correct links to Uniswap, DEXTools, DEXScreener and similar platforms to trade PEPU. Find its official Twitter here and Telegram here . To claim Pepe Unchained presale tokens, connect the same wallet used to buy the tokens on the pepeunchained.com website on December 10th, at 14:00 UTC.

(Author's note: In this Take , I offer an interpretation of recent events in Guatemala through the lens of someone on the ground in the country.) On November 10, the X account for El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office posted the following meme: The meme that spread like wildfire in Guatemala. It seemed harmless enough. I know I didn’t think too much about it when I came across it. I remember laughing when I saw it and then just going about my day. However, a week ago, a colleague of mine, a prominent Guatemalan Bitcoiner, shared with me that the meme went viral in Guatemala. And not just a bunch of retweets-type viral — more like wildfire viral. Many Guatemalans, particularly Guatemalan Bitcoiners, are fans of Bukele. So, when the Bitcoin Office jokingly signaled that Bukele is thinking of buying Guatemala, the reaction from many in the country was essentially “good.” This put the powers that be in the country on their heels, catalyzing higher ups in the Guatemalan government and at Guatemala's central bank to start researching Bitcoin. My source tells me it's possible that this could result in the Guatemalan government and central bank acknowledging bitcoin's value and offering proper guidance for banks and other institutions that may want to hold the asset on their balance sheets. I plan to speak with more people on the ground in the coming weeks to provide more substantial reporting. This article is a Take .

What a time to be alive! A cypherpunk experiment started as magic internet money is now the 7th largest asset globally, surpassing a $2 trillion market cap. But make no mistake — we're just getting started. 2025 will be the year of Bitcoin. $100K feels like the mere beginning. This is my 3rd Bitcoin bull market after entering in 2016. From experience, the party is still early. Here's why I think $100K Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg: Trump hasn't taken office yet. The next couple years, especially his first year, will likely bring very pro-Bitcoin and crypto regulations. The US hasn't started stockpiling BTC yet. When it does, it will put every country on notice to adopt bitcoin ASAP. Historically, the year after the halving pumps the most as supply shrinks. We're now post-2024 halving. You do the math. More public companies are adopting bitcoin treasuries. This trend will accelerate exponentially in 2025. Some US states have presented legislation to hold bitcoin in reserves. More are expected to follow. Putin is now actively talking about Bitcoin , passing pro-crypto laws in Russia and allowing national Bitcoin and crypto mining. Global adoption is brewing. With a pro-Bitcoin US President aiming to make America the global Bitcoin capital, you better believe we're going past the moon. Game theory says other nations must compete and buy BTC or risk irrelevance. So no, $100K isn't the ceiling. I'd be shocked if we don't surpass historical multiples this cycle, especially as nation-state adoption kicks into high gear. The show's just getting started. Happy $100K, but remember this is only the beginning, my friends. 2025 will be Bitcoin's breakout year as it cements itself as the global reserve asset. I'm incredibly bullish — keep holding on tight for the wild ride ahead! This article is a Take .

The historic climb followed brief concerns earlier in the day when a large amount of Bitcoin was transferred to exchanges, sparking fears of an impending sell-off. But those concerns were short-lived as Bitcoin quickly surged past the six-figure mark. Market analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s price is unlikely to drop below $100,000 in the short term, citing strong buy demand. “The order book shows strong support at $100,000 with over 4,600 BTC in buy orders,” said BRN analyst Valentin Fournier. “On the sell side, there are around 3,400 BTC in buy orders below $110,000, suggesting weaker resistance compared to the hurdle that needs to be overcome to break above $100,000.” Related News: Are Dogecoin and Other Memecoins Here to Stay or Just a Fad? Experts Give Their Opinion IntotheBlock Chief Marketing Officer Vincent Maliepaard explained that a notable “net inflow” of over 8,000 BTC worth around $860 million was seen on exchanges on Wednesday. Such moves typically indicate that investors may be preparing to sell or take profits at current price levels. “It is not yet clear how many investors will use this new high to take profits,” Maliepaard said. “We update this data daily and will have a clearer picture tomorrow.” *This is not investment advice.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 17:29:39

A successful rally could solidify DOGE’s position as a market leader in the altcoin space. However, failure to break resistance could lead to extended consolidation. For now, all eyes are on Dogecoin as it inches closer to a decisive move, potentially igniting fresh excitement in the market. Charts Suggests Dogecoin Is About To Run Again Dogecoin has been trading in a sideways range since November 12, with bulls struggling to regain the momentum that previously fueled its massive rally. This prolonged consolidation has left many investors questioning whether DOGE can reclaim its former glory. However, the broader market sentiment, driven by Bitcoin’s historic breakout above the $100,000 mark, offers a glimmer of hope. Positive price action across the crypto market suggests that Dogecoin may be gearing up for another significant move.

Its most recent rally saw an impressive 225% surge, capturing the attention of retail and institutional investors alike. With Bitcoin leading the charge, Dogecoin appears ready to follow suit. The meme coin’s resilience in maintaining its range and the improving sentiment across the market could set the stage for its next massive rally. Top analyst and investor The Crow has added to the excitement, sharing a technical analysis on X with a bold message: “Do not fade the father of all meme coins.” This statement highlights the growing optimism among seasoned traders who believe Dogecoin is positioned for a breakout. If DOGE can break out of its current range and reclaim momentum, it may continue its rally, setting new highs. However, failure to do so could result in extended consolidation or even a potential correction. The coming days will be critical as Dogecoin attempts to capitalize on the renewed market enthusiasm sparked by Bitcoin’s record-breaking performance. Can DOGE Reach $0.50 This Week? Dogecoin has been battling a stubborn 4-hour resistance at the $0.455 level, keeping the meme coin indecisive. Breaking above this resistance would position DOGE to retest the $0.48 local high, a critical level that could determine its next significant move. If bulls break above $0.48 and hold it as support, a massive breakout will likely follow, potentially propelling DOGE toward new highs. This scenario aligns with Dogecoin’s historical behavior during bullish market phases, where overcoming key resistance levels often leads to explosive rallies. The broader market’s strong momentum, led by Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000, provides an additional tailwind for DOGE’s bullish prospects. However, the risks of failure remain. If DOGE cannot break above $0.455 and $0.48, the price may remain stuck in its current consolidation phase. Extended sideways movement could test investor patience, and a potential correction could drive the price toward lower demand levels.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, during an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box , addressed Bitcoin’s recent surge, the Federal Reserve Chair’s comments comparing Bitcoin to gold, and the nomination of Paul Atkins to lead the US SEC. Bitcoin’s Status Evolves Amid Record Price Milestone Vlad Tenev remarked on Bitcoin’s transformation in perception over the last decade. “Bitcoin has gone from being ridiculed and ignored to now being taken very seriously,” he said. The cryptocurrency’s price exceeded $103,900, driven partly by growing institutional interest and regulatory shifts. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent comments about Bitcoin also fueled its momentum. Powell stated, “Bitcoin is a speculative asset, like gold, only virtual and digital.” He added that Bitcoin competes with gold, not the U.S. dollar, sparking optimism among crypto advocates who viewed this as a sign of growing legitimacy for the digital asset. Robinhood, which offers cryptocurrency trading, saw a 400% increase in crypto trading volume in November compared to the previous month. The platform processed over $30 billion in crypto transactions, highlighting the surging interest in digital currencies amid the recent price rally. Robinhood CEO on Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev also discussed the potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, who is seen as favorable to cryptocurrency even by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse . He compared Atkins’ nomination to the policies of the current administration, stating, “This administration has been hostile to crypto. Having people that understand and embrace it is very important for the industry.” Under the current leadership, the SEC has pursued strict enforcement actions against crypto firms. Tenev expressed optimism that the change in leadership could lead to more supportive regulatory frameworks. He emphasized the need to move away from “regulation by enforcement” and toward clearer guidelines for the industry. Vlad Tenev believes that the incoming administration, along with a Republican-led Congress, is more likely to support legislative changes that promote innovation in the crypto sector. He suggested that embracing cryptocurrency as a foundational infrastructure layer could unlock new opportunities for the financial system. Bitcoin and Strategic Reserve Discussions The idea of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has gained attention, with proponents arguing that it could play a role similar to gold reserves. Tenev referenced these discussions, noting, “A Bitcoin strategic reserve is something that gets people very excited, especially within the Bitcoin maximalist community.” The concept has gained traction as Bitcoin continues to be viewed as an alternative store of value. With its growing acceptance among institutional investors, some industry participants believe it could become a key component of national reserves. This shift is also reflected in growing institutional adoption. Analysts predict Bitcoin price could reach $120,000 by year-end if current trends persist. They attributed this to increased interest from institutions and the possibility of Bitcoin being considered for strategic reserves.

Announced in New York on December 5, 2024, N1 introduces a groundbreaking platform capable of supporting highly complex crypto applications with transaction speeds exceeding 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). N1 aims to redefine the blockchain landscape by focusing on scalability, multi-language development support, and application-centric features. The project is designed to make blockchain accessible for developers and to enable applications that were previously too computationally demanding for other networks. Developer-friendly tools to boost adoption A standout feature of N1 is its support for Typescript app development, with plans to incorporate other programming languages such as Solidity, Rust, and C. This multi-language compatibility significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers transitioning to blockchain technology. N1 also offers native tools tailored to streamline app deployment and management: Hub Wallet: Simplifies cross-application asset management. Wallet Widget: Provides a unified login experience across multiple dApps. Vercel-like Deployment Interface: Allows developers to launch and manage apps with just two clicks. These features aim to attract developers by delivering the same ease of use seen in traditional software deployment, making blockchain integration seamless. Innovative dApps coming to N1 N1 is collaborating with several teams to launch apps that leverage its computational capabilities: Susa: A perpetuals decentralized exchange (DEX) developed by Sushi, featuring Kubo, a novel AMM protocol. Amber Group’s Perpetual DEX: Offers innovative asset listings and deep liquidity. Mindshare: A social finance (SocialFi) app enabling users to trade crypto narratives. Onchain AI Simulation: A Westworld-inspired project designed for real-time AI-driven world-building. These applications are distinguished by their computational complexity, which makes them impractical on existing blockchains. N1’s architecture provides the infrastructure necessary to power such next-generation apps. High-performance infrastructure Originally developed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, N1 has evolved into a full-stack Layer-1 blockchain after Ethereum’s settlement layer proved to be a bottleneck for scaling. By replacing Ethereum with its own infrastructure, N1 can deliver transaction speeds up to 10-100 times faster than current blockchains. N1’s high-performance execution layer retains its L2 origins, having achieved 100,000 TPS on testnets. This scalability opens the door for dApps with unprecedented speed and efficiency, addressing a critical limitation of earlier blockchain platforms. Significant backing and proven expertise The N1 team has secured investments from high-profile backers, including Founders Fund, Multicoin, dao5, Kraken, Amber, GSR, and SALT. Prior to launching N1, the team developed a high-performance orderbook on Solana that processed over $500 million in trading volume, showcasing their technical capabilities and expertise. N1’s transformation into a Layer-1 blockchain signals a new chapter for blockchain technology, offering unparalleled computational power and a developer-friendly ecosystem. By enabling applications that were once deemed too complex, N1 is poised to drive innovation and expand the horizons of decentralized technology.

This forecast aligns with MicroStrategy’s ongoing strategy of intensifying its Bitcoin acquisition program, which has significantly influenced the company’s stock performance, linking it closely to Bitcoin’s price movements. Saylor Envisions Bitcoin Price Soaring To $13 Million Bitcoin has already reached a valuation of approximately $2 trillion, with its price hitting a new record of $104,000 on Thursday. However, Saylor anticipates an additional $200 trillion will be added to Bitcoin’s market cap by 2045, driven largely by global inflationary pressures. According to Saylor, many investors are moving away from traditional assets in favor of Bitcoin, viewing it as a viable global monetary asset. He asserts that as more capital flows into Bitcoin, its growth trajectory will outpace equities, gold, and real estate. Related Reading: XRP Downtrend Is Only Temporary: Analyst Gives Reasons Why Price Is Headed For $3.2 Delving into specific price predictions, Saylor posited that bitcoin could reach an astounding $13 million per coin. This would represent a 12,384% growth if Saylor’s predicted scenario comes to fruition, potentially making it the largest currency in the world. Saylor bases this estimate on an analysis suggesting that Bitcoin has historically grown at an average annual rate of 29%. This growth, he argues, could continue, leading to the projected valuation by 2045. NewsBTC previously reported that Saylor believes that Bitcoin represents only 0.1% of the global capital market, but he envisions that figure increasing to 7%. Saylor also provided a detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s growth trajectory, outlining a four-year projection with an average growth rate that might start at 44% and gradually taper down to 30%. Contrary to the perception of Bitcoin as a high-risk asset, Saylor emphasizes its potential as a safe haven for risk-averse investors, highlighting the increasing demand for security in investment choices. MicroStrategy Ramps Up BTC Acquisitions In a recent social media update, Saylor shared the company’s performance following three years of strategic Bitcoin investments. He announced that year-to-date, MicroStrategy’s treasury operations have delivered an impressive BTC yield of 63.3%, resulting in a net benefit of approximately 119,800 BTC for shareholders. At prices of $103,000 per BTC, this translates to an estimated $12.3 billion in returns for the year, positioning MicroStrategy as one of the most profitable and fastest-growing companies operating under the “Bitcoin Standard.” Related Reading: Don’t Fade Dogecoin! – Analyst Says DOGE Is About To Rally On Monday, MicroStrategy revealed that it has significantly ramped up its BTC acquisitions, surpassing the milestone of 400,000 BTC in its portfolio. The company sold 3.7 million shares of its stock, generating around $1.5 billion in proceeds immediately reinvested into Bitcoin. This marks the fourth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases by the firm. Since November 11, MicroStrategy has invested over $13.5 billion in Bitcoin across three separate transactions, bringing its total holdings to approximately $38 billion, or 402,100 BTC, at an average purchase price of $56,658 per coin. BTC trades at $101,628 at the time of writing, recording a 6% surge in the 24-hour time frame.

But as the expression goes, they saved the best for last: In the waning days of the year, bitcoin ( BTC ) hit six digits for the first time. The cryptocurrency surged past the $100,000 mark early Thursday UTC time, mushrooming from zero value into a $2 trillion asset in a little over a decade and a half. It's a milestone that was difficult to imagine not long ago. Just two years ago, the entire cryptocurrency space was reeling from the cataclysmic implosions of FTX , Celsius and the Terra-Luna ecosystem. In the eyes of the general public, a toxic cloud hung over the whole industry. Bitcoin sank to around $15,000 and, to many mainstream observers, was wheezing in its final breaths. Now, bitcoin has soared more than 500% from the desperate days of November 2022 when Sam Bankman-Fried's empire collapsed. A big difference between prior boom-bust cycles: Wall Street is firmly participating in this year's rally. The newly approved ETFs have lured institutions. Salesforces at mighty traditional financial giants like BlackRock are hawking crypto-related products. The soon-to-be U.S. president, Donald Trump, supports bitcoin and digital assets; he even has a DeFi project . Whether it’s long-term believers, newly converted enthusiasts or even heads of state, many are taking victory laps — and longtime skeptics and permabears are coping. Here's what prominent people are saying about BTC hitting $100,000: Donald Trump , U.S. president-elect: ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Mike Novogratz , CEO of Galaxy: ""$100,000 Bitcoin. A milestone that represents more than price—it’s proof of adoption, belief, and a community that has carried this revolution from 0 to 100. With world leaders leaning in and a generational wealth shift underway, this is just the beginning."" Peter Schiff , prominent gold and stock investor, and bitcoin skeptic:""It's ironic that bitcoin only hit $100K by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government. Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn't be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state."" Brian Armstrong , CEO of Coinbase:""If you bought $100 of Bitcoin when Coinbase was founded in June 2012, it would now be worth about $1,500,000. If you kept the $100 USD you'd only be able to purchase about $73 worth of goods today. Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the last 12 years, and it's still early days."" Anthony Pompliano , founder & CEO of Professional Capital Management: “What an epic milestone. … Bitcoin continued to be highly volatile, it went up a lot and it went down a lot too. There’s been multiple 30%, 50% or 90% drawdowns. That type of volatility would usually scare off many people. … It was one of the greatest selfless acts that I can think of.“ Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador He posted a screenshot of El Salvador’s bitcoin portfolio, then the “it ain’t much but it’s honest work” meme after Elon Musk called it impressive. Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group: ""We believe the Fed Chair’s comparison of bitcoin to gold is a significant development as it introduces another level of credibility to bitcoin as a major asset in global markets. The fact that gold is still about 10 times larger than bitcoin should offer additional insight into how much more room there is for bitcoin to grow from current levels."" Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares: ""Bitcoin has made unbelievable strides this year. Amid the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs, election of a pro-crypto administration — and specifically Trump’s recent appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chair — proposals for crypto-friendly legislation, and accelerated growth in the crypto ecosystem, BTC has more than doubled — all in a span of 10 months. This momentum has pushed bitcoin past $100K. This milestone is likely to attract a new wave of investors, as many who had been sitting on the sidelines watching bitcoin's ascent are now reengaging with digital assets, spurred by this historic breakthrough."" James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk: ""2024 has been an inflection point for bitcoin. We have witnessed the most successful ETF launch of all time. MicroStrategy issued the largest at-the-market offering in history of $21 billion. We are seeing more publicly traded companies issuing convertible notes in order to buy bitcoin. When bitcoin first broke $10,000, I thought the financial capital markets would change forever. I was slightly too early on my call. But $100,000 most definitely does."" Financial Times AlphaVille: ""Nevertheless, with bitcoin’s price recently crossing $100,000, a significant number of commenters seem to feel they deserve an apology in light of our longstanding cynicism, so here it is: We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up. And we’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too."" Allen Farrington , author/venture capitalist: ""In purely psychological terms, there is now no rational price between this and gold parity."" Preston Byrne, managing partner, Byrne & Storm: ""Price is an indicator, not an objective. This has always been the case and whilst adding another digit to the price is psychologically and symbolically significant, it is no more relevant to my day-to-day than 90k, 70k, or 50k before it. A rising price tells me [that] the wider markets are starting to also believe in longtime crypto believers' thesis in a fairly significant way. ... The expected end of the U.S. war on crypto business in the new year has driven a wave of optimism among current industry participants and new entrants. Regulatory normalization of crypto products in the world's largest economy was always a necessary prerequisite for widespread global adoption, and now it looks like we're going to get it."" Des Dickerson, CEO of Thundr Games: ""Bitcoin hitting $100K is a milestone that represents more than just a price point — it’s a testament to its growing adoption and resilience. It underscores the incredible potential of Bitcoin as the foundation for a new era of global, seamless digital payments. It's a signal to the world that we're building on solid, transformative technology that's here to stay. It's a perfect storm of hopium and recognition of Bitcoin's value prop as the most secure, decentralized, and globally accessible digital asset. How far will the price go next year? It's Bitcoin, so we should expect some bumps along the way. I am setting my sights on $200k, on our way to $1M!"" Andy Baehr , managing director, CoinDesk Indices:""It was a champagne moment, served at a champagne hour. At 9:33pm and 41 seconds, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index read 100,000. By 10:08:42, the current ATH of 103,633.70 was hit. Among blockchain assets, bitcoin stands to gain the least from improvements to regulatory pavement. It has futures, ETFs, and options. It is available widely in the United States and around the world. Bitcoin's adoption momentum, bolstered by a thoughtful mention by Fed Chair Powell and a news cycle rich with positive sentiment, helps more investors feel like they've waited long enough; it's time to get involved. Optimism about better, more dedicated regulatory agencies and support have been a boon for ""future-of-finance"" blockchain assets.""The CoinDesk 20 Index has doubled since the day before Election Day, outpacing bitcoin. In fact, 10 of the 20 constituents in CoinDesk 20 have doubled (or better) this year. What lies ahead? Bitcoin becomes a staple, and its narrative will get detached from other blockchain assets, as improvements to everyday activities, financial and otherwise, proliferate. Ethereum's status as a clearinghouse for the most important on-chain activity will take better shape. CoinDesk 20 names, current and future, will take advantage of improved support and regulatory clarity."" Nolan Bauerle , host of the ""American Bitcoin Citadels"" podcast: ""A movement that started with a few people inspired enough or pissed off enough to give up their free weekends and evenings has taken over earth in a few short years. Bitcoin continues to be the most interesting story on the planet, and now it’s headed for the moon.""

Deaton emphasized specific action points that the new SEC Chair must prioritize on their first day in office to support the growth of the crypto industry. Yesterday, President Trump announced the nomination of Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to succeed Gary Gensler as the next SEC Chair. The announcement, which was made through a post on Truth Social, came weeks after many reports identified Atkins as the most qualified candidate for the position. John Deaton has openly supported the digital asset industry and has made his stance publicly known. In light of this, he remarked that while most Senate candidates would typically avoid commenting on decisions made by the SEC, he is not a typical candidate and is willing to speak out. John Deaton asks Paul Atkins to change the SEC staff Initially, Deaton suggested that the subsequent SEC Chair address the Debt Box issue and terminate all parties involved in the affair. The SEC’s litigation against Digital Licensing Inc., also known as DEBT Box, a crypto-related firm, is the focal point of this incident. The SEC’s counsel acknowledged that the court deceived the company to obtain a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). As a result, the judge dismissed the litigation following the SEC’s request and directed the commission to reimburse DEBT Box $1.8 million in legal fees. Despite the fact that a number of SEC lawyers resigned in the wake of the DEBT Box scandal, Attorney Deaton is urging the incoming SEC Chair to terminate the employment of all individuals involved. In addition, Deaton demanded that Atkins fire or demote any SEC employees promoted to significant leadership positions by Gensler, whom he described as a bad-faith regulator. According to Deaton, the future SEC Chair should carefully select team members who share Trump’s ambition of making America the ‟Crypto Capital of the World.” He also encouraged the newly appointed SEC Chair to dissolve the agency’s digital asset Unit, which focuses mostly on cryptocurrency. Deaton believes there is no need for a dedicated digital asset unit at the SEC. Instead, he suggested that the new chairman create a generic fraud unit at the commission to combat fraudulent activity in various areas, including cryptocurrency and the stock market. The pro-XRP advocate advised that Atkins clarify that self-custody and decentralized finance (DeFi) are not subject to SEC regulation. This clarification would represent a substantial departure from Gensler’s previous stance, which has seen him label practically anything related to crypto as securities. It is worth noting that one of Trump’s campaign promises is to defend the right to self-custody. This revision would help crypto entities like Ripple XRP in their lawsuit. Crypto responds to Paul Atkin’s nomination Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, December 5, as traders applauded Donald Trump’s choice to appoint a crypto enthusiast to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission, strengthening hopes that the incoming president will push through efforts to de-regulate the industry. The apex crypto shot past the mark to a high of $103,800, following a bull rally since Donald Trump’s November 5 election, when he promised on the campaign trail to make the United States the “bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world.” With Bitcoin’s market cap exceeding $2 trillion, how might this leadership change shift the regulatory landscape and impact the broader crypto market?

The proposal is part of the “Jeju AI and Digital Transformation Roadmap.” Jeju remains a pro-cryptocurrency region after several years. Jeju, South Korea’s special self-governing province, has announced plans to implement digital payments for cross-border transactions. The province included the digital payments initiative in its “Jeju AI and Digital Transformation Roadmap.” According to a recent announcement, the roadmap aims to revolutionize Jeju into a cashless international city. Under the new plan, Jeju will enable digital asset-based cross-border payments with neighboring countries like China and Japan. The system will allow digital assets, including Bitcoin, to convert into Jeju’s regional currency for local use, streamlining transactions. It is important to note that the recent proposal is one of Jeju’s numerous pro-cryptocurrency activities, spanning many years.

To read full editions, subscribe . M^0, a decentralized stablecoin infrastructure layer, is setting a new standard for stablecoin design with its innovative modular architecture, revenue and distribution model. Its first distributor, Noble, is pulling back the curtain on the Noble dollar, USDN, in a bid to shake up the market and disrupt entrenched players. For the entire history of stablecoin issuance, Tether has been the dominant issuer. Its market share on Ethereum dipped to 30% in 2022 — following growth in Circle’s USDC and Binance’s BUSD — but thanks to its near monopoly on the Tron blockchain, Tether’s market cap has reigned supreme in the stablecoin space. With Tether ostensibly healthier than ever, it maintains a significant moat — but maybe not an insurmountable one. Robbie Petersen of Delphi Digital noted the importance of M^0’s approach in August, writing that “[M^0] could be best positioned to challenge the Tether monopoly .” A new framework Unlike traditional stablecoin issuers, M^0 operates a multi-issuer protocol, creating a decentralized system where issuers follow protocol rules rather than centralized mandates. Its canonical stablecoin, M, serves as a core building block for custom-branded stablecoins. Known as M-extensions, the Noble dollar is its first. This system offers issuers full programmability, allowing these branded M-extensions to distribute yield as they see fit — whether to liquidity pools, users or other stakeholders. According to Greg Di Prisco, co-founder of M^0, this structure provides scalability, safety and liquidity unmatched by traditional issuance models. “We don’t believe that [a centralized issuer model] can possibly scale. You can’t have one company controlling the entire world’s money supply as stablecoins continue to grow. So, we built a protocol that enables a multi-issuer process,” Di Prisco told Blockworks. Petersen noted the core issue in stablecoins today is that dapps “capture none of the value they create on behalf of stablecoin issuers.” Under M^0’s model, US Treasury yield can become “not only a meaningful source of revenue for apps, but possibly even the principal source.” This transformative potential could lead to a new business model, he argues: “Selling stablecoin distribution as a service (SDaaS).” Noble intends to pass on 100% of the USDN native yield to holders of the token — at least initially — according to Jelena Djuric, co-founder and CEO of Noble. “Our entire growth strategy has been keeping things as frictionless as possible,” Djuric told Blockworks, noting that Noble has no transaction fees to use any of its stablecoins. “We want to keep it like that, and the beauty [of] Cosmos and IBC is that it’s low fee and it’s fast — we wouldn’t want to compromise that in any way,” she said. Noble has previously been known for bringing USDC to IBC-connected chains, and generally improving the cross-chain routing of Circle’s stablecoins. But Djuric said USDN will complement USDC on the Noble chain, describing M^0 as “if Circle and MakerDAO [ now Sky ] joined forces and had a baby.” Modularity meets interoperability M^0 aims to meet the needs of appchains and fintech providers that want to launch their own branded stablecoins without worrying about the collateral backing, or interoperability — both are baked into the protocol underpinning M. “All of the collateral management is done for them,” Di Prisco said. “The big difference here between other [issuers] like Paxos …is that with Paxos, you’re going through months of negotiations, paperwork, legal documents, lawyers — [but] because we’re a protocol and fully onchain, [we] can give you your own branded stablecoin in minutes,” he said. Issuers maintain bankruptcy-remote SPVs , and are only allowed to hold 0-to-180-day T-bills that are marked to market. Their actual collateral balance is also checked daily. “They effectively can’t cheat as long as we maintain the right incentives in the ecosystem,” Di Prisco said. All M-extensions will be fungible by default, although brand partners have some leeway about exchanges with other distributors. For Noble, this modular design allows them to maintain a focus on ecosystem expansion. With the anticipated IBC Eureka upgrade — facilitating connections with non-Cosmos-based chains — plus integration into wormhole-supported chains, USDN will benefit from a large addressable market. “You want to go between Osmosis and dYdX in one click with two separate tokens? You can do that on Noble,” Djuric explained. The Noble Dollar will launch with a points campaign tied to a future Noble token, further bootstrapping adoption. But the launch of multiple stablecoins like Agora and M^0, which provide inherent yield, cements the idea that in the future, all stablecoin applications will start with a base yield. Whether this model will truly topple the non-yield bearing incumbents remains to be seen. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

While traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate, meme coins have carved out a unique space in the crypto universe. Thanks to their humour, community-driven vibes, and massive growth potential, they’ve got everyone—from casual investors to crypto veterans—keeping a close eye on them. December 2024 is shaping up to be one heck of a month for meme coin enthusiasts, as new contenders are entering the scene with innovative projects and jaw-dropping presale performances. One standout star is BTFD Coin (BTFD), which has tapped into the meme coin mania in a big way. With a presale performance that’s already turning heads and exciting features like Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming and high-yield staking, it’s no wonder investors are hyped. Let’s break down why BTFD Coin and four other fresh meme coins deserve a spot on your radar. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin is making serious waves. Launched with the slogan “Buy the Dip, Folks!”, this coin doesn’t just cash in on meme culture—it’s backed by solid utility. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike flocking to join the action, and the staking platform boasts a mouth-watering 90% APY. Oh, and did we mention the exclusive “Bulls Squad” community for holders? If you’re in, you’re part of a thriving, bullish club. The presale numbers speak for themselves. BTFD Coin’s journey kicked off on November 26, 2024, currently in Stage 7, the coin is priced at $0.000064, with over 23 billion tokens sold and more than $1,000,000 raised. If you’re considering jumping in now, here’s a fun thought experiment: Let’s say you invest $6,500. That’d get you around 101,562,500 BTFD Coins. If the price hits the listing target of $0.0006, you’re looking at a whopping $60,937.50. Not too shabby, right? Why did this coin make it to this list? Simple. BTFD Coin blends meme coin charm with real-world use cases, has a proven presale record, and offers one of the most attractive staking APYs in the market. Oh, and FOMO is real—don’t miss this train. 2. Brett Here’s a name you probably weren’t expecting: Brett. Yes, this meme coin embraces its inner simplicity with a comically unassuming name. But don’t let that fool you. Brett’s developers have crafted an ingenious narrative around a “friendly everyman” persona, symbolising accessibility and relatability. Community members even call themselves “Brettizens”—a quirky nod to their collective mission. Brett’s strongest play is its community-driven approach. Instead of relying on flashy ads or influencer hype, Brett taps into the grassroots vibe. In just a few weeks since its launch, the coin’s social media following has exploded, thanks to endless memes and relatable content. Plus, Brett’s tokenomics are designed to reward holders with frequent airdrops and liquidity incentives—a smart move to keep the Brettizens engaged. Why did this coin make it to this list? Brett’s combination of meme power, community vibes, and clever incentives makes it one to watch. If you’re craving something fresh and authentic, Brett’s got your back. 3. Popcat Remember the viral “Popcat” meme that had the internet losing its collective mind? Well, now it’s a cryptocurrency. Popcat’s creators took this nostalgic internet gem and turned it into a thriving crypto project. With a playful nod to its origins, the token leverages humour and nostalgia to pull in investors. Popcat isn’t just about the memes, though. It’s packed with utility. The token serves as a key to exclusive Popcat NFTs, which have been selling out faster than hotcakes. Moreover, the developers are working on a Popcat mobile game that promises to integrate cryptocurrency rewards. Think endless hours of fun plus the chance to earn some sweet Popcat tokens. The project’s roadmap is ambitious, but the team has been delivering on its promises so far. Why did this coin make it to this list? Popcat blends viral nostalgia with forward-thinking utility, making it a no-brainer for investors who love a good internet throwback. 4. Peanut the Squirrel If you’ve ever seen a squirrel hoarding nuts, you’ll get the idea behind Peanut the Squirrel. This meme coin is all about saving for the future—with a twist. Its tagline? “Stack your stash.” Peanut’s charm lies in its playful branding and its unique savings mechanism. Every transaction redistributes a portion of tokens back to holders, encouraging long-term holding. But there’s more to Peanut than meets the eye. The project is actively working on a financial literacy campaign aimed at teaching crypto newcomers the basics of saving and investing. It’s a clever way to tie in the “hoarding” theme with real-world education. Plus, the community’s memes? Absolutely nutty. (Pun intended.) Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel offers a mix of clever branding, community engagement, and financial literacy initiatives. It’s not just about hoarding—it’s about building a better financial future. 5. Non-Playable Coin Gamers, listen up. Non-Playable Coin, or NPC, is a meme coin with a gaming twist. Its name takes a cheeky jab at the “non-playable characters” we all love to mock in video games. But unlike those NPCs, this coin is anything but static. With partnerships in the gaming world and plans for metaverse integration, NPC is aiming to be the go-to coin for gamers everywhere. The standout feature? NPC’s rewards system. Gamers can earn NPC tokens by completing challenges in partner games. The coin also boasts seamless integration with some of the most popular gaming platforms, making it super easy to earn and spend. If the devs can keep this momentum going, NPC could dominate the gaming-crypto crossover space. Why did this coin make it to this list? Non-Playable Coin is a gamer’s dream come true, blending meme coin fun with real-world gaming rewards. If you’re into gaming and crypto, this one’s a no-brainer. 6. Simon’s Cat Simon’s Cat is an internet classic, and now it’s a cryptocurrency too. Fans of the beloved animated series have rallied around this coin, turning it into a community-driven powerhouse. Simon’s Cat Coin capitalises on its existing fanbase while rolling out exclusive NFTs and collectibles that only holders can access. What really sets Simon’s Cat apart is its charity component. A portion of all transactions goes towards animal shelters and pet welfare organisations. It’s a feel-good aspect that resonates with pet lovers and investors alike. Plus, the community’s dedication to promoting animal welfare has sparked partnerships with major brands in the pet industry. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simon’s Cat combines nostalgia, community spirit, and a charitable mission, making it a standout choice for socially-conscious investors. Conclusion Meme coins are more than just a joke—they’re reshaping the crypto landscape. Whether you’re drawn to the innovative P2E mechanics of BTFD Coin, the quirky charm of Brett, or the nostalgia-packed punch of Popcat, there’s no shortage of exciting opportunities. And let’s not forget about the financial literacy boost from Peanut the Squirrel or the gaming potential of Non-Playable Coin. BTFD Coin, in particular, is leading the charge. With its stellar presale performance, high-yield staking, and engaging P2E game, it’s a prime example of where meme coins are headed. Don’t miss out—join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your slice of the action.

This trend is manifesting itself as an increase in the “long-term owner spent output profit ratio” (LTH-SOPR), which measures the profitability of coins sold by long-term investors by comparing their selling price to the original purchase price. “Long-term investors have started to take profits as the Bitcoin price has climbed above $100,000,” said Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s Director of Research. “LTH-SOPR has risen to four on our charts, indicating that coins sold by long-term holders are making profits four times their original purchase price.” Moreno added that this behavior is typical during Bitcoin bull markets and that current profit-taking levels remain far from extreme. The activity of long-term holders is a key indicator during market rallies, which typically signal periods of consolidation or short-term corrections. CryptoQuant’s data shows that while profit-taking has increased, it does not signal panic selling or an imminent reversal. Related News: Can Bitcoin Maintain Its Support Level At $100,000 Or Is A Decline Coming? “This is a normal phenomenon during Bitcoin bull markets,” Moreno explained, adding: “The current profit-taking trend is at expected levels and we are not seeing the kind of extreme behavior typically seen before significant price declines.” The broader macroeconomic landscape could also play a role in Bitcoin’s trajectory, with Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner noting that the upcoming US employment report could have ripple effects on risk assets like Bitcoin. “Economists expect about 200,000 new jobs in November, rebounding from weak numbers in October caused by hurricanes and labor strikes,” Kooner said. “A strong jobs report could prompt the Fed to reconsider the pace of rate cuts, potentially opting for a more gradual approach. This scenario could strengthen the U.S. dollar and put downward pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

Financial Times’ Alphaville issues apology for Bitcoin bashing,https://crypto.news/sorry-not-sorry-financial-times-alphaville-issues-apology-for-bitcoin-bashing/,"The Financial Times’ Alphaville blog issued a rare, snarky, and semi-humorous apology to readers, addressing its longstanding skepticism toward Bitcoin. Since June 2011, Alphaville has consistently characterized Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a “negative-sum game” with limited utility, often describing its price as more reflective of hype than intrinsic value. But, with Bitcoin recently surpassing $100,000 , the publication issued a lighthearted apology for its previous coverage that may have deterred readers from investing. Hodlers: an apology https://t.co/aDJdYXuCQD — FT Alphaville (@FTAlphaville) December 5, 2024 In its apology, Alphaville acknowledged the impact its coverage may have had on readers’ investment decisions. “We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up,” the blog wrote, referencing Bitcoin’s meteoric price rise While standing by its critical analysis, Alphaville admitted its commentary may have unintentionally led readers to overlook Bitcoin’s potential for significant returns.

Alphaville reiterated its view that Bitcoin, while “clever” as a protocol, remains inefficient as a means of exchange and is compromised as a store of value. “We stand by every single one of those posts,” FT wrote in reference to their past skeptical takes on Bitcoin. FT described Bitcoin’s price as an “arbitrary hype gauge,” disconnected from the cryptocurrency’s utility. Nonetheless, the publication conceded that readers might have misinterpreted its cynicism as an endorsement of traditional finance, which Alphaville clarified it does not support either.

Is it the groundbreaking technology, the visionary roadmap, or the hype surrounding its presale success? Right now, three projects are turning heads in the crypto community: Qubetics, Cosmos, and Zignaly. Cosmos continues to dazzle with its interconnected blockchain ecosystem, while Zignaly’s $100M ZIGChain fund is redefining decentralised investments. But all eyes are on Qubetics, whose presale has already raised $4.4 million, attracting over 6,500 holders. If you’re searching for the best altcoins to buy today, these three coins should be on your radar. Qubetics isn’t just another presale darling; it’s addressing long-standing challenges in blockchain development with its QubeQode IDE. From clunky user interfaces to scalability bottlenecks, Qubetics is poised to rewrite the rules. Analysts are buzzing with predictions of $10-15 per token post-mainnet launch, making $TICS a must-watch. Let’s dive deeper into these trailblazing projects and why they’re the best altcoins to buy today . Qubetics ($TICS): A Presale Juggernaut Solving Blockchain’s Pain Points Qubetics is a force to be reckoned with. In its 11th presale stage, the project has already sold over 270 million $TICS tokens at $0.0282 each. With over 6,500 token holders and a tally exceeding $4.4 million, it’s clear that investors see something special here. And the buzz isn’t without merit. Analysts predict a token price of $10-15 following its mainnet launch—a staggering potential return that’s catapulting $TICS into conversations about the best altcoins to buy today. But what truly sets Qubetics apart is its QubeQode . Blockchain development has long been plagued by complexity and inefficiency. Many tools on the market are unintuitive, leading to a steep learning curve for developers. QubeQode addresses this with a user-friendly interface that simplifies coding and deployment, making blockchain tech accessible to a broader audience. Scalability has also been a thorn in blockchain’s side. Limited transaction processing capacity has led to congestion and high fees on major networks like Ethereum. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE optimises scalability by streamlining development processes, paving the way for applications that can handle larger volumes without sacrificing speed or security. It’s the kind of innovation that could reshape the industry. The stakes are high, and Qubetics is playing to win. With its presale already a roaring success and its IDE promising to address real-world issues, $TICS is not just another token; it’s a revolution in the making. For more guidance, watch this video . Cosmos (ATOM): Building the Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is a project that’s as ambitious as it is innovative. Dubbed the “Internet of Blockchains,” Cosmos aims to create a network where multiple blockchains can communicate and operate seamlessly. It’s a solution that’s long overdue in a fragmented industry where interoperability is often an afterthought. This vision has solidified Cosmos’ place among the best altcoins to buy today. At the heart of Cosmos is the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which allows disparate blockchains to interact without compromising their individual sovereignty. This is a game-changer for developers looking to build cross-chain applications. The Cosmos SDK further simplifies the process, enabling projects to create custom blockchains tailored to their needs. With scalability, speed, and flexibility baked into its design, Cosmos is setting a new standard. The ecosystem is growing rapidly, with notable projects like Terra, Osmosis, and Binance Chain leveraging Cosmos’ technology. This expansion is fuelling demand for ATOM, the network’s native token, which is used for staking, governance, and transaction fees. As blockchain adoption continues to rise, Cosmos’ role in fostering interoperability makes it a top contender for any investor’s portfolio. Cosmos isn’t just about technology; it’s about creating a future where blockchains work together to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s streamlining supply chains or enabling decentralised finance, Cosmos is proving that collaboration, not competition, is the key to blockchain’s success. Zignaly (ZIG): Redefining Decentralised Investment Platforms Zignaly is making waves with its mission to democratise investment opportunities. The launch of its $100 million ZIGChain fund has positioned Zignaly as a leader in decentralised finance (DeFi), offering investors a chance to participate in high-yield opportunities without the barriers of traditional finance. It’s no wonder ZIG is being touted as one of the best altcoins to buy today. What sets Zignaly apart is its unique approach to profit-sharing. The platform allows users to invest with professional traders and share profits directly, creating a transparent and collaborative investment ecosystem. This model eliminates the need for middlemen, reducing costs and increasing trust. For those tired of opaque traditional investment vehicles, Zignaly offers a breath of fresh air. The $100M ZIGChain fund takes this concept to the next level by funding innovative projects and providing liquidity for the Zignaly ecosystem. It’s a bold move that underscores the platform’s commitment to long-term growth and innovation. As DeFi continues to disrupt traditional finance, Zignaly is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this burgeoning market. ZIG isn’t just an investment; it’s a statement. For those looking to align their portfolios with projects that are pushing the envelope, Zignaly is a must-consider. Conclusion The crypto market is brimming with opportunities, but not all projects are created equal. Qubetics, Cosmos, and Zignaly stand out for their innovation, real-world applications, and growth potential. Whether it’s Qubetics’ game-changing QubeQode IDE, Cosmos’ vision of an interconnected blockchain ecosystem, or Zignaly’s revolutionary approach to decentralised investments, these projects are setting the pace for the industry. If you’re serious about finding the best altcoins to buy today, now’s the time to act. Don’t let these opportunities pass you by—get in on the action and be part of the next wave of crypto success stories. Start with Qubetics before its presale ends, and keep an eye on Cosmos and Zignaly as they continue to redefine what’s possible in blockchain and DeFi. The future is here, and it’s yours for the taking.

The new framework expands the suite of digital assets already offered by ADGM regulatory authority. As per the press release, the framework introduces several key components that establish robust standards for FRT issuers to ensure financial stability and investor protection such as reserve assets, governance and integrity, transparent disclosure, prudential safeguards, and redemption rights. The framework makes FRT issuance a distinct Regulated Activity within ADGM’s comprehensive financial services regulatory regime. It has been designed to be risk-proportionate while ensuring FRT issuers operate in a safe and prudent manner. Emmanuel Givanakis, CEO of the ADGM FSRA stated, “Our FRT framework is a significant milestone in ADGM’s evolution as a progressive international financial center. Through extensive consultation with industry stakeholders, we have created a regime that balances innovation with strong regulatory oversight. This framework provides the regulatory certainty that industry participants need while maintaining high standards of financial stability and investor protection. We believe this positions ADGM as a premier jurisdiction for responsible FRT issuance and shows our commitment to fostering responsible innovation in financial services.” Fiat-referenced tokens can be used as forms of payment As per the framework, an accepted fiat-referenced token is one that, in the opinion of the Regulator, meets the requirements that permit a regulated activity to be carried on in relation to it. The FSRA defined a Fiat-Referenced Token (FRT) as a digital asset, the transfer and storage of which is achieved through the use of a distributed ledger (DLT) or similar technology. The FRT can be used as a medium of exchange with a stable store of value, by referencing a fixed amount of a single fiat currency; and enabling the holder to redeem the token in exchange for the amount of the fiat currency referred to from its issuer upon demand. The fiat-referenced token can be used for remittance payments, and payment transactions, including transfers, payments for services, direct debits, credit transfers between bank accounts, including standing orders, and others. Central Bank of UAE also issued its stablecoin regulations In June the UAE Central Bank issued its UAE Stablecoin Payment Token Services Regulation pertaining to payment tokens, not allowing algorithmic tokens to be included and only allowing foreign stablecoins to be used to purchase virtual assets, while AED stablecoins could be used to purchase products and services within the UAE The Central Bank of the UAE defined Payment Token Services as being digital payment services in the UAE comprising three categories, namely Payment Token Issuance, Payment Token Conversion, and Payment Token Custody and Transfer. Since then Tether announced that it would be launching an AED stablecoin in early 2025, while AED Stablecoin LLC in the UAE announced that the Central Bank of UAE had provided it with in-principle approval to launch and establish its own stablecoin, AE Coin.

The Sui Foundation today announced that Phantom Wallet, the leading non-custodial multichain cryptocurrency wallet, is now integrating with the Sui network. At seven million monthly active users, Phantom has the largest on-chain user base of wallets in the Web 3.0 industry. With over 560 million total on-chain transactions year-to-date – and key features such as staking, in-app token swaps, NFT storage, multichain support and Ledger hardware wallet integration – Phantom represents a significant milestone for the Sui network, which becomes the first blockchain outside of Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum to be supported by the wallet. Sui is also the first blockchain built around the Move language to be supported by Phantom. Integrating the Sui network is also a significant step toward enhancing interoperability for Phantom Wallet and demonstrates how wallet providers and DApp (decentralized application) builders are betting on a multichain future rather than focusing on only one ecosystem. Jameel Khalfan, global head of ecosystem at the Sui Foundation, said, “The integration of Phantom Wallet with Sui represents a giant leap for the Sui ecosystem, which now gets access to a first-class wallet experience with several features that the Sui community has been asking for. “Phantom Wallet is selective about which chains they support, and we are proud to now be included among this notable group.” The integration of Phantom will provide Sui users with a reliable and secure wallet solution available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Brave, as well as a mobile app for iOS and Android. Brandon Millman, CEO of Phantom, said, “We’re excited to bring Sui support to millions of Phantom users. “Sui’s thoughtful approach to scalability and developer-focused solutions aligns with our commitment to high-performant blockchains. “We look forward to building together and supporting their growth.” Contact Sui Foundation This content is sponsored and should be regarded as promotional material.

The Ripple CLO’s statement comes amid Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins as the next US SEC Chair. Ripple CLO Calls Out Gary Gensler In an X post, Stuart Alderoty called Gary Gensler following the SEC’s latest filing in the Binance case. The Ripple CLO stated that the Gensler-led administration has filed an 8-page brief in the case instead of standing down and pausing crypto litigation with a new leadership just weeks away. Alderoty remarked that the Commission recycled the same failed arguments in the filing, including the absurd claim that crypto has no inherent value. The SEC’s filing is a memorandum opposing Binance’s motion to dismiss the Commission’s amended complaint. The Commission argued in the amended complaint that the top crypto exchange offered and sold BNB and ten other crypto assets as investment contracts. However, Binance had before now filed a motion to dismiss this motion. However, the Ripple CLO expects that Gary Gensler and the US SEC shouldn’t be moving forward with pending litigations, considering that the Donald Trump administration could soon come in. Moreover, Gensler has already announced that he will resign on the day Trump comes into office. As such, the Commission could wait for the next administration for guidance on how best to proceed with these lawsuits. It is worth mentioning that Donald Trump nominated pro-crypto Paul Atkins to become the next US SEC Chair. This indicates that there is a likelihood that these crypto lawsuits could be dropped under the next administration. Gensler Trying To Lead ‘From The Grave’ The Ripple CLO isn’t the only one that has criticized Gensler’s recent moves. Former SEC official John Reed Stark recently stated that Gensler is quietly working behind the scenes to lead the Commission from the grave. Stark mentioned that Gensler just promoted three crypto-enforcement lawyers in the SEC to senior executive positions and will now be in charge of running the SEC’s trial unit and the SEC’s crypto unit. He added that the Commission hasn’t announced these promotions, which makes this move interesting as the Commission always announces such promotions. Basically, the former SEC official suggested that Gensler is still trying to push the Commission’s anti-crypto war even after he leaves office. It is worth mentioning that Coingape recently reported that Jorge Tenreiro , the SEC’s lead attorney in its lawsuit against Ripple, had joined the Commission as the Chief Litigation Counsel.

With innovation at its core, this space has seen countless platforms rise and fall as they vie for dominance. However, whispers in the crypto community are growing louder around one particular player that has the potential to disrupt the status quo. Analysts are forecasting that Lightchain , a revolutionary blockchain powered by artificial intelligence, could overtake industry leader Uniswap by the end of 2025. What makes Lightchain so unique? And what should investors and crypto enthusiasts know about this ambitious contender? Buckle up as we explore how this new DeFi blockchain is poised to reshape the crypto landscape. The Rise of Lightchain AI Lightchain isn’t just another blockchain project; it represents the future of decentralized innovation. By combining the power of blockchain with cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) through its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain has introduced something truly extraordinary. Its mission is clear: create a decentralized ecosystem that’s scalable, privacy-focused, and built to transform industries through AI-driven governance and computation. And the market is taking notice. Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain has already raised over $1 million with a growing community of supporters. But why are analysts predicting Lightchain AI will soon rival—or even surpass—established players like Uniswap? What Sets Lightchain Apart from Uniswap? To understand Lightchain’s potential to dethrone Uniswap, we first need to compare their core technologies and value propositions. 1. Consensus Mechanisms Uniswap operates as a decentralized exchange (DEX) leveraging Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) model for the consensus mechanism. This approach ensures security and scalability but doesn’t introduce any particularly innovative changes to that model. Lightchain , on the other hand, employs a game-changing Proof of Intelligence (PoI) protocol. Unlike PoS or Proof of Work (PoW), PoI incentivizes network nodes to perform valuable AI computations, such as training machine learning models and optimizing algorithms—tasks critical to the modern tech ecosystem. This not only enhances the blockchain’s efficiency but also integrates AI functionality directly. By incentivizing contributions that drive AI development, Lightchain is creating a blockchain that’s not just a ledger—it’s a living, evolving network with computational utility. 2. Expanded Ecosystem Potential While Uniswap focuses almost exclusively on facilitating token swaps and providing liquidity through its AMM (automated market maker) model, Lightchain’s vision reaches much further. At its core is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , a computational layer that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) optimized for AI tasks. This opens a wide array of new possibilities, from decentralized governance to AI-driven DeFi platforms. Unlocking such potential could position Lightchain as a go-to blockchain for both traditional DeFi enthusiasts and tech innovators seeking unparalleled functionality. 3. Community-Driven Innovation with Practical Utility Both Lightchain and Uniswap leverage decentralized governance models to give power back to their communities. However, Lightchain’s tools like the Transparent AI Framework and Memecoin Launchpad add innovative layers that encourage collaboration and reward creativity. For example: Transparent AI Framework ensures open and auditable AI model operations, fostering trust. Memecoin Launchpad allows creators to securely launch meme-based tokens with embedded AI-enhanced features. These additions make Lightchain far more versatile than Uniswap, which remains narrowly focused on token swaps. Key Metrics That Support Lightchain’s Predicted Growth While technology provides the foundation, several data points strengthen the case for Lightchain’s ascent in the DeFi sector. 1. Adoption Metrics Uniswap has been praised for its user-friendly interface and liquidity dominance, boasting over 4 million users and $1.3 trillion in traded volume as of 2023. However, its growth has plateaued in recent years as competition intensifies. Analysts note that Lightchain’s integration of AI-powered dApps and growing developer community could see its adoption skyrocket. With tools like PoI and AIVM attracting developers from diverse industries, Lightchain aims to serve millions of users across multiple verticals—not just DeFi. 2. Early Presale Success The ongoing Lightchain presale has raised over $1 million in funding with significant traction from crypto enthusiasts. At just $0.003 per token, investors are positioning themselves early to benefit from a project with exponential growth potential. 3. Partnership Opportunities Lightchain’s roadmap for partnerships includes collaboration with AI research organizations, Web3 developers, and enterprise clients. These connections are positioned to unlock additional use cases and expand its ecosystem far beyond traditional DeFi competitors like Uniswap. Timeline to the Top Analysts have circled December 2025 as the pivotal point when Lightchain could overtake Uniswap. Several milestones along Lightchain’s roadmap will be crucial in achieving this goal: 2024 Q2: Testnet rollout and performance optimization. 2024 Q4: Full mainnet launch with active validator nodes. 2025 Q2: Deployment of pioneering AI-powered dApps. 2025 Q4: Projected ecosystem growth across governance, dApps, and base-layer adoption. Coupled with Lightchain’s ability to generate real-world value through AI computation, these phases will pave the way for sustained growth and prominence. https://lightchain.ai Why Smart Investors are Eyeing Lightchain Now The key to any great investment is timing. And if analysts are right, 2023-2024 is the perfect moment to act on Lightchain. Projects like Ethereum and Uniswap saw early backers net significant returns as their ecosystems expanded over time. Lightchain, with its revolutionary PoI and AIVM technology, offers a similar opportunity. Investing in Lightchain’s ongoing presale at this early stage not only locks in tokens at a discounted rate but also provides access to exclusive governance rights and future ecosystem features. The Future of DeFi Could Belong to Lightchain It’s not every day that a blockchain comes along with the potential to flip the script in DeFi. With its innovative AI-driven approach and expanding community, Lightchain is emerging as more than just another contender—it’s a genuine disruptor. Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast, an investor, or just someone excited about AI’s potential to transform industries, Lightchain offers an opportunity you can’t ignore. 🚀 Don’t miss your chance to be a part of tomorrow’s DeFi revolution.

However, according to Bitfinex’s head of derivatives, Jag Kooner, the reverse could introduce “downward pressure” on BTC. A robust jobs report could lead the Federal Reserve to reconsider the pace of interest rate cuts, potentially opting for a more gradual approach. This scenario might strengthen the U.S. dollar and apply downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected report could bolster expectations for more aggressive rate cuts, potentially enhancing liquidity and positively impacting the crypto market. Jag Kooner, Bitfinex’s head of derivatives Cautious Bitcoin optimism Amid looming economic data, B2BINPAY CEO Arthur Azizov argued that BTC was due for a market correction, especially after breaking the $100,000 psychological barrier. Azizov remarked that retracing below $90,000 would be healthy for BTC, given its 54% surge following Donald Trump’s re-election. It’s reasonable to conclude that a pullback is likely imminent—it’s just a matter of time. By year-end, I believe Bitcoin’s price will consolidate around $100,000 before retracing to five-digit levels, potentially settling near $85,000 in the following months.

According to a new report by AP News, Trump has picked former SEC Commissioner and current Patomak Partners chief executive Paul Atkins to head the regulatory agency. As stated by Trump on Truth social media, according to AP, “[Atkins] believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, and that provide capital to make our economy the best in the world. He also recognizes that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before.” Furthermore, Trump said that he is a “proven leader for common sense regulations.” Atkins will replace Gary Gensler as Chairman of the SEC. Gensler, who stepped down from this position last month, is known for his hardline stance on crypto assets as under his helm, the SEC took several high-profile enforcement actions against prominent crypto firms, including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Ripple Labs. After his tenure as a Commissioner of the SEC from 2002-2008, Atkins has opined that there is too much market regulation, according to the report. In 2022, while at Patomak, Atkins penned a letter noting that as Americans are becoming more familiar with crypto assets, they may become interested in purchasing them for their retirement plans. News of the announcement sent the top crypto asset by market cap flying, as BTC went from a low of $94,890 on December 4th to a peak of $103,425, a new all-time high. It has since stabilized and is trading for $101,194 at time of writing, a 6.5% gain on the day.

XRP’s price has experienced a sharp 25% drop since reaching a multi-year high of $2.90 in early December 2024, trading at $2.30 as of December 5. As XRP’s price dropped, its market capitalization fell by 8%, slipping below Tether USD to fourth place. This correction comes after a remarkable rally, where XRP surged by over 400% following the election of President Donald Trump. The appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair also added fuel to this surge, as market sentiment grew bullish on the expectation of a crypto-friendly SEC leadership. However, traders are currently taking the opportunity to lock in profits, contributing to the recent pullback. This decline is part of a broader correction that has affected several altcoins, diverging from Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000. Despite this, the drop could be a healthy market correction, as opposed to a full trend reversal, considering XRP’s strong performance earlier in the year. On-chain metrics suggest continued bullish sentiment While the short-term price correction may cause concern, on-chain data presents a more optimistic picture for XRP. One crucial metric supporting bullish sentiment is the stability of XRP’s funding rate. According to Coinglass data , XRP’s funding rate has increased immensely to levels seen during XRP’s rally in February 2024 and March 2021. Source: Coinglass This surge suggests that the market is not overly bullish, reducing the risk of an overheated rally, while still providing room for further growth. Moreover, XRP’s weighted sentiment remains low compared to previous rallies, indicating that retail traders are not the primary drivers of this latest surge. This suggests that the current holders are more confident in the long-term prospects of the token, reducing the chances of a significant sell-off during market downturns. Source: Santiment These on-chain indicators suggest that the recent decline may be more of a temporary pullback rather than a sign of an impending trend reversal. Technical indicators point toward a bullish reversal From a technical analysis perspective, XRP’s price is showing signs of potential upside despite the recent pullback. A bull flag pattern has formed on the 4-hour chart, indicating that a bullish continuation may be in the cards once the price closes above the $2.37 resistance level. If this pattern resolves positively, XRP’s price could see a surge towards $4.83, a new all-time high, marking a 60% increase from current levels. Source: TradingView However, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped from overbought conditions, which may indicate further price consolidation or a temporary dip. The RSI’s decline from 82 to 52 between December 3 and December 5 suggests a potential for a deeper pullback, but as long as XRP’s price holds above key support levels at $2.05 and $1.68, the bulls may quickly reclaim control. Going by the technical analysis, the correction is possibly providing an opportunity for consolidation before another potential breakout, supported by strong market sentiment and solid technical foundations.

Rise in Solana token creation drives record protocol growth As the protocol behind virtually all token creation on Solana, Metaplex has emerged as a primary beneficiary of the extraordinary surge in digital asset creation on the Solana network. This exponential level of activity – encompassing everything from memecoins to AI tokens and NFTs – directly contributes to Metaplex’s protocol fees. This increased protocol fee generation has in turn funded record-breaking $MPLX token purchases for the Metaplex DAO. Since June 2024, 50% of the prior month’s protocol fees and a portion of the historical fees have been allocated to funding MPLX token purchases for contribution to the DAO. In November 2024, this culminated in 12,000 SOL worth of MPLX purchases – e quivalent to approximately $3 million at current prices – m arking a substantial 58% increase month-over-month and signifying the largest monthly MPLX token purchases to date. Building on this momentum, Metaplex’s November protocol fees hit an ATH (all-time high) of $3.5 million, setting the stage for even larger allocations for MPLX purchases in December. Record-breaking Metaplex Protocol metrics in November November’s protocol activity shattered previous records across multiple metrics. Metaplex saw extraordinary growth in fungible token creation, with 1.4 million new tokens minted – marking a 56% increase month-over-month compared to the previous ATH in October 2024 and a new monthly record. This represented 94% of all token metadata assets created, driven primarily by memecoin activity on platforms such as Pump.fun. Metaplex Core – the next-generation NFT standard – demonstrated significant adoption with a new ATH of 354,000 assets created, driven by expanded use cases made possible due to the standard’s flexible design. User engagement metrics surged as the number of unique wallets interacting with the Metaplex Protocol reached 879,000 – a 34% increase from October and a new ATH. The protocol’s total collector base expanded to nearly 60 million unique wallets, growing by over 860,000 in November alone. About the Metaplex Protocol Metaplex is the leading decentralized protocol on Solana and SVM, providing tools and programs for developers and creators to build DApps (decentralized applications) that use digital assets. With a growing user base and a commitment to innovation, Metaplex is empowering the next wave of DeFi (decentralized finance) and commerce. About the Metaplex Foundation The Metaplex Foundation is a Cayman Islands non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and growth of the Metaplex Protocol. By providing open-source tools and resources, the foundation empowers developers, creators and users worldwide to participate in a decentralized and inclusive digital economy.

The Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary’s Solana Trust is currently the largest Solana investment fund by assets under management (AUM). It manages $134.2 million worth of SOL , roughly 0.1% of all Solana in circulation. Grayscale says it is seeking to list the Solana Trust as an ETF so it can closely track the value of the underlying crypto asset. “The Sponsor thus believes that allowing Shares of the Trust to list and trade on the Exchange as an ETP (i.e., converting the Trust to a spot SOL ETP) would provide other investors with a safe and secure way to invest in SOL on a regulated national securities exchange.” The development comes as other asset managers also file applications to offer Solana ETFs to their customers. Investment giant VanEck submitted an S-1 registration statement to the SEC in June, making it the first company in the US to apply for a SOL ETF. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, said at the time that the filing was a bet that Donald Trump would win the presidential election. Other firms seeking approval to launch a Solana ETF include 21Shares, Canary Capital and Bitwise.

ETH/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Strategic considerations As Bitcoin dominance resumes its upward climb and XRP attempts to dethrone USD Tether (USDT) as the third largest cryptocurrency, traders are rotating capital to altcoins, XRP and Solana (SOL) based meme coins and artificial intelligence tokens. Over $135 million in shorts were liquidated in the past 24 hours per Coinglass data, Bitcoin’s rally to $104,000 has added nearly 12% in open interest and 125% in options trading volume. Traders are consistently taking profits in Bitcoin, and this supports the capital rotation thesis. Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant argues this cycle is different from previous ones. Institutional investors buying Bitcoin have no interest in rotating into altcoins, and this implies that altcoin price rallies rely on an influx of capital from retail traders across crypto exchange platforms. Traders need to watch exchange user activity and the altcoin market capitalization chart to determine the top cycle for altcoins this season. The total crypto market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin, is still 8.5% below its 2021 cycle top of $1.71 trillion. As retail traders inject capital into crypto exchanges, the market cap is expected to climb past $1.57 trillion. The chart is key for traders looking to rotate into altcoins while Bitcoin holds steady above $100,000.

Recent price movements suggest that PEPE might be on the brink of a double bullish surge. Analysts speculate that the coin could see a significant upward breakout, with projections indicating a potential 100% increase. The growing interest in PEPE highlights investor optimism and hints at a possible rally in the near future. Analyst Predicts Pepe Coin Price to Surge as Major Breakout Looms The crypto analyst anticipates a potential surge in the price of Pepe Coin, forecasting a major breakout with an 80-100% upside. The analyst highlights a key resistance at $0.00003219, noting that surpassing this level could propel PEPE toward $0.00003955. This bullish scenario is supported by the coin’s current momentum and positive market sentiment. A safety net is identified at $0.00002046, acting as a strong support zone for traders. The breakout could significantly boost investor confidence, aligning with the anticipated price rally in the coming sessions.

The company’s move steps away from the traditional large models most of its competitors are currently invested in. Cohere’s co-founder, Nick Frosst emphasized that today’s businesses need models designed for specific tasks rather than generic, all-encompassing ones. The strategic shift to building customized models comes as a result of companies seeing diminishing returns from their larger models. The problem of diminishing returns from scaling AI models Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, mentioned that the gains from training AI models on large data sets have plateaued. Companies now face delays in the training and deployment of new generations of large language models. The industry, which initially saw breakthroughs by throwing computational power and resources at larger models, has started to recognize that size is not always synonymous with quality or utility. In a letter to its investors, Cohere says this new direction is a result of companies struggling to incorporate AI into their daily work. Instead of pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), which some companies like OpenAI see as the future of AI, Cohere is taking a more targeted approach. The company aims to achieve greater capital efficiency by optimizing existing models for real-world applications. “We’re going to work with enterprises to make models perfect for their use case, tailor them to their specific needs, and bring them to production,” Frosst said. He was clear that Cohere would not rely on the notion that AGI is just around the corner, emphasizing that increasing model size doesn’t equate to better results. The race to build better models The race to build large and better AI models has led to a boom in investment and development across the sector. Cohere recently raised $270 million in a Series C financing, while competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI labs have raised billions of dollars to fund the capital-intensive process of developing frontier AI systems, which often require enormous amounts of computational power. According to Cohere, it shifted from building larger models to custom models due to diminishing returns alongside feedback it received from customers. “What we’re hearing from customers is that they don’t just need bigger models to be good at everything. They need models that are actually built for their specific use cases,” Frosst said. Cohere will be deploying customized versions of existing models that can provide direct value to businesses. Its models will be designed to understand and execute highly specific tasks tailored to each enterprise’s requirements, in contrast to the generalized capabilities often found in larger models. Cohere’s new approach may also align with industry trends in sustainability and cost efficiency. With governments increasingly scrutinizing the carbon footprint of tech companies, Cohere’s strategy could offer an edge in navigating the evolving regulatory landscape . Developing enormous AI models is not just an expensive business; it is also energy-intensive. AI firms may need more energy-efficient techniques to better position themselves to comply with future regulations as governments push for lower emissions and understand the technology better.

The cryptocurrency whale, one of the earliest investors in the PEPE memecoin, made a huge sale in this altcoin after the rise. According to the data, the crypto whale in question sold the last remaining batch of 2.61 trillion PEPE tokens, which he bought for only 0.035 ETH, or $70, by sending them to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. The value of the PEPE that the whale initially purchased is $57 million at the time of writing. On the other hand, in his last sale, he sold 189.4 billion PEPE tokens worth $4.15 million.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA.

According to the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, the newly launched products are O1 and ChatGPT Pro. This product update comes at a time when the company is eying a transition to become a for-profit entity. The Growing OpenAI Product Suite As Altman revealed, the O1 product is a Large Language Model (LLM) that he claims is the fastest in the world. According to him, this new AI engine is also the fastest released to date. He said the new LLM has more embedded features including multimodality. The second product is ChatGPT Pro, an advanced subscription service of its Chatbot that will cost $200 per month. To justifying the pricing, Sam Altman said ChatGPT Pro will offer unlimited usage and even-smarter mode for using o1. He noted that the OpenAI team will integrate more benefits in the near future. we just launched two things: o1, the smartest model in the world. smarter, faster, and more features (eg multimodality) than o1-preview. live in chatgpt now, coming to api soon. chatgpt pro. $200/month. unlimited usage and even-smarter mode for using o1. more benefits to come! — Sam Altman (@sama) December 5, 2024 The AI giant has continued to make the news for its product launches. As reported earlier by Coingape, the firm launched Operator, a task-automating AI tool last month. The company has managed to keep up pace with these successive product launches as it released Sora, its video-generating software earlier in the year. While it claims each new product is advanced, some community members have flagged flaws in the O1 product that just launched changed. From conversations on X, users claimed the new model offers “weird answers” to user queries overall. Beyond Product Launch, Legal Woes Despite the growth OpenAI has recorded in recent times following its latest $1.5 billion capital raise from SoftBank , legal battle lurks. Per an earlier Coingape update, Elon Musk filed a revised lawsuit against the artificial intelligence and Microsoft, intensifying the brawl between then. The tech billionaire accused the firms of monopolistic practices and anti-competitive collaboration in the generative AI sector. This suit precedes a more recent antitrust lawsuit Elon Musk also slammed the duo. While this suit is ongoing, OpenAI still have competitors in the industry it need to contend with for market share.

This positive outlook for XRP is potentially driven by bullish price action, rising interest from whales and traders, and significant withdrawals from exchanges. XRP’s Price Momentum Despite this bullish outlook, XRP has registered a price drop of 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $2.40. Meanwhile, interest from whales and traders has resulted in a 12% rise in trading volume during the same period, along with a significant withdrawal of tokens from exchanges, as reported by an on-chain analytics firm. $315 Million XRP Outflow According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , XRP spot inflow/outflow data shows that exchanges across the cryptocurrency market have witnessed a significant $315 million worth of XRP outflow.

To read full editions, subscribe . It seems fitting that bitcoin’s rise above $103,000 came in the final month of a groundbreaking year for the asset. You already know about the first US spot bitcoin ETFs in January and Trump’s election win a month ago. Then there was the president-elect’s selection this week of Paul Atkins as SEC chair (who many deem to be a crypto advocate ). And Fed Chair Jerome Powell even recently compared bitcoin to gold . The fact that gold’s market cap is still nine times larger than bitcoin’s (about $18T to $2T) “should offer additional insight into how much more room there is for bitcoin to grow from current levels,” LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger said in an email. Momentum driving BTC past the psychological six-figure price mark can beget more momentum — albeit not without volatility. “It not only validates the long-term belief of the community but also signals to institutions, corporations, sovereign funds, skeptics and sidelined investors alike that bitcoin has entered a new phase of adoption and recognition as a store of value and a transformative asset class,” according to 21Shares crypto research strategist Matt Mena. Bitcoin had dipped to about $99,000 by 3 pm ET on Thursday. A key next target is $110,000, Mena added, citing Deribit data that shows the majority of Jan. 31, 2025 call option contract volume is concentrated at that price level. Industry watchers have also pointed to BTC’s history of price swings to temper mania from the most bullish of bulls. After the early years of bitcoin, the road to $100,000 included a rise to $18,000 in 2017 followed by a plummet to around $4,000 the following year. A surge to nearly $70,000 in late-2021 was followed by a severe downward move to $16,000 in 2022. While optimism is high that the Trump Administration and a crypto-friendly Congress will help spur crypto regulatory and legislative clarity , Nansen principal research analyst Aurelie Barthere said those might not pan out as expected. He said: “Once we witness the first policies and decisions from the Trump Administration in January, there could be some risk of disappointed expectations, especially if the agenda prioritizes tariff and immigration-related policies first.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The company plans to allocate roughly $48 million of these proceeds to repurchase approximately $51 million of its existing convertible notes, which are due in 2026. The remaining returns will be used for acquiring more Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of assets, and debt repayment. Previous Offerings and Purchases This move follows MARA’s previous $700 million zero-interest convertible senior notes offering due in 2030. The company also recently acquired 703 BTC in November after earlier buying 5,771 BTC, which brought its total monthly acquisitions to 6,474 BTC. The purchase was made after a previous zero-interest convertible senior note sale that raised $1 billion. At the time, the mining company also revealed it has approximately $160 million in remaining funds, which it plans to use for future Bitcoin buys during price dips. As of the latest update, BitcoinTreasuries shows that MARA now holds a total of 34,794 BTC, valued at approximately $3.3 billion. This positions the company as the second-largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, behind only MicroStrategy, which recently announced a purchase of $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The market has responded positively to the firm’s latest moves. Google Finance data shows that on December 5, the company’s stock closed up 3.30%, reaching $25.96. Additionally, over the past month, MARA’s stock price has surged by 59.85%, and its year-to-date growth stands at 13.2%.

Bobrinskoy issued this stark warning about Bitcoin ( BTC ), labeling the cryptocurrency a “get-rich-quick scheme” driven by momentum rather than intrinsic value. Speaking on CNBC’s The Exchange , Bobrinskoy expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s reliance on minimal regulatory oversight, which he argued leaves it vulnerable to collapse when investor sentiment turns. Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its lack of regulation, enabling large, anonymous transactions, Bobrinskoy noted. He also highlighted its association with criminal activities and its detachment from traditional Know Your Customer rules as risks to the broader financial system. He dismissed Bitcoin’s initial narrative as a transactional tool, adding that its current positioning as a store of value lacks long-term sustainability. You might also like: Bitcoin HODLers book profits post-$100k ATH: report Bitcoin’s price surge is purely speculative Bobrinskoy, who manages Ariel’s focused value investment strategy and has decades of experience in investment banking, attributed Bitcoin’s recent price surges to speculative enthusiasm rather than underlying economic fundamentals. He predicted a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s value once its momentum fades, echoing concerns about the cryptocurrency undermining the U.S. dollar and exposing investors to significant risks. “So the point of this is that it has gone up because it’s gone up, and it will go down dramatically if it starts to lose that momentum — and that will happen,” he said. Ariel Investments, known for its disciplined value approach, has long focused on traditional equities. Bobrinskoy’s remarks reflect ongoing skepticism in traditional finance circles regarding the sustainability of cryptocurrencies without stronger regulatory frameworks.

Its price reached a historic all-time high above $100,000 earlier, followed by a plunge toward $98,000 moments ago. As CryptoPotato reported earlier, the move above $100K followed Donald Trump’s decision to make Paul Atkins the new Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In the words of the President-elect himself: “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” The price skyrocketed and reached a high of more than $104K later in the day, but the bears weren’t finished. In the past few hours, BTC has been bleeding out and has just dropped to almost as low as $98,000 moments ago. Source: TradingView This resulted in almost $650 million worth of liquidated positions in the derivatives market, which is a 45% increase on a 24-hour basis. The majority of these are long traders, accounting for more than $400 million of the liquidations. Of course, BTC is the market where most traders are wiped off. With this latest dump, many altcoins are also now trading in the red. One example is Ripple’s XRP, which is down 3% on the day. Interestingly enough, it remains the best performer for the week, gaining close to 60%.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 114,600 followers on the social media platform X that decentralized exchange (DEX) Curve Finance ( CRV ) looks primed to skyrocket by over 500%. “Unsure if we’ll even get the pullback first, but CRV looks ready for $6.80 while above $0.87.” Source: Justin Bennett/X CRV is trading for $1.11 at time of writing, a 2.7% decrease during the last 24 hours. A spike to Bennett’s target price of $6.80 would represent a 515% increase from its current level. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Bennett says that investors shouldn’t be surprised if BTC smashes through the $105,000-$106,000 price tag after it reached the six-figure milestone for the first time ever. “Six-figure Bitcoin!! Nice move off of new support. We probably see $105,000-$106,000 before some consolidation, but don’t be surprised if it rips right through.” Source: Justin Bennett/X According to Bennett, altcoins – which had an explosive month of November – could slow down in December versus the crypto king. “Nice reaction from Bitcoin dominance so far. Alts that had explosive Novembers could cool off in December as BTC takes over.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett says that altcoins could struggle against BTC if its current dominance level of 54% holds up. Bitcoin is trading for $100,931 at time of writing, a 6.3% gain during the last 24 hours.

Can It Reach This Level? Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/financial-company-standard-chartered-releases-new-price-forecast-for-bitcoin-can-it-reach-this-level-here-are-the-details/,"Following Bitcoin’s historic surge past $100,000 this week, Standard Chartered has predicted that the cryptocurrency’s price could double by the end of 2025. Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin to Double to $200,000 by End of 2025 Analyst Geoff Kendrick shared the optimistic outlook in a note published Thursday, citing strong institutional adoption as a key driver of projected growth. Kendrick noted that Standard Chartered’s $200,000 price target for Bitcoin is “achievable,” especially with continued institutional interest. “We would be even more bullish if we saw rapid adoption of BTC by US pension funds, global sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), and even a potential US strategic reserve fund,” Kendrick said. Kendrick added that institutional flows in 2025 are expected to maintain or exceed 2024 levels as firms like MicroStrategy accelerate their Bitcoin buying strategies. The firm is projected to match or exceed its 2024 Bitcoin purchases as part of its $42 billion, three-year plan. Bitcoin is set to rise over 140% in 2024, a 48% jump since President-elect Donald Trump’s November 5 election victory. The cryptocurrency’s rise to $100,000 marks a milestone that Standard Chartered predicts could occur as early as April 2023, when Bitcoin would be trading around $27,000. Standard Chartered’s bullish projection is based on Bitcoin’s continued adoption by institutional players. The firm believes that broader acceptance by pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and potential government reserves could further boost Bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin’s rally into 2024 underscores its growing appeal as a store of value and a hedge against traditional market volatility, positioning it as a key asset in both institutional and individual portfolios. *This is not investment advice.

Whether it’s multi-chain technology, financial inclusion, or supply chain transparency, these three projects exemplify the best crypto to join for short-term growth. Qubetics ($TICS): Leading the Multi-Chain Revolution Qubetics has captured the attention of the crypto world with its ambitious multi-chain ecosystem, enabling interoperability across major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Currently in its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 270 million tokens to more than 6,500 holders, raising $4.4 million. At $0.0282 per token, analysts predict a potential price surge to $15 post-mainnet launch, translating to a 783% ROI or higher. What makes Qubetics truly revolutionary is its multi-chain wallet , designed to give users seamless access to manage assets across multiple blockchains. Imagine holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in one place while being able to swap between them instantly, without relying on third-party exchanges. This feature is perfect for institutions and individuals alike, simplifying crypto management and reducing friction.

One of its recent highlights is the collaboration with MoneyGram, enabling seamless fiat-to-crypto transfers globally. This partnership is a game-changer for unbanked and underbanked populations, allowing them to access financial services through Stellar’s blockchain. For instance, a migrant worker can send money to their family in another country at a fraction of the cost charged by traditional remittance services. Such use cases illustrate the platform’s real-world impact. Stellar’s network continues to grow, integrating with institutions and fintech firms to scale its reach. The blockchain’s ability to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently makes it an attractive choice for global enterprises. Analysts project steady growth for XLM, with its increasing adoption and partnerships driving its market value.

A recent milestone for VeChain was its strategic partnership with PwC to provide blockchain-based solutions for enterprise clients. This collaboration underscores VeChain’s credibility and showcases its potential to revolutionise industries. Imagine being able to track a product’s journey from the manufacturer to the retailer to the consumer, verifying authenticity and ensuring quality at every stage.

His remarks focus on the potential for U.S. government intervention in Bitcoin markets, which could have unforeseen consequences for the value of the dollar. Schiff, who has long argued that Bitcoin is a speculative asset, points to the possibility that the U.S. government could inflate the money supply and create an unsustainable economic bubble. Peter Schiff Warns Bitcoin’s Rise Could Lead to the Collapse of the Dollar According to a recent post on X , Peter Schiff warned that the rise of Bitcoin could eventually lead to the collapse of the U.S. dollar. Schiff argued that Bitcoin’s surge in price has largely been influenced by government intervention, which could have long-term negative effects on the dollar. Schiff’s concerns center on the possibility of the U.S. government adopting Bitcoin on a large scale. He suggested that the government might inflate the money supply by purchasing Bitcoin with newly printed dollars, leading to a large-scale economic bubble. Such actions will weaken investor confidence in the U.S. dollar. The BTC critic emphasized, “Bitcoin may end up destroying the dollar after all, not because it replaces the dollar as a global reserve currency, but because the U.S. government embraces Bitcoin, prints trillions of dollars to buy it, and fuels a larger bubble that squanders the nation’s wealth.” Additionally, the Bitcoin critic stated that BTC’s growth reached its $100,000 milestone, not because of organic market demand, but due to political lobbying and government support. In Schiff’s view, this government-backed momentum could push the U.S. into an economic bubble. More so, Peter Schiff insisted that the $100, 000 milestone would never come to pass without the Government’s influence. It's ironic that #Bitcoin only hit $100k by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government. Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn't be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 5, 2024 However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed a different opinion, stating that Bitcoin is more comparable to gold than the U.S. dollar. He emphasized that Bitcoin, like gold, is a speculative asset and not a direct competitor to the dollar. Powell’s comments highlight Bitcoin’s increasing role as an inflation hedge, similar to gold. The Risks of Trump’s Proposed Bitcoin Reserve Former President Donald Trump has proposed a crypto advisory council to create a national Bitcoin reserve. However, Schiff has criticized this move, warning that if the U.S. government buys large amounts of Bitcoin, it could destabilize the dollar. Trump’s idea of building a Bitcoin reserve involves the U.S. purchasing large amounts of Bitcoin annually, potentially accumulating up to one million BTC. According to Schiff, this plan could shift focus away from traditional assets like gold, weakening the dollar’s position in global trade. If the U.S. were to sell off gold reserves to fund the Bitcoin purchase, Peter Schiff believes it could spark a financial crisis. The move could signal to global markets that Bitcoin is a more viable store of value than the U.S. dollar. This could lead to a loss of confidence in the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, diminishing the dollar’s global dominance. In addition, the ongoing efforts by BRICS nations to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar could further exacerbate Peter Schiff’s concerns. The BRICS bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has been actively exploring alternatives to the dollar in international trade. In response, Trump has threatened harsh measures, including 100% tariffs on BRICS exports.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

On the way up, March’s high is the next obstacle to keep in mind for a bigger price movement. During the November rally, which sent many altcoins to a new high, Jup posted notable gains but later faced tough resistance at $1.32 after recovering nicely from a local bottom. The price pulled back in the mid-month and reestablished support around the key $1 level. Bouncing off this key level in the late month, the price increased slowly and slightly broke above the mentioned resistance that stopped the bulls during last month’s rally. Following that breakout, the bulls gained more control and now aim for March’s high. Meanwhile, the higher high and higher low pattern is still looking intact on the daily timeframe. A break above the current yearly high should facilitate a huge rally toward $3 in the short term. Rejecting the yearly high might cause a little setback in the market before rising back. Whichever way, the bulls are currently gaining dominance. If they lose control of the market, we may see a temporal pause in buying. But as it stands, Jup looks poise for a big move and from the look of things, the price will likely explode soon. JUP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview An immediate resistance level for a test is $1.49. Moving higher, the next level to watch is $1.623 and $1.85, followed by a break to $2 and potentially $2.5. The broken $1.32 level is now considered as close support in case of a pullback. If the price rolls back under this level, lower levels to keep in mind for support are $1.2 and $0.982. Key Resistance Levels: $1.49, $1.623, $1.85 Key Support Levels: $1.32, $1.2, $0.982 Spot Price: $1.35 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

But data shows they're gobbling up a growing amount of the crypto economy too. The sector — powered by the likes of dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) — made up 3.16% of the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies on Dec. 1, up from 1.3% at the beginning of the year, according to a new report from crypto exchange CEX.IO. If you exclude crypto titans bitcoin ( BTC ) and ether ( ETH ), memecoin market share jumps to 11.21% from 4.2%. That equates to big dollars: more than $140 billion of market value, per CoinGecko data , stashed in cryptocurrencies that don't pretend to have any utility. Extremely volatile by nature, they tend to be named after animals, viral internet jokes and political figures or events. As bitcoin topples the $100,000 threshold for the first time, memecoins are also rocketing higher. Dogecoin has soared 168% since Donald Trump's election spurred throughout the crypto market. Dogecoin is now the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $64 billion, according to CoinDesk data . The question is whether this is just how things work in the early stages of a bull market these days, or a harbinger that things have gotten overheated. ""In previous cycles, memecoins typically experienced their largest capital rotation toward the end of the post-halving bull run,"" Alexandr Kerya, vice president of product management at CEX.IO, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Halving"" refers to the once-every-four-years event — the most recent one was early in 2014 — when the reward for mining bitcoin gets slashed by 50%, which often correlates with crypto gains. ""However, this cycle stands out due to the significant rise in memecoin influence occurring well before the halving, and persisting even during bitcoin’s consolidation mid-year,"" Kerya added. The oldest memecoin, dogecoin, was created as a joke in 2013 and gained significant attention during the bull market that ended in 2021 as Tesla CEO Elon Musk repeatedly posted about it on social media. Other dog-themed coins, like SHIB, rode on DOGE's coat-tails and reached billions of dollars of valuation. Over time, memecoins came to be considered as a crypto investment category in their own right, in the same vein as decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, artificial intelligence tokens or privacy coins. ""While memecoins may eventually reach a plateau, similar to DeFi, the market is still in the process of determining where that equilibrium will be established,"" Kerya wrote. Eating up market share The memecoin sector underwent explosive growth early this year, the report said, when the daily number of projects deployed on Pump.fun — a Solana-based crypto project that makes it easy for users to launch tokens — went from a few dozen a day in February to thousands per day in March. Nowadays, over 60,000 memecoins are created daily, half of them through Pump.fun, the report said. As a sector, memecoins saw a 330% increase in their combined market capitalization over the period from Jan. 1 to Dec. 1, the report said. For comparison, bitcoin is up 140% since the beginning of the year, while ether is up 71%. Memecoin trading volume grew 979% in the same period, and now accounts for 5.27% of the entire crypto market's volume. Furthermore, memecoins retained significant volume in June while other sectors of the crypto economy saw declines. ""As a gateway for new investors, the growth of memecoins highlights the increasing influence of retail-driven narratives in the crypto market. As a sentiment bet, it reflects market optimism and the anticipation of a continuation of the post-halving rally,"" Kerya wrote. ""However, with increased share of memecoins, it also highlights the potential for the faster appearance of speculative bubbles. While this could amplify the intensity of a bull run, it might also shorten its duration."" The memecoin sector has changed over the years. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu dominated trading volume and market capitalization in 2021. In contrast, 2024 has seen a wide variety of newer memecoins — such as dogwifhat ( WIF ), Brett ( BRETT ), Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) and Popcat ( POPCAT ) — crack (or come close to) the top 100 coins by market cap. And whereas the majority of the largest memecoins were dog-themed up until March, cat-themed and AI-themed tokens have been stealing market share from dog tokens. Political memecoins also fared well into the U.S. election in November, after which they saw an 80% drop in trading volume. The networks on which trading activity occurs have also shifted. Dogecoin has its own proof-of-work blockchain, which mimics the Bitcoin network's. Ethereum-based memecoins such as pepe ( PEPE ) and MAGA ( TRUMP ) have also seen some popularity. But Solana, thanks to Pump.fun, is the big winner of the memecoin craze in 2024; the network accounts for 30% of the sector’s trading volume, and 15% of memecoin market cap is based on it. However, Telegram’s TON network’s memecoin trading volume grew 750 times in the last six months, even though the blockchain still only accounts for 1% of the total memecoin market cap. ""Given memecoins' ability to boost retail involvement and revenue generation for DeFi platforms, 2025 could see stronger integrations between launchpads and decentralized exchanges to capitalize on this trend,"" Kerya wrote. ""However, in ecosystems like Solana, heavy reliance on memecoins has raised concerns and could eventually backfire, straining its broader development.""",Markets|memecoins|Dogecoin|Shiba Inu|Solana|Telegram Open Network,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-05 21:25:49

It looks prepared for another rally while showing signs of strength on the day. Last month’s trading marked a historic moment for many Doge holders as the price rallied by more than 200% to reach a new milestone after three years of trading. Unfortunately, exhaustion set in and the buying pressure cooled off, ending that month in a neutral mode. The start of this month has been relatively indecisive as the leading meme coin subjected to a consolidation phase. While the next major move remains unknown, the bullish structure remains intact on the daily chart. A push above the consolidation phase should activate more upsurge. Anticipating the next move, the key $1 level is the target price to watch in the near term. A surge through this key level should trigger a bigger rally on the macro level. In the opposite direction, dropping off the consolidation phase could lead to a major retracement before deciding on the next move. Once it finds a solid ground, we can expect a bounce back. Considering the latest positive sentiment surrounding the market, the price is more likely to go bullish than bearish. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing above $0.48, Doge’s next price target would be $0.6, followed by $0.75. If the price flips those levels, the next area of interest for the bulls would be $0.9. If the price breaks below $0.35, the immediate support level to watch for a retracement is $0.298. Failure to bounce off this support could bring us to a low of $0.229. Another support level to keep in mind is $0.18.

To read full editions, subscribe . Solana Foundation’s head of strategy Austin Federa announced he would be departing the nonprofit to found DoubleZero, a network of fiber and subsea cables meant to establish a faster and more performant “new internet.” Federa had been at Solana Labs and Foundation for nearly four years, becoming one of Solana’s more recognizable public figures. He’s now founding DoubleZero — which will start by supporting Solana — alongside cofounders Mateo Ward and Andrew McConnell. Jito CEO Lucas Bruder called the startup “the most interesting experiment in crypto.” DoubleZero is an ambitious and potentially category-defining project, but I think it could be thought of for now as decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) for the internet. Individuals in the DoubleZero network contribute fiber optic links, which are basically cables that transmit data with light pulses, to a network that can filter out data before it gets to blockchain validators and RPCs. This all seems like it will be incentivized with a native token and enforced with proof-of-stake slashing, but DoubleZero’s white paper does not explicitly mention what form its “rewards” might take. Where will DoubleZero find all this unused fiberoptic cable, you might ask? The project’s white paper argues that there is “substantial” spare fiber in the world. This comes from the hundreds of terabits per second modern fiber can handle, “dark fiber” that has been installed but sits unused, and enterprises purchasing more fiber capacity than they need to prepare for doomsday scenarios. If all this unused fiber joined DoubleZero’s rewards-based network, it could build a faster new internet just with existing real-world infrastructure. Part of the impetus to create DoubleZero is that fast blockchains like Solana aren’t slowed down by how nice of hardware the blockchain’s software is being run on — they’re kneecapped by the fact that blockchain data is sent over the public internet where it is mixed with web traffic that doesn’t need to run as fast as a blockchain. As things stand, blockchain validators have to use some of their computing resources to filter out spam and deduplicate transactions. DoubleZero and its network of fiberoptic links will look to be a “common shield” for local validators, so all of their resources can go toward building and verifying blocks. DoubleZero’s white paper says layer-1 blockchains are the best use case for the network, but outside of blockchain, content delivery networks, games, large language models, and enterprises could all benefit. In recent weeks, Solana’s community has taken up that mantra of increasing bandwidth and reducing latency. To paraphrase Michael Jordan, Federa and his cofounders took that personally.

Some digital currencies are showing signs of explosive growth just in time for the holidays.

Bitcoin (BTC): The First Cryptocurrency and Its Market Potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto as a digital cash system. It operates on blockchain technology, enabling decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authorities like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where participants solve complex puzzles to validate exchanges and earn bitcoins as rewards. The network has a capped supply of 21 million bitcoins, and every four years, a ""halving"" event reduces miners' rewards by half. This scarcity model can impact mining profitability and network stability. Bitcoin's technology offers resilience against fraud and has potential for reshaping financial systems. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin remains attractive due to its pioneering status and growing acceptance in mainstream finance. Ethereum: Advancing Decentralized Applications with Proof-of-Stake Ethereum is a leading blockchain platform known for its smart contracts and extensive decentralized application ecosystem. Operating on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism since the Merge in 2022, it supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for governance and utility, while ETH remains essential for transaction fees. The upcoming sharding phase aims to improve scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) facilitates transactions, rewards stakers, and serves as a tradable asset and collateral. With ongoing technological advancements, Ethereum continues to demonstrate significant potential in the blockchain sector. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. It was created to be fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Transactions are processed without a central authority, making them secure and irreversible. XRP does not require a bank account for settlements. It was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. At launch, 100 billion XRP were created, with 80 billion given to Ripple for development. Ripple uses XRP to enhance liquidity and supports the ecosystem by placing 55 billion XRP in escrow. XRP aims to make payment transfers across currencies seamless. In the current market, XRP offers potential due to its speed and low transaction costs, making it attractive for global payments. Conclusion While BTC, ETH, and XRP offer stability, their short-term potential is limited. DOGEN, crafted for those seeking luxury and success, presents a unique opportunity. Expected to grow by 700% by the end of presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN is building a community of leaders. Early adopters gain exclusive benefits and perks.

Traders are taking positions to prepare for a potential pullback after the historic rally. Options data reveals a massive increase in demand for puts, contracts that allow the holder to sell Bitcoin at a fixed price within a set timeframe. Amberdata shows that puts with strike prices at $95,000 and $100,000 have seen the largest open interest over the past 24 hours. Traders are also snapping up puts at even lower levels, with $75,000 and $70,000 strike prices gaining popularity, Bloomberg reported . According to Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, these positions are primarily set to expire between late December and late February. He explained that this timeline aligns with the market’s expectations for potential surprises following Bitcoin’s sudden price surge. Funding rates signal high leverage Despite the hedging activity, bullish sentiment remains strong. Bitcoin’s funding rate, a critical metric for gauging leverage in perpetual futures contracts, is nearing record highs. This means that traders are aggressively leveraging long positions, betting on further price increases. On the options side, short-dated calls with strike prices between $100,000 and $110,000 have seen a significant spike in activity. Overnight, over $2 million was spent on call spreads between $110,000 and $160,000, set to expire in late January, according to Wintermute OTC trader Jake Ostrovskis. Elevated funding rates often precede corrections, as seen during Bitcoin’s rally in March, where funding rates hit an annualized high of 145% on Deribit. Institutional traders are also playing a big role in the current market dynamics. CME futures, a preferred tool for institutional investors in America, are trading at insanely huge premiums. Offshore exchanges, alongside new options tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, have seen increased activity as well. At press time, Bitcoin has actually already corrected a little. It is now worth $98,772.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world!🚀 Dogecoin Set to Soar: Bullish Indicators Point to Major Breakout Dogecoin is trading between $0.3868 and $0.4724, showing steady growth with a 7.59% increase over the past week. The 1-month price change of 175.53% highlights strong upward momentum. With the 10-day moving average at $0.4143 nearing the 100-day average of $0.4234, a bullish crossover is possible. The RSI at 52.17 indicates room for further gains before reaching overbought levels. Breaking above the nearest resistance at $0.5042 could propel Dogecoin to the next level of $0.5898, a potential rise of 16.97%. As altcoin season approaches and the market bullish, Dogecoin could be poised for significant growth. Cardano on the Rise: ADA Eyes $1.35 Amid Bullish Momentum Cardano has been showing strong upward movement, with its price ranging between $0.96 and $1.25 recently. Over the past week, ADA has surged by 27.6%, and an impressive 267.87% in the past month. The Relative Strength Index stands at 52.61, indicating potential for more growth. With the nearest resistance level at $1.35, a break above this could propel ADA towards the second resistance at $1.64. If this momentum continues, we could see gains of over 30% from current levels. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $1.21, suggesting bullish sentiment. Cardano looks poised for significant growth as the altcoin season unfolds. NEAR Protocol Surges 100% in a Month: Poised for Further Growth? After surging over 100% in the past month, NEAR Protocol is showing strong momentum. The current price hovers between $6.17 and $7.46, breaking above the 100-day simple moving average at $7.03. With the nearest resistance at $8, a rally past this level could lead to the next target at $9.30. The relative strength index at 56.69 suggests there is room for further upward movement. If the bullish trend continues, NEAR could rise another 20% to reach its next resistance. The recent 13.12% gain over the week supports this positive outlook. The altcoin season may boost NEAR even more. Bonk (BONK) Poised for Significant Gains as Altcoin Season Nears Bonk (BONK) is showing strong signs of potential growth. Over the past month, its price has surged by over 136%, indicating rising investor interest. Trading between $0.00004096 and $0.00005010, BONK is nearing its nearest resistance level at $0.00005412. A break above this could lead to gains of over 20%, aiming for the next resistance at $0.00006326. Technical indicators support this upward momentum: the MACD is positive, and the RSI at 53.95 suggests there's room for growth before overbought conditions occur. While the stochastic is slightly high at 80.67, the overall trend points upwards. With the altcoin season approaching, BONK could be poised for significant gains. Conclusion While DOGE, ADA, NEAR, and BONK have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out, designed for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, building a community of leaders and offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

To read full editions, subscribe . Jobs week continues with the latest initial claims report released this morning. The data came in a bit mixed, but is overall consistent with the 13-week moving average. These numbers are also the first we are getting in the holiday season, which is known as a volatile period . Initial jobless claims rose in the week ended Nov. 30, coming in at 224,000. This was a bit higher than analysts’ expectations of 215,000+ from the week prior, which was upwardly revised to 217,500. States with the biggest increases in initial claims include Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The overall 13-week moving average for initial claims is 226,000. Continuing claims eased a bit from 1.9 million a week prior to 1.87 million last week. Analysts had expected no change. Expectations for a 25-basis point interest rate cut later this month eased on the report. Fed funds futures markets now price in a 29.9% chance of Fed officials leaving interest rates unchanged, up from 21.9% on Wednesday. Stocks dipped a bit following the release, before paring gains later in the session. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were trading relatively flat midway through Thursday’s session, down 0.04% and 0.06%, respectively, at 2 pm ET. Bitcoin meanwhile hovered in the $101,000 range this afternoon, sustaining its rally sparked Tuesday evening when the largest cryptocurrency broke $100,000 for the first time ever. More on that, and what we can expect next, below. We’ll need to see more Goldilocks data tomorrow in the November jobs report, which will be released at 8:30 am ET.

Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has identified a pivotal pattern on the DOGE/USD daily price chart, suggesting an imminent surge. Will Dogecoin Price Confirm The Breakout Today? The daily chart of Dogecoin reveals an ascending triangle formation that has been developing over recent weeks. This pattern is typically considered a bullish continuation signal, characterized by a horizontal upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. The formation indicates accumulating buying pressure, as each price retracement becomes shallower—implying that bulls are willing to buy at higher lows. The top horizontal line of the triangle sits at approximately $0.44, a level that has been tested multiple times and serves as a significant barrier for upward movement. The ascending support trendline begins around $0.34 and rises gently, forming the triangle’s lower boundary and highlighting increasing support levels. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Mirrors Last Cycle, The Surge To $4 Begins At Week’s End Rekt Capital emphasizes the importance of the current price action, stating: “Dogecoin has followed every Bitcoin thus far. Now retesting the top of the Ascending Triangle as support. Successful retest here is crucial to precede a confirmed breakout.” If this retest solidifies the triangle’s upper resistance as a new support level, it could pave the way for a substantial price increase. The potential breakout target can be calculated by measuring the maximum height of the triangle—from the base near $0.34 to the top at $0.44—and projecting it upwards from the breakout point. This suggests that Dogecoin could potentially reach or exceed the $0.54 mark. Dogecoin Price Analysis (4-Hour Chart) Another prominent crypto analyst, Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper), has provided insights based on the 4-hour DOGE/USD chart. He notes: “DOGECOIN/usdt 4 hour: DOGE still consolidating, for almost 1 month now, but this flawless ascending channel is filling out nicely and the breakout is going to be EPIC, just wait.” The chart illustrates an ascending channel pattern, characterized by two parallel upward-sloping lines containing the price action. This pattern is recognized as bullish, formed by higher lows and higher highs. The Dogecoin price has been oscillating between these lines, with the lower line acting as support and the upper line as resistance.

Key levels to watch include: The lower boundary support sits around $0.40. The upper boundary resistance is near $0.52, a potential catalyst for Dogecoin’s next major move. The price target following an ascending channel breakout can be estimated by measuring the channel’s height at its widest part and extending that distance upward from the breakout point. This projection suggests that DOGE could rise towards $0.64. Adding to the technical signals, there could be a major catalyst for DOGE price today, December 5th. As reported by NewsBTC, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are set to address members of Congress. They are expected to present key proposals under the auspices of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This development could have a substantial impact on the Dogecoin price, as Elon Musk’s involvement with the memecoin has historically influenced market sentiment. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.44.
