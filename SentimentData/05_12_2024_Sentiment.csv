His prediction has thrilled the XRP community, who are now excited about the potential. However, the analyst has also underlined a new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , with an even better prospect. He insists that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token will yield higher returns than the XRP price, which is poised to reach $28. XRP Price To Touch $28 Soon, Analyst Claims After correctly predicting that the Dogecoin price will surge massively in 2021, the renowned analyst has once again stated that the XRP price is on its way to $28. The Ripple community has welcomed this news with excitement, as the XRP prive touching $28 will yield significant profits for investors. According to data on CoinGecko, the XRP price is $1.46. A potential surge to $28 will transform investors’ finances by 1,845%. Despite the Dogecoin analyst’s prediction, chances of the XRP price touching $28 soon are low, as the altcoin is struggling with spikes and dips. The Dogecoin analyst, however, named an emerging token with a better prospect than the XRP price: WallitIQ (WLTQ). Interestingly, the token is trading at a low price, as it is still in its presale stages. Investors who want higher returns at a low cost are already storming the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. Analyst Claims The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Token Holds Better Prospect Than XRP Price Hitting $28 According to an analyst who predicted the historical Dogecoin price surge, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token holds better prospects than the XRP price hitting $28. The Dogecoin analyst insists that WallitIQ (WLTQ) has the potential to surge by 17,000% in the bull run. This means investors holding the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token could accrue 17,000% profit in the current bull market. Since this prediction, investors have caught FOMO and are rapidly joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. The presale has raised over $1.3 million and is still fast increasing every day. Priced at only $0.0171 per token, investors can still buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token before it sells out. With the demand increasing daily, the presale is poised to sell out in a few days. Beyond its rewarding presale, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) potential lies in its unique features that make storing and transacting cryptocurrencies smooth and easy. As a decentralized crypto wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) allows investors to store their cryptocurrencies without hassle. It is developed with cutting-edge AI technology to create a secure and productive environment for crypto investors and holders. To verify its robust security, SolidProof , a top blockchain audit firm, has audited its smart contract and found no irregularities. Not to mention, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a significant milestone for the Ethereum token. WallitIQ (WLTQ) incorporates Escrow Connect (AI-Einstein) , an inventive security feature that provides top-notch protection for investors’ assets, into its platform. This security feature uses advanced authentication, making sure that every connection between investors’ wallets and dApps or web3 websites is secure. This way, investors’ assets are safe from phishing attempts and malicious activity. Investors are provided with AI-powered smart suggestions on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) crypto wallet. The AI technology analyzes real-time data, offering investors actionable insights to assist them in various tasks. These tasks include selecting the right transaction fees, choosing staking opportunities, deciding when to buy or sell holdings, etc. Final Thoughts While the XRP price surge promises investors a potential return of 1,845%, the new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ), will provide a higher return potential of up to 17,000% on money invested and at a lower cost. Moreover, the analyst is renowned for his accurate predictions in the crypto space, notably his Dogecoin price surge forecast. Consequently, investors who want enormous returns at a low price should buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token now!

Its performance was boosted by its newly launched AI-integrated products, which analysts also cited in optimistic fiscal forecasts for 2025. In late October, the customer relationship management (CRM) software heavyweight launched Agentforce, a suite of autonomous AI agents that augment employees and handle service, sales, marketing, and commerce tasks. Impressive Agentforce outing and positive forecast for 2025 In the early hours of morning trading, Salesforce shares hit $368.7, a record high that resulted in a potential addition of $35 billion to its current market valuation of $316.85 billion. Many analysts raised their price targets because of their confidence in the stock, according to LSEG data. Salesforce stock went up 26% this year, with a new median price target of $380 representing an upside of about 15%. Other US tech company stocks in the cloud space have also seen surges in their stock prices. For example, Oracle saw a 3.2% rise, while ServiceNow gained 3.5%. Others like Datadog and Snowflake both saw a 4% rise. Expectations for Salesforce’s revenue for the 2025 fiscal year have slightly increased by $100 million, increasing to a new range between $37.8 billion to $38 billion compared to its previous forecast of $37.7 billion to $38 billion. The company also beat analyst revenue estimates, which rose to $9.44 billion during the third quarter of this year. While its steady growth continues to impress, analysts expect increasing enterprise adoption of Salesforce’s solutions to help the company to a steady double-digit percentage growth performance. Salesforce enters a competitive autonomous AI agent market With Agentforce, Salesforce enters the race for stakes in the supply of autonomous AI agents that help businesses complete tasks. It enters competition with the likes of Microsoft, and a rivalry is already developing between both companies. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, called out Microsoft in October on X (Twitter) , saying the latter’s Copilot does work and doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. He also added in a press release that Agentforce is the third wave of AI and actively drives customer success. When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it’s disappointing. It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are… — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) October 17, 2024 A week before Agentforce’s release, Microsoft announced that it would be enabling customers to build autonomous AI agents through its Copilot studio in the following month, which was November. So far, Salesforce’s Agentforce seems to have delivered on its promise. Bullish on its early success, Salesforce has gone on to project that its AI product will continue to close more deals as it has already delivered 200 deals since its launch. Other than the success of its Agentforce AI, Salesforce’s high-performing data cloud was another major contributor to the company’s strong quarter. To meet up with increasing demand for Agentforce, Salesforce executives are reportedly planned to hire 1400 new staff members in the fourth quarter.

According to a new report by Fox Business, anonymous sources familiar with the matter say that Trump is considering Boring to take the reins of the regulatory agency, partially due to her ability to be conversant and telegenic in presenting financial topics to the public. Other top contenders for the job include Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham, who both currently serve as Commissioners for the CFTC, as well as Jill Sommers, a former Commissioner of the agency who currently serves as the chief of the derivatives practice group at Patomak Global Partners, according to the report. Neal Kumar, a former special counsel to the CFTC and the current co-head of the commodities and derivatives practice at Willkie Farr and Gallagher, is also in the running. Earlier this year, the Chamber of Commerce – with Boring at its helm – argued that Democratic lawmakers Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown were attempting to take down the crypto industry by proposing bills to make it comply with the same anti-money laundering laws that apply to traditional finance. At the time, Boring penned a letter to Brown asking him to kill the bill. Last year, Boring predicted that Bitcoin ( BTC ) would hit a price tag of $1 million by 2029 if its adoption continued at the rate it was going. According to the CEO, a combination of a spike in demand and a lack of supply will push the crypto king to higher prices during the next few years. Bitcoin is trading for $94,944 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.

While Bitcoin remains relatively flat above the $97K level, the altcoin market is now back in focus among retail traders and analysts, raising expectations of an altseason. According to Google Trends, the search interest for the term “altcoins” hit 100 in early December. This increase is not a steady growth because it has been observed in the course of 2023. In November, searches reached a high of 93 and then declined to 56 mid-month, which coincided with the market’s response to Donald Trump’s announcement of his presidential candidacy and Bitcoin’s record value. In the past, similar search volume surges have pointed to the involvement of the retail investor, an essential component of the cryptocurrency price movements. The last similar peak was observed during the 2016/2017 bull cycle, which means that the cycle of interest in altcoins is repeating when the BTC price is stable. Several other digital assets have come to light as the top performers in the current market cycle. XRP and XLM have each more than quadrupled this month but are still down from their all-time highs. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX) have hit new highs in the market, indicating strong market activities. Altcoin season indicators Crypto analysts are paying attention to these trends in order to determine the general mood in the market. According to Jamie Coutts, the Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, the market dominance of Bitcoin is not the only sign of an altcoin rally. Instead, market breadth, the number of assets trading above their Bitcoin counterparts, paints a different picture. Coutts also notes that the Altseason Indicator, which currently sits at 67%, means that altcoins are in the consolidation phase. However, other analysts, including Daan Crypto Trades, say that the true altcoin season starts when this metric is above 75%. However, the indicator has not reached high enough levels to suggest that the altcoin season has started. The Alt Season Index has been rising at a rapid pace in the past week. It's now sitting at 67, which means that 67% of the top 50 alts outperformed #Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Above 75%+ it's officially labelled as ""Alt Season"". https://t.co/3Z87crI8cx pic.twitter.com/qfHU6dhpSo — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) December 2, 2024 According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the transfer of assets from Bitcoin to altcoins is no longer the main factor that moves the market. Rather, the increase in trading volume of the altcoins is being driven by stablecoin and fiat pairs. He stated, “Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” This futher suggests the shift to real-world application and unique features of the altcoins.

Deaton, a strong critic of the SEC leadership under Gary Gensler, called for changes to make the agency more transparent toward the crypto industry. John Deaton Urges Immediate Reforms at SEC, Calls for Action from Paul Atkins In a recent blog post on X , John Deaton emphasized the urgent need for reform at the SEC, particularly under the leadership of Paul Atkins. Deaton called on Atkins to take decisive action on Day 1, starting with the firing of individuals involved in the Debt Box fiasco. He pointed to the necessity of removing officials who had engaged in misconduct under Gensler’s leadership. Deaton stressed that if Atkins doesn’t take immediate steps to replace certain SEC personnel, it would indicate he was not the right choice for the role. The Pro-XRP lawyer stated, “If Paul Atkins doesn’t fire, or at least demote, certain individuals and completely dismantle – that is, do away with – the crypto unit, he’s not the right pick. Period!” Deaton also highlighted the importance of reshaping the SEC’s leadership to better align with a pro-crypto agenda. He argued that Paul Atkins should not inherit the appointments made by Gensler, stating that a fresh perspective was needed. This includes appointing individuals who can foster a balanced regulatory environment that supports innovation while protecting investors. Deaton’s comments reflect a broader desire for a leadership change within the agency, particularly after Gensler’s tenure. However, earlier on, the XRP lawyer expressed support for the new SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, praising his pro-crypto stance and commitment to reducing regulatory burdens. Deaton emphasized that Atkins’ leadership would restore balance and transparency to the SEC Crypto Unit Dissolution Proposal In his call for reform, John Deaton advocated for the complete disbandment of the SEC’s crypto unit. He argued that the existence of a separate crypto unit was unnecessary and that the SEC should instead operate a general fraud unit that handles all types of fraud. Deaton emphasized that this change would streamline regulatory efforts and prevent overreach by the agency. Deaton also suggested that Paul Atkins make clear on Day 1 that decentralized finance (DeFi) and self-custody should not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. In addition, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed strong support for the new US SEC Chair. Garlinghouse echoed John Deaton’s sentiments regarding the need for clearer regulations and less hostility toward the crypto industry.

The chairman of the Federal Reserve (The Fed), the central bank of the United States, has publicly called Bitcoin ( BTC ) a competitor for gold due to the aspect of preserving the value of money rather than using it as a currency. “It’s just like a gold only it’s virtual. People are not using it as form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold,” Powell mentioned on The New York Times DealBook Summit 2024 posted video on YouTube. He also noted that the growing crypto industry should find a position that is suitable for the conventional banking system, which is his concern, and that it must be safe and supervised. Although the central bank does not regulate crypto directly, Powell aims for the people who are involved in these digital assets to have consumer protections, no matter what the crypto-product they hold. Powell also claimed that he does “not at all” hold any crypto, after being asked by the American journalist and author on that occasion, Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Seasonality and high RSI suggest the coin may be taking a breather. Bitcoin's Dominance in the crypto market has fallen from 60% to 55% in just two weeks. BRRR is currently trading at a very small discount to net asset value. The fund has not benefitted from Grayscale fee flight to the same degree as other spot ETFs. After a four-month rally, the market has taken Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from a low of $49k in early August up to $99.7k in late November. An epic tease, perhaps. With many, myself included, expecting a $100k BTC price, crypto's top coin is taking a breather. Have we already seen the top for this cycle? I have my doubts about that, though I don't think the top is as far away as others seem to believe. But with this recent pullback in the orange coin and another month of on-chain activity in the books, I think it's worth updating readers with how I'm seeing the ball currently. In this article, we'll look at chain usage data, seasonality, market dominance, and assess whether the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BRRR ) is the right financial product for investors who want long-term exposure to BTC. On Chain Data Token Terminal If you'd like to see a picture of 'Gresham's Law' in one chart, the one above might suffice. Since September 2023, Bitcoin's price has surged while monthly active addresses have fallen off a cliff. At 9 million active addresses during the month of November, monthly active addresses (or MAAs) on Bitcoin have fallen by 43% year over year while the price of the coin has nearly tripled. I've made this case ad nauseam at this point, but my personal view is that less people using Bitcoin is only sustainable if average transaction fees remain elevated to counter both the declining usage and the declining coin issuance long term. Otherwise, the hash rate is at risk of collapse as ledger validation loses incentive. Thus, my view is investors are better off if monthly fees trend up. Token Terminal For the month of November, Bitcoin produced $38.3 million in fees. This was a 19.2% decline from the $47.4 million fees produced in October and a 73% decline from the $142.1 million produced from transaction fees in November 2023. The general trend in transactions each month has been higher going back to January. That said, there was a 21% MoM decline in November as Bitcoin processed 16.1 million transactions - down from 20.5 million in October. November 2024 transactions were also slightly behind the 16.4 million in November 2023. Token Terminal The average transaction fee was essentially flat month over month from $2.38 in October to $2.41 in November. TPS fell month over month from 7.7 to 6.2. All things considered, network usage was down in November by most important metrics. As has been the case for some time, Bitcoin is being used primarily as a fiat hedge rather than as a peer to peer payment network. Of course, none of that means the price of the coin will go down. If anything, it's indicative of a broad crunch on supply. But I believe there are additional factors to consider. Seasonality & Bitcoin Dominance In previous articles for Seeking Alpha, I've noted the terrific historical setup for Bitcoin seasonality in the fourth quarter - particularly in years of and following halving events. October and November have notoriously been terrific months for Bitcoin gains, December is much less clear: TrendSpider Going back the last 11 years, Bitcoin has a 45% chance of delivering a positive return in December. Despite the month generally being a toss up from a gain or loss standpoint, the mean return is 8%, which still makes December a solid month for Bitcoin on paper. But BTC is typically feast or famine in December. Going back to 2011, December has resulted in a single digit percentage return in either direction just 4 times. So it's a 'go big or go home' kind of month historically. TrendSpider We've also seen Bitcoin generate positive returns in each of the last three months between September and November. Bitcoin has actually generated positive returns for four consecutive months starting in September three different times in the past. But I would caution against expecting that to happen again. Bitcoin is very much a part of the traditional investment world now and that puts the coin at risk of profit taking to end the year and the quarter, in my view. Furthermore, judging by indicators like the RSI, there are signs that BTC is technically overbought on several time frames. Exhaustion in the BTC move is potentially why we're seeing so much action in altcoins like XRP ( XRP-USD ). CoinMarketCap 'Alt season' may finally be upon us. Over the last decade, we've seen the general trend in long term 'Bitcoin Dominance' has been down. As calculated by CoinMarketCap.com, Bitcoin Dominance of the $3.45 trillion crypto market cap has fallen from 60% on November 10th down to 55% on December 3rd. If that was indeed the cycle peak for Bitcoin Dominance on 11/10, it would be yet another lower high in the long-term trend dating back the last two halving cycles. The point is, seasonality and Bitcoin Dominance may both be signaling that the better returns from here are in the altcoins rather than in Bitcoin. BRRR In a recent article covering Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, I shared the most recent weekly capital flow data that we have from CoinShares. While the net flow in the final week of November was positive for the broader digital asset investment landscape, Bitcoin was actually down by nearly a half a billion dollars in a single week: Asset ($m) Week Flows MTD Flows YTD Flows Bitcoin -$457 $6,226 $33,912 Ethereum $634 $1,427 $2,198 Multi-asset -$16 -$25 $441 Solana -$4 $40 $110 Binance - $0 -$2 Source: CoinShares, Bloomberg, as of 11/30/24 In spite of the final week of November sales, full-month net flow for Bitcoin was enormously positive at over $6.2 billion. That brings the full-year capital flows to nearly $34 billion for Bitcoin. Despite the clear enthusiasm for this asset from the investment community, the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF has not enjoyed the same level of interest: BitcoinTreasuries With a little over 9k BTC managed by the fund, investors haven't looked to BRRR for Bitcoin allocations to the same degree that they have with other funds like the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) or the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ). There are a few different reasons why there could be relative lack of interest for BRRR, though all of these are just my own speculations. The fund originally launched with a 0.49% expense ratio after waiver expiration. That expense ratio has since been dropped down to 0.25%, which is very much in line with the rest of the market. But it's possible that early fee mispricing soured the market on BRRR. Larger funds are managed by companies like BlackRock ( BLK ), Grayscale, and Fidelity - which may give those ETFs an advantage in areas like product marketing. The fund's original manager, Valkyrie, sold to CoinShares shortly after launch, which may have also contributed to confusion in the market. Again, all of these are just guesses. It's important to keep in mind that smaller funds could potentially produce larger swings in the NAV rate than bigger funds: Data by YCharts So far, we haven't really seen BRRR decouple dramatically from the larger players in the market. That said, at market close on 12/2/24, BRRR shares could be had for a 0.25% discount to NAV, larger than both IBIT and FBTC. Closing Thoughts As far as Bitcoin specifically, I think we're witnessing a small pullback in price that will allow altcoins to have their moment. I suspect there are better gains in select alts from here. That said, I'm of the view that we have not yet seen the peak in BTC for this cycle. I still think we see a BTC price that eclipses the long-awaited six-figure level. There may be better ways to play that possibility as a trade than through BRRR shares. And I'll no doubt explore some of those opportunities in the days and weeks ahead. For long-term investment, BRRR is a fine option since the expense ratio has come down in line with the market. Especially considering the fund trades at a larger discount to NAV than peers. I am not personally long BRRR, but I'll rate it a 'buy' yet again simply on the notion that I suspect Bitcoin will continue higher in 2025.",BTC-USD|BRRR,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-04 23:12:44

Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also ready to let local government bodies sell crypto. And it will allegedly follow up by eventually allowing companies to open corporate crypto wallets . Universities to ‘Trade’ Crypto in 2025? The newspaper claimed sources had told it the FSC will release a tentatively named “Roadmap for Allowing Corporations to Open Virtual Asset-Won Accounts” before the end of this year. Critics have accused Seoul of dragging its feet on the matter, allowing American, European, and Japanese companies to steal a march on domestic firms. Many South Korean firms want to use their balance sheets to buy cryptoassets, aware of the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) -buying strategies have helped many overseas firms boost the value of their assets. South Korea's martial law turmoil strains alliance with US https://t.co/bKA1QOfTmd — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 4, 2024 However, South Korean legal conventions do not allow corporations to invest in Bitcoin or other tokens. The FSC reportedly wants to “gradually” roll out regulations that will change that. And the body reportedly wants to begin with universities, schools, and local government bodies. Several major universities have received crypto donations in recent years. But government guidance currently prevents them from selling their coins for cash. There is no law that explicitly bans public bodies and corporations from opening crypto wallet-linked bank accounts. However, regulators have told domestic banks not to accept applications from anyone except private citizens. The FSC document allegedly outlines a “Stage 1” on the roadmap, which will allow “central government ministries, local government bodies, public institutions, other non-profit organizations, and universities” to “trade” crypto. South Korea’s financial markets tumbled on Wednesday following a night of political chaos, as President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law only to withdraw the measure just hours later under pressure from lawmakers. https://t.co/SVXisTSfqp — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 4, 2024 University Wants to Make WEMIX Sale The move will allow universities such as the elite Seoul National University (SNU) to finally sell altcoins they have been holding for years. The domestic gaming firm WeMade donated a large quantity of its WEMIX (WEMIX) token to SNU back in 2022. The university has since repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Education and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to allow it to sell the coins. However, the FSC rejected all of these requests, concerned that it could lead other companies to try to promote their coins by donating them to schools. Experts say they think SNU is currently holding some 800 million won ($566,000) worth of WEMIX. WEMIX prices over the past four years. (Source: CoinMarketCap) The media outlet added that “Stage 2” of the roadmap will focus on crypto exchanges and other crypto-related businesses. An unnamed official explained: “In order to foster the virtual asset industry and increase the effectiveness of regulations, business operations such as issuance, listing, and brokerage should be carried out as if [coins] were stocks or bonds.” “Stage 3” of the roadmap will finally give most private companies the right to buy and sell crypto, although this is listed as a “mid to long-range” goal. Banks Last to Get Green Light? The final two “stages” of the roadmap will see “financial companies,” a group that likely includes banks, granted permission to access the crypto market. However, the newspaper said the FSC was “considering building safety measures” into its regulations. One of these will likely see limits placed on stock exchange-listed companies. These companies will only be allowed to “hold a small percentage of their capital” in crypto. This move, Hanguk Kyungjae wrote, will help “prevent side effects” such as the creation of “Bitcoin-themed stocks.” Crypto speculators kept Bitcoin in sight of the landmark $100,000 level in anticipation of further steps to support the sector by Trump https://t.co/cCfVdAcE07 — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) December 4, 2024 The FSC may find this to be something of an uphill battle. The Korea Exchange is already highly influenced by Bitcoin price fluctuations, with even minor shareholders in unlisted crypto exchanges experiencing high price volatility when crypto news breaks or BTC prices rise . At present, the only South Korean public bodies with fiat-tradable crypto wallets are the Prosecution Service and the National Tax Service. The tax body uses its wallets to liquidate crypto confiscated from (mainly local) tax dodgers . The prosecution mainly uses its wallets to sell the coins of convicted crypto fraudsters.

Choosing the best crypto to join this week can be a game-changer for your portfolio in this dynamic landscape. With major updates from Monero and Avalanche, alongside the exciting presale of Qubetics, there’s a lot to unpack. Monero’s focus on privacy has kept it a favourite among enthusiasts, while Avalanche’s recent price surge has brought it back into the spotlight. But the real star of the moment? Qubetics ($TICS). With its innovative solutions for financial institutions and a presale generating serious momentum, $TICS is positioning itself as a standout opportunity. This article will discuss the latest updates for Monero, Avalanche, and Qubetics, with a special spotlight on why Qubetics might be the best crypto to join this week. From Borders to Breakthroughs: Qubetics Leads the Charge The Qubetics Network is shaking things up in the financial sector by offering banks and institutions a cutting-edge blockchain solution. With $TICS, institutions can execute near-instant cross-border payments , cutting down the delays and high costs associated with traditional methods.

To top it off, Qubetics recently hosted a well-received AMA session , where they shared insights into their vision and roadmap. Want to know more? Dive into the details from their AMA—it’s worth the watch. Monero ($XMR): The Privacy Pioneer’s Latest Move Monero continues to lead the charge as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy-conscious users. With its untraceable transactions and decentralised nature, $XMR has carved out a unique space in the crypto world. Recently, Monero announced enhancements to its stealth addresses, making it even harder to link transactions to individual users. This upgrade reinforces Monero’s commitment to safeguarding financial privacy in an era of increasing surveillance. As debates around privacy and regulation heat up, Monero’s relevance and appeal remain rock solid. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Momentum Keeps Building Avalanche has been making headlines with a significant price surge. Currently trading at $46.34, $AVAX has gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes skyrocketing by 200% to hit $2.07 billion. Investors are optimistic about the coin’s potential to break the $50 mark, driven by whale accumulation and institutional interest. What’s fueling this growth? Avalanche’s scalability and low transaction costs make it a favourite for DeFi applications. As more institutional investors recognise its potential, the demand for $AVAX is expected to climb even higher. 6200+ Holders and Counting: Best Crypto to Join This Week If you’re searching for the best crypto to join this week , Qubetics’ presale is the golden ticket. In Phase 11, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.028, but that won’t last long. Each weekly phase introduces a 10% price hike, culminating in a massive 20% jump in the final stage. Over $4.3 million has already been raised, with 6200+ holders securing 266 million tokens. Here’s the kicker: $TICS is targeting $0.25 per token post-presale. That’s a staggering 783.45% ROI potential for those who act now. Should the token price climb further to $15, as predicted, a $1000 investment would reach an extraordinary $530,173.50, with an ROI of approximately 52,917.35%. With excitement building and the next phase imminent, this presale isn’t just an opportunity—it’s a must-grab for anyone looking to make serious gains. Think about it: in just a few weeks, you could hold a token primed for exponential growth. But the window is closing fast, so don’t wait. Conclusion: Your Next Move in Crypto The crypto market is brimming with opportunities, but picking the best crypto to join this week is crucial. Monero’s privacy innovations and Avalanche’s price momentum offer compelling cases for investors. But Qubetics steals the show with its transformative vision and an electrifying presale that promises unbeatable ROI potential. If you’re serious about maximising your gains and joining a project with groundbreaking utility, Qubetics is the one to watch. With $TICS poised to disrupt financial systems and a presale offering massive rewards, there’s no better time to get in on the action. Don’t just follow the trend—be part of the movement.

Popular blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence indexed the transaction on December 3. Announcing the move on X, Arkham stated: “ALERT: US GOVERNMENT MOVING $1.5 MILLION OF SHIBA INU.” Specifically, the US government transferred 54,897,092,549 SHIB tokens to the Ethereum wallet ‘0x995’. Following the transaction, the sending wallet—associated with the US government—no longer holds any SHIB tokens. The recipient wallet, now with a total crypto portfolio valued at $33 million, has retained the assets. Notably, the US government acquired these SHIB tokens through the seizure of assets from Alameda Research, the trading firm affiliated with the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. This seizure was part of a broader forfeiture action involving more than $700 million in assets due to legal issues surrounding FTX and Alameda. The SHIB tokens were among a variety of digital assets seized during this process. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could Increase 75% If It Holds Current Level – Analyst Shares Price Target Data from Arkham suggests that the recipient wallet was newly created. Its first transaction occurred recently when it received $1.061 million worth of AEGRO tokens from the same wallet that moved the SHIB tokens. Within less than two hours, the wallet also received other crypto assets from the US government-affiliated address, including 4,815 ETH (approximately $17.9 million), 13.58 million BUSD ($133 million), and 631,959 POWR ($221,000). While it remains unclear whether the US government has sold its SHIB holdings, the absence of any identified exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) addresses linked to the transaction suggests that the government may still hold the tokens. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Potential For A 130% Surge? Crypto analyst Rony Kapoor (@LearnRony) shared a comparative chart analysis between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on X, stating: “Next leg up in SHIB will be like DOGE? Shib looks like big Cup & Handle pattern forming like doge before it run turbo. Sooner or later Shiba Inu will pump!!!” The chart for DOGE illustrates a clear “Cup and Handle” formation—a bullish continuation pattern that often precedes a significant price breakout. DOGE’s handle formed near the $0.21 mark, and following a period of consolidation, the token rallied to a peak of approximately $0.48. This move represented a substantial 128% increase from the breakout point. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Similarly, SHIB’s chart indicates the potential formation of a Cup and Handle pattern, with the structure still developing. The current trading price is hovering around $0.000030, with resistance levels identified at $0.000038—the anticipated handle resistance. If SHIB follows a trajectory similar to DOGE, a successful breakout could target a price level around $0.000087, based on the proportional increase observed in DOGE’s previous movement. Technical indicators such as the Fibonacci retracement levels support this analysis. SHIB is currently trading below the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.000032. A break above this level could see SHIB targeting the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.000038. Subsequent targets include the yearly high from March at $0.00004569. Notably, the all-time high of $0.00008854 aligns closely with the projected target from the Cup and Handle pattern identified by Kapoor.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 23:43:00

33767162,[object Object],1733356824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Price To Pull An XRP Rally From Here? The Trading Similarities Are Striking,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-pull-an-xrp/,"Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price replicating the recent XRP rally . This came as the analyst highlighted similarities between Dogecoin’s recent price action and XRP’s. Dogecoin Price To Replicate XRP Rally? In an X post, Jacob Canfield suggested that the Dogecoin price could soon replicate the recent XRP rally. He stated that Dogecoin was trading similarly to XRP in the lower time frames. DOGE is holding former resistances as support and trading in a “pretty straightforward” way. Based on this, the Dogecoin price could pull an XRP rally and witness massive gains like the one that XRP has recorded in the last couple of weeks. It is worth mentioning that Dogecoin witnessed a similar rally last month. Earlier in November, DOGE recorded a parabolic rally, which led to a gain of 161% in that month. Since then, the Dogecoin price has consolidated around the $0.4 range, although it looks well-primed for another leg to the upside. Canfield’s accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin’s next leg up could take it above the $0.48 level. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $0.55 and $0.66 price levels as ones to watch out for, as that is where the 1.618 and 2.618 Fibonacci levels are, respectively. DOGE On The Verge Of A Major Move Crypto analyst Master Kenobi recently stated that the Dogecoin price was on the verge of a major move, further suggesting that the meme coin could soon replicate XRP’s rally. Master Kenobi predicted a major move as he analyzed Dogecoin’s recent price action in relation to the previous cycle. The crypto analyst noted that in the previous cycle , it took 25 days of consolidation before a significant breakout occurred. If history repeats itself, he believes that the Dogecoin price is on the verge of a major move, as it has also consolidated for a similar period since its early November rally. Master Kenobi said that the Dogecoin price is already on day 21 of this consolidation, meaning that the pump to the next level could happen in the next three to four days. The crypto analyst didn’t give specific targets for this next leg up. However, his accompanying chart showed that Dogecoin could finally hit the $1 milestone and even rally further to $2.9 . This $2.9 target could mark the top for the Dogecoin price in this market cycle, as Master Kenobi had previously predicted that the foremost meme coin would top at around $3. He also mentioned that any target beyond $5 in this market cycle is unrealistic. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.42, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Altcoin News|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-05 00:00:24

Ethereum’s price took a battering, while Pepe coin (PEPE) also lost ground. Both are recovering lost price points after a recent rally. Meanwhile, bullish signals for IntelMarkets INTL offer a jump to $0.07 as its Stage 7 concludes. IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making waves with an impressive presale, hinting at a possible surge. Analysts predict that IntelMarkets INTL, a novel AI crypto, will also ride this bullish wave. Its innovative blend of AI and DeFi, which aims to reshape the crypto trading scene, has caught investors’ attention. Tipped to outperform PEPE, the top-performing meme coin, this is a new DeFi project to watch out for. Ethereum (ETH) Price Ready to Close 2024 Over $4,000 ETH is a top altcoin, and the price of Ethereum managed to withstand the bearish markets of last week and sustain its upward momentum. The Ethereum price climbed by 4% in the past seven days but is still trading at above $3,500. With a 32% rise on the monthly chart, it cements its status as one of the top crypto coins. During the year, Ethereum prices touched a high of $4,000. While there has been a major dip since then, the current market sentiments seem likely to push it above this level in the coming days. Seven-day technical indicators like the Hull Moving Average and Momentum are at sell, while the 14-day RSI is at neutral for the short term. Community sentiment is still bullish today but is moving towards bearish at 59%. Source: CoinMarketCap Pepecoin (PEPE) Retraces After Massive Price Rally After its remarkable surge in November, PEPE started dipping, losing over 10% in price over the past week. It has recovered and experienced a rise of 2.8% over the weekend. The coin is still highly volatile, while community sentiment remains bullish. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators like the RSI are mainly neutral for day trading, while 30-day technical indicators are divided between neutral and buy for the coin. People are moving into positions with PEPE, and many are opting to accumulate IntelMarkets (INTL) for its upcoming price pump. Whales’ Find a New Winner: IntelMarkets (INTL) IntelMarkets (INTL) is a new AI crypto that is stirring up a lot of attention. Its current presale is in the news, having raised over $2.7 million. Its major growth potential and cross-AI-DeFi product utility are its core appeals, generating sustained demand. In stage seven of the ICO, a token sells for just $0.064. This low entry makes picking up the INTL token easy, while its projected gains bring whales to the presales. Providing a low entry, the projected 50x gain after its debut makes it a whale favorite—retailers are also doubling down. As it approaches its ICO, investors are betting big and overlooking top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and PEPE. Besides its significant upside potential, INTL’s future transformation of the crypto trading scene with AI puts it in the spotlight. Offering a merger of all the advantages of AI technology, blockchain, and DeFi, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels. Its first commercial application of AI technology with a proprietary Layer-1 blockchain offers access to crypto trading assets. IntelMarkets has a range of advanced processing tools to improve trading performance. Conclusion For crypto investors looking to pick up guaranteed altcoins, joining the IntelMarkets’ INTL presale is necessary. The AI Crypto token has stolen the spotlight with its ongoing crypto presale. It also benefits from steep Ethereum prices and PEPE’s volatility.

He claims that if the Bitcoin price climbed from $2 to $97,000, so could the XRP price. His outrageous prediction is shining a spotlight on XRP’s long-term potential, which is driven by increasing adoption and legal victories. However, as XRP gains traction, an undervalued altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , with high-growth potential, is emerging as a worthy rival. With its cutting-edge features, AI integration, and practical utility, RCOF is poised to mirror and possibly even outdo XRP’s gains. $97,000 XRP Price Prediction: Can it reach Bitcoin Price levels? Analysts like BowTiedBull @BowTiedBull, are increasingly optimistic about XRP’s potential to reach ambitious XRP price levels, including hitting $97,000 like the Bitcoin price. This extraordinary projection isn’t baseless; it is fueled by several factors that showcase XRP’s growing adoption and relevance in the current market. XRP’s utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments is gaining traction among banks and payment providers. This is driving demand for the token, pushing up the XRP price. Ripple’s partnerships with major financial institutions continue to strengthen XRP’s position as a cornerstone in global financial infrastructure and drive up the XRP price. These partnerships position XRP as a utility tool for financial institutions and underscore Ripple’s commitment to promoting financial inclusion. Ripple’s recent legal victory over the SEC has been pivotal in the 409% rise in the XRP price over the past month. This ruling alleviated some of XRP’s regulatory uncertainty, reigniting investor confidence and paving the way for institutional adoption. With more legal clarity, the XRP price could grow tremendously, mirroring the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin’s deflationary model, with its halving cycles, is a big contributor to the Bitcoin price growth. XRP’s capped supply and rising demand are creating scarcity. As demand grows, the XRP price could climb higher, making BowTiedBull’s $97,000 prediction more plausible. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Set to Mirror XRP Price Gains While the XRP price chases Bitcoin price-like levels, its ambitious target spotlights RCO Finance , a Ripple rival with immense potential to achieve massive returns at a fraction of the price. RCOF’s ecosystem blends AI, DeFi, and real-world utility to deliver more value and exponential growth. Its AI integration allows RCOF to provide AI-powered investment and trading tools designed to improve and streamline the investing process.

Don’t Just Watch XRP’s Rise: Ride The wave with RCOF The journey of the XRP price to similar levels as the Bitcoin price, however optimistic, might take a while (read years). Luckily, the opportunity to achieve similar gains but faster is already here with RCO Finance. Backed by cutting-edge technology, deflationary tokenomics, a SolidProof audit, and a low entry price, RCOF is set to deliver extraordinary returns that could outpace XRP’s.

The price has rallied 60 percent in the last seven days and according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP is in a strong bullish trend on the larger time frames despite encountering resistance. The analyst also observed that XRP failed to follow through on a breakout past the $2.80 level, which acted as a short-term resistance. After a brief push higher, the price quickly rejected, breaking back down. Major Resistance Around $3 XRP has encountered significant resistance near the $3 level, a crucial psychological point and also a Fibonacci extension. XRP’s all-time high (ATH) is just slightly above $3, around $3.30. This makes the $3 mark an even more critical point for the price action since it’s very close to the ATH. Typically, when the price approaches an ATH, it tends to face resistance due to the historical significance of that price point. Short-Term Pullback XRP has faced a small pullback after reaching the $3 resistance. This is normal in bullish markets, and it doesn’t mean the market is turning bearish. Short-term pullbacks can happen even during larger upward trends. Given the rejection at $3 and the current price behavior, it’s possible we could see a deeper pullback in the short term. A pullback could test lower support levels, such as $2.50 or even $2.30, providing a better entry point for those looking to re-enter long positions.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-05 00:37:00
37231256,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316526,1733359363,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37231256.jpeg,"Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools – JEETMAS, CHAINSAW",https://cryptonews.com/news/top-crypto-gainers-today-on-dextools-jeetmas-chainsaw/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) takes another look at the major $100,000 resistance zone, traders are anticipating that altcoin markets could continue heating up, and are thus flocking to micro-cap gem top crypto gainers today in the DEX markets. Bitcoin rose briefly above $99,000 on Wednesday while Ethereum (ETH) continued to close in on the $4,000 level. Other major altcoins were also on the front foot, creating great conditions for micro-cap coins to pump. Traders looking to bank a quick 10 or even 100x often flock to the highly risky DEX markets as they search for top crypto gainers today. It’s important to note – many of these newly launched micro-cap tokens are scams and pump-and-dump schemes. And even the tokens of well-intentioned projects often fall to zero. However, some new tokens that started out with market caps below $1 million ended up striking a chord in the market, and going on to achieve market caps in the $100s of millions. The prospect of finding that one 100x gem is a key reason why traders brave the risks of the highly volatile and unpredictable DEX markets. Such traders often employ tools like DEXTools as they hunt for trending tokens. Here are some of the top crypto gainers today that will likely be catching their attention. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools – Which Are They? Nothing (VOID) A new Solana meme coin called Nothing (VOID) is one of the top crypto gainers today, having rallied 3,800% in the past 24 hours to a market cap of just over $12 million, per DEXTools . VOID has seen an impressive $12 million in trading volumes since its launch earlier in the day, and has amassed a respectable $700,000 in mostly locked liquidity. That said, its lack of engagement on social media platforms like X suggest it probably won’t retain value for long. Nothing may soon reach its real value, as implied by its name. That suggests it’s not a good candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS) Another Solana meme coin amongst the top crypto gainers today is Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS), which was last up 3,300% in the past 24 hours. Per DEXTools , its market cap remained tiny at just $156,000 with tiny liquidity of around $28,200. The Christmas-themed meme coin is doing a better job of generating hype on X than Nothing, posting entertaining new memes roughly every hour. The meme coin has also paid for ads and boosts, so may stand a solid chance of reaching million dollar status. Quick 10x gains are certainly a decent probability for JEETMAS, though, as with most new meme coins, this one will likely fade to zero soon. Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW) A new Depart of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) inspired Ethereum meme coin called Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW), which appears to be referencing the idea of the D.O.G.E. taking a chainsaw to the US government in its cost-cutting efforts, is another one of the top crypto gainers today. Per DEXTools , it was last up 6,500% in the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of around $300,000 with $70,000 in liquidity. CHAINSAW could do well in the weeks ahead as the countdown to the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump in the White House begins. Once Trump arrives, the D.O.G.E will get to work. And D.O.G.E-related meme coins could do very well. Of course, that doesn’t mean CHAINSAW will perform well. There will be millions of other similar meme coins vying for attention and mind-share. Most will be abject failures. Perhaps a better way for investors to do well in the meme coin market would be to instead get involved in meme coin presales. By running a presale, a meme coin gives itself a chance to build community hype and fund marketing, product and community development initiatives. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is a great example of a new meme coin project that has had huge success in doing all of these things. The project has raised a whopping more than $70 million in funds from early investors, and is putting these funds to work to build a leading web3 ecosystem. Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution and its developers have been busily building out all manner of dApps, including a DEX, a meme coin launch platform called Pepe Pump Pad, a block explorer, a bridge and much more. Just 10 days out from the end of the presale, PEPU is currently valued at around $100 million. But this is meme coin that has a high chance of reaching billion-dollar status – it has the funds, the community, the hype, the strong use case/technology. Learn more about Pepe Unchained , and why analysts at cryptonews.com rank it as one of their top presale picks for 2024, in the below video.

The ISC token will remain functional, but other features like its points system and ecosystem integrations will cease. ISC’s co-founder, Richard, announced via X that the company would be pivoting to FxSwap full-time. According to Richard, ISC's failure to find product market fit (PMF), even after exceeding the original budget, influenced the decision to close the company. “After working for more than 2 years on ISC, this decision is heart-wrenching. Especially considering that every week, we’re ever closer to a breakthrough. ISC launched at $1.54 and is now sitting at $1.81. It works,” Richard said.

The firm stated it is keen to launch under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) while upholding the regulations. Ripple posted through their X platform : Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. ~Ripple The launch of RLUSD stablecoin is set to redefine Ripple’s primary use case, moving it beyond its “memecoin” perception. The RLUSD will battle with market giants like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC as it will feature on XRPL and Ethereum. The stablecoin can kickstart DeFi activity on XRPL if it matches a fraction of USDT’s $134 billion in circulation. December 4 was marked for the big announcement Earlier, Ripple signaled that December 4 would be a tentative launch day, anticipating regulatory clearance by then. Although the launch is delayed, Ripple is set to sell its stablecoin, the RLUSD, to the public. Such a feat will see the firm grow into a big player in New York’s regulated digital finance market and stablecoin ecosystem. In June, Ripple officially unveiled its stablecoin, which it characterizes as a 1:1 USD-pegged asset fully backed by USD deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Later in the year, the stablecoin went through beta testing on the Ethereum main net, XRP ledger, and Ripple’s decentralized blockchain. Ripple’s CEO says Paul Atkin will bring back common sense to the SEC While announcing the delayed launch, Ripple’s CEO also shared remarks about the SEC. Brad Garlinghouse supported the nomination of Paul Atkins for the SEC chairperson position. He believes that Atkins is an outstanding choice at the helm of SEC. Ripple CEO notes Atkins will bring back common sense to the agency. According to one industry source, Atkins recently voiced a desire to let GOP Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” lead on crypto policy alongside her fellow GOP Commissioner Mark Uyeda. Brad also stated that with the team, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto. He believes such changes will restore freedom of choice and spur economic growth and innovations in America.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 301,800 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the Ethereum-based decentralized oracle Chainlink ( LINK ) is poised to spark a five-wave surge to a new all-time high. Bluntz relies on the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that states a bullish asset often witnesses a five-wave rally. Says Bluntz, “Major breakout on LINK today, all you have to do is take one look at LINK/BTC before you realize that you are probably not late and still early. It underperformed pretty much everything for the entirety of the bull run and now seems to be playing turbo catch-up. Probably one of the very few I would categorize as a dino coin that isn’t complete vaporware.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that LINK will explode to a new record high of $70. At time of writing, LINK is worth $24.44. Turning to Near ( NEAR ), the analyst says he’s bullish on the Ethereum rival after it breached a diagonal resistance on its Bitcoin pair (NEAR/ BTC ). “Revenge of the dinos. NEAR/BTC pair finally broke out.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $7.42. Bluntz also thinks that the Solana ( SOL )-based meme token dogwifhat ( WIF ) is primed to outperform the broader meme sector. “Huge six-month+ basing/inverse head and shoulder structure on US dollar pair. Double daily divergences against doge and double 12-hour bull divergences against PEPE. If you are playing memes, you want to outperform DOGE, that should always be the goal.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $3.31.

A crypto analyst has underscored why this support level is crucial for Bitcoin’s next price rally, as it could set the stage for a potential retest above the $100,000 All-Time High (ATH). Bitcoin Price Retests $96,400 To Trigger Surge To $100,000 Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital took to X (formerly Twitter) on December 4 to inform his over 518,000 followers about the current Bitcoin price action and future direction. The analyst suggested that if Bitcoin successfully tests the $96,440 support level, it could trigger a price increase to $100,068. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Sharing a price chart, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin has persistently retested its series of Lower Highs, establishing them as a key support level. In his Bitcoin price chart, “Lower Highs” means that each successive high point is lower than the previous point. This development is typically observed during a downtrend. However, with Bitcoin now treating these lower highs as support, it indicates a potential shift in the market, suggesting that prices may be stabilizing after declining. Rekt Capital also highlighted that Bitcoin is producing longer downside wicks, indicating that its price declined significantly during the time frame, but buyers stepped in. The analyst emphasized that Bitcoin is currently grabbing liquidity at lower prices without breaking below the key support trendline. A liquidity grab occurs when large volumes of orders at key price levels are triggered unexpectedly. In the case of Bitcoin, “grabbing liquidity” refers to the market dipping into levels where buy orders are clustered, enabling large players to execute trades. Rekt Capital has disclosed that, as long as this trend continues, Bitcoin will eventually move back up to reclaim the $96,440 level. Recovering this crucial support will allow Bitcoin to reach and even surpass the $100,000 milestone. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Bear Case Scenario Looking at the price chart presented by Rekt Capital, several support levels are highlighted, indicating price levels that Bitcoin could fall to if it fails to reclaim the $96,440 mark. While current Bitcoin price action indicates that it could potentially reach $100,000, the analyst has suggested that if the pioneer cryptocurrency fails to hold the $96,440 support, it might retest a lower support level of around $91,070. As indicated by the red line on the price chart, $91,070 is a critical price level for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency also falls below this level, it could crash to new lows around $87,325. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $96,737, marking a 3.24% increase over the past week. A drop below the $87,300 level would represent more than a 10% crash from Bitcoin’s current value.
