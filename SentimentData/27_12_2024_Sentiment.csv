Is a 1000x Move Possible?,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-price-enters-critical-level-as-this-doge-killer-rises-is-a-1000x-move-possible/,"Dogecoin has been a major player in the crypto market since its launch, rivaling other memecoins with its wide community adoption and celebrity endorsement. However, its recent downside has faced challenges from emerging DOGE killers like PropiChain . Its revolutionary approach to tackling major real estate loopholes like inefficiencies, fraud risks, and high transaction costs has been a propeller of its token presale, which continues to attract attention from major investors. In this article, we will discuss how PropiChain could outrank the Dogecoin price and make over a 1000x move when it launches, as well as the unique features that make it stand out as a formidable competitor. The Widespread Community Adoption of Meme coins and its Impact on the Dogecoin Price Dogecoin’s continuous dominance in the market has been attributed to its passionate community, celebrity endorsements, and widespread adoption as a tipping currency. With these communities’ most loyal community support and guidance, the Dogecoin price has seen significant highs through community takeovers (CTOs) and Cabals spearheading them. Dogecoin has also experienced real-world use cases as legal tenders for charitable donations, service payments, and a niche in micropayments. However, despite its enduring popularity, Dogecoin entering a critical level has spiraled the growth of projects like PropiChain, which combines utility and innovation, to challenge its dominance and the Dogecoin price trajectory. How PropiChain Could Make a 1000x Move After Launch PropiChain’s signal to investors as one of the most prominent altcoins to outpace the Dogecoin price as a beam of hope during this critical level. Below are some unique features and how they propel its price trajectory to make over 1000x after launch. Advanced AI Technologies: PropiChain AI tools are designed to offer provisional assistance to users as they navigate the platform by providing predictive market analysis, which encompasses real-time evaluation of market trends, identification of emerging patterns, and prediction of future market behaviors. Its property filtering tools also provide sophisticated filters that consider anticipated market growth, investment potential, and properties’ historical performance irrespective of location. Metaverse Capabilities: The platform allows users to explore and invest in virtual real estate, bridging physical and digital assets. Through its virtual tours, stagings, and meetings, international investors can experiment with different layouts and designs in an immersive virtual environment and interactive experience surpassing traditional methods. RWA Tokenization: PropiChain’s approach to tokenizing assets involves digitizing properties in small and large proportions, ensuring seamless virtual transactions on a secure blockchain network. This further reduces fraud and streamlines complex processes that demand physical documentation as it democratizes access to highly valued assets to everyday investors rather than large-scale investors. Conclusion The Dogecoin Price is at a crossroads, facing challenges from innovative projects like PropiChain . With its presale already raising nearly $1M, crypto insiders are bullish about its roadmap and price trajectory to surpass DOGE. PropiChain is offering investors a chance to purchase the PCHAIN token for $0.004 in its round two presale, the lowest it will ever be before it surges after its launch. Moreover, its BlockAudit review and CoinMarketCap listing provide additional reassurance for investors. So if you are investing $1000 now, your portfolio is expected to see a massive gain of over $100,000 as it replicates the 2017 Dogecoin price, especially when it continues to gain momentum. Hurry now, and be a part of this transition before it’s too late!

What is this technology about, and how does DePIN work? Table of Contents What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? What are the DePIN options? Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? Theoretical studies in cryptocurrencies have long predicted that encryption tools currently implemented in the blockchain will be used on the Internet and impact the physical world sooner or later. Nick Szabo noted at the end of the 20th century that smart contracts can automatically manage physical objects. More than 25 years have passed, and the blockchain is firmly embedded in our lives. This is primarily due to cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to break records and is supported by significant physical infrastructure. At first glance, this confirms an actual physical presence in our world. However, the boundaries of decentralized technologies continue to expand with the advent of solutions such as DePIN. What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? DePIN meaning a Decentralized physical infrastructure network. Blockchain participants use a public ledger and cryptocurrency to build and maintain specific, real-world infrastructure projects. Simply speaking, DePIN involves using DePIN blockchain to run and sustain decentralized networks of equipment that can serve a common purpose. This enables the network to be built on decentralized, horizontal connections rather than the hierarchical approach typically seen with large infrastructure projects such as bridges or roads. Building and managing physical infrastructure networks is expensive and complex, so historically, they have been the domain of large corporations or governments with capital and resources. In contrast, DePIN encourages voluntary cooperation among participants. People can participate in DePIN networks by using their own hardware or purchasing specialized hardware for specific tasks. Options range from simple hard drives to weather stations. However, DePINs are typically built around capabilities that are available to the general public. Max Thake, co-founder of peaq, explained crypto.news that DePIN uses tokens to incentivize people to use connected hardware to offer services to other people: “Let’s imagine a smartphone-focused DePIN like Roam Network. The smartphones, owned by regular people, are the hardware component, the data on local connection quality they gather is the goods. Telecom companies looking to improve their services buy this data on a Web3 marketplace, which is where the smart contracts come into play, enabling the value exchange between the supply and demand sides.” Max Thake, co-founder of peaq You might also like: DePIN early-stage fundraising has grown 296% YoY: Messari What are the DePIN options? There are two types of DePINs: Physical Resource Networks (PRN) and Digital Resource Networks (DRN). PRNs are decentralized networks where providers give hardware resources (such as sensors or internet access), and these resources are tied to a specific location. Their contribution to the network is location-dependent, therefore they are not interchangeable. DRNs are networks where providers provide resources determined by their function, not location. Here, location does not matter. Examples of such resources include computing power, bandwidth, and storage. DePIN Sector Map | Source: Messari Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN DePIN can theoretically wholly transform how we manage and interact with physical infrastructure. Using blockchain and smart contracts , this model increases the efficiency and transparency of systems, allowing the community to make decisions independently. DePIN can be considered a kind of “industrial DAO ,” where all participants have equal opportunities and ensure the independence of the infrastructure. The system is flexible and can be scaled horizontally. With the successful attraction of motivated users, the creation of a decentralized physical infrastructure can be significantly accelerated. The pricing model in DePIN crypto systems is also considered more accessible and fair since infrastructure assets are publicly owned, and the cost of services is determined not by the company’s benefits but by availability. Rewarding participants in the form of tokens allows users to receive regular passive income with the benefit of society. However, significant disadvantages should be considered: Vulnerability to hacks and errors. High volatility of tokens. There is a need for technical knowledge to maintain a decentralized infrastructure. Nevertheless, with DePIN, blockchain powers real-world DePIN use cases and value exchanges, it is inherently linked to real-world supply and demand, which makes this segment uniquely positioned for sustainable, healthy growth. “People won’t stop using navigation apps, ordering food, or using the Web because Bitcoin took a dive. DePIN merges web3 with real value instead of speculation and offers it a chance to live up to its promise of changing the world.” Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? According to Messari analysts, in 2023, the DePIN ecosystem grew to more than 650 projects, and the number of nodes increased by 600,000. Researchers noted the main trends in the development of DePIN in 2024. Experts believe meme tokens will contribute to massively adopting projects like the BONK airdrop for Solana Saga smartphone users. Analysts also consider Asia to be the region with the most significant potential for the rapid development of decentralized infrastructure, expecting that some of the most influential projects in the sector will appear here from 2024 to 2025. The first development in the DePIN field appeared about ten years ago. During this time, the number of projects increased significantly. The sector’s market capitalization is more than $20 billion, excluding RWA and blockchain oracles, according to experts from Messari. Source: Messari Speaking about the future of DePIN, Thake expects it to become an industry staple alongside the entire supporting stack, from DePIN-crowdsourced data for training models to decentralized compute and Web3 federated learning markets for AI agents. “Some of the most exciting implementations of the DePIN model will be in the energy industry, especially when it comes to green energy, which requires flexible and decentralized grids, while most old-school ones follow the centralized model. People will soon earn by harvesting solar energy and contributing to the power grid.” However, DePIN projects are not yet popular even among participants in the cryptocurrency industry, let alone the widespread adoption of the concept. Implementing decentralized infrastructure may take time since DePIN faces problems that must be solved. However, experts are confident that this system will play a key role in shaping the future and changing the principles of operation of physical infrastructure.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

The purchase is the start of a strategy to put up to 90% of the company’s surplus cash into cryptocurrency, as pioneered by industry leaders like MicroStrategy, and also it represents a larger corporate trend toward embracing digital assets. KULR’s Bitcoin treasury plan According to an announcement on Thursday, the coins were purchased at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. This is only the beginning of many more purchases since KULR plans to invest up to 90% of its available cash into Bitcoin. KULR has selected Coinbase Prime to provide custody solutions and self-custodial wallet services for its crypto assets. Following the announcement of the Bitcoin strategic reserve, the KULR stock value increased by 40%. KULR Technology Group is led by its CEO, Michael Mo, who discussed in an interview that he took inspiration from the way MicroStrategy approaches Bitcoin. Mo said , “ He calls BTC digital energy, which really resonated with our mission because we are an energy management company for batteries and space applications are our core.” The link between KULR’s core business and Bitcoin’s fundamental technology is a strategic alignment in their investment strategy. To confirm the support of shareholders for the initiative, KULR undertook a survey to assess the endorsement of this novel financial approach. The feedback was predominantly favorable. Cryptocurrency as corporate cash Mo continued, “We received an overwhelming ‘Yes.’ Here we are buying our first block of BTC and entering into the future of money.” Additionally, he expressed his strong belief in Bitcoin, asserting, “We believe that BTC is the future of money.” KULR now adds to the growing list of companies embracing BTC as part of there treasury reserve. On December 23, a Canada-based company, Matador Technologies, announced it will top up its balance sheet with $4.5 million in Bitcoin, as part of a long-term strategy for capital preservation. Quantum BioPharma, a biopharmaceutical company, also joined the trend by investing $1 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on December 20. In Japan, Metaplanet recently bought its largest Bitcoin to date, acquiring nearly 620 BTC. The phenomenon of corporate acquisition of Bitcoin was first brought into the limelight by MicroStrategy, which initiated its investments in Bitcoin back in 2020. Currently holding over 444,000 BTC, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its cryptocurrency holdings, aiming to buy more Bitcoins worth $42 billion more in the near future, pending the approval of shareholders. KULR’s Chief Executive Officer expects a future in which the integration of high-tech technologies creates a new corporate structure. He outlined this vision: “ We envision that the future of a dynamic corporation is based on three pillars: super intelligence through AI, an automated workforce through robotics, and the future of money through BTC, he added. “I believe the whole industry is still at the very early stage of figuring out how to tie them together,” suggesting that KULR’s Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader, long-term vision for corporate evolution.

The transfer will take place on March 8, 2025, marking the culmination of DMM Bitcoin’s liquidation process after a devastating $305 million hack in May 2024. Liquidation and Transfer Process In a December 25 notice , SBI VC indicated that customer accounts would be ready by the transfer date, and they would not have to register afresh but would instead be transitioned automatically by the company. Both fiat and cryptocurrency held by former DMM users will be transferred to SBI, with the company inheriting reports of all transactions conducted on the fallen exchange. The Tokyo-based firm initially offered 24 virtual assets for trade on its platform, but its acquisition of DMM Bitcoin will add an extra 14 cryptocurrencies to its books, including Tron (TRX), The Sandbox (SAND), Algorand (ALGO), and Maker (MKR). Additionally, as part of the deal, SBI will take over all leveraged trading pairs previously offered by DMM except those it already provides. The company also clarified that it would not transfer any open positions in leveraged trading. Per the notice, staking stocks will be automatically triggered, with customers that held Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Oasys (OAS), Flare (FLR), and Hedera (HBAR) on DMM eligible for staking on SBI. They are expected to receive their first staking reward in April 2025 if they continue holding the assets. Hacking Fallout DMM Bitcoin announced its decision to stop operations after months of recovery efforts from a multi-million dollar attack at the end of May failed. The platform lost more than 4,500 BTC, valued at around $305 million, in what is Japan’s second-largest crypto breach after another exchange, Coincheck, lost $523 million worth of NEM tokens in a 2018 incident. The DMM hack is suspected to have been carried out by threat actors linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known as TradeTraitor. In July, investigators revealed that over $35 million stolen from the exchange had been laundered via the infamous Cambodian online marketplace Huione Guarantee. At the time, pseudonymous on-chain detective ZachXBT likened the laundering techniques to those used by another DPRK-linked outfit, the notorious Lazarus Group. Soon after it was exploited, DMM immediately pledged to make affected customers whole. However, even after borrowing 50 million yen to reimburse users, the damage to its operations proved too great, leading to the decision to transfer all assets to SBI VC Trade. The firm confirmed the acquisition in a December 2 announcement, insisting that it would work to ensure a smooth transition for clients.

Is the Santa Rally already over?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-stocks-tumble-as-bitcoin-remains-stuck-at-95k-is-the-santa-rally-already-over/,"Wall Street’s so-called Santa Claus rally seems to have tripped over its own feet, while Bitcoin, the supposed king of volatility, is just sitting there like a lump, stuck at $95,000. Is this how we’re ending 2024? Flat stock performance, stagnant Bitcoin, and investors gnawing on their nails instead of celebrating a year-end windfall? The Dow barely scraped together a gain of 0.04%, the S&P 500 dipped by 0.02%, and the Nasdaq went completely nowhere. Treasury yields? Through the roof. The 10-year note hit its highest point since May, sitting at 4.58% before a late-day pullback. This surge in yields is a big problem for growth stocks, especially tech giants, which have propped up the market all year. Now, the “Magnificent Seven” are wobbling, and with them, the hopes of a December rally. Santa Claus rally hits a brick wall For those who don’t obsess over market quirks, the Santa Claus rally is a cute little phenomenon where stocks rally in the final trading days of the year, thanks to low liquidity, year-end bonuses, and tax-loss harvesting. It started to look promising earlier this week. Then reality smacked Wall Street upside the head. Mixed economic data, hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical tensions quickly killed the buzz. The Fed is holding firm on its less-than-dovish outlook for 2025, with way fewer rate cuts than markets were hoping for. Higher yields are squeezing growth stocks, which is terrible news for a market dominated by mega-cap tech. The S&P 500’s top ten stocks now account for 40% of the index’s market cap, a level that blows past the peak of the Dot-Com bubble. If these giants stumble, the rest of the market doesn’t stand a chance. New U.S. jobless claims data added to the tension. Initial claims dropped slightly, which sounds great, but ongoing claims climbed to their highest levels since 2021. Translation: People are losing jobs, and they’re struggling to find new ones. Combine that with uncertainty surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, and you’ve got a sense of the market chaos. Bitcoin’s glory days feel like ancient history Meanwhile, Bitcoin is sitting there doing absolutely nothing. It’s been bouncing between $92,500 and $96,000 for days now, a far cry from its December peak of $108,268. As of press time, it’s down 3.6% on the day, trading at $95,693. That’s a drop of over $3,500 in 24 hours, and the market capitalization is down to $1.89 trillion. Trading volume isn’t exactly inspiring either, clocking in at about $39.59 billion. This isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The entire crypto market feels sluggish. Analysts blame profit-taking after Bitcoin’s monster rally earlier this month, as well as tighter liquidity driven by the Fed’s hawkish cut. Still, there are glimmers of life. Institutional interest hasn’t dried up. MicroStrategy, always the Bitcoin cheerleader, added another $561 million worth of BTC to its stash. Bitcoin ETFs are still pulling in cash, with weekly inflows topping $300 million even in this downturn. But for the average trader, this kind of stagnation is painful. The Fear & Greed Index, which measures investor sentiment, is sitting at 54—smack in the middle of neutral territory. Will the Santa Claus rally make a last-minute comeback? Can Bitcoin escape its $95,000 prison? Or are we staring at the start of a rough 2025? No one knows.

The company recently forced Copilot onto Microsoft 365 users in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. And as if the decision wasn’t irritating enough, they slapped a price hike on top of it. In these regions, Microsoft 365—known for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—now includes Copilot whether customers want it or not. Users like Alistair Fleming, a YouTuber in Australia, are discovering that their monthly bills have surged. “It went from A$11 to A$16,” Fleming reportedly said, and all he got was a hyperactive AI assistant that wouldn’t leave him alone. “Every time I finished a line, its rainbow logo popped up, offering to ‘help.’ It’s annoying.” A desperate decision to profit from AI This aggressive rollout is all part of Microsoft’s plan to milk its massive investment in AI. Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s tech, is a key piece of CEO Satya Nadella’s strategy to expand the company’s software dominance. Earlier this year, Microsoft launched the premium consumer version of Copilot in the United States at $20 a month, on top of the standard $7 Microsoft 365 subscription. The company claimed it was a game-changing assistant, capable of generating emails, summarizing meetings, and creating entire PowerPoint presentations. But whether it’s worth the extra cash is a hotly debated question. Here’s the thing: people are not exactly lining up to use Copilot. Between May 2023 and mid-December, Copilot’s chatbot app was downloaded 37 million times, according to Sensor Tower. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT raked in a mind-blowing 433 million downloads in the same period. Microsoft might call this a “success,” but let’s not pretend Copilot is winning any popularity contests. For businesses, Copilot comes with an even heftier price tag—$30 per user. Corporate clients are Microsoft’s bread and butter, but the response to Copilot has been lukewarm at best. Many companies have doubts about its accuracy, data security, and whether it actually adds value. A Microsoft spokesperson refused to comment on how happy (or unhappy) corporate customers are, sticking to the usual “we meet global privacy standards” script. Microsoft wants to ditch OpenAI (sort of) While Copilot relies heavily on OpenAI’s technology, Microsoft is already working on alternatives. Reuters recently reported that Microsoft is building its own AI models, like Phi-4, and customizing open-weight models to power Copilot. The goal is to reduce costs and gain more control. This is a noticeable change from Microsoft’s earlier fanfare about its partnership with OpenAI. Back in March 2023, the company proudly announced Copilot’s reliance on OpenAI’s GPT-4. Now, Microsoft seems eager to tone down that reliance. It’s not cutting ties entirely though. OpenAI is negotiating to remove a clause from its agreement with Microsoft that limits the latter’s access to future artificial general intelligence (AGI) models. If this happens, Microsoft could maintain access to cutting-edge OpenAI tech without restrictions, even as it builds its own systems.

The Khao Kheow Open Zoo revealed that Buterin joined their Wildlife Sponsorship Program, pledging 10 million baht, or around $293,000 USD, to support Moo Deng and her family, in a Dec. 26 announcement . Buterin expressed in a post on X his commitment to supporting Moo Deng over the next two years “with my 10M THB donation, maybe more as I set aside 88 ETH for [pygmy hippopotamuses] + frens.” The move by Buterin spiked the memecoin’s price by as high as 70% to $0.0002446 before retracing to $0.0001924, which is a 55% increase in the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing Rexas Finance as a top pick for those who missed SHIB and PEPE. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Presale achievements Components: A unique ecosystem Ensuring investor benefits Conclusion Many investors who got in early on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have become extremely rich. But for those who missed these two tokens, there is a new token that has the potential to provide massive gains — Rexas Finance (RXS) . Rexas Finance shows great future promise due to its unique real-world asset features, strong tokenomics, and upcoming presale stages. This, along with a Certik audit completion and planned exchange listings, make it a great option for high returns. Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Rexas Finance is at the helm of the tokenization process. Interested users will easily access high-value assets like real estate, fine art, and collectibles via blockchain tokenization through its platform. This method of investing will fence off a huge proportion of the market previously occupied by the affluent, making it possible for the average investor to join in. Instead of having the purchase barrier of millions to buy a piece of real estate, users will be able to buy fractionalized real estate with RXS tokens. To increase liquidity and lower costs, tokenization allows for filling a growing asset digitization shift that the market is seeing. The immense market potential that Rexas Finance promises, combined with its presale, makes it stand out. Presale achievements With a total of over 364 million tokens sold, the RXS presale has been immensely successful, raising more than $30 million through its stages. The presale started at $0.03 in Stage 1, growing over 400% to the stage 10 price of $0.15. The investors’ trust is quite clear from the performance of this presale. It shows that the fundamentals and the vision of the project are sturdy. Many other crypto projects get a lot of funding from VC firms, but Rexas Finance has managed to do well without a single VC firm, allowing a fairer start for early investors. The growth witnessed without any external support reiterates the strength of the project’s future.

Rexas Launchpad: This is meant for upcoming blockchain-based ventures that need exposure and assistance. Rexas Estate: Focused on real estate tokenization in a manner that will involve fractional ownership and more accessibility. Rexas Treasury: This will serve as a reliable source of investment for future development of the platform. These features will help mitigate challenges in the blockchain space, giving RXS the capacity to be a good and practical investment. The application of utility gives the platform a competitive advantage over other conjectural meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. Ensuring investor benefits Investing in cryptocurrency should be done with great consideration, as security comes first. RXS has been certified by Certik, ensuring that it adheres to safety and transparency measures. Many investors become hesitant about crypto owing to the prevalence of terms such as rug pulls and scams. However, with Certik’s backing, Rexas Finance seeks to be a more reliable investment. Additionally, Rexas Finance offers early investor giveaways worth up to $50,000 in RXS tokens just by referring friends or engaging with the community on social media. Unlike other obscure cryptocurrencies with lengthy processes, Rexas Finance is easy to buy. Connect a MetaMask wallet and use USDT or ETH to purchase RXS tokens. Investors have a fantastic opportunity to participate in the project during its low-cost presale rates. Conclusion As Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin were hyped years ago, Rexas Finance is a new promising investment. The combination of real-world tokenization, outstanding tokenomics, and a successful presale suggests a massive increase in value. With its planned $1 million giveaway and anticipated listings in 2025, Rexas Finance could be among the best cryptocurrency investments for those seeking life-changing results.

That’s $166 million an hour, $2.7 million every minute, and a mind-numbing $45,000 a second. It’s a figure so obscene yet it’s the reality of America’s financial position. This reckless spending has pushed the U.S. Debt-to-GDP ratio to 121%, a level not even reached during World War II. In comparison, it was just 60% in 2008, back when the Great Recession first hit, because yeah, it came back last year. Since 2020, the U.S. has added $13 trillion to its debt. That’s a 57% increase in under five years. Meanwhile, as 2025 approaches, prediction markets are betting there’s a 36% chance the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) might trim $250 billion from federal spending. Sounds like a lot, right? Except it wouldn’t even scratch the surface of the deficit problem. The dollar’s grip on global finance Despite this insane financial chaos, the dollar isn’t going anywhere. For decades, doomsayers have warned about the dollar’s downfall, but it keeps flexing like an undefeated champ. From the oil crisis of the 1970s to the rise of the euro, from Japan’s economic ascent to China’s manufacturing takeover, the dollar has seen it all—and survived. Why? Because the world has no other choice. Right now, over 60% of global reserves are held in dollars. About 90% of all foreign exchange trades involve the greenback. International trade invoices? Mostly in dollars. And let’s not forget U.S. Treasuries—the so-called “safe haven” for global investors. Other currencies, like the euro or the Chinese yuan, have tried to make a play for the top spot, but they just don’t have the same liquidity or trust. China, often hyped as the dollar’s biggest threat, has its own issues. The yuan accounts for a tiny fraction of global transactions and is tightly controlled by Beijing. Investors don’t trust a currency that can’t flow freely. Meanwhile, the euro had a strong debut but lost credibility after a series of debt crises rocked the eurozone. These problems have left the dollar as the last man standing in a very shaky financial world. The dollar’s dominance is woven into the fabric of global trade and finance. The U.S. can borrow at levels that would bankrupt any other country because the dollar is still the world’s default currency. But how long can this game go on? Debt: The privilege and the price For decades, the U.S. has leaned on what economists call its “exorbitant privilege.” Basically, the world trusts the U.S. government to pay its bills, so investors keep buying Treasuries no matter how much debt America racks up. This allows Washington to borrow trillions for wars, stimulus packages, or even public-health emergencies. But that trust isn’t unlimited. Critics warn that America’s debt addiction could eventually blow up in its face. The sheer scale of the debt—combined with those $4 billion-a-day interest payments—has people wondering how much longer the U.S. can live beyond its means. And it’s not like anyone has a plan. Barack Obama tried to rein in spending with a high-powered deficit committee, but their recommendations went nowhere. Donald Trump once called the dollar both “too strong” and “too weak” while pursuing massive tax cuts that ballooned the debt even further. Joe Biden hasn’t fared much better, pushing pandemic-era spending packages that added trillions more to the tab. What’s the long-term strategy here? No one seems to know. U.S. is the dollar’s worst enemy But even countries that criticize America’s policies rely on the greenback. China, for instance, might talk about “de-dollarizing,” but it still issues dollar-denominated bonds to attract investors. Saudi Arabia recently sold $2 billion in dollar bonds. Even the much-discussed BRICS currency is years away, if it happens at all. Until something better comes along, the dollar will stay on top. But let’s not pretend this is a good thing. The dollar’s dominance allows the U.S. to print money and pile on debt without facing the kind of crises that cripple other nations. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: Washington borrows because it can, and the world keeps enabling it because they don’t have another option. The real question isn’t whether the dollar will collapse—it’s what could trigger its decline. Some economists argue that America itself poses the biggest threat to its currency. Excessive sanctions, for example, have already pushed some countries to explore alternatives. If the Oval overplays its hand, it could accidentally speed up the search for a credible dollar rival, just as Russia’s president Vladimir Putin predicted.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the project says it has been working closely with a respected asset manager to create a FLOKI-based ETP for European inventors, set to launch in Q1 of next year. “We’ve been actively working with a respected asset manager and an ETP issuer to launch a Floki ETP for quite a while now. After months of due diligence and painstaking effort, we’ve been told that the Floki ETP is on track to go live in early Q1, 2025. This proposal is to have the Floki DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) approve liquidity for the Floki ETP!” An ETP allows investors to expose themselves to specific assets without the need to actually purchase them. In the proposal, the Floki team says the ETP is already in its advanced stages and will become tradable on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland, as soon as next year and become the second meme coin in the world with a live ETP. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way. This is a big move that is almost unprecedented in this space, because Dogecoin is currently the only memecoin in the WORLD, with a live ETP, and Floki could become the next memecoin with an ETP besides Dogecoin.” The proposal also includes provisions for burning FLOKI tokens as well as providing liquidity for the ETP. “The purpose of this DAO proposal is to seek approval from the Floki DAO for providing liquidity to the ETP… We currently hold 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens in [a crypto wallet] and propose using a portion of them to provision liquidity for the ETP while burning the remainder on the day the ETP launches.” FLOKI is trading for $0.000177 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 23:02:00

Table of Contents Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments 3 promising altcoins for last-minute Investment Lesser-known altcoins for last-minute investments As the cryptocurrency market approaches the end of 2024, investors are keenly observing altcoins that exhibit the potential for significant growth before the year’s close. While established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have garnered substantial attention, newer entrants like Pepe (PEPE) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are also capturing the market’s interest. This shift in attention underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where new projects can rapidly gain prominence, influencing trading strategies and market trends. Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments Investors are seeking final chances in the crypto marketplace hoping to earn cash before a new year. This period usually shows extra moves in the market with traders eager t͏o improve their stash for end-year outcomes. One way that is noticed is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves saving a set amount of cash at normal times, regardless of the market condition. This method reduces the impact of market rises and falls and cuts down the risk of making poor choices from fast market shifts. Another is Market Cycle Investing, which refers to timing funds on the crypto market’s circular nature. By checking old data and market trends, investors seek to buy when the market is down and sell when it’s up. There’s also a mix of investments. By spreading money over different types of digital coins, investors can handle risk and raise the chance for gains. Mixing helps to balance the ups and downs found in the crypto market. It’s key to know that while these me͏thods can work, they also have risks as the crypto market is always changing. As such, doing a deep study and matching buy choices with personal money goals and risk comfort is crucial.

The firm offering less volatile access to Bitcoin also holds U.S. Treasuries for liquidity. Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF Strive Asset Management, run by Vivek Ramaswamy, is filing with the SEC on a “ Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF. ” The 485A filing suggests investment landscapes shift from the old “follow the money” to new “follow the Bitcoin.” The proposed ETF is going to offer access to MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds, which have become so popular due to the potentially more favorable regulatory climate under the new administration. This is an important step by Strive as digital assets are gaining popularity in the financial world. The demand for MicroStrategy’s bonds that convert into stocks based on Bitcoin’s performance has been strong broader market for Bitcoin-related investments. There is also an expectation that following Donald Trump’s recent election victory, regulatory hurdles may ease for digital assets and more institutions will look at crypto-related financial products at ease. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Funds, has been open about the strategy of the fund, pointing out that he is going to focus on vehicles that would be best suited by having a digital asset-friendly administration. His comments give an insight into what might be expected in 2025. Investment Strategy and Objective Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF strategy lies investment in what they describe as “Bitcoin Bonds. ” These are convertibles from a company such as MicroStrategy that happens to plough large proportions of the proceeds of bonds into Bitcoin. The use of derivative instruments by this ETF will enable to managing their exposure in these securities. The main objective of this fund is to replicate Bitcoin for investors through these Bitcoin Bonds and derivatives, allowing the investor to have less volatile exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it. The fund will invest in U.S. government securities, primarily Treasuries, to ensure liquidity and support its derivative positions. It may also invest in other investment companies specializing in Bitcoin-related financial instruments to diversify its approach to capturing the potential of Bitcoin. It indicates the growing acceptance of bitcoin in traditional finance and thereby has portrayed a strategic change towards digital assets that will help redefine how investment strategies get built. With Ramaswamy’s background opposition to corporate governance norms as well as his firm, which opposes ESG; this particular ETF might find investors who are looking out for non-traditional options which highlights the Bitcoin’s aspects.

Analyst Breaks Down the Data",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/who-profited-during-bitcoin-100000-surge-analyst-breaks-down-the-data/,"Bitcoin ongoing price movement has sparked intense analysis as it continues to hover below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching an all-time high above $108,000 last week, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain upward momentum ever since. With this performance, BTC’s on-chain data has been brought to the spotlight to uncover the factors driving recent selling pressures and investor behavior. One key focus has been the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) indicator, which provides valuable insights into Bitcoin holders’ activity based on their holding periods. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? Who Cashed Out Their Bitcoin Gains? According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Yonsei Dent, data reveals that Bitcoin investors who bought their holdings between six to twelve months ago were the most active sellers during the recent price surge. This group largely entered the market during the initial excitement surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in the year. While this selling activity exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, the asset has managed to stabilize within the $90,000–$100,000 range. Interestingly, long-term holders, defined as those holding Bitcoin for over a year, have shown minimal selling activity. Historical trends suggest that these seasoned investors are likely anticipating elevated price levels before considering substantial profit-taking. Meanwhile, Dent pointed to the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric showing a noticeable decline in older Bitcoin being moved in December compared to November. Historically, reduced activity from long-term holders during price corrections often signals market resilience and potential for future upward momentum. The analyst wrote: The ‘Binary CDD’ indicator at the bottom of the chart shows a decline in the selling of older Bitcoin in December compared to November. This suggests that many long-term holders may anticipate even higher prices before selling. Binance Reserves Signal Market Confidence Speaking of higher prices, another crucial metric suggesting a significant move brewing for Bitcoin comes from Binance’s Bitcoin reserves, which have been steadily declining since August. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted that Binance’s reserves recently hit their lowest level since January. This trend is significant because a similar decline earlier in the year preceded a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price. The reduction in exchange reserves typically indicates that investors are moving their Bitcoin holdings away from centralized exchanges and into private wallets. Such behavior suggests reduced selling pressure and a preference for long-term holding strategies. Historically, declining reserves on exchanges have often aligned with periods of strong market optimism and price rallies. Notably, as BTC currently still trades at a price of $95,567 down by 2.7% in the past day, the confluence of these factors—long-term holder confidence, reduced activity from older wallets, and declining exchange reserves—presents a cautiously optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors look to 1Fuel as Cardano (ADA) Ethereum (ETH) struggle. Table of Contents ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum ADA faces high-selling pressure Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Conclusion With the current retracements, some altcoins have found it difficult to regain momentum. Ethereum, which rose to $4,000, nearing its ATH of $4,792, has declined drastically. Cardano trails a similar path, falling below $0.91. Should there be more retracements, analysts suggest they might consolidate at their current values or experience further decreases. However, a new token, 1Fuel , has been gaining traction and recording an increase in sales. Currently, in its second phase selling at $0.012, 1Fuel has raised $835,000, with experts ranking it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy for 2025. ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum In the past 24 hours, ETH has struggled to break out of $3,477 resistance and has assumed a bearish state with a high chance of ETH dipping below $3,300 before a rebound. ETH’s long/short ratio — a metric to track the ratio of buyers to sellers in the market — is at 0.98 and on the verge of entering 1, a bullish sign. This means that investors believe that ETH still has the potential to increase, allocating more funds to it. However, if ETH reverses from its current price, there’s a possibility of it dipping to $3,000, which will result in a massive loss for these investors. The uncertainty surrounding the ETH’s rally has caused investors to eye 1Fuel because of its potential offerings. 1Fuel has recorded a massive increment in its token presales, and it’s set to change the investment narratives in the cryptocurrency market in 2025. ADA faces high-selling pressure ADA is currently trading at $0.86. The token has seen a 9.63% decline in its trading volume. This indicates that there’s high selling pressure, pushing ADA’s price downwards. ADA may gain momentum if it drops into the $0.73–$0.63 range, where buyer interest is anticipated. However, investors should exercise caution, as market volatility could push prices below this range, leading to potential losses. Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Experts predict at least a 500% surge in price after 1Fuel launches on top cryptocurrency exchanges. Notably, investors will get a 30% APR on all their staked coins, meaning they can earn passively. 1Fuel will also support P2P trading on its platform, giving room for users to trade directly with other users at low fees. Furthermore, with 1Fuel, users will get a built-in AI-powered feature that will make all the functions in the cryptocurrency wallet easy for them to use, facilitating seamless transactions. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market regains momentum, coins like ETH and ADA have been finding it hard to join the bullish trend. However, 1Fuel is set to create a buzz in the altcoin market. The new crypto is currently selling at $0.012 but is expected to surge more than 100x once it hits top cryptocurrency exchanges. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

Table of Contents Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Bitcoin Conclusion A trader famed for accurately forecasting Bitcoin’s price movements now suggests that a meme token, currently priced at $0.0007, could soar to $1 in 2025. This bold prediction has caught the attention of the crypto world, sparking curiosity about the potential of this overlooked token. Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Donald Trump’s comeback has lit a fire under the crypto market, with meme coins roaring back into the limelight. While blue-chip tokens make incremental gains, Catzilla is ready to leap ahead, positioning itself as the apex predator in this new meme coin renaissance. Trump’s vision of a pro-crypto America sets the stage for unparalleled growth, creating the perfect storm for meme coins to thrive. Among them, Catzilla stands tall, ready to shatter expectations and claim the throne. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s here to rewrite the playbook for decentralized finance. Starting at just $0.0002, Catzilla’s presale climbs to $0.0016 over 14 stages, offering early adopters significant growth opportunities. Stage 4 is live at $0.0006, with a 16.67% price increase looming. Catzilla doesn’t just offer investment opportunities; it empowers the community with its a unique referral system: 8% USDT on direct referral purchases. 2% USDT on second-tier referrals. 1% USDT on third-tier referrals. With BTC and other major coins seemingly losing momentum, Catzilla rises as the ultimate underdog poised for greatness. You might also like: 4 overlooked cryptos poised to turn $200 into half a million: Catzilla on spotlight Bitcoin Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, using blockchain technology to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Its transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and earn BTC as rewards. With a capped supply of 21 million BTC and halving events that reduce miners’ rewards every four years, Bitcoin is designed to be scarce. This scarcity, along with increasing adoption, gives it potential as a digital store of value. Conclusion With BTC and other major coins showing less short-term potential, Catzilla steps up as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a 700% ROI during its presale. Its triple utility empowers holders through governance, rewards, and staking. Catzilla seeks to unite enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom, inviting participation in the battle against crypto villains.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 00:22:00

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Jason Pizzino tells his 123,400 followers that investor sentiment indicates traders now are closer to the end of the bull market than the start. “Bitcoin and crypto ‘end-stage’ emotional volatility has dramatically increased which only suggests we are much closer to the end than the beginning of the cycle. That might seem like an obvious statement now, but wait until the market gets closer to the final top; it won’t be so obvious which is generally a signal within itself.” In an accompanying video update, Pizzino says historically, when the market gets excited and overconfident, stagnation tends to follow. “I think a lot of people believe this cycle should run until the end of 2025, but what if we’re seeing a lot of that excitement come back into the market? Every time it goes up, all I see is just everyone getting super bullish and then it pauses for a bit, corrects, and then we start on the next move. So I’m just keeping an open mind.” Source: Jason Pizzino/X The trader’s chart uses Bitcoin ( BTC ) as an example. According to Pizzino, the top crypto asset by market cap may correct or trade sideways all the way until October 2025. “Looking somewhere [between] Q2 out to Q3, just the beginning of Q4… Most people can’t handle six to 10 months. They talked about a drop of one month and they all freaked out yesterday, it’s absolutely bonkers out there, which is why I think we are in those final moves, basically the end of the cycle.” BTC is trading at $98,900 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Bitcoin Average Coin Age Has Been Trending Up Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the recent trend in the Average Coin Age for Bitcoin. The “Average Coin Age” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of how long the average BTC token has been staying dormant for. A coin is said to be dormant when it sits still inside an address without being involved in any sort of transaction activity. The longer the coin stays in this state, the more it ‘ages’ up. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 4%, Whale Reacts With $69 Million Coinbase Deposit Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age has seen some sharp spikes this year, but also some equally steep declines. This would suggest that the investors have been participating in some phases of HODLing, but they have also not been shying away from taking some profits. On the whole, however, the holders have shown notable resolve, as the 365-day MA of the indicator has been in a constant state of uptrend since the end of the 2022 bear market. Statistically, the longer investors hold onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the fact that the investors have been increasingly preferring to keep their coins dormant can be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency’s price. Interestingly, this trend didn’t develop during the 2021 bull market, as even though the 30-day MA of the Average Coin Age saw a period of uptrend, the 365-day MA moved down throughout the year instead. This could imply the average investor has become smarter this cycle. In the short-term, the 30-day MA of the indicator has been rapidly climbing, which implies the Bitcoin market is currently in one of the phases of active accumulation.

Following the latest jump, nearly a third of the asset’s tokens in circulation haven’t been involved in a transaction since more than five years ago.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 01:45:00
33767162,[object Object],1735264800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,South Korea Sanctions 15 North Korean Hackers and One Entity Over Crypto Theft Operations,https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-sanctions-entity-crypto-theft-operation/,"South Korea has announced sanctions against 15 individuals and one entity from North Korea involved in cybercrimes, including large-scale cryptocurrency heists. The move comes amid rising concerns about North Korea’s use of cyber operations to fund its weapons programs and evade international sanctions. South Korea Imposes Sanctions On North Korean Hackers And IT Operatives The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea particularly disclosed in a statement released on December 26 that the sanctioned individuals are linked to Bureau 313, an organization under the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Machine-Building Industry Department. This bureau, which has been under United Nations Security Council sanctions since 2016, plays a significant role in overseeing North Korea’s weapons production, including its ballistic missile program. According to the ministry, these operatives are often dispatched to countries such as China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where they operate under disguised identities to secure employment in IT firms. Many of these individuals infiltrate IT networks, manipulate company operations, and, in some cases, conduct cryptocurrency thefts. One such individual, Kim Cheol-min, reportedly infiltrated IT firms in the US and Canada, transferring large sums of foreign currency back to North Korea. Additionally, one sanctioned entity is also known to send North Korean IT personnel overseas to secure illicit funds for Pyongyang’s regime and military operations. CryptoTheft and Cyber Activities Intensify Notably, the reasons behind the sanctions of these North Korean perpetrators are quite evident. Recent reports from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reveal that North Korean hackers stole approximately $1.34 billion worth of cryptocurrency across 47 incidents last year. This significant figure represents 61% of the total global cryptocurrency theft in 2023, marking a sharp increase both in terms of frequency and scale. According to the report, these attacks are often meticulously planned, with operatives using advanced Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to breach corporate networks and extract valuable digital assets. The Chainalysis report also points out a concerning trend—many of these thefts are facilitated by North Korean IT workers embedded in global tech firms, including crypto and Web3 companies. These operatives often use false identities, third-party intermediaries, and remote work opportunities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Once inside, they manipulate networks, compromise security protocols, and exfiltrate funds in the form of cryptocurrencies, which are then laundered through complex blockchain transactions to evade detection. While the sanctions represent a significant step, North Korea’s cyber capabilities will likely remain a persistent threat without coordinated global oversight and advanced cybersecurity measures. The South Korean government wrote: Our government will continue to work with the international community to block North Korea’s illegal cyber activities with a high level of alertness. This independent sanction is scheduled to take effect from 00:00 on Monday, December 30 through publication in the Official Gazette. Financial and foreign exchange transactions with the targets designated as targets of this independent sanction require prior approval from the Financial Services Commission or the Governor of the Bank of Korea Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Crypto News|crypto|crypto crime|Crypto Market|Crypto theft|Cyber crime|North Korean hackers|South Korea,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-27 02:00:00

The token has moved through the ranks, flipping other Solana-based tokens and gathering massive attention in nine days. Pudgy Penguins, one of the largest NFT collections, consists of 8,888 unique cartoons of cute penguins and has a market capitalization of 205,757 ETH. In anticipation of the token launch, the project surged as the second-largest NFT collection, only falling behind CryptoPunks. Since its launch three years ago, the project has seen its community significantly grow and “cemented itself in the hearts and minds of everyday people and culture,” according to the project’s team. Additionally, it is expected to contribute to the project’s governance despite not having a specific use case announced yet. As such, the newly launched cryptocurrency aims to “expand its community and further widen the reach” of the project by allowing old and new users “to align” themselves with the penguins. According to CoinGecko data, the Solana-based memecoin debuted with a 500% surge to a market capitalization of $3.5 billion but registered massive volatility in the following days. Just hours after launching, PENGU’s price retraced over 50% before descending to a $1.4 billion market cap on December 20. The token hovered between the $0.025-$0.037 range over a few days, stabilizing around the range’s upper zone on Christmas Eve.

PENGU became the fourth largest memecoin by this metric, just behind Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Additionally, in the last 24 hours, the token has seen a 25% increase in market activity, with a daily trading volume of $1.92 billion. According to on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain, Crypto whales have also noticed PENGU’s rally, with several large-scale investors filling their bags over the past week.
