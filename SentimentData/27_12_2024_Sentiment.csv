Is a 1000x Move Possible?,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-price-enters-critical-level-as-this-doge-killer-rises-is-a-1000x-move-possible/,"Dogecoin has been a major player in the crypto market since its launch, rivaling other memecoins with its wide community adoption and celebrity endorsement. However, its recent downside has faced challenges from emerging DOGE killers like PropiChain . Its revolutionary approach to tackling major real estate loopholes like inefficiencies, fraud risks, and high transaction costs has been a propeller of its token presale, which continues to attract attention from major investors. In this article, we will discuss how PropiChain could outrank the Dogecoin price and make over a 1000x move when it launches, as well as the unique features that make it stand out as a formidable competitor. The Widespread Community Adoption of Meme coins and its Impact on the Dogecoin Price Dogecoin’s continuous dominance in the market has been attributed to its passionate community, celebrity endorsements, and widespread adoption as a tipping currency. With these communities’ most loyal community support and guidance, the Dogecoin price has seen significant highs through community takeovers (CTOs) and Cabals spearheading them. Dogecoin has also experienced real-world use cases as legal tenders for charitable donations, service payments, and a niche in micropayments. However, despite its enduring popularity, Dogecoin entering a critical level has spiraled the growth of projects like PropiChain, which combines utility and innovation, to challenge its dominance and the Dogecoin price trajectory. How PropiChain Could Make a 1000x Move After Launch PropiChain’s signal to investors as one of the most prominent altcoins to outpace the Dogecoin price as a beam of hope during this critical level. Below are some unique features and how they propel its price trajectory to make over 1000x after launch. Advanced AI Technologies: PropiChain AI tools are designed to offer provisional assistance to users as they navigate the platform by providing predictive market analysis, which encompasses real-time evaluation of market trends, identification of emerging patterns, and prediction of future market behaviors. Its property filtering tools also provide sophisticated filters that consider anticipated market growth, investment potential, and properties’ historical performance irrespective of location. Metaverse Capabilities: The platform allows users to explore and invest in virtual real estate, bridging physical and digital assets. Through its virtual tours, stagings, and meetings, international investors can experiment with different layouts and designs in an immersive virtual environment and interactive experience surpassing traditional methods. RWA Tokenization: PropiChain’s approach to tokenizing assets involves digitizing properties in small and large proportions, ensuring seamless virtual transactions on a secure blockchain network. This further reduces fraud and streamlines complex processes that demand physical documentation as it democratizes access to highly valued assets to everyday investors rather than large-scale investors. Conclusion The Dogecoin Price is at a crossroads, facing challenges from innovative projects like PropiChain . With its presale already raising nearly $1M, crypto insiders are bullish about its roadmap and price trajectory to surpass DOGE. PropiChain is offering investors a chance to purchase the PCHAIN token for $0.004 in its round two presale, the lowest it will ever be before it surges after its launch. Moreover, its BlockAudit review and CoinMarketCap listing provide additional reassurance for investors. So if you are investing $1000 now, your portfolio is expected to see a massive gain of over $100,000 as it replicates the 2017 Dogecoin price, especially when it continues to gain momentum. Hurry now, and be a part of this transition before it’s too late!

What is this technology about, and how does DePIN work? Table of Contents What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? What are the DePIN options? Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? Theoretical studies in cryptocurrencies have long predicted that encryption tools currently implemented in the blockchain will be used on the Internet and impact the physical world sooner or later. Nick Szabo noted at the end of the 20th century that smart contracts can automatically manage physical objects. More than 25 years have passed, and the blockchain is firmly embedded in our lives. This is primarily due to cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to break records and is supported by significant physical infrastructure. At first glance, this confirms an actual physical presence in our world. However, the boundaries of decentralized technologies continue to expand with the advent of solutions such as DePIN. What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? DePIN meaning a Decentralized physical infrastructure network. Blockchain participants use a public ledger and cryptocurrency to build and maintain specific, real-world infrastructure projects. Simply speaking, DePIN involves using DePIN blockchain to run and sustain decentralized networks of equipment that can serve a common purpose. This enables the network to be built on decentralized, horizontal connections rather than the hierarchical approach typically seen with large infrastructure projects such as bridges or roads. Building and managing physical infrastructure networks is expensive and complex, so historically, they have been the domain of large corporations or governments with capital and resources. In contrast, DePIN encourages voluntary cooperation among participants. People can participate in DePIN networks by using their own hardware or purchasing specialized hardware for specific tasks. Options range from simple hard drives to weather stations. However, DePINs are typically built around capabilities that are available to the general public. Max Thake, co-founder of peaq, explained crypto.news that DePIN uses tokens to incentivize people to use connected hardware to offer services to other people: “Let’s imagine a smartphone-focused DePIN like Roam Network. The smartphones, owned by regular people, are the hardware component, the data on local connection quality they gather is the goods. Telecom companies looking to improve their services buy this data on a Web3 marketplace, which is where the smart contracts come into play, enabling the value exchange between the supply and demand sides.” Max Thake, co-founder of peaq You might also like: DePIN early-stage fundraising has grown 296% YoY: Messari What are the DePIN options? There are two types of DePINs: Physical Resource Networks (PRN) and Digital Resource Networks (DRN). PRNs are decentralized networks where providers give hardware resources (such as sensors or internet access), and these resources are tied to a specific location. Their contribution to the network is location-dependent, therefore they are not interchangeable. DRNs are networks where providers provide resources determined by their function, not location. Here, location does not matter. Examples of such resources include computing power, bandwidth, and storage. DePIN Sector Map | Source: Messari Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN DePIN can theoretically wholly transform how we manage and interact with physical infrastructure. Using blockchain and smart contracts , this model increases the efficiency and transparency of systems, allowing the community to make decisions independently. DePIN can be considered a kind of “industrial DAO ,” where all participants have equal opportunities and ensure the independence of the infrastructure. The system is flexible and can be scaled horizontally. With the successful attraction of motivated users, the creation of a decentralized physical infrastructure can be significantly accelerated. The pricing model in DePIN crypto systems is also considered more accessible and fair since infrastructure assets are publicly owned, and the cost of services is determined not by the company’s benefits but by availability. Rewarding participants in the form of tokens allows users to receive regular passive income with the benefit of society. However, significant disadvantages should be considered: Vulnerability to hacks and errors. High volatility of tokens. There is a need for technical knowledge to maintain a decentralized infrastructure. Nevertheless, with DePIN, blockchain powers real-world DePIN use cases and value exchanges, it is inherently linked to real-world supply and demand, which makes this segment uniquely positioned for sustainable, healthy growth. “People won’t stop using navigation apps, ordering food, or using the Web because Bitcoin took a dive. DePIN merges web3 with real value instead of speculation and offers it a chance to live up to its promise of changing the world.” Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? According to Messari analysts, in 2023, the DePIN ecosystem grew to more than 650 projects, and the number of nodes increased by 600,000. Researchers noted the main trends in the development of DePIN in 2024. Experts believe meme tokens will contribute to massively adopting projects like the BONK airdrop for Solana Saga smartphone users. Analysts also consider Asia to be the region with the most significant potential for the rapid development of decentralized infrastructure, expecting that some of the most influential projects in the sector will appear here from 2024 to 2025. The first development in the DePIN field appeared about ten years ago. During this time, the number of projects increased significantly. The sector’s market capitalization is more than $20 billion, excluding RWA and blockchain oracles, according to experts from Messari. Source: Messari Speaking about the future of DePIN, Thake expects it to become an industry staple alongside the entire supporting stack, from DePIN-crowdsourced data for training models to decentralized compute and Web3 federated learning markets for AI agents. “Some of the most exciting implementations of the DePIN model will be in the energy industry, especially when it comes to green energy, which requires flexible and decentralized grids, while most old-school ones follow the centralized model. People will soon earn by harvesting solar energy and contributing to the power grid.” However, DePIN projects are not yet popular even among participants in the cryptocurrency industry, let alone the widespread adoption of the concept. Implementing decentralized infrastructure may take time since DePIN faces problems that must be solved. However, experts are confident that this system will play a key role in shaping the future and changing the principles of operation of physical infrastructure.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

The purchase is the start of a strategy to put up to 90% of the company’s surplus cash into cryptocurrency, as pioneered by industry leaders like MicroStrategy, and also it represents a larger corporate trend toward embracing digital assets. KULR’s Bitcoin treasury plan According to an announcement on Thursday, the coins were purchased at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. This is only the beginning of many more purchases since KULR plans to invest up to 90% of its available cash into Bitcoin. KULR has selected Coinbase Prime to provide custody solutions and self-custodial wallet services for its crypto assets. Following the announcement of the Bitcoin strategic reserve, the KULR stock value increased by 40%. KULR Technology Group is led by its CEO, Michael Mo, who discussed in an interview that he took inspiration from the way MicroStrategy approaches Bitcoin. Mo said , “ He calls BTC digital energy, which really resonated with our mission because we are an energy management company for batteries and space applications are our core.” The link between KULR’s core business and Bitcoin’s fundamental technology is a strategic alignment in their investment strategy. To confirm the support of shareholders for the initiative, KULR undertook a survey to assess the endorsement of this novel financial approach. The feedback was predominantly favorable. Cryptocurrency as corporate cash Mo continued, “We received an overwhelming ‘Yes.’ Here we are buying our first block of BTC and entering into the future of money.” Additionally, he expressed his strong belief in Bitcoin, asserting, “We believe that BTC is the future of money.” KULR now adds to the growing list of companies embracing BTC as part of there treasury reserve. On December 23, a Canada-based company, Matador Technologies, announced it will top up its balance sheet with $4.5 million in Bitcoin, as part of a long-term strategy for capital preservation. Quantum BioPharma, a biopharmaceutical company, also joined the trend by investing $1 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on December 20. In Japan, Metaplanet recently bought its largest Bitcoin to date, acquiring nearly 620 BTC. The phenomenon of corporate acquisition of Bitcoin was first brought into the limelight by MicroStrategy, which initiated its investments in Bitcoin back in 2020. Currently holding over 444,000 BTC, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its cryptocurrency holdings, aiming to buy more Bitcoins worth $42 billion more in the near future, pending the approval of shareholders. KULR’s Chief Executive Officer expects a future in which the integration of high-tech technologies creates a new corporate structure. He outlined this vision: “ We envision that the future of a dynamic corporation is based on three pillars: super intelligence through AI, an automated workforce through robotics, and the future of money through BTC, he added. “I believe the whole industry is still at the very early stage of figuring out how to tie them together,” suggesting that KULR’s Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader, long-term vision for corporate evolution.

The transfer will take place on March 8, 2025, marking the culmination of DMM Bitcoin’s liquidation process after a devastating $305 million hack in May 2024. Liquidation and Transfer Process In a December 25 notice , SBI VC indicated that customer accounts would be ready by the transfer date, and they would not have to register afresh but would instead be transitioned automatically by the company. Both fiat and cryptocurrency held by former DMM users will be transferred to SBI, with the company inheriting reports of all transactions conducted on the fallen exchange. The Tokyo-based firm initially offered 24 virtual assets for trade on its platform, but its acquisition of DMM Bitcoin will add an extra 14 cryptocurrencies to its books, including Tron (TRX), The Sandbox (SAND), Algorand (ALGO), and Maker (MKR). Additionally, as part of the deal, SBI will take over all leveraged trading pairs previously offered by DMM except those it already provides. The company also clarified that it would not transfer any open positions in leveraged trading. Per the notice, staking stocks will be automatically triggered, with customers that held Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Oasys (OAS), Flare (FLR), and Hedera (HBAR) on DMM eligible for staking on SBI. They are expected to receive their first staking reward in April 2025 if they continue holding the assets. Hacking Fallout DMM Bitcoin announced its decision to stop operations after months of recovery efforts from a multi-million dollar attack at the end of May failed. The platform lost more than 4,500 BTC, valued at around $305 million, in what is Japan’s second-largest crypto breach after another exchange, Coincheck, lost $523 million worth of NEM tokens in a 2018 incident. The DMM hack is suspected to have been carried out by threat actors linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known as TradeTraitor. In July, investigators revealed that over $35 million stolen from the exchange had been laundered via the infamous Cambodian online marketplace Huione Guarantee. At the time, pseudonymous on-chain detective ZachXBT likened the laundering techniques to those used by another DPRK-linked outfit, the notorious Lazarus Group. Soon after it was exploited, DMM immediately pledged to make affected customers whole. However, even after borrowing 50 million yen to reimburse users, the damage to its operations proved too great, leading to the decision to transfer all assets to SBI VC Trade. The firm confirmed the acquisition in a December 2 announcement, insisting that it would work to ensure a smooth transition for clients.

Is the Santa Rally already over?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-stocks-tumble-as-bitcoin-remains-stuck-at-95k-is-the-santa-rally-already-over/,"Wall Street’s so-called Santa Claus rally seems to have tripped over its own feet, while Bitcoin, the supposed king of volatility, is just sitting there like a lump, stuck at $95,000. Is this how we’re ending 2024? Flat stock performance, stagnant Bitcoin, and investors gnawing on their nails instead of celebrating a year-end windfall? The Dow barely scraped together a gain of 0.04%, the S&P 500 dipped by 0.02%, and the Nasdaq went completely nowhere. Treasury yields? Through the roof. The 10-year note hit its highest point since May, sitting at 4.58% before a late-day pullback. This surge in yields is a big problem for growth stocks, especially tech giants, which have propped up the market all year. Now, the “Magnificent Seven” are wobbling, and with them, the hopes of a December rally. Santa Claus rally hits a brick wall For those who don’t obsess over market quirks, the Santa Claus rally is a cute little phenomenon where stocks rally in the final trading days of the year, thanks to low liquidity, year-end bonuses, and tax-loss harvesting. It started to look promising earlier this week. Then reality smacked Wall Street upside the head. Mixed economic data, hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical tensions quickly killed the buzz. The Fed is holding firm on its less-than-dovish outlook for 2025, with way fewer rate cuts than markets were hoping for. Higher yields are squeezing growth stocks, which is terrible news for a market dominated by mega-cap tech. The S&P 500’s top ten stocks now account for 40% of the index’s market cap, a level that blows past the peak of the Dot-Com bubble. If these giants stumble, the rest of the market doesn’t stand a chance. New U.S. jobless claims data added to the tension. Initial claims dropped slightly, which sounds great, but ongoing claims climbed to their highest levels since 2021. Translation: People are losing jobs, and they’re struggling to find new ones. Combine that with uncertainty surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, and you’ve got a sense of the market chaos. Bitcoin’s glory days feel like ancient history Meanwhile, Bitcoin is sitting there doing absolutely nothing. It’s been bouncing between $92,500 and $96,000 for days now, a far cry from its December peak of $108,268. As of press time, it’s down 3.6% on the day, trading at $95,693. That’s a drop of over $3,500 in 24 hours, and the market capitalization is down to $1.89 trillion. Trading volume isn’t exactly inspiring either, clocking in at about $39.59 billion. This isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The entire crypto market feels sluggish. Analysts blame profit-taking after Bitcoin’s monster rally earlier this month, as well as tighter liquidity driven by the Fed’s hawkish cut. Still, there are glimmers of life. Institutional interest hasn’t dried up. MicroStrategy, always the Bitcoin cheerleader, added another $561 million worth of BTC to its stash. Bitcoin ETFs are still pulling in cash, with weekly inflows topping $300 million even in this downturn. But for the average trader, this kind of stagnation is painful. The Fear & Greed Index, which measures investor sentiment, is sitting at 54—smack in the middle of neutral territory. Will the Santa Claus rally make a last-minute comeback? Can Bitcoin escape its $95,000 prison? Or are we staring at the start of a rough 2025? No one knows.

The company recently forced Copilot onto Microsoft 365 users in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. And as if the decision wasn’t irritating enough, they slapped a price hike on top of it. In these regions, Microsoft 365—known for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—now includes Copilot whether customers want it or not. Users like Alistair Fleming, a YouTuber in Australia, are discovering that their monthly bills have surged. “It went from A$11 to A$16,” Fleming reportedly said, and all he got was a hyperactive AI assistant that wouldn’t leave him alone. “Every time I finished a line, its rainbow logo popped up, offering to ‘help.’ It’s annoying.” A desperate decision to profit from AI This aggressive rollout is all part of Microsoft’s plan to milk its massive investment in AI. Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s tech, is a key piece of CEO Satya Nadella’s strategy to expand the company’s software dominance. Earlier this year, Microsoft launched the premium consumer version of Copilot in the United States at $20 a month, on top of the standard $7 Microsoft 365 subscription. The company claimed it was a game-changing assistant, capable of generating emails, summarizing meetings, and creating entire PowerPoint presentations. But whether it’s worth the extra cash is a hotly debated question. Here’s the thing: people are not exactly lining up to use Copilot. Between May 2023 and mid-December, Copilot’s chatbot app was downloaded 37 million times, according to Sensor Tower. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT raked in a mind-blowing 433 million downloads in the same period. Microsoft might call this a “success,” but let’s not pretend Copilot is winning any popularity contests. For businesses, Copilot comes with an even heftier price tag—$30 per user. Corporate clients are Microsoft’s bread and butter, but the response to Copilot has been lukewarm at best. Many companies have doubts about its accuracy, data security, and whether it actually adds value. A Microsoft spokesperson refused to comment on how happy (or unhappy) corporate customers are, sticking to the usual “we meet global privacy standards” script. Microsoft wants to ditch OpenAI (sort of) While Copilot relies heavily on OpenAI’s technology, Microsoft is already working on alternatives. Reuters recently reported that Microsoft is building its own AI models, like Phi-4, and customizing open-weight models to power Copilot. The goal is to reduce costs and gain more control. This is a noticeable change from Microsoft’s earlier fanfare about its partnership with OpenAI. Back in March 2023, the company proudly announced Copilot’s reliance on OpenAI’s GPT-4. Now, Microsoft seems eager to tone down that reliance. It’s not cutting ties entirely though. OpenAI is negotiating to remove a clause from its agreement with Microsoft that limits the latter’s access to future artificial general intelligence (AGI) models. If this happens, Microsoft could maintain access to cutting-edge OpenAI tech without restrictions, even as it builds its own systems.

The Khao Kheow Open Zoo revealed that Buterin joined their Wildlife Sponsorship Program, pledging 10 million baht, or around $293,000 USD, to support Moo Deng and her family, in a Dec. 26 announcement . Buterin expressed in a post on X his commitment to supporting Moo Deng over the next two years “with my 10M THB donation, maybe more as I set aside 88 ETH for [pygmy hippopotamuses] + frens.” The move by Buterin spiked the memecoin’s price by as high as 70% to $0.0002446 before retracing to $0.0001924, which is a 55% increase in the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing Rexas Finance as a top pick for those who missed SHIB and PEPE. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Presale achievements Components: A unique ecosystem Ensuring investor benefits Conclusion Many investors who got in early on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have become extremely rich. But for those who missed these two tokens, there is a new token that has the potential to provide massive gains — Rexas Finance (RXS) . Rexas Finance shows great future promise due to its unique real-world asset features, strong tokenomics, and upcoming presale stages. This, along with a Certik audit completion and planned exchange listings, make it a great option for high returns. Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Rexas Finance is at the helm of the tokenization process. Interested users will easily access high-value assets like real estate, fine art, and collectibles via blockchain tokenization through its platform. This method of investing will fence off a huge proportion of the market previously occupied by the affluent, making it possible for the average investor to join in. Instead of having the purchase barrier of millions to buy a piece of real estate, users will be able to buy fractionalized real estate with RXS tokens. To increase liquidity and lower costs, tokenization allows for filling a growing asset digitization shift that the market is seeing. The immense market potential that Rexas Finance promises, combined with its presale, makes it stand out. Presale achievements With a total of over 364 million tokens sold, the RXS presale has been immensely successful, raising more than $30 million through its stages. The presale started at $0.03 in Stage 1, growing over 400% to the stage 10 price of $0.15. The investors’ trust is quite clear from the performance of this presale. It shows that the fundamentals and the vision of the project are sturdy. Many other crypto projects get a lot of funding from VC firms, but Rexas Finance has managed to do well without a single VC firm, allowing a fairer start for early investors. The growth witnessed without any external support reiterates the strength of the project’s future.

Rexas Launchpad: This is meant for upcoming blockchain-based ventures that need exposure and assistance. Rexas Estate: Focused on real estate tokenization in a manner that will involve fractional ownership and more accessibility. Rexas Treasury: This will serve as a reliable source of investment for future development of the platform. These features will help mitigate challenges in the blockchain space, giving RXS the capacity to be a good and practical investment. The application of utility gives the platform a competitive advantage over other conjectural meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. Ensuring investor benefits Investing in cryptocurrency should be done with great consideration, as security comes first. RXS has been certified by Certik, ensuring that it adheres to safety and transparency measures. Many investors become hesitant about crypto owing to the prevalence of terms such as rug pulls and scams. However, with Certik’s backing, Rexas Finance seeks to be a more reliable investment. Additionally, Rexas Finance offers early investor giveaways worth up to $50,000 in RXS tokens just by referring friends or engaging with the community on social media. Unlike other obscure cryptocurrencies with lengthy processes, Rexas Finance is easy to buy. Connect a MetaMask wallet and use USDT or ETH to purchase RXS tokens. Investors have a fantastic opportunity to participate in the project during its low-cost presale rates. Conclusion As Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin were hyped years ago, Rexas Finance is a new promising investment. The combination of real-world tokenization, outstanding tokenomics, and a successful presale suggests a massive increase in value. With its planned $1 million giveaway and anticipated listings in 2025, Rexas Finance could be among the best cryptocurrency investments for those seeking life-changing results.

That’s $166 million an hour, $2.7 million every minute, and a mind-numbing $45,000 a second. It’s a figure so obscene yet it’s the reality of America’s financial position. This reckless spending has pushed the U.S. Debt-to-GDP ratio to 121%, a level not even reached during World War II. In comparison, it was just 60% in 2008, back when the Great Recession first hit, because yeah, it came back last year. Since 2020, the U.S. has added $13 trillion to its debt. That’s a 57% increase in under five years. Meanwhile, as 2025 approaches, prediction markets are betting there’s a 36% chance the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) might trim $250 billion from federal spending. Sounds like a lot, right? Except it wouldn’t even scratch the surface of the deficit problem. The dollar’s grip on global finance Despite this insane financial chaos, the dollar isn’t going anywhere. For decades, doomsayers have warned about the dollar’s downfall, but it keeps flexing like an undefeated champ. From the oil crisis of the 1970s to the rise of the euro, from Japan’s economic ascent to China’s manufacturing takeover, the dollar has seen it all—and survived. Why? Because the world has no other choice. Right now, over 60% of global reserves are held in dollars. About 90% of all foreign exchange trades involve the greenback. International trade invoices? Mostly in dollars. And let’s not forget U.S. Treasuries—the so-called “safe haven” for global investors. Other currencies, like the euro or the Chinese yuan, have tried to make a play for the top spot, but they just don’t have the same liquidity or trust. China, often hyped as the dollar’s biggest threat, has its own issues. The yuan accounts for a tiny fraction of global transactions and is tightly controlled by Beijing. Investors don’t trust a currency that can’t flow freely. Meanwhile, the euro had a strong debut but lost credibility after a series of debt crises rocked the eurozone. These problems have left the dollar as the last man standing in a very shaky financial world. The dollar’s dominance is woven into the fabric of global trade and finance. The U.S. can borrow at levels that would bankrupt any other country because the dollar is still the world’s default currency. But how long can this game go on? Debt: The privilege and the price For decades, the U.S. has leaned on what economists call its “exorbitant privilege.” Basically, the world trusts the U.S. government to pay its bills, so investors keep buying Treasuries no matter how much debt America racks up. This allows Washington to borrow trillions for wars, stimulus packages, or even public-health emergencies. But that trust isn’t unlimited. Critics warn that America’s debt addiction could eventually blow up in its face. The sheer scale of the debt—combined with those $4 billion-a-day interest payments—has people wondering how much longer the U.S. can live beyond its means. And it’s not like anyone has a plan. Barack Obama tried to rein in spending with a high-powered deficit committee, but their recommendations went nowhere. Donald Trump once called the dollar both “too strong” and “too weak” while pursuing massive tax cuts that ballooned the debt even further. Joe Biden hasn’t fared much better, pushing pandemic-era spending packages that added trillions more to the tab. What’s the long-term strategy here? No one seems to know. U.S. is the dollar’s worst enemy But even countries that criticize America’s policies rely on the greenback. China, for instance, might talk about “de-dollarizing,” but it still issues dollar-denominated bonds to attract investors. Saudi Arabia recently sold $2 billion in dollar bonds. Even the much-discussed BRICS currency is years away, if it happens at all. Until something better comes along, the dollar will stay on top. But let’s not pretend this is a good thing. The dollar’s dominance allows the U.S. to print money and pile on debt without facing the kind of crises that cripple other nations. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: Washington borrows because it can, and the world keeps enabling it because they don’t have another option. The real question isn’t whether the dollar will collapse—it’s what could trigger its decline. Some economists argue that America itself poses the biggest threat to its currency. Excessive sanctions, for example, have already pushed some countries to explore alternatives. If the Oval overplays its hand, it could accidentally speed up the search for a credible dollar rival, just as Russia’s president Vladimir Putin predicted.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the project says it has been working closely with a respected asset manager to create a FLOKI-based ETP for European inventors, set to launch in Q1 of next year. “We’ve been actively working with a respected asset manager and an ETP issuer to launch a Floki ETP for quite a while now. After months of due diligence and painstaking effort, we’ve been told that the Floki ETP is on track to go live in early Q1, 2025. This proposal is to have the Floki DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) approve liquidity for the Floki ETP!” An ETP allows investors to expose themselves to specific assets without the need to actually purchase them. In the proposal, the Floki team says the ETP is already in its advanced stages and will become tradable on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland, as soon as next year and become the second meme coin in the world with a live ETP. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way. This is a big move that is almost unprecedented in this space, because Dogecoin is currently the only memecoin in the WORLD, with a live ETP, and Floki could become the next memecoin with an ETP besides Dogecoin.” The proposal also includes provisions for burning FLOKI tokens as well as providing liquidity for the ETP. “The purpose of this DAO proposal is to seek approval from the Floki DAO for providing liquidity to the ETP… We currently hold 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens in [a crypto wallet] and propose using a portion of them to provision liquidity for the ETP while burning the remainder on the day the ETP launches.” FLOKI is trading for $0.000177 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 23:02:00

Table of Contents Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments 3 promising altcoins for last-minute Investment Lesser-known altcoins for last-minute investments As the cryptocurrency market approaches the end of 2024, investors are keenly observing altcoins that exhibit the potential for significant growth before the year’s close. While established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have garnered substantial attention, newer entrants like Pepe (PEPE) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are also capturing the market’s interest. This shift in attention underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where new projects can rapidly gain prominence, influencing trading strategies and market trends. Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments Investors are seeking final chances in the crypto marketplace hoping to earn cash before a new year. This period usually shows extra moves in the market with traders eager t͏o improve their stash for end-year outcomes. One way that is noticed is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves saving a set amount of cash at normal times, regardless of the market condition. This method reduces the impact of market rises and falls and cuts down the risk of making poor choices from fast market shifts. Another is Market Cycle Investing, which refers to timing funds on the crypto market’s circular nature. By checking old data and market trends, investors seek to buy when the market is down and sell when it’s up. There’s also a mix of investments. By spreading money over different types of digital coins, investors can handle risk and raise the chance for gains. Mixing helps to balance the ups and downs found in the crypto market. It’s key to know that while these me͏thods can work, they also have risks as the crypto market is always changing. As such, doing a deep study and matching buy choices with personal money goals and risk comfort is crucial.

The firm offering less volatile access to Bitcoin also holds U.S. Treasuries for liquidity. Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF Strive Asset Management, run by Vivek Ramaswamy, is filing with the SEC on a “ Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF. ” The 485A filing suggests investment landscapes shift from the old “follow the money” to new “follow the Bitcoin.” The proposed ETF is going to offer access to MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds, which have become so popular due to the potentially more favorable regulatory climate under the new administration. This is an important step by Strive as digital assets are gaining popularity in the financial world. The demand for MicroStrategy’s bonds that convert into stocks based on Bitcoin’s performance has been strong broader market for Bitcoin-related investments. There is also an expectation that following Donald Trump’s recent election victory, regulatory hurdles may ease for digital assets and more institutions will look at crypto-related financial products at ease. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Funds, has been open about the strategy of the fund, pointing out that he is going to focus on vehicles that would be best suited by having a digital asset-friendly administration. His comments give an insight into what might be expected in 2025. Investment Strategy and Objective Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF strategy lies investment in what they describe as “Bitcoin Bonds. ” These are convertibles from a company such as MicroStrategy that happens to plough large proportions of the proceeds of bonds into Bitcoin. The use of derivative instruments by this ETF will enable to managing their exposure in these securities. The main objective of this fund is to replicate Bitcoin for investors through these Bitcoin Bonds and derivatives, allowing the investor to have less volatile exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it. The fund will invest in U.S. government securities, primarily Treasuries, to ensure liquidity and support its derivative positions. It may also invest in other investment companies specializing in Bitcoin-related financial instruments to diversify its approach to capturing the potential of Bitcoin. It indicates the growing acceptance of bitcoin in traditional finance and thereby has portrayed a strategic change towards digital assets that will help redefine how investment strategies get built. With Ramaswamy’s background opposition to corporate governance norms as well as his firm, which opposes ESG; this particular ETF might find investors who are looking out for non-traditional options which highlights the Bitcoin’s aspects.

Analyst Breaks Down the Data",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/who-profited-during-bitcoin-100000-surge-analyst-breaks-down-the-data/,"Bitcoin ongoing price movement has sparked intense analysis as it continues to hover below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching an all-time high above $108,000 last week, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain upward momentum ever since. With this performance, BTC’s on-chain data has been brought to the spotlight to uncover the factors driving recent selling pressures and investor behavior. One key focus has been the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) indicator, which provides valuable insights into Bitcoin holders’ activity based on their holding periods. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? Who Cashed Out Their Bitcoin Gains? According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Yonsei Dent, data reveals that Bitcoin investors who bought their holdings between six to twelve months ago were the most active sellers during the recent price surge. This group largely entered the market during the initial excitement surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in the year. While this selling activity exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, the asset has managed to stabilize within the $90,000–$100,000 range. Interestingly, long-term holders, defined as those holding Bitcoin for over a year, have shown minimal selling activity. Historical trends suggest that these seasoned investors are likely anticipating elevated price levels before considering substantial profit-taking. Meanwhile, Dent pointed to the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric showing a noticeable decline in older Bitcoin being moved in December compared to November. Historically, reduced activity from long-term holders during price corrections often signals market resilience and potential for future upward momentum. The analyst wrote: The ‘Binary CDD’ indicator at the bottom of the chart shows a decline in the selling of older Bitcoin in December compared to November. This suggests that many long-term holders may anticipate even higher prices before selling. Binance Reserves Signal Market Confidence Speaking of higher prices, another crucial metric suggesting a significant move brewing for Bitcoin comes from Binance’s Bitcoin reserves, which have been steadily declining since August. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted that Binance’s reserves recently hit their lowest level since January. This trend is significant because a similar decline earlier in the year preceded a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price. The reduction in exchange reserves typically indicates that investors are moving their Bitcoin holdings away from centralized exchanges and into private wallets. Such behavior suggests reduced selling pressure and a preference for long-term holding strategies. Historically, declining reserves on exchanges have often aligned with periods of strong market optimism and price rallies. Notably, as BTC currently still trades at a price of $95,567 down by 2.7% in the past day, the confluence of these factors—long-term holder confidence, reduced activity from older wallets, and declining exchange reserves—presents a cautiously optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors look to 1Fuel as Cardano (ADA) Ethereum (ETH) struggle. Table of Contents ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum ADA faces high-selling pressure Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Conclusion With the current retracements, some altcoins have found it difficult to regain momentum. Ethereum, which rose to $4,000, nearing its ATH of $4,792, has declined drastically. Cardano trails a similar path, falling below $0.91. Should there be more retracements, analysts suggest they might consolidate at their current values or experience further decreases. However, a new token, 1Fuel , has been gaining traction and recording an increase in sales. Currently, in its second phase selling at $0.012, 1Fuel has raised $835,000, with experts ranking it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy for 2025. ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum In the past 24 hours, ETH has struggled to break out of $3,477 resistance and has assumed a bearish state with a high chance of ETH dipping below $3,300 before a rebound. ETH’s long/short ratio — a metric to track the ratio of buyers to sellers in the market — is at 0.98 and on the verge of entering 1, a bullish sign. This means that investors believe that ETH still has the potential to increase, allocating more funds to it. However, if ETH reverses from its current price, there’s a possibility of it dipping to $3,000, which will result in a massive loss for these investors. The uncertainty surrounding the ETH’s rally has caused investors to eye 1Fuel because of its potential offerings. 1Fuel has recorded a massive increment in its token presales, and it’s set to change the investment narratives in the cryptocurrency market in 2025. ADA faces high-selling pressure ADA is currently trading at $0.86. The token has seen a 9.63% decline in its trading volume. This indicates that there’s high selling pressure, pushing ADA’s price downwards. ADA may gain momentum if it drops into the $0.73–$0.63 range, where buyer interest is anticipated. However, investors should exercise caution, as market volatility could push prices below this range, leading to potential losses. Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Experts predict at least a 500% surge in price after 1Fuel launches on top cryptocurrency exchanges. Notably, investors will get a 30% APR on all their staked coins, meaning they can earn passively. 1Fuel will also support P2P trading on its platform, giving room for users to trade directly with other users at low fees. Furthermore, with 1Fuel, users will get a built-in AI-powered feature that will make all the functions in the cryptocurrency wallet easy for them to use, facilitating seamless transactions. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market regains momentum, coins like ETH and ADA have been finding it hard to join the bullish trend. However, 1Fuel is set to create a buzz in the altcoin market. The new crypto is currently selling at $0.012 but is expected to surge more than 100x once it hits top cryptocurrency exchanges. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

Table of Contents Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Bitcoin Conclusion A trader famed for accurately forecasting Bitcoin’s price movements now suggests that a meme token, currently priced at $0.0007, could soar to $1 in 2025. This bold prediction has caught the attention of the crypto world, sparking curiosity about the potential of this overlooked token. Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Donald Trump’s comeback has lit a fire under the crypto market, with meme coins roaring back into the limelight. While blue-chip tokens make incremental gains, Catzilla is ready to leap ahead, positioning itself as the apex predator in this new meme coin renaissance. Trump’s vision of a pro-crypto America sets the stage for unparalleled growth, creating the perfect storm for meme coins to thrive. Among them, Catzilla stands tall, ready to shatter expectations and claim the throne. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s here to rewrite the playbook for decentralized finance. Starting at just $0.0002, Catzilla’s presale climbs to $0.0016 over 14 stages, offering early adopters significant growth opportunities. Stage 4 is live at $0.0006, with a 16.67% price increase looming. Catzilla doesn’t just offer investment opportunities; it empowers the community with its a unique referral system: 8% USDT on direct referral purchases. 2% USDT on second-tier referrals. 1% USDT on third-tier referrals. With BTC and other major coins seemingly losing momentum, Catzilla rises as the ultimate underdog poised for greatness. You might also like: 4 overlooked cryptos poised to turn $200 into half a million: Catzilla on spotlight Bitcoin Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, using blockchain technology to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Its transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and earn BTC as rewards. With a capped supply of 21 million BTC and halving events that reduce miners’ rewards every four years, Bitcoin is designed to be scarce. This scarcity, along with increasing adoption, gives it potential as a digital store of value. Conclusion With BTC and other major coins showing less short-term potential, Catzilla steps up as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a 700% ROI during its presale. Its triple utility empowers holders through governance, rewards, and staking. Catzilla seeks to unite enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom, inviting participation in the battle against crypto villains.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 00:22:00

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Jason Pizzino tells his 123,400 followers that investor sentiment indicates traders now are closer to the end of the bull market than the start. “Bitcoin and crypto ‘end-stage’ emotional volatility has dramatically increased which only suggests we are much closer to the end than the beginning of the cycle. That might seem like an obvious statement now, but wait until the market gets closer to the final top; it won’t be so obvious which is generally a signal within itself.” In an accompanying video update, Pizzino says historically, when the market gets excited and overconfident, stagnation tends to follow. “I think a lot of people believe this cycle should run until the end of 2025, but what if we’re seeing a lot of that excitement come back into the market? Every time it goes up, all I see is just everyone getting super bullish and then it pauses for a bit, corrects, and then we start on the next move. So I’m just keeping an open mind.” Source: Jason Pizzino/X The trader’s chart uses Bitcoin ( BTC ) as an example. According to Pizzino, the top crypto asset by market cap may correct or trade sideways all the way until October 2025. “Looking somewhere [between] Q2 out to Q3, just the beginning of Q4… Most people can’t handle six to 10 months. They talked about a drop of one month and they all freaked out yesterday, it’s absolutely bonkers out there, which is why I think we are in those final moves, basically the end of the cycle.” BTC is trading at $98,900 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Bitcoin Average Coin Age Has Been Trending Up Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the recent trend in the Average Coin Age for Bitcoin. The “Average Coin Age” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of how long the average BTC token has been staying dormant for. A coin is said to be dormant when it sits still inside an address without being involved in any sort of transaction activity. The longer the coin stays in this state, the more it ‘ages’ up. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 4%, Whale Reacts With $69 Million Coinbase Deposit Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age has seen some sharp spikes this year, but also some equally steep declines. This would suggest that the investors have been participating in some phases of HODLing, but they have also not been shying away from taking some profits. On the whole, however, the holders have shown notable resolve, as the 365-day MA of the indicator has been in a constant state of uptrend since the end of the 2022 bear market. Statistically, the longer investors hold onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the fact that the investors have been increasingly preferring to keep their coins dormant can be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency’s price. Interestingly, this trend didn’t develop during the 2021 bull market, as even though the 30-day MA of the Average Coin Age saw a period of uptrend, the 365-day MA moved down throughout the year instead. This could imply the average investor has become smarter this cycle. In the short-term, the 30-day MA of the indicator has been rapidly climbing, which implies the Bitcoin market is currently in one of the phases of active accumulation.

Following the latest jump, nearly a third of the asset’s tokens in circulation haven’t been involved in a transaction since more than five years ago.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 01:45:00

Avalanche (AVAX) is riding high after traders spotted massive potential in FX Guy’s trading systems, aiming for up to 20x returns. Meanwhile, SEI (SEI) is turning heads with its lightning-fast Layer-1 blockchain, built to handle the demands of high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). These projects are grabbing attention for good reason—2024 is shaping up to be a year of bold moves and even bigger gains in the crypto space. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , a project with its eyes set on solving the very problems that have held crypto back from mainstream adoption. With a groundbreaking partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is about to make crypto transactions as simple as buying a cup of coffee. Its innovative features are designed for real-life usability, putting it in a league of its own.

Picture small businesses finally embracing crypto payments without worrying about complexity. Freelancers get paid instantly, without waiting for banks to clear funds. And regular users manage their digital assets with ease. With Qubetics, the barriers to entry are crumbling fast. The numbers speak for themselves. Qubetics’ presale is in its 14th stage, and it’s already sold over 377 million tokens to more than 11,800 holders, raising $7.8 million. Priced at just $0.0377 right now, $TICS tokens will see a 10% price increase this weekend as the 15th stage kicks off. If you’re looking to get in on the action, now’s the time to act. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling New Heights in 2024 Avalanche has cemented itself as a force to be reckoned with in decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming.

The token’s rally has gathered massive interest from large-scale investors, who have heavily invested in the token over the last few days. Related Reading: ONDO Faces 30% Correction Risk If It Loses $1.46 Support – Top Analyst New Solana Token Steals The Spotlight On December 17, the Pudgy Penguins Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project launched its official token, PENGU, on the Solana Blockchain. The token has moved through the ranks, flipping other Solana-based tokens and gathering massive attention in nine days. Pudgy Penguins, one of the largest NFT collections, consists of 8,888 unique cartoons of cute penguins and has a market capitalization of 205,757 ETH. In anticipation of the token launch, the project surged as the second-largest NFT collection, only falling behind CryptoPunks. Since its launch three years ago, the project has seen its community significantly grow and “cemented itself in the hearts and minds of everyday people and culture,” according to the project’s team. Additionally, it is expected to contribute to the project’s governance despite not having a specific use case announced yet. As such, the newly launched cryptocurrency aims to “expand its community and further widen the reach” of the project by allowing old and new users “to align” themselves with the penguins. According to CoinGecko data, the Solana-based memecoin debuted with a 500% surge to a market capitalization of $3.5 billion but registered massive volatility in the following days. Just hours after launching, PENGU’s price retraced over 50% before descending to a $1.4 billion market cap on December 20. The token hovered between the $0.025-$0.037 range over a few days, stabilizing around the range’s upper zone on Christmas Eve. Whales Fill Their Bags As PENGU Flips BONK Amid the market’s momentary Christmas Day gains, the token broke above this range and climbed to the $0.042 mark on Thursday morning, hitting a $2.6 billion market cap. During this 18% rally, the token flipped dogwifhat (WIF) and BONK to become the largest Solana memecoin by market cap, currently holding its position as the sector’s leader. PENGU became the fourth largest memecoin by this metric, just behind Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Additionally, in the last 24 hours, the token has seen a 25% increase in market activity, with a daily trading volume of $1.92 billion. According to on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain, Crypto whales have also noticed PENGU’s rally, with several large-scale investors filling their bags over the past week.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 03:03:00

If you’ve been keeping your eyes peeled on the crypto scene, you know that meme coins have taken the market by storm, and this month, there’s one standout that’s going to make your wallet roar with excitement. Forget the usual suspects; we’re talking about BTFD Coin and its epic festive offer. With its community-driven approach, innovative gaming features, and legendary presale numbers (more than $4.5 million raised to this day), BTFD Coin is leading the charge. If you thought the price was already a steal, hold on tight—thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can unlock a jaw-dropping 50% bonus ! This isn’t just any sale. The bonus draws inspiration from the iconic 1973 market crash, a time when savvy investors seized the moment and rode the waves to success. So buckle up, because BTFD Coin is ready to rocket into 2025. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin to Watch for the Long Haul When it comes to the best new meme coins to invest in this month, BTFD Coin has earned its spot at the top. Not only is it packed with insane features like high-yield staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’ll keep you entertained for hours, and a strong, vibrant community, but it also offers an incredible opportunity for long-term growth. The festive 50% offer that you can unlock with the BIG50 code is the cherry on top. Let’s be real—who doesn’t love a good deal? Now, you might be wondering, “Why the 1973 market crash?” Well, it’s all about history repeating itself. Back in the ‘70s, the oil market crashed, and while many investors panicked, others saw an opportunity to buy in low and hold for the long term. Just like them, you’ve got the chance to grab BTFD Coin with a massive deal—before it potentially blows up and leaves everyone else in the dust. Let’s break it down with an investment example: If you put $6,000 into BTFD Coin at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d initially receive 46,153,846 $BTFD tokens. But here’s the kicker—with the BIG50 bonus, you’ll snag an additional 50% tokens, bringing your total to 69,230,769 coins. If the price rises to $0.0006 (a target many analysts are predicting), that investment could skyrocket to $41,538.46. ANDY: The Pepe Sidekick Changes the Game If you’ve been around the crypto scene, you’ve probably heard of Pepe, the meme king of crypto. Now, meet ANDY, Pepe’s lifelong best friend, who has finally decided to launch his own meme coin and show the world what he’s made of. ANDY is all about fun, memes, and good vibes. And while it might not have the same explosive growth as some of the bigger coins out there, ANDY has a dedicated fanbase and a unique position in the market. With a circulating supply of 1 trillion ANDY coins, the token is all about community, making it an appealing option for anyone who’s looking to hop onto the Pepe train. Currently, the price of ANDY is sitting at $0.000196, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.7 million. While the coin is currently down by about 14%, it’s still a solid contender in the meme coin race. If you’re looking for something a bit different, ANDY could be worth a closer look. DOGS: A Community-Driven Coin with a Woof Another contender in the meme coin world is DOGS, a coin that’s all about community ownership and fun vibes. Built on the TON blockchain, DOGS has already created a buzz by leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and incorporating meme culture into its core. If you’re part of the Telegram community, you’ve probably seen the iconic DOGS mascot popping up everywhere. However, like ANDY, DOGS has recently faced a bit of a dip, with the price down by around 7% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, the DOGS project is far from being counted out. It boasts a market cap of over $270 million and a dedicated following that keeps the coin’s spirit alive. With a circulating supply of over 500 billion coins, DOGS is another community-driven coin that’s worth keeping an eye on. How to Claim Your Bonus on BTFD Coin’s Presale Today If you’re ready to take advantage of this killer offer, here’s how you can claim your 50% bonus: Go to the Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50 , and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and take a look at the updated amount. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

33767162,[object Object],1735270226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Erases Christmas Gains: Social Media Sentiment May Have Foreshadowed This,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-christmas-gains-social-media-foreshadowed/,"Bitcoin has crashed today, erasing the gains from the Christmas rally. Here’s how this may have been foreshadowed by social media sentiment. Social Media Users Got Too Hyped During Latest Bitcoin Rally On Christmas Day, Bitcoin came close to touching the $100,000 mark, but in the past day, the coin has seen a sharp reversal of trend as its price has collapsed toward the $95,000 level. Like with any other price plunge, there are bound to be several factors contributing to the trend. One of these could potentially be the sentiment shared by traders on social media. When BTC had rallied yesterday, the analytics firm Santiment had shared a chart that revealed how social media had been reacting to the run. The indicator cited by the analytics firm was the “ Social Dominance .” The Social Dominance keeps track of the percentage of the total social media discussions related to the top 100 cryptocurrencies that a given term or topic occupies. Santiment has used this metric for gauging sentiment on the major social media platforms by applying Bitcoin and price-target-related terms to it. The price targets in question are $90,000, $100,000, and $110,000. In the context of the recent rally, investors posting about the $90,000 target would naturally be bearish on BTC. Similarly, the posts containing $100,000 would reflect a neutral sentiment, and those with $110,000 would correspond to bullish optimism. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Social Dominance for these terms over the last month: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Social Dominance for the $110,000 target spiked during the latest rally, implying the social media users were quite bullish about the run and expected it to continue until a new all-time high (ATH) . Historically, the cryptocurrency’s price has tended to move in a manner opposite to the expectations of the crowd. This probability of a contrary move taking place has also only gone up the more sure the traders have become about a direction. As such, while some optimism may not prove to be bad for a rally, an excess of hype can make a reversal more likely to take place. From the chart, it’s apparent that the Social Dominance of the level had also spiked twice earlier in the month and on both occasions, BTC had ended up suffering price declines. Given the past precedence, it’s not surprising to see that the latest price rally also ended up in failure after the traders on social media got overly excited about where the run could lead to. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $96,100, down almost 4% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Christmas|bitcoin sentiment|Bitcoin Social Media|Bitcoin Social Media Sentiment|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-27 03:30:26

Meanwhile, Ethereum traders recently made some impressive profits, and one trader earned $1.1M from a leveraged short. Analysts also predict that ETH could outperform Bitcoin in early 2025. Ethereum ETFs, like BlackRock’s ETHA, are already gaining momentum by attracting millions in inflows, contrasting with Bitcoin ETFs. Vitalik Buterin Adopts Viral Pygmy Hippo Moo Deng Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, captured the internet’s attention by adopting Moo Deng, a pygmy hippopotamus that became a viral sensation earlier this year. The announcement was made by Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo on Dec. 26 through a post on X which revealed that Buterin contributed 10,000,000 Thai Baht (or $292,000) to support Moo Deng and her family as part of the Wildlife Sponsorship Program. The zoo is extremely grateful that Buterin will be supporting Moo Deng over the next two years. Moo Deng rose to fame in September of 2024 thanks to her playful personality and the widely shared videos posted by the zoo, which captivated audiences worldwide. After the adoption announcement, Buterin indicated that his support could extend further, and revealed plans to allocate 88 ETH, which is equivalent to over $290,000, to assist Moo Deng and her companions. Buterin’s philanthropy in 2024 also included a $180,000 Ethereum donation to the biotech charity Kanro, which came from meme coins that were sent to his wallet. The viral phenomenon of Moo Deng extended beyond just the confines of social media, and even inspired the creation of a Solana-based meme coin named MOODENG . Early investors reaped impressive profits from the token, and one trader transformed a $1,300 investment into $3.4 million. However, the token’s success was short-lived as its value plummeted by about 58% from its peak price of $0.62 in mid-November 2024. Data from Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, revealed that more than 99% of traders suffered losses or gained less than $1,000. Out of 8.5 million wallets, only 50 earned up to $1,000, while five wallets achieved profits between $1,000 and $10,000. Just one wallet managed to exceed $10,000 in earnings. Despite the financial turbulence, Moo Deng is still a symbol of joy and community engagement, now with the added support of one of cryptocurrency’s most influential figures. Trader Nets $1.1M on Ether Short MOODENG was not the only token that traders lucked out on. A crypto trader recently made more than $1.1 million in profit in just two days by strategically shorting Ethereum (ETH) during the current market correction. By using a 50x leveraged short position, the trader borrowed 19,186 Ether, worth more than $64.5 million, when its price was $3,428. This position was opened on Dec. 24, and also earned the trader over $680,000 in funding fees. According to blockchain data from Hypurrscan , the short position carries a liquidation price above $4,750. On-chain intelligence firm Lookonchain revealed that the trader faced a $1.2 million loss on the first day. However, the market's subsequent downturn flipped the position into a highly profitable trade. While leveraged trading can amplify returns, it still carries some serious risks. These risks took center stage in January of 2024 during an incident where a trader lost over $161,000 after being liquidated on a leveraged position. The past year has seen other traders make extraordinary profits in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin’s historic climb past $100,000 on Dec. 5 was especially a boon for many, while meme coin traders also saw good returns. One such trader turned a $27 investment into $52 million over 600 days by capitalizing on PEPE’s meteoric rise. Another trader in May achieved a $46 million profit from a $3,000 investment in PEPE. Ether Poised for Breakout Traders can make even more money off ETH as the altcoin is showing potential for a breakout against Bitcoin in January 2025. TradingView data revealed that the ETH/BTC ratio strands close to 0.0356, and MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe suggested it could surpass 0.04 in January. The last time the ratio hit 0.04 was on Dec. 8, when ETH reached $4,018. Van de Poppe expects increased inflows into Ether in the coming month, while Bitcoin may experience outflows that could potentially consolidate its price. This shift could trigger an “altcoin run,” which happens when alternative tokens like Ethereum gain more market momentum. Already, key Ethereum ecosystem tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mantle recorded impressive price increases recently. Bitcoin , meanwhile, continues to trade below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching the six-figure milestone on Dec. 5, its current performance contrasts with the enthusiasm building around Ethereum and altcoins. Analysts also predict that spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could outperform Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. Nate Geraci , the president of ETF Store, shared that inflows into ETH ETFs are aligning with those of gold ETFs and may accelerate even more in the near future. Pseudonymous trader Brent compared Ether’s current state to a ”ball forcibly held underwater,” which means that the altcoin has the potential for explosive growth. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen noticed earlier in December that the ETH/BTC ratio’s decline is either over or nearing its conclusion, which also sets the stage for potential growth over the next 6 to 12 months. Ethereum ETF Gains Momentum While Bitcoin ETFs Face Outflows BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), attracted almost $44 million in inflows on Christmas eve, bringing its total net assets to $3.65 billion, according to data from SoSoValue . In contrast, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) faced outflows of $188 million, contributing to an overall $338 million bleed from Bitcoin ETFs on the same day. Among the Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded outflows of $83.16 million and $75 million, respectively. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) stood out as the only product in the green, gaining $8.5 million in inflows. Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF also performed well after attracting roughly $6 million in inflows. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite the recent underperformance, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is still a standout success thanks to it amassing close to $54 billion in net assets in less than a year. This achievement cements its position as one of the most successful cryptocurrency stories of the year. Industry experts, including Bitwise, predict that the total Bitcoin ETF inflows next year could surpass those of 2024. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed the estimated holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, though the exact number of coins owned by Nakamoto is still unknown.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-27 03:30:47

The idea? To offer investors a way to gain exposure to firms embracing the “Bitcoin standard.” Curious what that means? Let’s break it down. A Closer Look at Bitwise’s Plan The proposed fund, called the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF , is no ordinary ETF. To qualify for inclusion, companies must hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their reserves. That’s not all. They also need a market capitalization of at least $100 million, daily liquidity of $1 million, and less than 10% of their stock privately held. Source : SEC Edgar Here’s where it gets interesting: the ETF doesn’t weigh companies based on their market size, like most funds do. Instead, it focuses on the value of their Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy, which holds a whopping 444,262 BTC, would dominate the ETF, even though Tesla owns far fewer Bitcoin (9,720 BTC) but has a much larger market cap. Each holding, however, is capped at 25% to keep things balanced. Bitcoin’s Growing Corporate Appeal Why are companies diving into Bitcoin? Partly because it’s great for their stock prices. Take KULR Technology Group , for instance. They bought 217.18 BTC for $21 million earlier this month. That decision paid off big time, boosting their stock price by 40%. And let’s not forget Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency has soared 117% this year, hitting a record high of $108,000 in December. Even now, it’s holding steady at around $95,800. It’s clear that Bitcoin’s appeal is only growing. What to Expect Bitwise’s ETF isn’t the only one vying for attention. Strive, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed for an ETF focused on Bitcoin bonds. It’ll be interesting to see how these competing proposals play out. For investors looking to bet on Bitcoin’s rising adoption, these ETFs could open exciting new doors. But as always with crypto, there’s a mix of potential and uncertainty.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 03:54:28

Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created simultaneously, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This method transforms the blockchain into a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). By generalizing Nakamoto consensus, Kaspa achieves secure operation with very high block rates. Currently, it produces one block per second, aiming to increase to 10 blocks per second and potentially 100 in the future. This results in minimal confirmation times, primarily limited by internet latency. Kaspa’s implementation includes features such as Reachability to query the blockDAG’s topology and block data pruning, with plans for block header pruning. It supports Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and will later include subnetwork support, which will facilitate future layer 2 solutions. The coin introduces innovations in blockchain technology and addresses scalability while maintaining security. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s technological advancements may be noteworthy to those following developments in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.

These activities, which include cryptocurrency theft and IT-related foreign currency generation, are said to be funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. Crypto Crimes Funding Military Developments In a press statement released on Boxing Day, the South Korean government announced it had designated 15 North Korean IT employees and one organization under independent sanctions. The individuals allegedly belong to the 313th General Bureau, an entity tied to the DPRK’s Ministry of Munitions Industry, which oversees the country’s weapons development programs. Among them, Kim-Cheol-Min is accused of working secretly for technology firms in the United States and Canada, funneling large sums of money to the North Korean regime. Another individual, Kim Ryu-Sung, previously faced indictment in the U.S. for violating sanctions. The measures will also target the Chosun Geumjeong Economic Information Technology Exchange Company, which is claimed to dispatch IT workers abroad to help generate foreign currency for North Korea. The money is reportedly used to finance military developments in the pariah nation. Once the sanctions come into effect on December 30, 2024, South Korean laws require that any financial transactions with the affected individuals and entities must receive approval from the Financial Services Commission or the Governor of the Bank of Korea. Growing North Korean Threat The restrictions against the alleged DPRK agents come even as a recent Chainalysis report revealed that North Korean actors were responsible for 61% of the $2.2 billion stolen in 2024 in crypto heists across the globe. The hackers used sophisticated tactics, including malware deployment and social engineering, allowing them to target major digital asset companies. In one instance, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Radiant Capital suffered a $50 million hack attributed to the North Koreans. The attackers orchestrated the breach through malware distributed via Telegram, exploiting weaknesses in the platform’s security. Additionally, the notorious hacking outfit, the Lazarus Group, has been linked to another $50 million heist, this time on the Upbit crypto exchange. South Korean authorities, in collaboration with the FBI and Swiss prosecutors, confirmed the group’s involvement and shed light on its ties to the DPRK’s main intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Kaspersky Labs security analyst Vasily Berdnikov also connected the syndicate with an elaborate hacking plot that involved cloning a popular blockchain game and embedding malicious code within its website, allowing it to install malware on the systems of anyone playing the game. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have been tackling related issues. On December 17, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned two individuals and an entity for allegedly laundering millions of dollars in crypto for the Kim Jong Un administration.

All attention is now drawn to 1Fuel (OFT) , the token behind the cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet in development to simplify transactions. Experts say that at presale stage 2, with over $800,000 raised so far, its current price of $0.012 is a bargain. Here’s a deeper look: ADA falls below $1 as investors back off Investors in ADA are backing out one after the other, as reflected in the weeks of decline. ADA dropped by 12% in the past week alone, placing it at $0.91 at press time with technical indicators hinting at further decrease. Investors are closing their positions on ADA as the only hope for a bounce back hinges on a descending channel, involving prices dropping lower (within a support and resistance line) before bouncing higher. Analysts say ADA could fall as low as $0.60 before any major upward momentum occurs. With ADA’s trading volume declining by 9.90% and its price dropping 1.61% in the last 24 hours, this suggests a market divergence with possible exhaustion in the buying, indicating an incoming decline. Investors, not wanting to be caught in this downside murkiness, are leaving ADA and seeking better alternatives. XRP has also been ruled out as a profitable asset to purchase. XRP investors might begin opting out After a month-long rally, XRP has now dropped. Over the past 7 days, it caused investors to lose 5.36%, falling as low as $1.9. However, XRP is currently trading within a consolidation channel known as an asymmetrical triangle. The price trading in this channel involves a slow and steady buying of the asset (in this case, XRP ) at a low price before a final upswing. However, this phase could last weeks or even months, leaving investors uncertain about when a meaningful rally will surface for XRP . Following the recent downturn and the lack of a definitive date for a rally, investors are turning to 1Fuel . With its presale price at $0.012, experts claim it is the cheapest cryptocurrency to buy in 2024 . 1Fuel: Investor’s yield generator, ahead of ADA and XRP 1Fuel has become the talk of the crypto community as its presale stage 2 has generated $800,000 in nearly two weeks, driven purely by market interest. Experts project that 1Fuel could deliver 100x returns by the end of its presale and upon the launch of its associated wallet. The wallet aims to solve critical pain points in the crypto ecosystem, including cross-chain transaction inefficiencies, unified gas fees, and streamlined off-ramp and on-ramp solutions. With a clear roadmap and strong market interest, 1Fuel is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the best crypto investments of 2024 . Conclusion As one of the best crypto investments of 2024 , with the potential to return 100X and backed by the anticipated cryptocurrency wallet , it is without doubt that experts are correct in predicting 1Fuel’s potential to outperform other crypto assets in the market, ADA and XRP inclusive.

Solana and Its Role In Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for speed and scalability. It allows developers to build decentralized applications while competing with platforms like Ethereum. The system processes transactions quickly without relying on sharding or side chains. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is used for transaction fees, program execution, and network rewards. Its architecture supports developers with tools across various programming languages. This versatility makes Solana suitable for hosting projects requiring high performance. The coin’s value is tied to its ecosystem’s growth and adoption. SOL appeals to those looking for efficient blockchain solutions. The focus on high capacity and developer-friendly tools positions Solana as an option for scalable innovations in blockchain technology. Avalanche: Efficient Blockchain with Customizable Subnet Functionality Avalanche is a fast, energy-efficient blockchain with low fees. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second and finalizes them in under two seconds. Its structure includes three chains for specific tasks like transactions and smart contracts. Users can create custom Subnets tailored to specific needs. The network uses a hybrid consensus model combining classical and Nakamoto methods. AVAX, its native token, is used for fees, staking, and running Subnets. It can also support payment systems and the creation of custom blockchains. This combination of speed, functionality, and adaptability makes Avalanche and AVAX appealing in the evolving blockchain market. Conclusion While Solana and Avalanche may offer steady growth, they show less short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN embodies luxury and success for those seeking the best. With expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN is poised to dominate this altcoin season, building a community of alpha leaders who settle for nothing less.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 04:30:00

Positioned as the most explosive crypto opportunity of the year, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers investors a rare chance to capitalize on a New Year’s miracle of unprecedented proportions. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 65,500% Rally That Could Define Your New Year WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly rising as one of the most thrilling tokens in the cryptocurrency landscape. While the Cardano price is expected to surpass $5 by March 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is capturing global investor attention with a predicted jaw-dropping 65,500% surge by January. Experts attribute this explosive potential to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) groundbreaking utilities, including an AI-powered, decentralized platform loaded with cutting-edge features like AI-enhanced portfolio management, a multimodal chatbot, and convenient QR-based Scan & Pay solutions. These innovations ease DeFi investments, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a market leader and a long-term asset for generating massive gains beyond January 2025.

ADA’s $5 Breakthrough: Cardano Price Prediction For 2025 The Cardano price has been steadily gaining traction as one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. With a promising roadmap and robust technological advancements, analysts now predict the Cardano price could break the $5 milestone from $0.897 by March 2025, making it a key contender in the race for blockchain dominance. A major driver for this projected surge in the Cardano price is its revolutionary proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which offers unparalleled energy efficiency and scalability. As more developers flock to the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, the demand for ADA, the native token, continues to rise. This growing adoption fuels optimism that the Cardano price will skyrocket in the coming years. In addition, Cardano’s (ADA) strategic partnerships and expanding utility further solidify its position as a market leader. From powering decentralized applications to facilitating secure smart contracts, the platform’s versatility is attracting investors. Experts believe these developments could catapult the Cardano price into uncharted territory. As the crypto market matures, regulatory clarity and institutional interest are also expected to play a pivotal role in ADA’s growth. With these favorable conditions, the Cardano price breaking $5 by March 2025 seems increasingly plausible. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale: The Future Of Crypto Growth Starts Here While the Cardano price climbs toward the $5 milestone, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the true standout in the crypto world. Predictions point to an astonishing 65,500% surge by January 2025, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the most bullish asset on the market. Backed by a successful SolidProof smart contract audit , WallitIQ (WLTQ) is earning trust among investors, while its presale price of just $0.0243 offers an unbeatable opportunity for massive returns. Combining reliability with unparalleled growth potential, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has quickly become the go-to token for those aiming to achieve life-changing profits by 2025. With demand skyrocketing, WallitIQ (WLTQ)’s presale is selling out rapidly, making this a limited opportunity to secure a position in this high-growth token. Experts anticipate that the token’s value will soar by 65,500% in the coming months, offering a rare chance to transform your portfolio.

This optimistic outlook is driven by India’s progressive efforts to create frameworks that build trust, boost innovation, and expand blockchain use. India’s Growing Importance in Crypto Regulation India’s growing role in cryptocurrency regulation is gaining attention, especially as 2024 marked major advancements in crypto adoption and institutional interest, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $108K . One of the defining moments was the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Therefore, Vishal Sacheendran, Head of Regional Markets at Binance, believes India will take the lead in global crypto regulation by 2025, helping to build trust and support growth in the industry. Sacheendran also highlighted Binance’s efforts to keep up with India’s changing rules. The company has been working to grow its presence in the country, showing its commitment to offering safe and legal crypto services. Sacheendran further notes that the future of crypto is not just about trading but about creating a decentralized and innovative digital ecosystem that benefits everyone. India’s Shifting Stance Towards Crypto India’s journey toward crypto regulation began in 2019 with a draft bill proposing a complete ban on cryptocurrencies. However, this bill was never presented in Parliament, and over time, India’s approach became less strict, influenced by global trends. During a recent Parliament session , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has advised the government to create rules for cryptocurrencies. Still, the government believes that any ban would need global cooperation. However, the government has also introduced taxes on virtual assets. A 30% tax on crypto profits began on April 1, followed by a 1% TDS from July 1. These rules have caused a drop in trading activity on crypto exchanges in India.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 04:50:11

You don’t just buy coins and hope they go up anymore. Strive Asset Manager, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is pushing the boundaries with a new kind of fund. They’ve filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF, which could let investors profit from companies that are big on Bitcoin—without directly owning any. Strive files for “Bitcoin Bond” ETF… Would seek exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy. pic.twitter.com/ybJjbVFWUN — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 26, 2024 If that sounds a bit confusing, don’t worry. The idea is actually pretty simple. Companies like MicroStrategy have been using bonds to invest in Bitcoin for years. Strive wants to bring that strategy to investors like you. What Exactly Are Bitcoin Bonds? Bitcoin bonds aren’t actually Bitcoin. They’re more like loans companies take out. MicroStrategy, for example, issues bonds to raise cash, which they then use to buy Bitcoin. These bonds are interesting because they can turn into shares of the company later. It’s a risky move, but for MicroStrategy, it’s been a jackpot. Their stock has soared over 2,200% since 2020. Strive’s ETF wants to jump into this space. Instead of just buying Bitcoin, the fund would invest in these bonds. It’s an active approach, meaning managers make decisions on which bonds to pick. They might also use tools like swaps and options to maximize returns. Source : SEC Edgar The fees haven’t been announced yet, but actively managed funds typically cost more than regular index funds. Whether or not that’s worth it will depend on how the Bitcoin bond ETF performs. Politics and Crypto: How Does Ramaswamy Fit In? Let’s talk about Vivek Ramaswamy for a second. He’s not just some Wall Street guy. He’s also a major political player. In 2023, he ran against Donald Trump in the Republican primaries. After losing, he turned around and endorsed Trump. Now, the two seem to be working toward a common goal—making the U.S. a leader in innovation, including crypto. Under Trump, the crypto world has seen some big shifts. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins is set to lead the SEC, and David Sacks, PayPal’s ex-COO, has been named “AI and Crypto Czar.” These moves suggest a friendlier attitude toward crypto, which could make it easier for funds like Strive’s ETF to get approved. What’s Next for Bitcoin Investors? If Strive’s ETF gets the green light for the Bitcoin bind ETF, it could open the door for a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Instead of dealing with the ups and downs of owning Bitcoin directly, people can invest in bonds tied to the cryptocurrency. It’s less risky in some ways, but still gives exposure to Bitcoin’s growth. This isn’t just about one fund, though. It’s part of a bigger trend of blending traditional finance with the crypto world. As more companies adopt Bitcoin into their strategies, tools like this ETF could make it easier for everyday investors to get involved. This shows how Bitcoin is making its place in the financial world.

Bitcoin (BTC) price backtracked to the $96k level, whereas Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP mirrored a slumping movement. However, it’s worth mentioning that Bitget’s BGB token has defied the broader market trend to witness unprecedented gains. Meanwhile, the global crypto market cap was recorded slipping nearly 2.5% over the past day, reaching $3.34 trillion. Besides, the total market volume from yesterday witnessed a 5% increase to $123.46 billion. Let’s delve deeper into the top coins and their price action on December 27. Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, & XRP Take Heat Amid the broader market’s recent volatility due to the U.S. Fed’s Hawkish stance with rate cuts, top cryptos such as BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL face heat across the broader market.

Bitcoin’s market dominance stood at 57.05% today, indicating a dominant market stance for the flagship crypto. Besides, long-term prospects for the coin remain optimistic in light of the asset witnessing heightened buying. CoinGape reported that American energy management company KULR had purchased $21M worth of BTC recently. Although this buying projects optimism over the crypto’s future prospects, it’s also worth considering the recent market volatility. Another CoinGape report revealed that the crypto eyes a correction to $80K in the wake of the current market trends. Market participants remain apprehensive in light of these stats. Ethereum (ETH) Price Today On the other hand, ETH price slipped by nearly 2% intraday and is currently sitting at $3,380. Its 24-hour low and high were $3,302.31 and $3,446, respectively. Ethereum’s slumping action follows the broader market trend. However, Coinglass data sparked slight optimism over the asset’s market potential. Notably, ETH’s futures OI witnessed a marginal 1% increase to $23.47 billion. Moreover, the derivatives volume rocketed 29% in value to $35.69 billion. Market watchers continue to eye the crypto for further price action shifts amid a broader turbulent market. Solana (SOL) Price Today SOL price waned nearly 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $190.31. Its intraday low and high were $186.86 and $195.27, respectively. The crypto’s future price movements remain uncertain amid the broader market’s volatile movement. Coinglass data indicated a 3% drop in Solana’s futures OI, whereas the derivatives volume soared 24%. However, despite the recent correction, a CoinGape report revealed that Solana could reach between $400 and $500 in this cycle. XRP Price Today At press time, XRP price dipped nearly 3.5% and is currently trading at $2.18. Its intraday low and high were $2.13 and $2.25, respectively. Despite soaring optimism across the Ripple community in light of favorable legal maneuvers and strong market technicals, the token currently faces heat. Nevertheless, a recent CoinGape report spotlighted a $27 price target for XRP , sparking contrasting speculations on future movements. Meme Crypto Prices Today Dogecoin witnessed a 3% drop in value and is currently sitting at $0.3156. Moreover, Shiba Inu witnessed a 2% decline to $0.00002182.

Salame and Ellison pleaded guilty to the charges against them, which were criminal fraud charges and seven federal counts of fraud and conspiracy, respectively. With their guilty plea, they saved themselves and the prosecution from a lengthy trial process. Both of them pleaded guilty in 2023 and were sentenced this year in May. Rewarding the cooperation of the fraudulent FTX execs In the federal prison system, inmates can earn sentence reductions through good behavior and participation in rehabilitation programs. Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison. She began her sentence at the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution on November 7. She was scheduled to be released in October of 2026, but prison records state that her release date is now July 20, 2026. The new release date is more than three months shy of two years. Ellison’s attorneys declined to comment, but the early release can be attributed to the fact that Ellison was a star witness in the criminal trial against her ex-boyfriend, Sam Bankman-Fried. Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in federal prison and began his sentence in October. He was due for release in April of 2032, but now his release date, as listed on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, is March 1, 2031. This new date is over a year earlier than his initial release schedule. Salame’s attorneys have also not commented on the matter. However, a spokesperson of the Bureau of Prisons stated that incarcerated individuals could earn time off their sentences for good behavior under the 2018 First Step Act, according to a Business Insider report. Singh, who was arrested alongside the other executives, assisted the prosecution and testified against Bankman-Fried. He got no prison time. The infamous FTX implosion 2022 Before it went bankrupt, FTX was a leading crypto exchange globally, while its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), had achieved near superstar status, making waves even in political circles. The exchange platform was associated and endorsed by public figures and it was believed to be the gold standard for safe and secure cryptocurrency trading. The platform quickly collapsed in 2022 when users pulled their funds following rumors about FTX’s improper ties to Alameda Research. SBF was the CEO of FTX, and his girlfriend at the time, Caroline Ellison, led Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund founded by Bankman-Fried before the creation of FTX. After the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried, his girlfriend Caroline Ellison, Ryan Salame and Nishad Singh were all promptly arrested on criminal fraud charges. The mastermind behind the operation, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The prison records currently have no date listed for his release.

This marks a significant drop from its November 22 peak of $0.000053. Open interest in BONK has also fallen to $8.32 million, the lowest in three months, as traders shift their focus to other assets. Despite these setbacks, BONK remains a low-cost token with a strong community and hopes of regaining its top spot in the meme token market . Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 Massive Token Burn to Revive Interest In a big move to boost its value, Bonk DAO burned 1.69 trillion tokens, reducing the total supply from 100 trillion to 91 trillion. This burn, worth over $52 million, was approved by 99% of the community and completed in a single Solana transaction. The burn was part of BONK’s second-anniversary celebration, aiming to reduce supply and make the token more valuable. Community Participation The token burn campaign, which ran from November 15 to December 25, involved the community through social media activities and collaborations with ecosystem partners. Bonk DAO’s wallet still holds 9% of the total supply, making it the largest holder, even surpassing Binance. Additionally, 4.8% of the supply is locked in staking pools, further limiting the number of tokens in circulation. Challenges and Competition Despite this significant token burn, BONK’s price has not seen a major rally. Newer Solana meme tokens like Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU and DogWifHat (WIF) are gaining popularity . PENGU, with a market cap of $2.4 billion, has surpassed BONK as the leading Solana meme token . However, BONK remains optimistic about its future, banking on its strong community, wide presence across 11 chains, and listings on major exchanges. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Dogecoin Following the Bullish Pattern—Here’s When the DOGE Price May Hit a New ATH at $5 , Current Market Sentiment BONK’s market sentiment is currently neutral, with the Fear & Greed Index showing “Greed,” indicating growing trader interest.

Analysts predict a potential 30.39% price increase in the next five days, offering hope for a rebound. In the current market, BONK is a surprising element as investors are shifting their focus to low-cap coins to gain profit. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

XRP’s price has remained above the $2 region despite the bear’s attempts to push it to former lows. Despite a sharp dip on Friday, when the price dipped below the $2 level, sending FUD among investors, XRP still enjoys an over 40% monthly surge. Similarly, Tron has steadily risen, aiming to surpass $1 by 2025. Tron price movement has already recorded a monthly surge of over 13% with a YTD of 135%. Like Ripple and Tron, Lunex Network is also eying impressive gains, increasing 300% to hit the $0.0048 price target. This remarkable gain has been attributed to the project’s unique features, which include a no-KYC check. Lunex Network’s No KYC Requirement Lures More Investors Lunex Network is set to disrupt the DeFi market with a no-KYC check approach to decentralized finance. Unlike most projects associated with invasive KYC policies, Lunex Network aims to provide users with the best level of privacy, allowing them to stake, trade, and manage their assets efficiently. This unique approach will help simplify the Lunex onboarding process while making the DeFi space more open and diverse. Lunex Network also elevates users’ experiences with cross-chain solutions, allowing them to swap over 50K tokens across 40-plus blockchains. This unique feature allows users to carry out transactions quickly and at a lower cost than other platforms. Currently, the LNEX token is priced at $0.0048, a significant rally from its starting price of just $0.0012. The project has collected over $5.5M in presale revenue and is targeting $6M by the end of 2024. Its unique features, including anonymity, decentralization, and security, place it in a better position to gain more in Q1 of 2025. Ripple Bulls Outshine The Bears Ripple’s bulls managed to overcome the bears, forcing a reversal in XRP’s price . This move confirms Ripple’s strong support, which could increase its price. Its relative strength index is also above the midline, meaning the bulls are still in charge. Additionally, the debut of XRP’s anticipated RLUSD stablecoin added fuel to the crypto’s price movement. Ripple is also in talks with Bitstamp about plans to build a derivatives exchange on Ripple’s Ledger, which might boost XRP’s price in 2025. The Fibonacci retracement levels of 0.382, 0.5, and 0.618 are also critical in identifying XRP’s resistance and support levels during its correction period. A breakout above its triangle pattern could signal bullish momentum, targeting previous highs. According to CryptoFayZ ’s price prediction for XRP, the token’s bullish breakout might see it hit $5 soon. Tron Hits Record Revenue While Eying the $1 Milestone by 2025 Tron recorded $21.66M in revenue on December 3, 2024. This impressive accomplishment led to widespread attention, boosting the demand for Tron. The growth of altcoin, hovering within the $0.24 region , has been remarkable. Since Tron’s launch in 2017, when the RTX token was priced at just $0.0019 during presale, the altcoin has already delivered exceptional returns. This unique performance highlights the transformative opportunities that early investments in cryptocurrency can offer. Its technical indicators including the relative strength index at 47, however, point to a neutral position. Despite this, its growing adoption and network developments could help Tron’s price achieve a $1 milestone in 2025. Its impressive performance and increasing revenue streams position Tron’s future in the positive, making it a standout option for investors seeking massive returns in 2025. Will LNEX Match Ripple and Tron Price Movements? Ripple and Tron are among the top altcoins with the unique ability to record significant growth in 2025. Nonetheless, Lunex Network’s no-KYC feature and unique cross-chain swap feature put it in a better position to enjoy more substantial gains and attract more investors while eying the $1 region.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 05:53:00

Experts Warn of Major Crash,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-to-crash-hard-to-60k-experts-warn-of-major-crash/,"The post Bitcoin Price To Crash Hard To $60K! Experts Warn of Major Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has been struggling recently, experiencing a noticeable decline over the past two weeks. As BTC dropped to $95,120 , the crypto enthusiast is in fear of a massive crash ahead. A prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that several prominent figures in the crypto industry have warned that Bitcoin’s price could potentially fall to $60K. Drop Below $95K Could Trigger Crash Ali Martinez highlights a prediction from Tone Vays, a well-respected figure in the crypto space. Vays warns that if Bitcoin’s price falls below $95,000, it could set the stage for a sharp correction down to around $73,000. Some investors are already preparing for this possibility. In fact, over the past week, more than 33,000 Bitcoins , worth around $3.23 billion, were moved to exchanges, suggesting that traders are preparing for further decline. A Repeat of the 2018 Crash? Another notable figure mentioned by Martinez is Peter Brant, a veteran trader who famously predicted the Bitcoin crash in 2018. Brant has voiced concerns that Bitcoin might break below a key technical pattern, the expanding triangle, which could lead to a drop to around $70,000. Hey trolls — this is not a prediction. Just always pointing out possibilities, not probabilities, not certainties. No screen shot is necessary $BTCA right angled broadening triangle could project back into the 70s and a test of the parabolic modality pic.twitter.com/n5sy6DxAMb — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 20, 2024 Interestingly, on December 23rd alone, Bitcoin saw over $7.1 billion in realized profits, which could indicate that many traders are capitalizing on the current volatility. Could Bitcoin Hit $60,000? Martinez also brings up predictions from Mark Newton, Managing Director at Fundstrat, and analyst Benjamin Cohen. Both have expressed concerns that Bitcoin’s price could eventually fall to the $60,000 range. Cohen suggests Bitcoin’s price could follow a similar path to other assets like the QQQ, which could result in a crash around the time of political events, such as on Donald Trump’s presidential oath days. Yet, Bullish Hope for Bitcoin! Despite the bearish predictions, out that Bitcoin recently broke a key support level at $97,300. For the bearish outlook to be avoided, Bitcoin would need to rise above this level and stay above $100,000. If this happens, Bitcoin could see a new rise, with some experts predicting prices could reach $168,500. Amidst fears of a crypto crash, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index remains in the “Greed” zone at 74. This suggests that some traders are still hopeful and believe Bitcoin could experience a massive breakout soon.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 05:56:56

As one of the most established crypto trading platforms, HTX has consistently strived for breakthroughs, leading the industry development with premium products and services. The futures business has been a key focus for the platform this year. Through sustained efforts, HTX has achieved significant progress in this domain. Data shows that the platform’s total futures trading volume in 2024 has reached approximately $900 billion so far, representing a 70% increase compared to 2023. Additionally, the scale of futures trading exhibited a steady month-over-month growth trend. The success stems from two factors. On the one hand, HTX’s team has stayed ahead by closely following the latest market trends and hotspots, continually expanding its asset map. Over the year, the platform listed more than 80 new futures trading assets, with nearly 70 of them experiencing growth rates exceeding 200%. By December 2024, HTX had supported over 160 futures trading assets, providing users with a diverse range of trading options. On the other hand, HTX’s proactive optimization and bold innovations in futures products have played a pivotal role in its growth. Notably, the introduction of its exclusive product, “SmartEarn,” has redefined industry standards while presenting users with unique revenue opportunities. SmartEarn Draws Over 260,000 Users, Becoming an Instant Hit SmartEarn, a pioneering Earn product created by HTX, officially launched on November 14. It enables users to earn a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) on the assets in their Futures account, regardless of whether they are holding a position or not. SmartEarn’s zero-threshold requirement, high flexibility, and high yield perfectly align with the needs of futures users, making it an instant success. As of December 26, just over a month since its launch, SmartEarn has attracted more than 260,000 users. Offering a 6% APY on funds in Futures accounts and the lowest funding rate for futures positions, SmartEarn empowers HTX’s futures business with a significant boost. The total futures trading volume has increased by 88% over the past 30 days, and the Q4 futures trading volume has surged by 50% compared to Q3. Users have also reaped significant benefits, with the highest individual earnings for SmartEarn users reaching up to 24,641 USDT. In addition to launching this groundbreaking product, HTX continues to enhance its existing features. In 2024, HTX completed more than 30 upgrades to its futures services, including TP/SL price protection and real-time position updates. In an effort to improve the user experience, HTX has launched 15 enhancements to its futures copy trading product, including the ability for users to follow multiple lead traders and optimize the trader ranking system. As of November 2024, the user base of HTX’s copy trading has experienced a remarkable growth of over 700% compared to the start of the year. Today, HTX Futures, powered by an outstanding user experience and with SmartEarn as its flagship product, have become a major player in the highly competitive field of crypto derivatives. Year-End Highlights: Three New Futures Products Scheduled for Successive Launches As 2024 winds down, HTX is still ramping up efforts to enhance user experiences. Right now, three new futures products have either gone live or are arriving soon. Zero-Cost Futures Position Event Recently, HTX launched the Zero-Cost Futures Position Event to offer newcomers an effortless entry into futures trading. This event offers free futures positions. By participating, users will receive predefined positions, including specific trading pairs, leverage, direction, and size. This allows them to get accustomed to futures trading mechanics and gain hands-on experience in a live trading environment. If a user’s position results in a profit, the gains will be credited as Futures Trial Bonuses to their Futures account, offering opportunities for future gains. However, losses in this position will not affect their account balance. Futures Grid HTX is set to upgrade its futures grid functionality by the end of December, offering users a smarter, strategy-based trading tool. This upgrade boosts capital efficiency while minimizing risk, making it well-suited for seizing opportunities in volatile markets. Once users set their futures grid parameters, the bot will handle the execution, freeing them from the need to monitor the tiny changes in the tickers. What’s even better, HTX charges no extra fees for this service. Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading Around Lunar New Year 2025, HTX will launch Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading, allowing traders to use multiple assets as collateral for trading the USDT-M futures. This new feature will provide a more convenient trading experience, especially for users trading futures with multiple assets. 2024 has seen HTX achieve impressive results in boosting the competitiveness of its futures products. The success of SmartEarn, coupled with the substantial growth in futures trading volume and the number of futures traders, stands as a testament to user recognition of HTX’s efforts. This recognition has been a key driver of HTX’s innovation. Looking ahead to 2025, HTX will continue to optimize its futures services and products, focusing on enhancing core trading functions and the copy trading section. More efforts will be made to increase liquidity, with a particular focus on strengthening the market depth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular cryptos to ensure a smoother trading experience. Furthermore, HTX will continue to drive the comprehensive development of its ecosystem. By delivering exceptional user experiences, generating wealth effects, implementing robust security strategies, and deploying cutting-edge technologies, the platform will solidify its leading position in the cryptocurrency industry. In 2025, HTX is poised to outperform expectations.

As a result, the large-cap altcoin, with a total valuation of about $406 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $23 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level. With the TOTAL2 having already retested the previous all-time high (ATH), around $1.6 trillion, Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards $5k soon. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been forming a macro reversal pattern, coupled with the bullish divergence on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). Ethereum Whales Prepares for Major Uproar With Bitcoin price having outperformed the majority of large and mid-cap altcoins in the past two years, whale crypto investors have been repositioning their portfolios in preparation for a parabolic altseason. Moreover, the Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI) and volume recently surged to a new ATH of above $23 billion. According to on-chain data analysis provided by Coinglass, the overall supply of Ethereum on centralized exchanges declined from 16.12 million on November 29, to hover about 15.3 million at the time of this writing. The notable decline of Ethereum on CEXes is majorly attributed to the rising demand from the U.S. spot Ether ETF issuers. Led by BlackRock’s ETHA, and Fidelity’s FETH, the US spot Ether ETF issuers have attracted more than $2.64 billion in cumulative total net inflow since inception, thus a total assets under management of about $12.01 billion. On Thursday, the US spot Ether ETFs registered net cash inflows of about $117 million and a total value traded of around $390 million. Meanwhile, on-chain data analysis shows a while investors withdrew 1,500 Ether, worth $5.21 million, from Binance in the last 24 hours. Ethereum rebounds from crucial support, setting the stage for a potential rally. Read Ethereum price prediction for the latest market insights! What Next?

Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/meme-index-memex-raises-450k-in-presale/,"The post Next Crypto to Explode? Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The festive season did wonders for Meme Index ($MEMEX) , as it smashed through the $450K milestone in its presale just after Christmas. Meme Index is a unique platform that offers the first-ever decentralized index for meme coins. Rather than just investing in a single token, Meme Index bundles numerous tokens into four baskets, each with a different risk and upside profile. Instead of betting on a single token, investors can choose an index—or multiple indexes—to determine how aggressive or conservative they’d like to be. The whole platform is built around its native $MEMEX governance token, which is currently live in presale. Currently, $MEMEX is priced at just $0.0146285, but it will increase within 48 hours when the next presale phase starts. A Strong Year for Meme Coins One of the biggest crypto trends of the year has been the rise of meme coins, with the sector collectively reaching a value of $137 billion at one point. Some of the hottest meme coins, like Pepe ($PEPE) and Mog Coin ($MOG), saw an over 1,200% upside in 2024 alone. There are also lesser-known projects like Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), which blew the market away with a 2,000% gain since November. While these successes are hard to ignore, they also reveal how volatile meme coins can be. That’s where the Meme Index comes in. It helps investors hedge their bets by diversifying risk into various coins rather than concentrating their investment on a single bet. One Governance Token for Four Indexes As we saw above, Meme Index has four indexes. $MEMEX holders govern all four indexes and any future updates. If a new meme coin takes off and the community wants to add it to an index, $MEMEX token holders can propose and vote on it. Each index has a different level of risk and upside. Investors can choose a level of risk that aligns with their objectives. For instance, the Titan Index concentrates on the top 10 meme coins with a market cap exceeding $1 billion (such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE). While it provides exposure to established meme coins, it still carries more volatility than standard large-cap cryptos. It could be the right choice if you want to avoid more obscure meme tokens. Conversely, the Moonshot Index features coins that are either listed or about to be listed on top exchanges but have yet to attain a $1 billion market cap. This is ideal for those who want to gain exposure to growing coins without investing too heavily in speculative projects. Next on the list is the Midcap Index . It includes meme coins with a market cap between $50 and $250 million. This tier can bring high reward potential if a token moves up to the next tier, though it comes with added volatility. The last one is the Meme Frenzy Index , a high-stakes basket of brand-new meme coins that may soar to the moon or crash to the ground in days. This option is suitable for high-risk-taking investors chasing exponential gains and certainly not for those playing safe. How to Buy $MEMEX With over $450,000 raised in the presale in just a few days, many early supporters are confident that the project can stand out in the meme coin space. Per the Meme Index whitepaper , the total supply of $MEMEX tokens is limited to 15 billion. The platform has allocated 15% of these tokens to early buyers for the ongoing presale. You can visit the official Meme Index presale page to buy $MEMEX. You can connect a compatible crypto wallet by clicking ‘Connect Wallet’ and pay with $USDT, $ETH, $BNB, or a credit card. Buyers can then directly stake these tokens via the Meme Index staking protocol . The APY is currently over 3,900%. Although this rate will decrease once more participants start staking, it offers an attractive option for $MEMEX holders who want to earn high passive rewards. It’s worth noting that security has been a top priority for Meme Index. It has audited its smart contracts by Coinsult and SolidProof, where both firms flagged no critical vulnerabilities. You can join the Meme Index community on Telegram and follow its X account to keep up with the latest news and project updates.
