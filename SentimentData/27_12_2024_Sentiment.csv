Is a 1000x Move Possible?,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-price-enters-critical-level-as-this-doge-killer-rises-is-a-1000x-move-possible/,"Dogecoin has been a major player in the crypto market since its launch, rivaling other memecoins with its wide community adoption and celebrity endorsement. However, its recent downside has faced challenges from emerging DOGE killers like PropiChain . Its revolutionary approach to tackling major real estate loopholes like inefficiencies, fraud risks, and high transaction costs has been a propeller of its token presale, which continues to attract attention from major investors. In this article, we will discuss how PropiChain could outrank the Dogecoin price and make over a 1000x move when it launches, as well as the unique features that make it stand out as a formidable competitor. The Widespread Community Adoption of Meme coins and its Impact on the Dogecoin Price Dogecoin’s continuous dominance in the market has been attributed to its passionate community, celebrity endorsements, and widespread adoption as a tipping currency. With these communities’ most loyal community support and guidance, the Dogecoin price has seen significant highs through community takeovers (CTOs) and Cabals spearheading them. Dogecoin has also experienced real-world use cases as legal tenders for charitable donations, service payments, and a niche in micropayments. However, despite its enduring popularity, Dogecoin entering a critical level has spiraled the growth of projects like PropiChain, which combines utility and innovation, to challenge its dominance and the Dogecoin price trajectory. How PropiChain Could Make a 1000x Move After Launch PropiChain’s signal to investors as one of the most prominent altcoins to outpace the Dogecoin price as a beam of hope during this critical level. Below are some unique features and how they propel its price trajectory to make over 1000x after launch. Advanced AI Technologies: PropiChain AI tools are designed to offer provisional assistance to users as they navigate the platform by providing predictive market analysis, which encompasses real-time evaluation of market trends, identification of emerging patterns, and prediction of future market behaviors. Its property filtering tools also provide sophisticated filters that consider anticipated market growth, investment potential, and properties’ historical performance irrespective of location. Metaverse Capabilities: The platform allows users to explore and invest in virtual real estate, bridging physical and digital assets. Through its virtual tours, stagings, and meetings, international investors can experiment with different layouts and designs in an immersive virtual environment and interactive experience surpassing traditional methods. RWA Tokenization: PropiChain’s approach to tokenizing assets involves digitizing properties in small and large proportions, ensuring seamless virtual transactions on a secure blockchain network. This further reduces fraud and streamlines complex processes that demand physical documentation as it democratizes access to highly valued assets to everyday investors rather than large-scale investors. Conclusion The Dogecoin Price is at a crossroads, facing challenges from innovative projects like PropiChain . With its presale already raising nearly $1M, crypto insiders are bullish about its roadmap and price trajectory to surpass DOGE. PropiChain is offering investors a chance to purchase the PCHAIN token for $0.004 in its round two presale, the lowest it will ever be before it surges after its launch. Moreover, its BlockAudit review and CoinMarketCap listing provide additional reassurance for investors. So if you are investing $1000 now, your portfolio is expected to see a massive gain of over $100,000 as it replicates the 2017 Dogecoin price, especially when it continues to gain momentum. Hurry now, and be a part of this transition before it’s too late!

What is this technology about, and how does DePIN work? Table of Contents What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? What are the DePIN options? Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? Theoretical studies in cryptocurrencies have long predicted that encryption tools currently implemented in the blockchain will be used on the Internet and impact the physical world sooner or later. Nick Szabo noted at the end of the 20th century that smart contracts can automatically manage physical objects. More than 25 years have passed, and the blockchain is firmly embedded in our lives. This is primarily due to cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to break records and is supported by significant physical infrastructure. At first glance, this confirms an actual physical presence in our world. However, the boundaries of decentralized technologies continue to expand with the advent of solutions such as DePIN. What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? DePIN meaning a Decentralized physical infrastructure network. Blockchain participants use a public ledger and cryptocurrency to build and maintain specific, real-world infrastructure projects. Simply speaking, DePIN involves using DePIN blockchain to run and sustain decentralized networks of equipment that can serve a common purpose. This enables the network to be built on decentralized, horizontal connections rather than the hierarchical approach typically seen with large infrastructure projects such as bridges or roads. Building and managing physical infrastructure networks is expensive and complex, so historically, they have been the domain of large corporations or governments with capital and resources. In contrast, DePIN encourages voluntary cooperation among participants. People can participate in DePIN networks by using their own hardware or purchasing specialized hardware for specific tasks. Options range from simple hard drives to weather stations. However, DePINs are typically built around capabilities that are available to the general public. Max Thake, co-founder of peaq, explained crypto.news that DePIN uses tokens to incentivize people to use connected hardware to offer services to other people: “Let’s imagine a smartphone-focused DePIN like Roam Network. The smartphones, owned by regular people, are the hardware component, the data on local connection quality they gather is the goods. Telecom companies looking to improve their services buy this data on a Web3 marketplace, which is where the smart contracts come into play, enabling the value exchange between the supply and demand sides.” Max Thake, co-founder of peaq You might also like: DePIN early-stage fundraising has grown 296% YoY: Messari What are the DePIN options? There are two types of DePINs: Physical Resource Networks (PRN) and Digital Resource Networks (DRN). PRNs are decentralized networks where providers give hardware resources (such as sensors or internet access), and these resources are tied to a specific location. Their contribution to the network is location-dependent, therefore they are not interchangeable. DRNs are networks where providers provide resources determined by their function, not location. Here, location does not matter. Examples of such resources include computing power, bandwidth, and storage. DePIN Sector Map | Source: Messari Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN DePIN can theoretically wholly transform how we manage and interact with physical infrastructure. Using blockchain and smart contracts , this model increases the efficiency and transparency of systems, allowing the community to make decisions independently. DePIN can be considered a kind of “industrial DAO ,” where all participants have equal opportunities and ensure the independence of the infrastructure. The system is flexible and can be scaled horizontally. With the successful attraction of motivated users, the creation of a decentralized physical infrastructure can be significantly accelerated. The pricing model in DePIN crypto systems is also considered more accessible and fair since infrastructure assets are publicly owned, and the cost of services is determined not by the company’s benefits but by availability. Rewarding participants in the form of tokens allows users to receive regular passive income with the benefit of society. However, significant disadvantages should be considered: Vulnerability to hacks and errors. High volatility of tokens. There is a need for technical knowledge to maintain a decentralized infrastructure. Nevertheless, with DePIN, blockchain powers real-world DePIN use cases and value exchanges, it is inherently linked to real-world supply and demand, which makes this segment uniquely positioned for sustainable, healthy growth. “People won’t stop using navigation apps, ordering food, or using the Web because Bitcoin took a dive. DePIN merges web3 with real value instead of speculation and offers it a chance to live up to its promise of changing the world.” Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? According to Messari analysts, in 2023, the DePIN ecosystem grew to more than 650 projects, and the number of nodes increased by 600,000. Researchers noted the main trends in the development of DePIN in 2024. Experts believe meme tokens will contribute to massively adopting projects like the BONK airdrop for Solana Saga smartphone users. Analysts also consider Asia to be the region with the most significant potential for the rapid development of decentralized infrastructure, expecting that some of the most influential projects in the sector will appear here from 2024 to 2025. The first development in the DePIN field appeared about ten years ago. During this time, the number of projects increased significantly. The sector’s market capitalization is more than $20 billion, excluding RWA and blockchain oracles, according to experts from Messari. Source: Messari Speaking about the future of DePIN, Thake expects it to become an industry staple alongside the entire supporting stack, from DePIN-crowdsourced data for training models to decentralized compute and Web3 federated learning markets for AI agents. “Some of the most exciting implementations of the DePIN model will be in the energy industry, especially when it comes to green energy, which requires flexible and decentralized grids, while most old-school ones follow the centralized model. People will soon earn by harvesting solar energy and contributing to the power grid.” However, DePIN projects are not yet popular even among participants in the cryptocurrency industry, let alone the widespread adoption of the concept. Implementing decentralized infrastructure may take time since DePIN faces problems that must be solved. However, experts are confident that this system will play a key role in shaping the future and changing the principles of operation of physical infrastructure.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

The purchase is the start of a strategy to put up to 90% of the company’s surplus cash into cryptocurrency, as pioneered by industry leaders like MicroStrategy, and also it represents a larger corporate trend toward embracing digital assets. KULR’s Bitcoin treasury plan According to an announcement on Thursday, the coins were purchased at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. This is only the beginning of many more purchases since KULR plans to invest up to 90% of its available cash into Bitcoin. KULR has selected Coinbase Prime to provide custody solutions and self-custodial wallet services for its crypto assets. Following the announcement of the Bitcoin strategic reserve, the KULR stock value increased by 40%. KULR Technology Group is led by its CEO, Michael Mo, who discussed in an interview that he took inspiration from the way MicroStrategy approaches Bitcoin. Mo said , “ He calls BTC digital energy, which really resonated with our mission because we are an energy management company for batteries and space applications are our core.” The link between KULR’s core business and Bitcoin’s fundamental technology is a strategic alignment in their investment strategy. To confirm the support of shareholders for the initiative, KULR undertook a survey to assess the endorsement of this novel financial approach. The feedback was predominantly favorable. Cryptocurrency as corporate cash Mo continued, “We received an overwhelming ‘Yes.’ Here we are buying our first block of BTC and entering into the future of money.” Additionally, he expressed his strong belief in Bitcoin, asserting, “We believe that BTC is the future of money.” KULR now adds to the growing list of companies embracing BTC as part of there treasury reserve. On December 23, a Canada-based company, Matador Technologies, announced it will top up its balance sheet with $4.5 million in Bitcoin, as part of a long-term strategy for capital preservation. Quantum BioPharma, a biopharmaceutical company, also joined the trend by investing $1 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on December 20. In Japan, Metaplanet recently bought its largest Bitcoin to date, acquiring nearly 620 BTC. The phenomenon of corporate acquisition of Bitcoin was first brought into the limelight by MicroStrategy, which initiated its investments in Bitcoin back in 2020. Currently holding over 444,000 BTC, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its cryptocurrency holdings, aiming to buy more Bitcoins worth $42 billion more in the near future, pending the approval of shareholders. KULR’s Chief Executive Officer expects a future in which the integration of high-tech technologies creates a new corporate structure. He outlined this vision: “ We envision that the future of a dynamic corporation is based on three pillars: super intelligence through AI, an automated workforce through robotics, and the future of money through BTC, he added. “I believe the whole industry is still at the very early stage of figuring out how to tie them together,” suggesting that KULR’s Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader, long-term vision for corporate evolution.

The transfer will take place on March 8, 2025, marking the culmination of DMM Bitcoin’s liquidation process after a devastating $305 million hack in May 2024. Liquidation and Transfer Process In a December 25 notice , SBI VC indicated that customer accounts would be ready by the transfer date, and they would not have to register afresh but would instead be transitioned automatically by the company. Both fiat and cryptocurrency held by former DMM users will be transferred to SBI, with the company inheriting reports of all transactions conducted on the fallen exchange. The Tokyo-based firm initially offered 24 virtual assets for trade on its platform, but its acquisition of DMM Bitcoin will add an extra 14 cryptocurrencies to its books, including Tron (TRX), The Sandbox (SAND), Algorand (ALGO), and Maker (MKR). Additionally, as part of the deal, SBI will take over all leveraged trading pairs previously offered by DMM except those it already provides. The company also clarified that it would not transfer any open positions in leveraged trading. Per the notice, staking stocks will be automatically triggered, with customers that held Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Oasys (OAS), Flare (FLR), and Hedera (HBAR) on DMM eligible for staking on SBI. They are expected to receive their first staking reward in April 2025 if they continue holding the assets. Hacking Fallout DMM Bitcoin announced its decision to stop operations after months of recovery efforts from a multi-million dollar attack at the end of May failed. The platform lost more than 4,500 BTC, valued at around $305 million, in what is Japan’s second-largest crypto breach after another exchange, Coincheck, lost $523 million worth of NEM tokens in a 2018 incident. The DMM hack is suspected to have been carried out by threat actors linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known as TradeTraitor. In July, investigators revealed that over $35 million stolen from the exchange had been laundered via the infamous Cambodian online marketplace Huione Guarantee. At the time, pseudonymous on-chain detective ZachXBT likened the laundering techniques to those used by another DPRK-linked outfit, the notorious Lazarus Group. Soon after it was exploited, DMM immediately pledged to make affected customers whole. However, even after borrowing 50 million yen to reimburse users, the damage to its operations proved too great, leading to the decision to transfer all assets to SBI VC Trade. The firm confirmed the acquisition in a December 2 announcement, insisting that it would work to ensure a smooth transition for clients.

Is the Santa Rally already over?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-stocks-tumble-as-bitcoin-remains-stuck-at-95k-is-the-santa-rally-already-over/,"Wall Street’s so-called Santa Claus rally seems to have tripped over its own feet, while Bitcoin, the supposed king of volatility, is just sitting there like a lump, stuck at $95,000. Is this how we’re ending 2024? Flat stock performance, stagnant Bitcoin, and investors gnawing on their nails instead of celebrating a year-end windfall? The Dow barely scraped together a gain of 0.04%, the S&P 500 dipped by 0.02%, and the Nasdaq went completely nowhere. Treasury yields? Through the roof. The 10-year note hit its highest point since May, sitting at 4.58% before a late-day pullback. This surge in yields is a big problem for growth stocks, especially tech giants, which have propped up the market all year. Now, the “Magnificent Seven” are wobbling, and with them, the hopes of a December rally. Santa Claus rally hits a brick wall For those who don’t obsess over market quirks, the Santa Claus rally is a cute little phenomenon where stocks rally in the final trading days of the year, thanks to low liquidity, year-end bonuses, and tax-loss harvesting. It started to look promising earlier this week. Then reality smacked Wall Street upside the head. Mixed economic data, hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical tensions quickly killed the buzz. The Fed is holding firm on its less-than-dovish outlook for 2025, with way fewer rate cuts than markets were hoping for. Higher yields are squeezing growth stocks, which is terrible news for a market dominated by mega-cap tech. The S&P 500’s top ten stocks now account for 40% of the index’s market cap, a level that blows past the peak of the Dot-Com bubble. If these giants stumble, the rest of the market doesn’t stand a chance. New U.S. jobless claims data added to the tension. Initial claims dropped slightly, which sounds great, but ongoing claims climbed to their highest levels since 2021. Translation: People are losing jobs, and they’re struggling to find new ones. Combine that with uncertainty surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, and you’ve got a sense of the market chaos. Bitcoin’s glory days feel like ancient history Meanwhile, Bitcoin is sitting there doing absolutely nothing. It’s been bouncing between $92,500 and $96,000 for days now, a far cry from its December peak of $108,268. As of press time, it’s down 3.6% on the day, trading at $95,693. That’s a drop of over $3,500 in 24 hours, and the market capitalization is down to $1.89 trillion. Trading volume isn’t exactly inspiring either, clocking in at about $39.59 billion. This isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The entire crypto market feels sluggish. Analysts blame profit-taking after Bitcoin’s monster rally earlier this month, as well as tighter liquidity driven by the Fed’s hawkish cut. Still, there are glimmers of life. Institutional interest hasn’t dried up. MicroStrategy, always the Bitcoin cheerleader, added another $561 million worth of BTC to its stash. Bitcoin ETFs are still pulling in cash, with weekly inflows topping $300 million even in this downturn. But for the average trader, this kind of stagnation is painful. The Fear & Greed Index, which measures investor sentiment, is sitting at 54—smack in the middle of neutral territory. Will the Santa Claus rally make a last-minute comeback? Can Bitcoin escape its $95,000 prison? Or are we staring at the start of a rough 2025? No one knows.

The company recently forced Copilot onto Microsoft 365 users in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. And as if the decision wasn’t irritating enough, they slapped a price hike on top of it. In these regions, Microsoft 365—known for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—now includes Copilot whether customers want it or not. Users like Alistair Fleming, a YouTuber in Australia, are discovering that their monthly bills have surged. “It went from A$11 to A$16,” Fleming reportedly said, and all he got was a hyperactive AI assistant that wouldn’t leave him alone. “Every time I finished a line, its rainbow logo popped up, offering to ‘help.’ It’s annoying.” A desperate decision to profit from AI This aggressive rollout is all part of Microsoft’s plan to milk its massive investment in AI. Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s tech, is a key piece of CEO Satya Nadella’s strategy to expand the company’s software dominance. Earlier this year, Microsoft launched the premium consumer version of Copilot in the United States at $20 a month, on top of the standard $7 Microsoft 365 subscription. The company claimed it was a game-changing assistant, capable of generating emails, summarizing meetings, and creating entire PowerPoint presentations. But whether it’s worth the extra cash is a hotly debated question. Here’s the thing: people are not exactly lining up to use Copilot. Between May 2023 and mid-December, Copilot’s chatbot app was downloaded 37 million times, according to Sensor Tower. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT raked in a mind-blowing 433 million downloads in the same period. Microsoft might call this a “success,” but let’s not pretend Copilot is winning any popularity contests. For businesses, Copilot comes with an even heftier price tag—$30 per user. Corporate clients are Microsoft’s bread and butter, but the response to Copilot has been lukewarm at best. Many companies have doubts about its accuracy, data security, and whether it actually adds value. A Microsoft spokesperson refused to comment on how happy (or unhappy) corporate customers are, sticking to the usual “we meet global privacy standards” script. Microsoft wants to ditch OpenAI (sort of) While Copilot relies heavily on OpenAI’s technology, Microsoft is already working on alternatives. Reuters recently reported that Microsoft is building its own AI models, like Phi-4, and customizing open-weight models to power Copilot. The goal is to reduce costs and gain more control. This is a noticeable change from Microsoft’s earlier fanfare about its partnership with OpenAI. Back in March 2023, the company proudly announced Copilot’s reliance on OpenAI’s GPT-4. Now, Microsoft seems eager to tone down that reliance. It’s not cutting ties entirely though. OpenAI is negotiating to remove a clause from its agreement with Microsoft that limits the latter’s access to future artificial general intelligence (AGI) models. If this happens, Microsoft could maintain access to cutting-edge OpenAI tech without restrictions, even as it builds its own systems.

The Khao Kheow Open Zoo revealed that Buterin joined their Wildlife Sponsorship Program, pledging 10 million baht, or around $293,000 USD, to support Moo Deng and her family, in a Dec. 26 announcement . Buterin expressed in a post on X his commitment to supporting Moo Deng over the next two years “with my 10M THB donation, maybe more as I set aside 88 ETH for [pygmy hippopotamuses] + frens.” The move by Buterin spiked the memecoin’s price by as high as 70% to $0.0002446 before retracing to $0.0001924, which is a 55% increase in the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing Rexas Finance as a top pick for those who missed SHIB and PEPE. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Presale achievements Components: A unique ecosystem Ensuring investor benefits Conclusion Many investors who got in early on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have become extremely rich. But for those who missed these two tokens, there is a new token that has the potential to provide massive gains — Rexas Finance (RXS) . Rexas Finance shows great future promise due to its unique real-world asset features, strong tokenomics, and upcoming presale stages. This, along with a Certik audit completion and planned exchange listings, make it a great option for high returns. Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Rexas Finance is at the helm of the tokenization process. Interested users will easily access high-value assets like real estate, fine art, and collectibles via blockchain tokenization through its platform. This method of investing will fence off a huge proportion of the market previously occupied by the affluent, making it possible for the average investor to join in. Instead of having the purchase barrier of millions to buy a piece of real estate, users will be able to buy fractionalized real estate with RXS tokens. To increase liquidity and lower costs, tokenization allows for filling a growing asset digitization shift that the market is seeing. The immense market potential that Rexas Finance promises, combined with its presale, makes it stand out. Presale achievements With a total of over 364 million tokens sold, the RXS presale has been immensely successful, raising more than $30 million through its stages. The presale started at $0.03 in Stage 1, growing over 400% to the stage 10 price of $0.15. The investors’ trust is quite clear from the performance of this presale. It shows that the fundamentals and the vision of the project are sturdy. Many other crypto projects get a lot of funding from VC firms, but Rexas Finance has managed to do well without a single VC firm, allowing a fairer start for early investors. The growth witnessed without any external support reiterates the strength of the project’s future.

Rexas Launchpad: This is meant for upcoming blockchain-based ventures that need exposure and assistance. Rexas Estate: Focused on real estate tokenization in a manner that will involve fractional ownership and more accessibility. Rexas Treasury: This will serve as a reliable source of investment for future development of the platform. These features will help mitigate challenges in the blockchain space, giving RXS the capacity to be a good and practical investment. The application of utility gives the platform a competitive advantage over other conjectural meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. Ensuring investor benefits Investing in cryptocurrency should be done with great consideration, as security comes first. RXS has been certified by Certik, ensuring that it adheres to safety and transparency measures. Many investors become hesitant about crypto owing to the prevalence of terms such as rug pulls and scams. However, with Certik’s backing, Rexas Finance seeks to be a more reliable investment. Additionally, Rexas Finance offers early investor giveaways worth up to $50,000 in RXS tokens just by referring friends or engaging with the community on social media. Unlike other obscure cryptocurrencies with lengthy processes, Rexas Finance is easy to buy. Connect a MetaMask wallet and use USDT or ETH to purchase RXS tokens. Investors have a fantastic opportunity to participate in the project during its low-cost presale rates. Conclusion As Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin were hyped years ago, Rexas Finance is a new promising investment. The combination of real-world tokenization, outstanding tokenomics, and a successful presale suggests a massive increase in value. With its planned $1 million giveaway and anticipated listings in 2025, Rexas Finance could be among the best cryptocurrency investments for those seeking life-changing results.

That’s $166 million an hour, $2.7 million every minute, and a mind-numbing $45,000 a second. It’s a figure so obscene yet it’s the reality of America’s financial position. This reckless spending has pushed the U.S. Debt-to-GDP ratio to 121%, a level not even reached during World War II. In comparison, it was just 60% in 2008, back when the Great Recession first hit, because yeah, it came back last year. Since 2020, the U.S. has added $13 trillion to its debt. That’s a 57% increase in under five years. Meanwhile, as 2025 approaches, prediction markets are betting there’s a 36% chance the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) might trim $250 billion from federal spending. Sounds like a lot, right? Except it wouldn’t even scratch the surface of the deficit problem. The dollar’s grip on global finance Despite this insane financial chaos, the dollar isn’t going anywhere. For decades, doomsayers have warned about the dollar’s downfall, but it keeps flexing like an undefeated champ. From the oil crisis of the 1970s to the rise of the euro, from Japan’s economic ascent to China’s manufacturing takeover, the dollar has seen it all—and survived. Why? Because the world has no other choice. Right now, over 60% of global reserves are held in dollars. About 90% of all foreign exchange trades involve the greenback. International trade invoices? Mostly in dollars. And let’s not forget U.S. Treasuries—the so-called “safe haven” for global investors. Other currencies, like the euro or the Chinese yuan, have tried to make a play for the top spot, but they just don’t have the same liquidity or trust. China, often hyped as the dollar’s biggest threat, has its own issues. The yuan accounts for a tiny fraction of global transactions and is tightly controlled by Beijing. Investors don’t trust a currency that can’t flow freely. Meanwhile, the euro had a strong debut but lost credibility after a series of debt crises rocked the eurozone. These problems have left the dollar as the last man standing in a very shaky financial world. The dollar’s dominance is woven into the fabric of global trade and finance. The U.S. can borrow at levels that would bankrupt any other country because the dollar is still the world’s default currency. But how long can this game go on? Debt: The privilege and the price For decades, the U.S. has leaned on what economists call its “exorbitant privilege.” Basically, the world trusts the U.S. government to pay its bills, so investors keep buying Treasuries no matter how much debt America racks up. This allows Washington to borrow trillions for wars, stimulus packages, or even public-health emergencies. But that trust isn’t unlimited. Critics warn that America’s debt addiction could eventually blow up in its face. The sheer scale of the debt—combined with those $4 billion-a-day interest payments—has people wondering how much longer the U.S. can live beyond its means. And it’s not like anyone has a plan. Barack Obama tried to rein in spending with a high-powered deficit committee, but their recommendations went nowhere. Donald Trump once called the dollar both “too strong” and “too weak” while pursuing massive tax cuts that ballooned the debt even further. Joe Biden hasn’t fared much better, pushing pandemic-era spending packages that added trillions more to the tab. What’s the long-term strategy here? No one seems to know. U.S. is the dollar’s worst enemy But even countries that criticize America’s policies rely on the greenback. China, for instance, might talk about “de-dollarizing,” but it still issues dollar-denominated bonds to attract investors. Saudi Arabia recently sold $2 billion in dollar bonds. Even the much-discussed BRICS currency is years away, if it happens at all. Until something better comes along, the dollar will stay on top. But let’s not pretend this is a good thing. The dollar’s dominance allows the U.S. to print money and pile on debt without facing the kind of crises that cripple other nations. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: Washington borrows because it can, and the world keeps enabling it because they don’t have another option. The real question isn’t whether the dollar will collapse—it’s what could trigger its decline. Some economists argue that America itself poses the biggest threat to its currency. Excessive sanctions, for example, have already pushed some countries to explore alternatives. If the Oval overplays its hand, it could accidentally speed up the search for a credible dollar rival, just as Russia’s president Vladimir Putin predicted.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the project says it has been working closely with a respected asset manager to create a FLOKI-based ETP for European inventors, set to launch in Q1 of next year. “We’ve been actively working with a respected asset manager and an ETP issuer to launch a Floki ETP for quite a while now. After months of due diligence and painstaking effort, we’ve been told that the Floki ETP is on track to go live in early Q1, 2025. This proposal is to have the Floki DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) approve liquidity for the Floki ETP!” An ETP allows investors to expose themselves to specific assets without the need to actually purchase them. In the proposal, the Floki team says the ETP is already in its advanced stages and will become tradable on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland, as soon as next year and become the second meme coin in the world with a live ETP. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way. This is a big move that is almost unprecedented in this space, because Dogecoin is currently the only memecoin in the WORLD, with a live ETP, and Floki could become the next memecoin with an ETP besides Dogecoin.” The proposal also includes provisions for burning FLOKI tokens as well as providing liquidity for the ETP. “The purpose of this DAO proposal is to seek approval from the Floki DAO for providing liquidity to the ETP… We currently hold 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens in [a crypto wallet] and propose using a portion of them to provision liquidity for the ETP while burning the remainder on the day the ETP launches.” FLOKI is trading for $0.000177 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 23:02:00

Table of Contents Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments 3 promising altcoins for last-minute Investment Lesser-known altcoins for last-minute investments As the cryptocurrency market approaches the end of 2024, investors are keenly observing altcoins that exhibit the potential for significant growth before the year’s close. While established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have garnered substantial attention, newer entrants like Pepe (PEPE) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are also capturing the market’s interest. This shift in attention underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where new projects can rapidly gain prominence, influencing trading strategies and market trends. Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments Investors are seeking final chances in the crypto marketplace hoping to earn cash before a new year. This period usually shows extra moves in the market with traders eager t͏o improve their stash for end-year outcomes. One way that is noticed is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves saving a set amount of cash at normal times, regardless of the market condition. This method reduces the impact of market rises and falls and cuts down the risk of making poor choices from fast market shifts. Another is Market Cycle Investing, which refers to timing funds on the crypto market’s circular nature. By checking old data and market trends, investors seek to buy when the market is down and sell when it’s up. There’s also a mix of investments. By spreading money over different types of digital coins, investors can handle risk and raise the chance for gains. Mixing helps to balance the ups and downs found in the crypto market. It’s key to know that while these me͏thods can work, they also have risks as the crypto market is always changing. As such, doing a deep study and matching buy choices with personal money goals and risk comfort is crucial.

The firm offering less volatile access to Bitcoin also holds U.S. Treasuries for liquidity. Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF Strive Asset Management, run by Vivek Ramaswamy, is filing with the SEC on a “ Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF. ” The 485A filing suggests investment landscapes shift from the old “follow the money” to new “follow the Bitcoin.” The proposed ETF is going to offer access to MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds, which have become so popular due to the potentially more favorable regulatory climate under the new administration. This is an important step by Strive as digital assets are gaining popularity in the financial world. The demand for MicroStrategy’s bonds that convert into stocks based on Bitcoin’s performance has been strong broader market for Bitcoin-related investments. There is also an expectation that following Donald Trump’s recent election victory, regulatory hurdles may ease for digital assets and more institutions will look at crypto-related financial products at ease. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Funds, has been open about the strategy of the fund, pointing out that he is going to focus on vehicles that would be best suited by having a digital asset-friendly administration. His comments give an insight into what might be expected in 2025. Investment Strategy and Objective Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF strategy lies investment in what they describe as “Bitcoin Bonds. ” These are convertibles from a company such as MicroStrategy that happens to plough large proportions of the proceeds of bonds into Bitcoin. The use of derivative instruments by this ETF will enable to managing their exposure in these securities. The main objective of this fund is to replicate Bitcoin for investors through these Bitcoin Bonds and derivatives, allowing the investor to have less volatile exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it. The fund will invest in U.S. government securities, primarily Treasuries, to ensure liquidity and support its derivative positions. It may also invest in other investment companies specializing in Bitcoin-related financial instruments to diversify its approach to capturing the potential of Bitcoin. It indicates the growing acceptance of bitcoin in traditional finance and thereby has portrayed a strategic change towards digital assets that will help redefine how investment strategies get built. With Ramaswamy’s background opposition to corporate governance norms as well as his firm, which opposes ESG; this particular ETF might find investors who are looking out for non-traditional options which highlights the Bitcoin’s aspects. As 2025 begins, this kind of ETF could set up a trend that encourages broader crypto integration into investment portfolios.

Analyst Breaks Down the Data",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/who-profited-during-bitcoin-100000-surge-analyst-breaks-down-the-data/,"Bitcoin ongoing price movement has sparked intense analysis as it continues to hover below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching an all-time high above $108,000 last week, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain upward momentum ever since. With this performance, BTC’s on-chain data has been brought to the spotlight to uncover the factors driving recent selling pressures and investor behavior. One key focus has been the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) indicator, which provides valuable insights into Bitcoin holders’ activity based on their holding periods. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? Who Cashed Out Their Bitcoin Gains? According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Yonsei Dent, data reveals that Bitcoin investors who bought their holdings between six to twelve months ago were the most active sellers during the recent price surge. This group largely entered the market during the initial excitement surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in the year. While this selling activity exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, the asset has managed to stabilize within the $90,000–$100,000 range. Interestingly, long-term holders, defined as those holding Bitcoin for over a year, have shown minimal selling activity. Historical trends suggest that these seasoned investors are likely anticipating elevated price levels before considering substantial profit-taking. Meanwhile, Dent pointed to the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric showing a noticeable decline in older Bitcoin being moved in December compared to November. Historically, reduced activity from long-term holders during price corrections often signals market resilience and potential for future upward momentum. The analyst wrote: The ‘Binary CDD’ indicator at the bottom of the chart shows a decline in the selling of older Bitcoin in December compared to November. This suggests that many long-term holders may anticipate even higher prices before selling. Binance Reserves Signal Market Confidence Speaking of higher prices, another crucial metric suggesting a significant move brewing for Bitcoin comes from Binance’s Bitcoin reserves, which have been steadily declining since August. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted that Binance’s reserves recently hit their lowest level since January. This trend is significant because a similar decline earlier in the year preceded a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price. The reduction in exchange reserves typically indicates that investors are moving their Bitcoin holdings away from centralized exchanges and into private wallets. Such behavior suggests reduced selling pressure and a preference for long-term holding strategies. Historically, declining reserves on exchanges have often aligned with periods of strong market optimism and price rallies. Notably, as BTC currently still trades at a price of $95,567 down by 2.7% in the past day, the confluence of these factors—long-term holder confidence, reduced activity from older wallets, and declining exchange reserves—presents a cautiously optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors look to 1Fuel as Cardano (ADA) Ethereum (ETH) struggle. Table of Contents ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum ADA faces high-selling pressure Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Conclusion With the current retracements, some altcoins have found it difficult to regain momentum. Ethereum, which rose to $4,000, nearing its ATH of $4,792, has declined drastically. Cardano trails a similar path, falling below $0.91. Should there be more retracements, analysts suggest they might consolidate at their current values or experience further decreases. However, a new token, 1Fuel , has been gaining traction and recording an increase in sales. Currently, in its second phase selling at $0.012, 1Fuel has raised $835,000, with experts ranking it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy for 2025. ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum In the past 24 hours, ETH has struggled to break out of $3,477 resistance and has assumed a bearish state with a high chance of ETH dipping below $3,300 before a rebound. ETH’s long/short ratio — a metric to track the ratio of buyers to sellers in the market — is at 0.98 and on the verge of entering 1, a bullish sign. This means that investors believe that ETH still has the potential to increase, allocating more funds to it. However, if ETH reverses from its current price, there’s a possibility of it dipping to $3,000, which will result in a massive loss for these investors. The uncertainty surrounding the ETH’s rally has caused investors to eye 1Fuel because of its potential offerings. 1Fuel has recorded a massive increment in its token presales, and it’s set to change the investment narratives in the cryptocurrency market in 2025. ADA faces high-selling pressure ADA is currently trading at $0.86. The token has seen a 9.63% decline in its trading volume. This indicates that there’s high selling pressure, pushing ADA’s price downwards. ADA may gain momentum if it drops into the $0.73–$0.63 range, where buyer interest is anticipated. However, investors should exercise caution, as market volatility could push prices below this range, leading to potential losses. Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Experts predict at least a 500% surge in price after 1Fuel launches on top cryptocurrency exchanges. Notably, investors will get a 30% APR on all their staked coins, meaning they can earn passively. 1Fuel will also support P2P trading on its platform, giving room for users to trade directly with other users at low fees. Furthermore, with 1Fuel, users will get a built-in AI-powered feature that will make all the functions in the cryptocurrency wallet easy for them to use, facilitating seamless transactions. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market regains momentum, coins like ETH and ADA have been finding it hard to join the bullish trend. However, 1Fuel is set to create a buzz in the altcoin market. The new crypto is currently selling at $0.012 but is expected to surge more than 100x once it hits top cryptocurrency exchanges. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

Table of Contents Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Bitcoin Conclusion A trader famed for accurately forecasting Bitcoin’s price movements now suggests that a meme token, currently priced at $0.0007, could soar to $1 in 2025. This bold prediction has caught the attention of the crypto world, sparking curiosity about the potential of this overlooked token. Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Donald Trump’s comeback has lit a fire under the crypto market, with meme coins roaring back into the limelight. While blue-chip tokens make incremental gains, Catzilla is ready to leap ahead, positioning itself as the apex predator in this new meme coin renaissance. Trump’s vision of a pro-crypto America sets the stage for unparalleled growth, creating the perfect storm for meme coins to thrive. Among them, Catzilla stands tall, ready to shatter expectations and claim the throne. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s here to rewrite the playbook for decentralized finance. Starting at just $0.0002, Catzilla’s presale climbs to $0.0016 over 14 stages, offering early adopters significant growth opportunities. Stage 4 is live at $0.0006, with a 16.67% price increase looming. Catzilla doesn’t just offer investment opportunities; it empowers the community with its a unique referral system: 8% USDT on direct referral purchases. 2% USDT on second-tier referrals. 1% USDT on third-tier referrals. With BTC and other major coins seemingly losing momentum, Catzilla rises as the ultimate underdog poised for greatness. You might also like: 4 overlooked cryptos poised to turn $200 into half a million: Catzilla on spotlight Bitcoin Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, using blockchain technology to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Its transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and earn BTC as rewards. With a capped supply of 21 million BTC and halving events that reduce miners’ rewards every four years, Bitcoin is designed to be scarce. This scarcity, along with increasing adoption, gives it potential as a digital store of value. Conclusion With BTC and other major coins showing less short-term potential, Catzilla steps up as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a 700% ROI during its presale. Its triple utility empowers holders through governance, rewards, and staking. Catzilla seeks to unite enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom, inviting participation in the battle against crypto villains.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 00:22:00

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Jason Pizzino tells his 123,400 followers that investor sentiment indicates traders now are closer to the end of the bull market than the start. “Bitcoin and crypto ‘end-stage’ emotional volatility has dramatically increased which only suggests we are much closer to the end than the beginning of the cycle. That might seem like an obvious statement now, but wait until the market gets closer to the final top; it won’t be so obvious which is generally a signal within itself.” In an accompanying video update, Pizzino says historically, when the market gets excited and overconfident, stagnation tends to follow. “I think a lot of people believe this cycle should run until the end of 2025, but what if we’re seeing a lot of that excitement come back into the market? Every time it goes up, all I see is just everyone getting super bullish and then it pauses for a bit, corrects, and then we start on the next move. So I’m just keeping an open mind.” Source: Jason Pizzino/X The trader’s chart uses Bitcoin ( BTC ) as an example. According to Pizzino, the top crypto asset by market cap may correct or trade sideways all the way until October 2025. “Looking somewhere [between] Q2 out to Q3, just the beginning of Q4… Most people can’t handle six to 10 months. They talked about a drop of one month and they all freaked out yesterday, it’s absolutely bonkers out there, which is why I think we are in those final moves, basically the end of the cycle.” BTC is trading at $98,900 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Bitcoin Average Coin Age Has Been Trending Up Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the recent trend in the Average Coin Age for Bitcoin. The “Average Coin Age” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of how long the average BTC token has been staying dormant for. A coin is said to be dormant when it sits still inside an address without being involved in any sort of transaction activity. The longer the coin stays in this state, the more it ‘ages’ up. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 4%, Whale Reacts With $69 Million Coinbase Deposit Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age has seen some sharp spikes this year, but also some equally steep declines. This would suggest that the investors have been participating in some phases of HODLing, but they have also not been shying away from taking some profits. On the whole, however, the holders have shown notable resolve, as the 365-day MA of the indicator has been in a constant state of uptrend since the end of the 2022 bear market. Statistically, the longer investors hold onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the fact that the investors have been increasingly preferring to keep their coins dormant can be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency’s price. Interestingly, this trend didn’t develop during the 2021 bull market, as even though the 30-day MA of the Average Coin Age saw a period of uptrend, the 365-day MA moved down throughout the year instead. This could imply the average investor has become smarter this cycle. In the short-term, the 30-day MA of the indicator has been rapidly climbing, which implies the Bitcoin market is currently in one of the phases of active accumulation.

Following the latest jump, nearly a third of the asset’s tokens in circulation haven’t been involved in a transaction since more than five years ago.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 01:45:00

Avalanche (AVAX) is riding high after traders spotted massive potential in FX Guy’s trading systems, aiming for up to 20x returns. Meanwhile, SEI (SEI) is turning heads with its lightning-fast Layer-1 blockchain, built to handle the demands of high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). These projects are grabbing attention for good reason—2024 is shaping up to be a year of bold moves and even bigger gains in the crypto space. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , a project with its eyes set on solving the very problems that have held crypto back from mainstream adoption. With a groundbreaking partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is about to make crypto transactions as simple as buying a cup of coffee. Its innovative features are designed for real-life usability, putting it in a league of its own.

Picture small businesses finally embracing crypto payments without worrying about complexity. Freelancers get paid instantly, without waiting for banks to clear funds. And regular users manage their digital assets with ease. With Qubetics, the barriers to entry are crumbling fast. The numbers speak for themselves. Qubetics’ presale is in its 14th stage, and it’s already sold over 377 million tokens to more than 11,800 holders, raising $7.8 million. Priced at just $0.0377 right now, $TICS tokens will see a 10% price increase this weekend as the 15th stage kicks off. If you’re looking to get in on the action, now’s the time to act. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling New Heights in 2024 Avalanche has cemented itself as a force to be reckoned with in decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming.

The token’s rally has gathered massive interest from large-scale investors, who have heavily invested in the token over the last few days. Related Reading: ONDO Faces 30% Correction Risk If It Loses $1.46 Support – Top Analyst New Solana Token Steals The Spotlight On December 17, the Pudgy Penguins Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project launched its official token, PENGU, on the Solana Blockchain. The token has moved through the ranks, flipping other Solana-based tokens and gathering massive attention in nine days. Pudgy Penguins, one of the largest NFT collections, consists of 8,888 unique cartoons of cute penguins and has a market capitalization of 205,757 ETH. In anticipation of the token launch, the project surged as the second-largest NFT collection, only falling behind CryptoPunks. Since its launch three years ago, the project has seen its community significantly grow and “cemented itself in the hearts and minds of everyday people and culture,” according to the project’s team. Additionally, it is expected to contribute to the project’s governance despite not having a specific use case announced yet. As such, the newly launched cryptocurrency aims to “expand its community and further widen the reach” of the project by allowing old and new users “to align” themselves with the penguins. According to CoinGecko data, the Solana-based memecoin debuted with a 500% surge to a market capitalization of $3.5 billion but registered massive volatility in the following days. Just hours after launching, PENGU’s price retraced over 50% before descending to a $1.4 billion market cap on December 20. The token hovered between the $0.025-$0.037 range over a few days, stabilizing around the range’s upper zone on Christmas Eve. Whales Fill Their Bags As PENGU Flips BONK Amid the market’s momentary Christmas Day gains, the token broke above this range and climbed to the $0.042 mark on Thursday morning, hitting a $2.6 billion market cap. During this 18% rally, the token flipped dogwifhat (WIF) and BONK to become the largest Solana memecoin by market cap, currently holding its position as the sector’s leader. PENGU became the fourth largest memecoin by this metric, just behind Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Additionally, in the last 24 hours, the token has seen a 25% increase in market activity, with a daily trading volume of $1.92 billion. According to on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain, Crypto whales have also noticed PENGU’s rally, with several large-scale investors filling their bags over the past week.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 03:03:00

If you’ve been keeping your eyes peeled on the crypto scene, you know that meme coins have taken the market by storm, and this month, there’s one standout that’s going to make your wallet roar with excitement. Forget the usual suspects; we’re talking about BTFD Coin and its epic festive offer. With its community-driven approach, innovative gaming features, and legendary presale numbers (more than $4.5 million raised to this day), BTFD Coin is leading the charge. If you thought the price was already a steal, hold on tight—thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can unlock a jaw-dropping 50% bonus ! This isn’t just any sale. The bonus draws inspiration from the iconic 1973 market crash, a time when savvy investors seized the moment and rode the waves to success. So buckle up, because BTFD Coin is ready to rocket into 2025. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin to Watch for the Long Haul When it comes to the best new meme coins to invest in this month, BTFD Coin has earned its spot at the top. Not only is it packed with insane features like high-yield staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’ll keep you entertained for hours, and a strong, vibrant community, but it also offers an incredible opportunity for long-term growth. The festive 50% offer that you can unlock with the BIG50 code is the cherry on top. Let’s be real—who doesn’t love a good deal? Now, you might be wondering, “Why the 1973 market crash?” Well, it’s all about history repeating itself. Back in the ‘70s, the oil market crashed, and while many investors panicked, others saw an opportunity to buy in low and hold for the long term. Just like them, you’ve got the chance to grab BTFD Coin with a massive deal—before it potentially blows up and leaves everyone else in the dust. Let’s break it down with an investment example: If you put $6,000 into BTFD Coin at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d initially receive 46,153,846 $BTFD tokens. But here’s the kicker—with the BIG50 bonus, you’ll snag an additional 50% tokens, bringing your total to 69,230,769 coins. If the price rises to $0.0006 (a target many analysts are predicting), that investment could skyrocket to $41,538.46. ANDY: The Pepe Sidekick Changes the Game If you’ve been around the crypto scene, you’ve probably heard of Pepe, the meme king of crypto. Now, meet ANDY, Pepe’s lifelong best friend, who has finally decided to launch his own meme coin and show the world what he’s made of. ANDY is all about fun, memes, and good vibes. And while it might not have the same explosive growth as some of the bigger coins out there, ANDY has a dedicated fanbase and a unique position in the market. With a circulating supply of 1 trillion ANDY coins, the token is all about community, making it an appealing option for anyone who’s looking to hop onto the Pepe train. Currently, the price of ANDY is sitting at $0.000196, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.7 million. While the coin is currently down by about 14%, it’s still a solid contender in the meme coin race. If you’re looking for something a bit different, ANDY could be worth a closer look. DOGS: A Community-Driven Coin with a Woof Another contender in the meme coin world is DOGS, a coin that’s all about community ownership and fun vibes. Built on the TON blockchain, DOGS has already created a buzz by leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and incorporating meme culture into its core. If you’re part of the Telegram community, you’ve probably seen the iconic DOGS mascot popping up everywhere. However, like ANDY, DOGS has recently faced a bit of a dip, with the price down by around 7% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, the DOGS project is far from being counted out. It boasts a market cap of over $270 million and a dedicated following that keeps the coin’s spirit alive. With a circulating supply of over 500 billion coins, DOGS is another community-driven coin that’s worth keeping an eye on. How to Claim Your Bonus on BTFD Coin’s Presale Today If you’re ready to take advantage of this killer offer, here’s how you can claim your 50% bonus: Go to the Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50 , and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and take a look at the updated amount. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

ETH is now showing bearish signs and might slide below the $3,300 level. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,550 zone. The price is trading below $3,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bearish momentum if it settles below the $3,300 level. Ethereum Price Dips To Support Ethereum price struggled to continue higher above the $3,550 resistance and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin . ETH traded below the $3,450 and $3,420 support levels. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,225 swing low to the $3,543 high.

It is now testing the $3,300 support and is above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,225 swing low to the $3,543 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,380 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,420 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,500. A clear move above the $3,500 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. More Losses In ETH?

Meanwhile, Ethereum traders recently made some impressive profits, and one trader earned $1.1M from a leveraged short. Analysts also predict that ETH could outperform Bitcoin in early 2025. Ethereum ETFs, like BlackRock’s ETHA, are already gaining momentum by attracting millions in inflows, contrasting with Bitcoin ETFs. Vitalik Buterin Adopts Viral Pygmy Hippo Moo Deng Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, captured the internet’s attention by adopting Moo Deng, a pygmy hippopotamus that became a viral sensation earlier this year. The announcement was made by Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo on Dec. 26 through a post on X which revealed that Buterin contributed 10,000,000 Thai Baht (or $292,000) to support Moo Deng and her family as part of the Wildlife Sponsorship Program. The zoo is extremely grateful that Buterin will be supporting Moo Deng over the next two years. Moo Deng rose to fame in September of 2024 thanks to her playful personality and the widely shared videos posted by the zoo, which captivated audiences worldwide. After the adoption announcement, Buterin indicated that his support could extend further, and revealed plans to allocate 88 ETH, which is equivalent to over $290,000, to assist Moo Deng and her companions. Buterin’s philanthropy in 2024 also included a $180,000 Ethereum donation to the biotech charity Kanro, which came from meme coins that were sent to his wallet. The viral phenomenon of Moo Deng extended beyond just the confines of social media, and even inspired the creation of a Solana-based meme coin named MOODENG . Early investors reaped impressive profits from the token, and one trader transformed a $1,300 investment into $3.4 million. However, the token’s success was short-lived as its value plummeted by about 58% from its peak price of $0.62 in mid-November 2024. Data from Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, revealed that more than 99% of traders suffered losses or gained less than $1,000. Out of 8.5 million wallets, only 50 earned up to $1,000, while five wallets achieved profits between $1,000 and $10,000. Just one wallet managed to exceed $10,000 in earnings. Despite the financial turbulence, Moo Deng is still a symbol of joy and community engagement, now with the added support of one of cryptocurrency’s most influential figures. Trader Nets $1.1M on Ether Short MOODENG was not the only token that traders lucked out on. A crypto trader recently made more than $1.1 million in profit in just two days by strategically shorting Ethereum (ETH) during the current market correction. By using a 50x leveraged short position, the trader borrowed 19,186 Ether, worth more than $64.5 million, when its price was $3,428. This position was opened on Dec. 24, and also earned the trader over $680,000 in funding fees. According to blockchain data from Hypurrscan , the short position carries a liquidation price above $4,750. On-chain intelligence firm Lookonchain revealed that the trader faced a $1.2 million loss on the first day. However, the market's subsequent downturn flipped the position into a highly profitable trade. While leveraged trading can amplify returns, it still carries some serious risks. These risks took center stage in January of 2024 during an incident where a trader lost over $161,000 after being liquidated on a leveraged position. The past year has seen other traders make extraordinary profits in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin’s historic climb past $100,000 on Dec. 5 was especially a boon for many, while meme coin traders also saw good returns. One such trader turned a $27 investment into $52 million over 600 days by capitalizing on PEPE’s meteoric rise. Another trader in May achieved a $46 million profit from a $3,000 investment in PEPE. Ether Poised for Breakout Traders can make even more money off ETH as the altcoin is showing potential for a breakout against Bitcoin in January 2025. TradingView data revealed that the ETH/BTC ratio strands close to 0.0356, and MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe suggested it could surpass 0.04 in January. The last time the ratio hit 0.04 was on Dec. 8, when ETH reached $4,018. Van de Poppe expects increased inflows into Ether in the coming month, while Bitcoin may experience outflows that could potentially consolidate its price. This shift could trigger an “altcoin run,” which happens when alternative tokens like Ethereum gain more market momentum. Already, key Ethereum ecosystem tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mantle recorded impressive price increases recently. Bitcoin , meanwhile, continues to trade below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching the six-figure milestone on Dec. 5, its current performance contrasts with the enthusiasm building around Ethereum and altcoins. Analysts also predict that spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could outperform Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. Nate Geraci , the president of ETF Store, shared that inflows into ETH ETFs are aligning with those of gold ETFs and may accelerate even more in the near future. Pseudonymous trader Brent compared Ether’s current state to a ”ball forcibly held underwater,” which means that the altcoin has the potential for explosive growth. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen noticed earlier in December that the ETH/BTC ratio’s decline is either over or nearing its conclusion, which also sets the stage for potential growth over the next 6 to 12 months. Ethereum ETF Gains Momentum While Bitcoin ETFs Face Outflows BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), attracted almost $44 million in inflows on Christmas eve, bringing its total net assets to $3.65 billion, according to data from SoSoValue . In contrast, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) faced outflows of $188 million, contributing to an overall $338 million bleed from Bitcoin ETFs on the same day. Among the Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded outflows of $83.16 million and $75 million, respectively. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) stood out as the only product in the green, gaining $8.5 million in inflows. Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF also performed well after attracting roughly $6 million in inflows. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite the recent underperformance, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is still a standout success thanks to it amassing close to $54 billion in net assets in less than a year. This achievement cements its position as one of the most successful cryptocurrency stories of the year. Industry experts, including Bitwise, predict that the total Bitcoin ETF inflows next year could surpass those of 2024. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed the estimated holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, though the exact number of coins owned by Nakamoto is still unknown.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-27 03:30:47

The idea? To offer investors a way to gain exposure to firms embracing the “Bitcoin standard.” Curious what that means? Let’s break it down. A Closer Look at Bitwise’s Plan The proposed fund, called the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF , is no ordinary ETF. To qualify for inclusion, companies must hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their reserves. That’s not all. They also need a market capitalization of at least $100 million, daily liquidity of $1 million, and less than 10% of their stock privately held. Source : SEC Edgar Here’s where it gets interesting: the ETF doesn’t weigh companies based on their market size, like most funds do. Instead, it focuses on the value of their Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy, which holds a whopping 444,262 BTC, would dominate the ETF, even though Tesla owns far fewer Bitcoin (9,720 BTC) but has a much larger market cap. Each holding, however, is capped at 25% to keep things balanced. Bitcoin’s Growing Corporate Appeal Why are companies diving into Bitcoin? Partly because it’s great for their stock prices. Take KULR Technology Group , for instance. They bought 217.18 BTC for $21 million earlier this month. That decision paid off big time, boosting their stock price by 40%. And let’s not forget Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency has soared 117% this year, hitting a record high of $108,000 in December. Even now, it’s holding steady at around $95,800. It’s clear that Bitcoin’s appeal is only growing. What to Expect Bitwise’s ETF isn’t the only one vying for attention. Strive, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed for an ETF focused on Bitcoin bonds. It’ll be interesting to see how these competing proposals play out. For investors looking to bet on Bitcoin’s rising adoption, these ETFs could open exciting new doors. But as always with crypto, there’s a mix of potential and uncertainty.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 03:54:28

Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created simultaneously, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This method transforms the blockchain into a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). By generalizing Nakamoto consensus, Kaspa achieves secure operation with very high block rates. Currently, it produces one block per second, aiming to increase to 10 blocks per second and potentially 100 in the future. This results in minimal confirmation times, primarily limited by internet latency. Kaspa’s implementation includes features such as Reachability to query the blockDAG’s topology and block data pruning, with plans for block header pruning. It supports Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and will later include subnetwork support, which will facilitate future layer 2 solutions. The coin introduces innovations in blockchain technology and addresses scalability while maintaining security. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s technological advancements may be noteworthy to those following developments in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While KAS and DOT are strong, XYZVerse’s pioneering all-sport memecoin unites fans and aims for massive growth, making it a standout in the bull run.

These activities, which include cryptocurrency theft and IT-related foreign currency generation, are said to be funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. Crypto Crimes Funding Military Developments In a press statement released on Boxing Day, the South Korean government announced it had designated 15 North Korean IT employees and one organization under independent sanctions. The individuals allegedly belong to the 313th General Bureau, an entity tied to the DPRK’s Ministry of Munitions Industry, which oversees the country’s weapons development programs. Among them, Kim-Cheol-Min is accused of working secretly for technology firms in the United States and Canada, funneling large sums of money to the North Korean regime. Another individual, Kim Ryu-Sung, previously faced indictment in the U.S. for violating sanctions. The measures will also target the Chosun Geumjeong Economic Information Technology Exchange Company, which is claimed to dispatch IT workers abroad to help generate foreign currency for North Korea. The money is reportedly used to finance military developments in the pariah nation. Once the sanctions come into effect on December 30, 2024, South Korean laws require that any financial transactions with the affected individuals and entities must receive approval from the Financial Services Commission or the Governor of the Bank of Korea. Growing North Korean Threat The restrictions against the alleged DPRK agents come even as a recent Chainalysis report revealed that North Korean actors were responsible for 61% of the $2.2 billion stolen in 2024 in crypto heists across the globe. The hackers used sophisticated tactics, including malware deployment and social engineering, allowing them to target major digital asset companies. In one instance, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Radiant Capital suffered a $50 million hack attributed to the North Koreans. The attackers orchestrated the breach through malware distributed via Telegram, exploiting weaknesses in the platform’s security. Additionally, the notorious hacking outfit, the Lazarus Group, has been linked to another $50 million heist, this time on the Upbit crypto exchange. South Korean authorities, in collaboration with the FBI and Swiss prosecutors, confirmed the group’s involvement and shed light on its ties to the DPRK’s main intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Kaspersky Labs security analyst Vasily Berdnikov also connected the syndicate with an elaborate hacking plot that involved cloning a popular blockchain game and embedding malicious code within its website, allowing it to install malware on the systems of anyone playing the game. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have been tackling related issues.

All attention is now drawn to 1Fuel (OFT) , the token behind the cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet in development to simplify transactions. Experts say that at presale stage 2, with over $800,000 raised so far, its current price of $0.012 is a bargain. Here’s a deeper look: ADA falls below $1 as investors back off Investors in ADA are backing out one after the other, as reflected in the weeks of decline. ADA dropped by 12% in the past week alone, placing it at $0.91 at press time with technical indicators hinting at further decrease. Investors are closing their positions on ADA as the only hope for a bounce back hinges on a descending channel, involving prices dropping lower (within a support and resistance line) before bouncing higher. Analysts say ADA could fall as low as $0.60 before any major upward momentum occurs. With ADA’s trading volume declining by 9.90% and its price dropping 1.61% in the last 24 hours, this suggests a market divergence with possible exhaustion in the buying, indicating an incoming decline. Investors, not wanting to be caught in this downside murkiness, are leaving ADA and seeking better alternatives. XRP has also been ruled out as a profitable asset to purchase. XRP investors might begin opting out After a month-long rally, XRP has now dropped. Over the past 7 days, it caused investors to lose 5.36%, falling as low as $1.9. However, XRP is currently trading within a consolidation channel known as an asymmetrical triangle. The price trading in this channel involves a slow and steady buying of the asset (in this case, XRP ) at a low price before a final upswing. However, this phase could last weeks or even months, leaving investors uncertain about when a meaningful rally will surface for XRP . Following the recent downturn and the lack of a definitive date for a rally, investors are turning to 1Fuel . With its presale price at $0.012, experts claim it is the cheapest cryptocurrency to buy in 2024 . 1Fuel: Investor’s yield generator, ahead of ADA and XRP 1Fuel has become the talk of the crypto community as its presale stage 2 has generated $800,000 in nearly two weeks, driven purely by market interest. Experts project that 1Fuel could deliver 100x returns by the end of its presale and upon the launch of its associated wallet. The wallet aims to solve critical pain points in the crypto ecosystem, including cross-chain transaction inefficiencies, unified gas fees, and streamlined off-ramp and on-ramp solutions. With a clear roadmap and strong market interest, 1Fuel is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the best crypto investments of 2024 . Conclusion As one of the best crypto investments of 2024 , with the potential to return 100X and backed by the anticipated cryptocurrency wallet , it is without doubt that experts are correct in predicting 1Fuel’s potential to outperform other crypto assets in the market, ADA and XRP inclusive.

Solana and Its Role In Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for speed and scalability. It allows developers to build decentralized applications while competing with platforms like Ethereum. The system processes transactions quickly without relying on sharding or side chains. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is used for transaction fees, program execution, and network rewards. Its architecture supports developers with tools across various programming languages. This versatility makes Solana suitable for hosting projects requiring high performance. The coin’s value is tied to its ecosystem’s growth and adoption. SOL appeals to those looking for efficient blockchain solutions. The focus on high capacity and developer-friendly tools positions Solana as an option for scalable innovations in blockchain technology. Avalanche: Efficient Blockchain with Customizable Subnet Functionality Avalanche is a fast, energy-efficient blockchain with low fees. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second and finalizes them in under two seconds. Its structure includes three chains for specific tasks like transactions and smart contracts. Users can create custom Subnets tailored to specific needs. The network uses a hybrid consensus model combining classical and Nakamoto methods. AVAX, its native token, is used for fees, staking, and running Subnets. It can also support payment systems and the creation of custom blockchains. This combination of speed, functionality, and adaptability makes Avalanche and AVAX appealing in the evolving blockchain market. Conclusion While Solana and Avalanche may offer steady growth, they show less short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN embodies luxury and success for those seeking the best. With expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN is poised to dominate this altcoin season, building a community of alpha leaders who settle for nothing less.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 04:30:00

Positioned as the most explosive crypto opportunity of the year, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers investors a rare chance to capitalize on a New Year’s miracle of unprecedented proportions. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 65,500% Rally That Could Define Your New Year WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly rising as one of the most thrilling tokens in the cryptocurrency landscape. While the Cardano price is expected to surpass $5 by March 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is capturing global investor attention with a predicted jaw-dropping 65,500% surge by January. Experts attribute this explosive potential to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) groundbreaking utilities, including an AI-powered, decentralized platform loaded with cutting-edge features like AI-enhanced portfolio management, a multimodal chatbot, and convenient QR-based Scan & Pay solutions. These innovations ease DeFi investments, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a market leader and a long-term asset for generating massive gains beyond January 2025. Furthermore, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) security features appeal to institutional and retail investors as they guarantee the safety of user assets.

With analysts forecasting a 65,500% surge by January and the possibility of extending gains to 75,000%, investors are looking at WallitIQ (WLTQ) as more than an opportunity but a revolution. . ADA’s $5 Breakthrough: Cardano Price Prediction For 2025 The Cardano price has been steadily gaining traction as one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. With a promising roadmap and robust technological advancements, analysts now predict the Cardano price could break the $5 milestone from $0.897 by March 2025, making it a key contender in the race for blockchain dominance. A major driver for this projected surge in the Cardano price is its revolutionary proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which offers unparalleled energy efficiency and scalability. As more developers flock to the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, the demand for ADA, the native token, continues to rise. This growing adoption fuels optimism that the Cardano price will skyrocket in the coming years. In addition, Cardano’s (ADA) strategic partnerships and expanding utility further solidify its position as a market leader. From powering decentralized applications to facilitating secure smart contracts, the platform’s versatility is attracting investors. Experts believe these developments could catapult the Cardano price into uncharted territory. As the crypto market matures, regulatory clarity and institutional interest are also expected to play a pivotal role in ADA’s growth. With these favorable conditions, the Cardano price breaking $5 by March 2025 seems increasingly plausible. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale: The Future Of Crypto Growth Starts Here While the Cardano price climbs toward the $5 milestone, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the true standout in the crypto world. Predictions point to an astonishing 65,500% surge by January 2025, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the most bullish asset on the market. Backed by a successful SolidProof smart contract audit , WallitIQ (WLTQ) is earning trust among investors, while its presale price of just $0.0243 offers an unbeatable opportunity for massive returns. Combining reliability with unparalleled growth potential, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has quickly become the go-to token for those aiming to achieve life-changing profits by 2025. With demand skyrocketing, WallitIQ (WLTQ)’s presale is selling out rapidly, making this a limited opportunity to secure a position in this high-growth token. Experts anticipate that the token’s value will soar by 65,500% in the coming months, offering a rare chance to transform your portfolio.

This optimistic outlook is driven by India’s progressive efforts to create frameworks that build trust, boost innovation, and expand blockchain use. India’s Growing Importance in Crypto Regulation India’s growing role in cryptocurrency regulation is gaining attention, especially as 2024 marked major advancements in crypto adoption and institutional interest, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $108K . One of the defining moments was the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Therefore, Vishal Sacheendran, Head of Regional Markets at Binance, believes India will take the lead in global crypto regulation by 2025, helping to build trust and support growth in the industry. Sacheendran also highlighted Binance’s efforts to keep up with India’s changing rules. The company has been working to grow its presence in the country, showing its commitment to offering safe and legal crypto services. Sacheendran further notes that the future of crypto is not just about trading but about creating a decentralized and innovative digital ecosystem that benefits everyone. India’s Shifting Stance Towards Crypto India’s journey toward crypto regulation began in 2019 with a draft bill proposing a complete ban on cryptocurrencies. However, this bill was never presented in Parliament, and over time, India’s approach became less strict, influenced by global trends. During a recent Parliament session , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has advised the government to create rules for cryptocurrencies. Still, the government believes that any ban would need global cooperation. However, the government has also introduced taxes on virtual assets. A 30% tax on crypto profits began on April 1, followed by a 1% TDS from July 1. These rules have caused a drop in trading activity on crypto exchanges in India.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 04:50:11

You don’t just buy coins and hope they go up anymore. Strive Asset Manager, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is pushing the boundaries with a new kind of fund. They’ve filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF, which could let investors profit from companies that are big on Bitcoin—without directly owning any. Strive files for “Bitcoin Bond” ETF… Would seek exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy. pic.twitter.com/ybJjbVFWUN — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 26, 2024 If that sounds a bit confusing, don’t worry. The idea is actually pretty simple. Companies like MicroStrategy have been using bonds to invest in Bitcoin for years. Strive wants to bring that strategy to investors like you. What Exactly Are Bitcoin Bonds? Bitcoin bonds aren’t actually Bitcoin. They’re more like loans companies take out. MicroStrategy, for example, issues bonds to raise cash, which they then use to buy Bitcoin. These bonds are interesting because they can turn into shares of the company later. It’s a risky move, but for MicroStrategy, it’s been a jackpot. Their stock has soared over 2,200% since 2020. Strive’s ETF wants to jump into this space. Instead of just buying Bitcoin, the fund would invest in these bonds. It’s an active approach, meaning managers make decisions on which bonds to pick. They might also use tools like swaps and options to maximize returns. Source : SEC Edgar The fees haven’t been announced yet, but actively managed funds typically cost more than regular index funds. Whether or not that’s worth it will depend on how the Bitcoin bond ETF performs. Politics and Crypto: How Does Ramaswamy Fit In? Let’s talk about Vivek Ramaswamy for a second. He’s not just some Wall Street guy. He’s also a major political player. In 2023, he ran against Donald Trump in the Republican primaries. After losing, he turned around and endorsed Trump. Now, the two seem to be working toward a common goal—making the U.S. a leader in innovation, including crypto. Under Trump, the crypto world has seen some big shifts. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins is set to lead the SEC, and David Sacks, PayPal’s ex-COO, has been named “AI and Crypto Czar.” These moves suggest a friendlier attitude toward crypto, which could make it easier for funds like Strive’s ETF to get approved. What’s Next for Bitcoin Investors? If Strive’s ETF gets the green light for the Bitcoin bind ETF, it could open the door for a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Instead of dealing with the ups and downs of owning Bitcoin directly, people can invest in bonds tied to the cryptocurrency. It’s less risky in some ways, but still gives exposure to Bitcoin’s growth. This isn’t just about one fund, though. It’s part of a bigger trend of blending traditional finance with the crypto world. As more companies adopt Bitcoin into their strategies, tools like this ETF could make it easier for everyday investors to get involved. This shows how Bitcoin is making its place in the financial world.

Bitcoin (BTC) price backtracked to the $96k level, whereas Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP mirrored a slumping movement.

Besides, the total market volume from yesterday witnessed a 5% increase to $123.46 billion. Let’s delve deeper into the top coins and their price action on December 27. Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, & XRP Take Heat Amid the broader market’s recent volatility due to the U.S. Fed’s Hawkish stance with rate cuts, top cryptos such as BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL face heat across the broader market.

Notably, ETH’s futures OI witnessed a marginal 1% increase to $23.47 billion. Moreover, the derivatives volume rocketed 29% in value to $35.69 billion. Market watchers continue to eye the crypto for further price action shifts amid a broader turbulent market.

However, despite the recent correction, a CoinGape report revealed that Solana could reach between $400 and $500 in this cycle. XRP Price Today At press time, XRP price dipped nearly 3.5% and is currently trading at $2.18. Its intraday low and high were $2.13 and $2.25, respectively.

Salame and Ellison pleaded guilty to the charges against them, which were criminal fraud charges and seven federal counts of fraud and conspiracy, respectively. With their guilty plea, they saved themselves and the prosecution from a lengthy trial process. Both of them pleaded guilty in 2023 and were sentenced this year in May. Rewarding the cooperation of the fraudulent FTX execs In the federal prison system, inmates can earn sentence reductions through good behavior and participation in rehabilitation programs. Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison. She began her sentence at the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution on November 7. She was scheduled to be released in October of 2026, but prison records state that her release date is now July 20, 2026. The new release date is more than three months shy of two years. Ellison’s attorneys declined to comment, but the early release can be attributed to the fact that Ellison was a star witness in the criminal trial against her ex-boyfriend, Sam Bankman-Fried. Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in federal prison and began his sentence in October. He was due for release in April of 2032, but now his release date, as listed on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, is March 1, 2031. This new date is over a year earlier than his initial release schedule. Salame’s attorneys have also not commented on the matter. However, a spokesperson of the Bureau of Prisons stated that incarcerated individuals could earn time off their sentences for good behavior under the 2018 First Step Act, according to a Business Insider report. Singh, who was arrested alongside the other executives, assisted the prosecution and testified against Bankman-Fried. He got no prison time. The infamous FTX implosion 2022 Before it went bankrupt, FTX was a leading crypto exchange globally, while its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), had achieved near superstar status, making waves even in political circles. The exchange platform was associated and endorsed by public figures and it was believed to be the gold standard for safe and secure cryptocurrency trading. The platform quickly collapsed in 2022 when users pulled their funds following rumors about FTX’s improper ties to Alameda Research. SBF was the CEO of FTX, and his girlfriend at the time, Caroline Ellison, led Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund founded by Bankman-Fried before the creation of FTX. After the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried, his girlfriend Caroline Ellison, Ryan Salame and Nishad Singh were all promptly arrested on criminal fraud charges. The mastermind behind the operation, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The prison records currently have no date listed for his release.

This marks a significant drop from its November 22 peak of $0.000053. Open interest in BONK has also fallen to $8.32 million, the lowest in three months, as traders shift their focus to other assets. Despite these setbacks, BONK remains a low-cost token with a strong community and hopes of regaining its top spot in the meme token market . Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 Massive Token Burn to Revive Interest In a big move to boost its value, Bonk DAO burned 1.69 trillion tokens, reducing the total supply from 100 trillion to 91 trillion. This burn, worth over $52 million, was approved by 99% of the community and completed in a single Solana transaction. The burn was part of BONK’s second-anniversary celebration, aiming to reduce supply and make the token more valuable. Community Participation The token burn campaign, which ran from November 15 to December 25, involved the community through social media activities and collaborations with ecosystem partners. Bonk DAO’s wallet still holds 9% of the total supply, making it the largest holder, even surpassing Binance. Additionally, 4.8% of the supply is locked in staking pools, further limiting the number of tokens in circulation. Challenges and Competition Despite this significant token burn, BONK’s price has not seen a major rally. Newer Solana meme tokens like Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU and DogWifHat (WIF) are gaining popularity . PENGU, with a market cap of $2.4 billion, has surpassed BONK as the leading Solana meme token .

XRP’s price has remained above the $2 region despite the bear’s attempts to push it to former lows. Despite a sharp dip on Friday, when the price dipped below the $2 level, sending FUD among investors, XRP still enjoys an over 40% monthly surge. Similarly, Tron has steadily risen, aiming to surpass $1 by 2025. Tron price movement has already recorded a monthly surge of over 13% with a YTD of 135%. Like Ripple and Tron, Lunex Network is also eying impressive gains, increasing 300% to hit the $0.0048 price target. This remarkable gain has been attributed to the project’s unique features, which include a no-KYC check. Lunex Network’s No KYC Requirement Lures More Investors Lunex Network is set to disrupt the DeFi market with a no-KYC check approach to decentralized finance. Unlike most projects associated with invasive KYC policies, Lunex Network aims to provide users with the best level of privacy, allowing them to stake, trade, and manage their assets efficiently. This unique approach will help simplify the Lunex onboarding process while making the DeFi space more open and diverse. Lunex Network also elevates users’ experiences with cross-chain solutions, allowing them to swap over 50K tokens across 40-plus blockchains. This unique feature allows users to carry out transactions quickly and at a lower cost than other platforms. Currently, the LNEX token is priced at $0.0048, a significant rally from its starting price of just $0.0012. The project has collected over $5.5M in presale revenue and is targeting $6M by the end of 2024. Its unique features, including anonymity, decentralization, and security, place it in a better position to gain more in Q1 of 2025. Ripple Bulls Outshine The Bears Ripple’s bulls managed to overcome the bears, forcing a reversal in XRP’s price . This move confirms Ripple’s strong support, which could increase its price. Its relative strength index is also above the midline, meaning the bulls are still in charge. Additionally, the debut of XRP’s anticipated RLUSD stablecoin added fuel to the crypto’s price movement. Ripple is also in talks with Bitstamp about plans to build a derivatives exchange on Ripple’s Ledger, which might boost XRP’s price in 2025. The Fibonacci retracement levels of 0.382, 0.5, and 0.618 are also critical in identifying XRP’s resistance and support levels during its correction period. A breakout above its triangle pattern could signal bullish momentum, targeting previous highs. According to CryptoFayZ ’s price prediction for XRP, the token’s bullish breakout might see it hit $5 soon. Tron Hits Record Revenue While Eying the $1 Milestone by 2025 Tron recorded $21.66M in revenue on December 3, 2024. This impressive accomplishment led to widespread attention, boosting the demand for Tron. The growth of altcoin, hovering within the $0.24 region , has been remarkable. Since Tron’s launch in 2017, when the RTX token was priced at just $0.0019 during presale, the altcoin has already delivered exceptional returns. This unique performance highlights the transformative opportunities that early investments in cryptocurrency can offer. Its technical indicators including the relative strength index at 47, however, point to a neutral position. Despite this, its growing adoption and network developments could help Tron’s price achieve a $1 milestone in 2025. Its impressive performance and increasing revenue streams position Tron’s future in the positive, making it a standout option for investors seeking massive returns in 2025. Will LNEX Match Ripple and Tron Price Movements? Ripple and Tron are among the top altcoins with the unique ability to record significant growth in 2025. Nonetheless, Lunex Network’s no-KYC feature and unique cross-chain swap feature put it in a better position to enjoy more substantial gains and attract more investors while eying the $1 region.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 05:53:00

Experts Warn of Major Crash,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-to-crash-hard-to-60k-experts-warn-of-major-crash/,"The post Bitcoin Price To Crash Hard To $60K! Experts Warn of Major Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has been struggling recently, experiencing a noticeable decline over the past two weeks. As BTC dropped to $95,120 , the crypto enthusiast is in fear of a massive crash ahead. A prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that several prominent figures in the crypto industry have warned that Bitcoin’s price could potentially fall to $60K. Drop Below $95K Could Trigger Crash Ali Martinez highlights a prediction from Tone Vays, a well-respected figure in the crypto space. Vays warns that if Bitcoin’s price falls below $95,000, it could set the stage for a sharp correction down to around $73,000. Some investors are already preparing for this possibility. In fact, over the past week, more than 33,000 Bitcoins , worth around $3.23 billion, were moved to exchanges, suggesting that traders are preparing for further decline. A Repeat of the 2018 Crash? Another notable figure mentioned by Martinez is Peter Brant, a veteran trader who famously predicted the Bitcoin crash in 2018. Brant has voiced concerns that Bitcoin might break below a key technical pattern, the expanding triangle, which could lead to a drop to around $70,000. Hey trolls — this is not a prediction. Just always pointing out possibilities, not probabilities, not certainties. No screen shot is necessary $BTCA right angled broadening triangle could project back into the 70s and a test of the parabolic modality pic.twitter.com/n5sy6DxAMb — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 20, 2024 Interestingly, on December 23rd alone, Bitcoin saw over $7.1 billion in realized profits, which could indicate that many traders are capitalizing on the current volatility. Could Bitcoin Hit $60,000? Martinez also brings up predictions from Mark Newton, Managing Director at Fundstrat, and analyst Benjamin Cohen. Both have expressed concerns that Bitcoin’s price could eventually fall to the $60,000 range. Cohen suggests Bitcoin’s price could follow a similar path to other assets like the QQQ, which could result in a crash around the time of political events, such as on Donald Trump’s presidential oath days. Yet, Bullish Hope for Bitcoin! Despite the bearish predictions, out that Bitcoin recently broke a key support level at $97,300. For the bearish outlook to be avoided, Bitcoin would need to rise above this level and stay above $100,000. If this happens, Bitcoin could see a new rise, with some experts predicting prices could reach $168,500. Amidst fears of a crypto crash, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index remains in the “Greed” zone at 74. This suggests that some traders are still hopeful and believe Bitcoin could experience a massive breakout soon.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 05:56:56

As one of the most established crypto trading platforms, HTX has consistently strived for breakthroughs, leading the industry development with premium products and services. The futures business has been a key focus for the platform this year. Through sustained efforts, HTX has achieved significant progress in this domain. Data shows that the platform’s total futures trading volume in 2024 has reached approximately $900 billion so far, representing a 70% increase compared to 2023. Additionally, the scale of futures trading exhibited a steady month-over-month growth trend. The success stems from two factors. On the one hand, HTX’s team has stayed ahead by closely following the latest market trends and hotspots, continually expanding its asset map. Over the year, the platform listed more than 80 new futures trading assets, with nearly 70 of them experiencing growth rates exceeding 200%. By December 2024, HTX had supported over 160 futures trading assets, providing users with a diverse range of trading options. On the other hand, HTX’s proactive optimization and bold innovations in futures products have played a pivotal role in its growth. Notably, the introduction of its exclusive product, “SmartEarn,” has redefined industry standards while presenting users with unique revenue opportunities. SmartEarn Draws Over 260,000 Users, Becoming an Instant Hit SmartEarn, a pioneering Earn product created by HTX, officially launched on November 14. It enables users to earn a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) on the assets in their Futures account, regardless of whether they are holding a position or not. SmartEarn’s zero-threshold requirement, high flexibility, and high yield perfectly align with the needs of futures users, making it an instant success. As of December 26, just over a month since its launch, SmartEarn has attracted more than 260,000 users. Offering a 6% APY on funds in Futures accounts and the lowest funding rate for futures positions, SmartEarn empowers HTX’s futures business with a significant boost. The total futures trading volume has increased by 88% over the past 30 days, and the Q4 futures trading volume has surged by 50% compared to Q3. Users have also reaped significant benefits, with the highest individual earnings for SmartEarn users reaching up to 24,641 USDT. In addition to launching this groundbreaking product, HTX continues to enhance its existing features. In 2024, HTX completed more than 30 upgrades to its futures services, including TP/SL price protection and real-time position updates. In an effort to improve the user experience, HTX has launched 15 enhancements to its futures copy trading product, including the ability for users to follow multiple lead traders and optimize the trader ranking system. As of November 2024, the user base of HTX’s copy trading has experienced a remarkable growth of over 700% compared to the start of the year. Today, HTX Futures, powered by an outstanding user experience and with SmartEarn as its flagship product, have become a major player in the highly competitive field of crypto derivatives. Year-End Highlights: Three New Futures Products Scheduled for Successive Launches As 2024 winds down, HTX is still ramping up efforts to enhance user experiences. Right now, three new futures products have either gone live or are arriving soon. Zero-Cost Futures Position Event Recently, HTX launched the Zero-Cost Futures Position Event to offer newcomers an effortless entry into futures trading. This event offers free futures positions. By participating, users will receive predefined positions, including specific trading pairs, leverage, direction, and size. This allows them to get accustomed to futures trading mechanics and gain hands-on experience in a live trading environment. If a user’s position results in a profit, the gains will be credited as Futures Trial Bonuses to their Futures account, offering opportunities for future gains. However, losses in this position will not affect their account balance. Futures Grid HTX is set to upgrade its futures grid functionality by the end of December, offering users a smarter, strategy-based trading tool. This upgrade boosts capital efficiency while minimizing risk, making it well-suited for seizing opportunities in volatile markets. Once users set their futures grid parameters, the bot will handle the execution, freeing them from the need to monitor the tiny changes in the tickers. What’s even better, HTX charges no extra fees for this service. Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading Around Lunar New Year 2025, HTX will launch Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading, allowing traders to use multiple assets as collateral for trading the USDT-M futures. This new feature will provide a more convenient trading experience, especially for users trading futures with multiple assets. 2024 has seen HTX achieve impressive results in boosting the competitiveness of its futures products. The success of SmartEarn, coupled with the substantial growth in futures trading volume and the number of futures traders, stands as a testament to user recognition of HTX’s efforts. This recognition has been a key driver of HTX’s innovation. Looking ahead to 2025, HTX will continue to optimize its futures services and products, focusing on enhancing core trading functions and the copy trading section. More efforts will be made to increase liquidity, with a particular focus on strengthening the market depth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular cryptos to ensure a smoother trading experience. Furthermore, HTX will continue to drive the comprehensive development of its ecosystem. By delivering exceptional user experiences, generating wealth effects, implementing robust security strategies, and deploying cutting-edge technologies, the platform will solidify its leading position in the cryptocurrency industry. In 2025, HTX is poised to outperform expectations.

As a result, the large-cap altcoin, with a total valuation of about $406 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $23 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level. With the TOTAL2 having already retested the previous all-time high (ATH), around $1.6 trillion, Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards $5k soon. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been forming a macro reversal pattern, coupled with the bullish divergence on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). Ethereum Whales Prepares for Major Uproar With Bitcoin price having outperformed the majority of large and mid-cap altcoins in the past two years, whale crypto investors have been repositioning their portfolios in preparation for a parabolic altseason. Moreover, the Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI) and volume recently surged to a new ATH of above $23 billion. According to on-chain data analysis provided by Coinglass, the overall supply of Ethereum on centralized exchanges declined from 16.12 million on November 29, to hover about 15.3 million at the time of this writing. The notable decline of Ethereum on CEXes is majorly attributed to the rising demand from the U.S. spot Ether ETF issuers. Led by BlackRock’s ETHA, and Fidelity’s FETH, the US spot Ether ETF issuers have attracted more than $2.64 billion in cumulative total net inflow since inception, thus a total assets under management of about $12.01 billion. On Thursday, the US spot Ether ETFs registered net cash inflows of about $117 million and a total value traded of around $390 million. Meanwhile, on-chain data analysis shows a while investors withdrew 1,500 Ether, worth $5.21 million, from Binance in the last 24 hours. Ethereum rebounds from crucial support, setting the stage for a potential rally. Read Ethereum price prediction for the latest market insights! What Next? From a technical analysis standpoint, Ethereum price has rebounded from a falling logarithmic trend, which formed year-to-date, thus signaling potential bullish uproar in the near term.

Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/meme-index-memex-raises-450k-in-presale/,"The post Next Crypto to Explode? Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The festive season did wonders for Meme Index ($MEMEX) , as it smashed through the $450K milestone in its presale just after Christmas. Meme Index is a unique platform that offers the first-ever decentralized index for meme coins. Rather than just investing in a single token, Meme Index bundles numerous tokens into four baskets, each with a different risk and upside profile. Instead of betting on a single token, investors can choose an index—or multiple indexes—to determine how aggressive or conservative they’d like to be. The whole platform is built around its native $MEMEX governance token, which is currently live in presale. Currently, $MEMEX is priced at just $0.0146285, but it will increase within 48 hours when the next presale phase starts. A Strong Year for Meme Coins One of the biggest crypto trends of the year has been the rise of meme coins, with the sector collectively reaching a value of $137 billion at one point. Some of the hottest meme coins, like Pepe ($PEPE) and Mog Coin ($MOG), saw an over 1,200% upside in 2024 alone. There are also lesser-known projects like Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), which blew the market away with a 2,000% gain since November. While these successes are hard to ignore, they also reveal how volatile meme coins can be. That’s where the Meme Index comes in. It helps investors hedge their bets by diversifying risk into various coins rather than concentrating their investment on a single bet. One Governance Token for Four Indexes As we saw above, Meme Index has four indexes. $MEMEX holders govern all four indexes and any future updates. If a new meme coin takes off and the community wants to add it to an index, $MEMEX token holders can propose and vote on it. Each index has a different level of risk and upside. Investors can choose a level of risk that aligns with their objectives. For instance, the Titan Index concentrates on the top 10 meme coins with a market cap exceeding $1 billion (such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE). While it provides exposure to established meme coins, it still carries more volatility than standard large-cap cryptos. It could be the right choice if you want to avoid more obscure meme tokens. Conversely, the Moonshot Index features coins that are either listed or about to be listed on top exchanges but have yet to attain a $1 billion market cap. This is ideal for those who want to gain exposure to growing coins without investing too heavily in speculative projects. Next on the list is the Midcap Index . It includes meme coins with a market cap between $50 and $250 million. This tier can bring high reward potential if a token moves up to the next tier, though it comes with added volatility. The last one is the Meme Frenzy Index , a high-stakes basket of brand-new meme coins that may soar to the moon or crash to the ground in days. This option is suitable for high-risk-taking investors chasing exponential gains and certainly not for those playing safe. How to Buy $MEMEX With over $450,000 raised in the presale in just a few days, many early supporters are confident that the project can stand out in the meme coin space. Per the Meme Index whitepaper , the total supply of $MEMEX tokens is limited to 15 billion. The platform has allocated 15% of these tokens to early buyers for the ongoing presale. You can visit the official Meme Index presale page to buy $MEMEX. You can connect a compatible crypto wallet by clicking ‘Connect Wallet’ and pay with $USDT, $ETH, $BNB, or a credit card. Buyers can then directly stake these tokens via the Meme Index staking protocol . The APY is currently over 3,900%. Although this rate will decrease once more participants start staking, it offers an attractive option for $MEMEX holders who want to earn high passive rewards. It’s worth noting that security has been a top priority for Meme Index. It has audited its smart contracts by Coinsult and SolidProof, where both firms flagged no critical vulnerabilities. You can join the Meme Index community on Telegram and follow its X account to keep up with the latest news and project updates.

Thus, top market public-listed firms like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Coinbase, Semler Scientific, Metaplanet, and others would be part of this index. For its new Bitcoin ETF, the asset manager has set minimum criteria such as 1,000+ BTC holdings, and more. Here’s What Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Company ETF Will Offer Bitwise Asset Manager has announced a new Bitcoin ETF investment fund tracking companies that adopt the Bitcoin standard via corporate treasury holdings. In its filing prospectus, the firm said that the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in securities that comprise the index. This will include top Bitcoin holding companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR), Marathon Digital (MARA), Coinbase (COIN), Tesla (TSLA), Semler Scientific (SMLR) , Metaplanet (MTPLF) and others. However, to qualify for the inclusion in the index, the company has put some key criteria: Hold a minimum of 1,000 Bitcoins in their corporate treasury. Maintain a market capitalization of at least $100 million. Have a minimum average daily liquidity of $1 million. Maintain a public-free float of at least 10%. Below is the list of the companies that could be part of the new Bitcoin Standard Company ETF from Bitwise. Source: HODL15Capital Industry leaders have shown interest in being part of the new investment fund from Bitwise. Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel stated: ” I assume MARA would have to be included as we hold over 44,000 BTC in our treasury”. Similarly, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich also stated that his company would qualify for the new Bitcoin ETF adding: “Metaplanet is a Bitcoin standard company with at least 1000 BTC in its corporate treasury”. On the other hand, Semler Scientific CEO Eric Semler recently stated: “In the near future, I predict it will be considered IRRESPONSIBLE for public companies not to own Bitcoin on their balance sheets”. MicroStrategy Also Part of Bitcoin Bonds ETF In another development, Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive Asset Management has filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF with the US SEC. The ETF aims to provide exposure to “Bitcoin Bonds,” defined as convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies intending to allocate all or a substantial portion of the proceeds toward purchasing Bitcoin, as per the SEC filing . This development, amid the latest development from Bitwise, has further fueled market optimism. However, commenting on Strive Asset Management’s development, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated: “Vivek’s ETF company has filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF that will track (using swaps) convertible bonds issued for the purpose of buying Bitcoin- so essentially it’s a Microstrategy convertible bond ETF until other firms do the same”. Over the last four years, MicroStrategy has been raising funds through the issuance of equity and convertible bonds. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor called for a special shareholders meeting for voting on the company’s 21/21 plan, a proposal to secure $21 billion through equity financing and an additional $21 billion through bond issuance over the next three years, and further expand its Bitcoin holdings. Citing strong demand for Bitcoin in the market, Bitwise remains confident that BTC and top altcoins like Ethereum, and Solana will hit fresh all-time highs in 2025.

38171839,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398639,1735281626,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,SpacePay’s Solution: A Deep Dive Into How 0.5% Fees Change Payment Economics,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/spacepays-solution-a-deep-dive-into-how-0-5-fees-change-payment-economics/,"The post SpacePay’s Solution: A Deep Dive Into How 0.5% Fees Change Payment Economics appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the payment processing sector, fees might seem like small percentages, but their impact on business profits is high. Traditional credit card processors charge merchants between 2.5% and 3.5% per transaction, meaning a store making $10,000 monthly loses up to $350 just in processing fees. SpacePay fundamentally changes this equation with its 0.5% fee structure, allowing merchants to keep more of their earnings while still maintaining profitable platform operations. As presale funding approaches $1 million with tokens at $0.002441, this sustainable economic model attracts both businesses and investors. To understand how SpacePay achieves this balance, think of traditional payment processing like a relay race where each runner (intermediary) takes a portion of the fee. A typical credit card payment passes through six different entities, each adding their costs to the final fee. SpacePay’s technology creates a direct path between customer and merchant, similar to replacing that relay race with a single sprinter. Why Traditional Payment Fees Hurt Business Growth Traditional payment processing creates a complex chain of fees that steadily erodes business profits. Let’s examine a typical credit card transaction: When a customer pays $100, the merchant doesn’t receive $100. Instead, they lose between $2.50 and $3.50 to various processing fees. This might not sound big for a single purchase, but consider how these fees compound over thousands of transactions. To fully understand this impact, imagine a busy coffee shop serving 200 customers daily with an average purchase of $5. With traditional payment processors charging 3%, the shop loses $0.15 on each transaction. Across 200 daily customers, that’s $30 lost to fees every day. Over a month, these fees consume $900 of potential profit – enough to cover utility bills or employee wages. The problem extends beyond visible fees. Traditional payment systems often include hidden costs that further reduce profits. Monthly terminal rental fees typically range from $30-$100 per device. Then there are PCI compliance fees, statement fees, and minimum processing fees. A single store might pay over $1,500 annually just in equipment and maintenance costs before counting per-transaction fees. How SpacePay Creates Sustainable Payment Economics SpacePay’s 0.5% fee structure works because of smart technological design. Consider the same coffee shop from our previous example, now using SpacePay. With 200 daily customers spending $5 each, the shop pays just $0.025 in fees per transaction. This reduces their daily fee cost from $30 to only $5, saving $25 every business day. Over a month, these savings add up to $750 that stays in the business rather than going to payment processors. The revenue distribution model shows how SpacePay maintains profitability while charging lower fees. From each 0.5% transaction fee, the platform allocates portions to different essential functions. Part of the fee supports technical operations and security. Another portion funds the revenue sharing program for token holders. The remaining amount goes toward platform development and growth. This careful distribution ensures every participant in the ecosystem benefits while keeping fees low for merchants. Let’s examine how this works in practice using a retail store example. A clothing store processing $20,000 monthly in traditional card payments currently loses $600-700 in fees. Switching to SpacePay reduces these fees to just $100, saving $500-600 monthly. These savings compound even further because SpacePay eliminates terminal rental fees and other hidden charges. The store can reinvest these savings into inventory, marketing, or staff wages. The platform achieves this efficiency through automated processes. Unlike traditional systems that require multiple intermediaries, SpacePay’s technology handles verification, conversion, and settlement in one seamless operation. This streamlined approach reduces operating costs while maintaining security and speed, proving that efficient technology can make lower fees sustainable for everyone involved. SpacePay’s Major Achievements SpacePay’s success starts with strong private investment backing. The platform secured $750,000 from private investors who recognized its potential to transform payment processing. This early funding provided the foundation for building a secure, efficient payment system. The platform’s technical readiness demonstrates another milestone. SpacePay completed its Minimum Viable Product (MVP), proving the technology works effectively in real-world conditions. The successful development of the payment processing system, merchant dashboard, and security features shows how SpacePay turns its vision into working solutions. Industry recognition came through the “New Payment Platform of the Year” award at the CorporateLiveWire Global Awards 2022/23. This award validates SpacePay’s innovative approach to solving payment challenges. The combination of low fees, instant settlements, and merchant protection caught the attention of payment industry experts. Building Economic Value Through Community SpacePay’s approach to value creation extends beyond simple fee savings. The platform’s presale success, now approaching $1 million with tokens at $0.002441 , demonstrates how combining payment efficiency with community benefits creates lasting economic value. Think of it as building a financial ecosystem where every participant – from small merchants to token holders – contributes to and benefits from the network’s growth. The revenue sharing program shows this collaborative economics. When merchants process payments through SpacePay, a portion of the 0.5% fee flows back to token holders. To understand how this works, consider a network processing $1 million daily in transactions. The total fees would generate $5,000 daily, with a major portion distributed among the community. This creates a direct link between platform usage and token holder rewards, encouraging everyone to support network growth. The upcoming staking program adds another layer of economic benefit. Token holders who stake their SPY tokens will earn regular rewards from platform activity. Participating in this economic ecosystem starts at SpacePay’s website. New investors can join using various cryptocurrencies (USDT, AVAX, BASE, MATIC, ETH, BNB) or bank cards. The investment process follows clear steps: Visit the official website Connect your crypto wallet Choose your payment method Enter your investment amount Complete the transaction As SpacePay moves toward exchange listings, early supporters gain ground-floor access to a platform that’s changing payment economics.

The pullback from the levels above $98,000 can be treated as a major setback, as this revives the possibility of a yearly close below the $100K milestone. With this, the market participants could become less optimistic in 2025, which may delay the revival of a strong ascending trend, targeting a new ATH above $110K. Bitcoin bulls have pushed the price above $96,000 as the selling volume exhausted to a large extent. Regardless of this, the price is stuck close to the crucial support at $96,071, which keeps the bearish possibilities alive. However, the token remains within the bullish range, with a major support level of around $95,850, where a massive sell-wall has been built. As per the data shared by popular analyst Ali , nearly 822 BTC may be liquidated if the price hits $95,850. Hence, if the price hits this level, there is a possibility of a huge pullback as the sell orders of 822 BTC could be processed. However, there are huge sell orders above the levels between $96,100 and $95,900 where more than 100 BTC are feared to be liquidated at each price range. This suggests the Bitcoin price rally continues to trade within the bearish range, as a minor plunge may trigger a huge sell-off. What’s next? Will BTC price rebound and close the yearly trade above $100K or remain consolidated below the range? The short-term price action of Bitcoin suggests neither bulls nor bears are possessing the required strength as the price remains stuck within a range. However, the technicals suggest a quick surge in the price could occur anytime from now. The stochastic RSI is trading within the oversold range and has been trying to validate a rebound. However, the possibility of a bullish crossover remains distinct as the levels are about to undergo a bearish crossover, suggesting some more price drain before the next price action. Meanwhile, the MACD suggests a drop in the selling pressure, hence suggesting a potential trend reversal. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is expected to remain consolidated below $100K until the end of the year, which may attract a significant buying volume in 2025.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 06:42:08

His analysis comes following XRP’s historic surge to a multi-year high. The asset is currently consolidating, trading at $2.29. The digital asset experienced massive growth in November 2024, achieving a remarkable increase of almost 300% following the United States presidential election results on November 5th, when Donald Trump secured victory. This surge culminated in XRP almost reaching $2.90 on December 5th, establishing its highest valuation since 2018. Despite the current market correction and price stabilization, Ramos maintains an optimistic outlook. I know – XRP RIPPLE HOLDERS WILL GET RICH – My take, my urgency, the plan – DO IT before $3 $XRP pic.twitter.com/B0TZN1xozp — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) December 23, 2024 XRP’s Building Up For Something Big Ramos interprets the present consolidation phase, particularly during the December holiday, as a strategic accumulation opportunity. He attributes the current market stability to reduced trading activity during Christmas, as market participants temporarily shift their focus to seasonal celebrations. When evaluating potential catalysts for XRP’s next significant price movement, Ramos emphasizes the expanding institutional presence in cryptocurrency markets. He references MicroStrategy’s acquisition of 5,262 Bitcoin, valued at $561 million, as evidence of growing institutional confidence in digital assets. According to Ramos, this institutional momentum could generate increased attention across the cryptocurrency sector, potentially benefiting XRP. Ramos also highlights several specific developments that could drive XRP’s value appreciation. Among these factors, the prospective approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is particularly significant. Multiple companies are already pursuing ETF listings , and Ramos suggests that major financial institutions like BlackRock might explore similar initiatives. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Catalysts for XRP’s Growth Ramos also identified Ripple’s recent launch of RLUSD , its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, as another crucial development. This new financial instrument enhances the XRP ecosystem’s utility and could attract increased enterprise adoption. The analyst anticipates that RLUSD’s growing market presence might catalyze broader institutional and retail participation in the upcoming months. The broader cryptocurrency market context also supports Ramos’s positive outlook. Bitcoin’s surge in late November and early December sent it above $100,000 for the first time, and the broader market has experienced a massive rise, with a current market cap exceeding $3 trillion. Ramos anticipates the cryptocurrency market capitalization will reach $4 trillion, leading to new all-time highs. The overall outlook for the market is bullish, and many experts have big expectations for XRP in 2025. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Meanwhile, Japan's economic data presented a mixed outlook: retail sales growth accelerated, industrial production contracted, and the jobless rate remained steady.

India ( SENSEX ) rose +0.47% to 78,998 in morning trade on Friday, after being flat the day before, mainly supported by gains in auto, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare sectors. A statement from the government lifted sentiment, as India's economy is expected to grow at around 6.5% in FY 2024/25 despite a challenging environment. The forecasts are close to the lower end of its 6.5%-7% projection, as global uncertainties pose a dampening threat. Australia ( AS51 ) rose +0.50% to finish at 8,262 on Friday, reaching its highest level in over a week and gaining for the 3rd straight session, supported by gains in consumer discretionary, energy, and materials after the Christmas break.

Institutional Bitcoin Bulls Line Up!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitwise-files-for-new-bitcoin-etf-institutional-bitcoin-bulls-line-up/,"A new move came from Bitwise, a giant company that has spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. Accordingly, Bitwise has made a new application to track the stocks of companies that hold at least 1K BTC. Bitwise reported that it has filed an application with the US SEC for a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which aims to track the stock performance of companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. At this point, the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in companies that hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin. To be included in Bitwise’s ETF, companies holding Bitcoin must also have a market capitalization of at least $100 million, average daily liquidity of at least $1 million, and a free float ratio of less than 10 percent. ETF Store president Nate Feraci shared a table on his X account showing which companies hold more than 1,000 BTC. According to this table, MicroStrategy ranked first, followed by Marathon Digital, Riot, Hut8, Tesla and Coinbase. Accordingly, companies on this list will be included in Bitwise's new Bitcoin Standard Company ETF. As the cryptocurrency sector shows interest in being part of Bitwise’s new ETF, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel said: “I think MARA will need to be included as we hold over 44,000 BTC in our treasury.” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich also stated that his company would be eligible for the new Bitcoin ETF, saying, “Metaplanet is a Bitcoin-standard company with at least 1000 BTC in its corporate treasury.” Companies holding > 1,000 btc… via @HODL15Capital h/t @Roubini18 pic.twitter.com/E91ky56iEI — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 27, 2024 *This is not investment advice.

While bulls are trying to defend the crucial support of $95,000, on-chain data and market analysts show that chances of a BTC price crash to $60,000 by Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 19, are much higher. On-Chain Data Flashes Bitcoin Price Crash Signals Following the rally to $100K levels, the Bitcoin selling pressure intensified pushing the BTC price all the way to $95,000 once again. On-chain data also shows weakness, as there is not enough ammunition for Bitcoin price to continue the rally. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that Bitcoin’s critical support zone now lies between $97,041 and $93,806. He also warned that if Bitcoin fails to hold this demand area, it could see a sharp decline to $70,085. Source: Ali Charts Exchange Reserve Surge Puts Pressure on Bitcoin Price Another concerning matter has been the BTC exchange reserves, which have soared amid the Bitcoin price surge to its all-time high of $100K. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reports that savvy investors seem to be preparing for a potential bearish scenario. Over the past week, more than 33,000 Bitcoin, valued at over $3.23 billion, have been transferred to exchanges. This movement suggests heightened caution and possible selling pressure in the market. Source: Ali Charts On the other hand, profit booking for BTC has also surged over the past week. On December 23, Bitcoin investors collectively realized over $7.17 billion in profits, highlighting significant market activity and profit-taking during the holiday period, reported Martinez. Additionally, derivatives data shows that traders aren’t quite optimistic about Bitcoin in the near term. The percentage of traders holding long positions on Bitcoin ($BTC) on Binance has declined sharply, falling from 66.73% to 53.60%. What Are The Chances Of BTC Reveral To Bullish Rally? On Christmas day, Bitcoin price breached a crucial support level at $97,300, where 1.51 million wallets collectively purchased approximately 1.49 million BTC, according to analyst Ali Martinez. For bearish sentiment to be overturned, Bitcoin must reclaim this significant support zone and, more importantly, achieve a daily close above the $100,000 mark. Martinez further added that if the Bitcoin bulls manage to sustain the $100K support, the BTC price can rally to $168,000 as per the Mayer Multiple. Source: Ali Charts However, BTC price today was 2.2% down and exchanged hands at $96,038. Its market cap stood at $1.9 trillion, and the 24-hour trading volume has shot up 24% all the way to $46 billion. The 24-hour liquidation stands at $55 million with $44 million being in long liquidation. Analysts Predict BTC Crash By Donald Trump Inauguration Several crypto market analysts predict further downside for Bitcoin if it loses the crucial support of $95,000. Crypto analyst Tone Vays has expressed concern over Bitcoin ($BTC) trading below the critical $95,000 level. Vays warns that such a move is “very, very bad,” as it significantly raises the likelihood of a correction toward $73,000. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has cautioned that Bitcoin price may be on the verge of breaking down from a “broadening triangle” pattern. If this occurs, Brandt suggests the price could experience a retracement toward the $70,000 zone. Source: Peter Brandt On the other hand, Fundstrat remains optimistic, projecting that Bitcoin price could reach $250,000 by 2025. However, according to market expert Mark Newton, a pullback to $60,000 may occur before that surge. Finally, Benjamin Cowen from IntoTheCryptoVerse, speculates that Bitcoin (BTC) may follow a similar price pattern to the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). If this occurs, a flash crash to $60,000 could take place around the inauguration of Donald Trump. As BTC faces chances of a crash, investors are turning bullish on altcoins . Crypto market analysts believe that the altcoin season isn’t over and that altcoins could see a strong recovery from now onwards. Although, many investors might seem to have given up the hope, the recovery in altcoins could be stronger.

While high-profile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate the market, there are numerous lesser-known, low-cost tokens that could yield impressive profits in the coming years. With the right mix of technology, strong community support, and innovative solutions, these cryptocurrencies present exciting opportunities for investors who are willing to take a calculated risk. Among these promising projects is Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain platform combining artificial intelligence with decentralized networks. Currently in its presale at just $0.003 , Lightchain AI offers an affordable entry point for early investors. With a solid roadmap and growing interest from the crypto community, Lightchain AI could be one of the top picks for 2025, providing the chance to turn small investments into substantial fortunes as it gains traction in the rapidly evolving AI and blockchain sectors. Why Afforadable Cryptos Matter for Investors Affordable cryptocurrencies offer an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially maximize profits. While high-priced coins like Bitcoin may have large potential returns, their high cost of entry can deter smaller investors from getting involved. This is where affordable cryptos come into play – they provide a lower barrier to entry, allowing everyday investors to get in on the ground floor of promising projects with huge growth potential. Additionally, investing in affordable cryptos allows for greater risk management. High-priced coins are often subject to extreme volatility, making it difficult for investors to manage their risk exposure. Lower-priced tokens tend to be less volatile and can help balance out a portfolio by reducing overall risk. What to Look for in Affordable Cryptos When considering affordable cryptocurrencies, it’s important to do thorough research and look for key indicators of potential success. Here are a few factors to consider when evaluating these tokens Technology: Look for projects with innovative technology that solves real-world problems or disrupts traditional industries. A strong technological foundation can help a crypto gain traction and attract investors. Community support: The strength and engagement of a project’s community can play a significant role in its success. Keep an eye out for active communication channels, supportive communities, and a dedicated team working towards the project’s goals. Roadmap: A clear roadmap outlining the milestones and goals of a project is crucial in determining its potential growth. A project with a well-defined roadmap and achievable goals is more likely to attract investors and see success. Lightchain AI Affordable and Promising Top Pick For 2025 Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a top pick for 2025, offering an affordable investment opportunity with its presale token priced at just $0.003. By combining artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI aims to solve scalability, security, and efficiency issues faced by traditional blockchain networks. Its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, enhancing network performance. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables real-time analytics and decentralized AI model training directly on the blockchain. With a solid roadmap that includes key milestones like the testnet and mainnet launches in 2025, Lightchain AI is positioned for substantial growth. This innovative project offers a promising entry point for investors seeking exposure to both the AI and blockchain industries, making it one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space.

The Crypto AI sector could experience a bullish trend this year due to the rapid adoption of its technology. On the other hand, the meme narrative, despite lacking substantial innovation, continues to make waves in the cryptocurrency realm. Here are the top 10 AI-based altcoins with the potential to skyrocket in 2025. This selection is based on strong technical indicators and the bullish price action of these AI tokens. Let’s get started: Bitttensor (TAO) Bittensor is one of the top AI-based tokens currently struggling to gain momentum, similar to major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. However, over the longer time frame, TAO appears to be trading within a range of $432 to $702. Amid market uncertainty, the TAO price has reached the lower boundary of this range, signaling a potential upside rally in the coming days. Source: Trading View Additionally, TAO appears to be forming a bullish double-bottom price action pattern on its weekly time frame. After forming its first bottom in November 2024, the token recently formed its second bottom. Based on its recent price action, if TAO sustains above the $430 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 52% to reach the $720 mark in the future. This bullish price action on the weekly time frame positions TAO as a top AI-based altcoin. Near Protocol (NEAR) Following the presidential election results in the United States, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged by over 125%, rising from $3.60 to $8.05. However, due to market uncertainty and profit-taking, the price has corrected by 37%, reaching the crucial Golden Fibonacci zone while also finding support at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, NEAR’s current daily chart indicates a strong buying opportunity with a 1:8 risk-to-reward ratio. If NEAR maintains support above the $4.80 mark, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 57% to reach $8.11 in the coming days. The Graph (GRT) Similar to NEAR, The Graph (GRT) has also experienced a notable price decline and has now reached the Golden Fibonacci zone, making it an ideal investment for 2025. However, due to market uncertainty, GRT appears to be consolidating within a tight range. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that the token could soar by 66% in the coming days. This bullish thesis will hold only if GRT remains above the $0.20 mark; otherwise, this bullish outlook may fail. Render Network (RENDER) Render Network (RENDER) currently appears to be consolidating within a tight range near strong support provided by the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the crucial horizontal level of $6.80. Source: Trading View Additionally, RENDER’s price action pattern shows similarities to TAO and GRT. Based on recent price action, if RENDER maintains support above the $6.70 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 60% to reach $11.60 in the future. Internet Computer (ICP) Amid market uncertainty, ICP, the native token of Internet Computer, experienced a price decline of over 35% and found support at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the horizontal level of $9.50. However, the ICP price now appears to be recovering. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ICP could rally by 45% to reach the $15.30 level in the coming days. This bullish thesis will hold only if ICP remains above the $9.50 mark; otherwise, it may fail. Artificial Super Intelligence (FET) During the ongoing price correction phase, the top AI-based altcoin, Artificial Super Intelligence (FET), appears to have recovered after experiencing a price decline of over 45% in recent weeks. Following this notable drop, FET has reached a crucial support level at the $1.14 mark, which has historically served as a strong support zone and an area of significant buying pressure. Source: Trading View Since September 2024, FET has tested this level four times, and each time it has rebounded with buying pressure and upward momentum. Experts and analysts anticipate a similar rally. Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that FET could soar by 69% to reach the $2.05 mark in the future. This bullish price action cements FET’s position as a top AI-based altcoin. Theta Network (THETA) THETA, the native token of Theta Network, is poised for significant upside momentum as it has formed a bullish price action pattern on its daily time frame. The altcoin saw substantial gains in November 2024 but has experienced a price decline of over 35% since the beginning of December 2024. Source: Trading View This decline has resulted in the formation of a descending triangle pattern on the daily time frame, and THETA is now on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical price momentum, if THETA breaks out of the pattern and closes a daily candle above the $2.41 mark, it could rally by 40% to reach $3.32 in the future. Unlike meme coins, THETA stands out as one of the top AI-based altcoins with the potential to skyrocket in 2025. Filecoin (FIL) Filecoin (FIL) is one of the top AI-based crypto projects that has been consistently attracting attention from crypto enthusiasts, not only for its performance but also for its blockchain-based storage solution. Amid a recent price decline, FIL has experienced a drop of over 40%. Source: Trading View However, the price has recently found support at a crucial level of $4.90 and the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Additionally, FIL has paused its continuous decline at the 61.8% Golden Fibonacci zone. Based on the recent price action and these bullish factors, there is a strong possibility that FIL could soar by 65% to reach the $8.20 mark in the future. AIOZ Network (AIOZ) AIOZ, the native token of the AIOZ network, has gained significant attention from crypto enthusiasts following its impressive 240% upside rally last month. Source: Trading View However, as market sentiment shifted, it experienced a price decline of over 38% and is currently testing a strong support level of around $0.83. Based on recent price action, if AIOZ holds this support level, it could rally by 50% to reach the $1.30 mark in the future. Injective (INJ) Amid the recent price correction, INJ, the native token of Injective, has experienced a significant price decline of over 40% and has reached a crucial support trendline that it has been following since August 2024. Historically, whenever the asset reaches this support level, it experiences buying pressure and upward momentum. Source: Trading View Experts and analysts are expecting a similar price rally this time. Based on recent price action, if INJ holds above the $20 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 61% in the coming days. These top AI-based altcoins, supported by strong technical analysis and market activity, hold the potential for notable gains in 2025, beyond the predicted.

Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 But is the market overhyping the targets what is the realistic target BTC can hit in the upcoming bull market, let’s get the insights from analysts. Dan’s Bitcoin Prediction 2025 Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera Capital, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $117,000 by August 2025. He bases this forecast on Bitcoin’s historical price movements around its halving events, which happen every four years. The halving reduces the reward for miners, and Morehead points out that Bitcoin’s price usually starts rising about 400 days before the halving and peaks around 480 days after the event. The last halving took place in April 2024, cutting the reward for miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Morehead believes that Bitcoin’s price will follow this pattern and climb to $117,000, which would represent a 22.53% increase from its current price of $95,484. Macro Factors Can’t Be Ruled Out… In addition to the halving effect, Morehead also factors in macroeconomic conditions and political developments that could help drive Bitcoin’s price higher. He expects these factors to contribute to Bitcoin’s potential growth and help it reach the target of $117,000 by mid-2025. Morehead’s prediction comes during a time when Bitcoin is already showing strong growth, and many investors are watching the halving closely for signs of a continued bull market. If Bitcoin follows its historical trend, the coming months could see significant price gains as it heads toward its next peak. Other Bold Predictions: Could Bitcoin Hit $500K? Pantera’s optimistic outlook echoes other ambitious predictions. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, recently speculated that Bitcoin could soar to $500,000 if Donald Trump implements his plan to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile. This proposal, revealed at the Bitcoin Conference earlier this year, has sparked widespread interest, with some suggesting that other countries might follow the U.S. lead. With Japan’s rejection of the Bitcoin Reserve plan, it will be a good opportunity for the US to take the first mover advantage to become the Bitcoin leader globally. Even Perianne Boring, Digital Chamber CEO also said that Bitcoin will hit $800,000 under Trump’s leadership. With Bitcoins rising trend, analysts see these short-term dips as a great opportunity to enter the market like Microstrategy is doing right now. But you need to be careful as experts also believe in a market crash possibility if Trump’s policies get delayed due to political differences.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 07:00:46

Bitcoin (BTC), a major player in the crypto world, has seen its price fall to $96,200 recently . Amidst this price drop, many are asking: where is Bitcoin headed next? As 2025 approaches, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, has made a bold prediction: Bitcoin could skyrocket to $200,000 before ever dropping back to $50,000. Bitcoin To Hit $200K By 2025 In a recent interview with CNBC , Tom Lee shared an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin. He predicts that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 in 2025, driven by several key factors. Lee pointed to the changing U.S. political landscape and the potential for the government to accumulate Bitcoin as important catalysts for growth. He believes these developments show that Bitcoin is becoming a legitimate alternative to traditional stores of value like gold. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Here’s When Bitcoin Price Will Hit $117,000 , Lee further noted that many people are considering adding Bitcoin to their retirement portfolios, which could increase demand significantly. Lee didn’t stop at Bitcoin. He also expects altcoins to experience a major surge. He forecasted that Ethereum’s price could rise to between $5,000 and $6,000, while Solana and other promising altcoins might also see big gains during this market rally. Bitcoin As a Strategic Reserve Lee also mentioned that under the leadership of President Donald Trump, bitcoin will soon become a Strategic Reserve. These changes, he believes, will provide the necessary environment for Bitcoin to reach new heights. Will Bitcoin Ever Drop Back to $50K? While there are always risks in any market, Lee is confident that Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise. He argues that the $50,000 price range may be behind us, as Bitcoin continues to gain more support from institutions and governments. Meanwhile, Lee predicts that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 before it ever sees a major downturn. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It’s a market filled with excitement, community power, and yes, massive volatility! Whether you’re in it for the fun or eyeing some quick gains, there’s always a meme coin that’s caught your attention. But hey, if you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join for short-term gains, you’re in the right place. With so many new players entering the scene, it’s a tough choice. But, there’s one coin that’s standing out right now — BTFD Coin. The presale has been nothing short of amazing (raising over $4.5 million so far), and here’s the kicker — there’s a 50% offer going on right now! Thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can snag more BTFD tokens at today’s price. And what better time than now, as we’re drawing inspiration from the 1973 oil market crash, which left its mark on the financial world and gave birth to many opportunities. Let’s dive into the coins that could potentially bring those short-term gains you’re after — from BTFD Coin to Bonk’s ‘BURNmas’ to the SPX6900 dip. BTFD Coin: The December Star BTFD Coin is proving to be the star of the show in 2024, and it’s not just about the memes. It’s all about community, staking rewards, and a super fun Play-to-Earn game . If you’ve ever thought that meme coins were just about a viral moment and didn’t have any real potential, think again. BTFD Coin is the meme coin that’s about to flip the script on what you can expect from this genre. With features like high-stakes APY and a game that rewards players with BTFD tokens, this is one meme coin that’ll keep on giving. But here’s the cool part: It’s still in presale, which means you’ve got the chance to get in early at a super-low price. And thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can take advantage of 50% additional tokens on your BTFD purchases. Back in 1973, the oil market saw a massive downturn, but that didn’t stop savvy investors from jumping on opportunities — and that’s exactly what you can do now with BTFD Coin. The market crash birthed investment opportunities that left many with great returns, and this is the 1973 mindset — buy the dip, and watch your rewards grow. If you decide to invest $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’ll snag yourself 7,692,307 $BTFD tokens. But wait—here’s where it gets even better: by using the BIG50 code, you’ll get 50% more tokens! That’s an additional 3,846,153 tokens, bringing your total to 11,538,460 $BTFD tokens for your $1,000 investment. Now, let’s talk about future potential. If the price of BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 (which analysts are eyeing as a reasonable target), your $1,000 investment could grow to $6,923. Bonk’s ‘BURNmas’: A Community-Driven Event with Big Potential BonkDAO, the meme coin that’s had crypto enthusiasts on their toes for a while now, is making waves again. This time, it’s with an event called ‘BURNmas’, where BonkDAO has announced plans to burn 1.69 trillion BONK tokens — worth around $54.52 million. Yes, you read that right. This move aims to reduce the circulating supply, making the token more scarce, and possibly influencing the market dynamics. So, what does that mean for BONK? Well, burning such a large portion of tokens could lead to a short-term price surge. And history tells us that when BonkDAO executed a similar burn back in July 2024, the price jumped by 25% in just a day. For those looking for the best new meme coins to join for short-term gains, Bonk could be the one to keep an eye on. At the time of writing, Bonk is trading at $0.0000330, but with the BURNmas event in the pipeline, it might just give investors a chance to snag some gains. As always, it’s important to keep an eye on the market for any fluctuations or surprises. SPX6900: A 5% Dip in the Market, But Is It Just a Temp Blip? SPX6900, another meme coin on the radar, has been feeling the heat lately with a 5% dip over the last 24 hours. The price is sitting at $0.799299, with a market cap of $744 million.

The report indicates that there was a 40% annual rise in the number of cyber attacks in 2024 compared to 2023, with 165 incidents costing $2.3 billion in damages. The sum was still down 37% from the fraud peak in 2022, but complex schemes and breaches surged this year. Access control breaches made up most of that damage, with 67 incidents totaling $1.9 billion. Other attack vectors included smart contract vulnerabilities, leading to losses of $456.8 million over 98 incidents, and address poisoning assaults, resulting in $68.7 million in a single major case. These attack methods demonstrate the loopholes in blockchain networks and decentralized applications that scammers still take advantage of.

Cyvers cited the blockchain’s ease of access as a key factor in the fraudulent schemes, which they said allowed scammers to send over 100,000 small inducement payments to victims as part of their grooming methods. 🚨 $3.6 Billion Stolen in 2024’s Pig Butchering Scams 🐷This year saw the crypto world rocked by pig butchering scams, which swindled unsuspecting users out of a jaw-dropping $3.6 billion—most of it on Ethereum.

Like this, these incidents unveil the recurring vulnerabilities of many crypto exchanges. Recovery However, even in the face of these losses, some progress was made in the rehabilitation effort. In 2024, approximately $1.3 billion was returned to victims, primarily on-chain detectives like ZachXBT and bug bounty programs. The first quarter of 2024 had the highest number of incidences of any quarter in the year, at 53, the study noted. The largest amount, roughly $760 million, was lost in Q3 2024, while Q4 exhibited the lowest activity and losses.

In a Dec. 26 regulatory filing , Bitwise said the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in equity securities of publicly traded firms that have adopted the “Bitcoin standard” by holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in their corporate treasuries. These securities include “common stock, depositary receipts (both American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”), tracking stocks and other equity units. Such securities may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies including companies operating in emerging market countries,” the filing noted. To qualify for inclusion, companies must have at least $100 million in market capitalization, average daily liquidity of at least $1 million, and a public free float of under 10%. These criteria will be assessed based on quarterly and annual corporate reports. In terms of weighting, the ETF will prioritize the market value of each company’s Bitcoin holdings rather than its overall market capitalization, which is typically the case with traditional equity ETFs.

For instance, Marathon Digital Holdings, with over 44,000 BTC in its reserves, will have a higher weighting in the ETF than Tesla, which holds 9,720 BTC, despite its significantly larger $1.42 trillion market capitalization compared to Marathon’s $6.55 billion. However, no stock will exceed a weighting of 25% in the fund to ensure diversification and prevent overexposure to any single company. Commenting on the filing, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, said that the ETF could see many companies vying for a spot in the index. Fuelled by Bitcoin’s performance this year, a wave of Wall Street-focused investment products has emerged, catering to the growing appetite among institutional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regulated and familiar financial vehicles. Bitwise, for instance, proposed a Bitcoin-Ethereum mixed crypto ETF to U.S. regulators. According to the Nov. 26 S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the ETF aims to provide balanced exposure between Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering investors a diversified approach to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. On Dec. 21, New York-based GraniteShares filed for a set of leveraged ETFs aimed at tracking prominent companies with significant crypto exposure, including Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy, and Robinhood. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Grayscale Investments filed to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an exchange-traded fund.

In a report published by Cyvers , a Web3 security company, it was revealed that these scams mainly tricked the Ethereum blockchain with 150,000 wallet addresses conned across 800,000 transactions. What are Pig Butchering Scams? Pig Butchering is an extended and very sophisticated fraud in which the criminals build up close relationships with their targets, and persuade them to invest in various fake cryptocurrency platforms. After making these big investments, they vanish, and the gullible investors end up with nothing. These schemes include highly targeted investors hence having led to an increase in cyber threats in the crypto industry by 40% this year. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Weekly Report: $2.2 Billion Stolen in 2024, Centralized Exchanges Hit Hard , People Aren’t the Only Ones Being Hurt; Firms This Time Suffer From Access Control Hacks Access control breaches were also to a significant extent behind crypto fraud this year: the share of such incidents was 81% and the financial losses, according to the study. These comprised 41.6% of all the reported cases, but the losses arising from such incidences call for the strengthening of protective modalities against unauthorised access and transfers. In another report by Chain analysi s, digital currency theft rose to $2.2 billion based on 303 incidents in 2024, from $1.8 billion in 2023; North Korean hackers accounted for $1.34 billion in 2024, which was more than double that of 2023. A major shift materialized to centralized applications instead of DeFi systems, including attacks like Japan’s DMM Bitcoin($305m) and Indian WazirX($234.9m) . Regarding funds’ redistribution, experienced hackers used mixers and bridges between blockchains for 90% of stolen funds, while the private key’s poor management let the fraudsters steal 43.8% of the money. The risks are such that they encourage people to adapt to cryptocurrency but also warn them to stay alert, check all the investment offers thoroughly and stay with reliable service providers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Strong inflows into crypto ETFs expected to drive market growth throughout 2025. Stablecoins and regulatory changes will play a key role in shaping crypto’s future. As the crypto market recorded a 90% increase in total market capitalization in 2024, experts highlighted key factors influencing its growth trajectory in 2025. According to a Citigroup report , the future of digital assets depends on economic conditions, crypto ETF performance, regulatory changes, and the expanding role of stablecoins. Macro Environment Supporting Crypto in Early 2025 Citigroup analysts project that digital currencies will benefit from a positive economic environment into the first quarter of 2025.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 07:20:00

One key analyst highlights that Trump’s administration could significantly boost Bitcoin’s price by pushing for the tokenization of traditional assets, such as stocks from major companies like Apple and Amazon. This could lead to a world where assets are traded digitally, making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies even more integral to the financial system. The analyst believes this could unlock trillions of dollars in new digital assets, creating a massive opportunity for Bitcoin in 2025. Analyst Say Trump wants Bitcoin’s price up Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also revealed that Trump plans to clean out the SEC and install individuals who are more supportive of Bitcoin. Trump is expected to treat Bitcoin as part of the U.S. strategic reserve, which could further boost the cryptocurrency’s position in the global economy. Analysts believe that Trump will measure his success by Bitcoin’s price and will take credit for any future surges. Some even predict that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 under his leadership. Moreover, another analyst, Kristen Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, also echoed similar sentiment and pointed out that the lack of a clear regulatory framework for Bitcoin exchanges has stopped its growth. With Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, she believes that regulatory clarity will encourage more big companies to invest in Bitcoin, making it a mainstream asset. Further pointing towards the regulatory issues Coinbase and Robinhood faced could have been avoided with transparent policies saving investors money. Overall, analysts agree that Trump’s presidency could be a turning point for Bitcoin, with clearer regulations, more institutional adoption, and a more favorable attitude toward cryptocurrencies. This could lead to Bitcoin reaching a new high with a global presence. Not All Agree to Trump’s Promises… Ethan Vera, COO at Seattle-based Luxor Technology said in a recent Bloomberg interview that Trump’s plans to mine all remaining Bitcoin mining to be done in the US are fake and impractical as Bitcoin mining is a costly and energy process Also majority of miners is spread across the globe where energy is cheap.

Table of Contents Catzilla: A giant leap for meme coins CHILLGUY: New digital asset SHIRO Coin: Emerging crypto with promising potential Catwifhat: Deflationary coin with perpetual auto-burn on Solana Notcoin: A community token bridging gaming and web3 technology Conclusion The crypto scene could witness remarkable shifts in 2025, with certain meme-based coins hinting at tremendous growth. These unique digital currencies, driven by internet culture and community enthusiasm, might be on the cusp of significant leaps. Uncover five of these intriguing tokens that could potentially make a notable impact on the market and draw substantial attention. Catzilla: A giant leap for meme coins In the dynamic landscape of meme coins, few contenders roar as loudly as Catzilla. Inspired by the success stories of Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE, Catzilla combines the humor and chaos of meme culture with kaiju-inspired storytelling. Picture a colossal, Godzilla-like cat wreaking havoc while rallying a community of gamers, anime fans, and crypto enthusiasts.

Designed to enhance transaction efficiency and security, it seeks to address common challenges in the crypto space. CHILLGUY’s technology focuses on improving scalability and user experience, which could set it apart from existing digital currencies. In the current market cycle, with continued interest in emerging cryptocurrencies, CHILLGUY presents potential opportunities for investors. Its attractiveness depends on its technological developments and the adoption rate within the crypto community. SHIRO Coin: Emerging crypto with promising potential SHIRO is a cryptocurrency designed to offer innovative solutions in the blockchain industry. It aims to enhance transaction speed and security while reducing costs. SHIRO utilizes advanced technology to improve scalability and user experience. In the current market cycle, SHIRO appears attractive to investors looking for new opportunities. Its potential lies in addressing challenges faced by existing cryptocurrencies. With unique features and growing adoption, SHIRO could play a significant role in the future of digital currencies. Catwifhat: Deflationary coin with perpetual auto-burn on Solana Catwifhat is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain featuring a unique auto-burn mechanism. Introduced in December 2023, it applies a 4% burn fee to every on-chain transaction, including DEX buys, sells, and wallet transfers. This deflationary measure reduces the supply of CWIF over time. Since all contract authorities were revoked day 1, the auto-burn cannot be altered and will continue indefinitely. The perpetual reduction in supply may influence the coin’s value dynamics. In the current market cycle, CWIF presents a distinct model within the memecoin space. Notcoin: A community token bridging gaming and web3 technology Notcoin began as a viral Telegram game that introduced many users to web3 through a tap-to-earn mining mechanic. NOT is a community token where users earn by exploring web3 products, playing games, and contributing to the ecosystem. Web3 builders can offer their products to the community via Notcoin campaigns. The coin leverages gaming to make web3 accessible and engaging. In the current market cycle, Notcoin’s blend of gaming and web3 technology may attract users seeking interactive and rewarding experiences in the crypto space. Conclusion CHILLGUY, SHIRO, CWIF, and NOT show less short-term potential. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as a leading meme coin, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone with a 700% ROI potential during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising over 14 stages. It offers governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking options, uniting enthusiasts in the fight against crypto villains.

That’s the kind of momentum that turns heads, and Rollblock has done just that. With its innovative GambleFi platform, Rollblock has ignited a buying frenzy among Sui and Avalanche users, raising nearly $7.5 million so far. The excitement is fueled by its community-backed model and potential to disrupt the casino market. With Rollblock’s RBLK token gaining traction, the project’s market cap could skyrocket post-launch, making this presale a red-hot opportunity for early investors seeking substantial returns. Rollblock presale frenzy: Road to $7.5M and a $40.M market cap in sight “The internet is the new frontier for gambling, and online casinos are leading the way.” These words from Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. perfectly capture why Rollblock is making waves right now. In just its 9th presale , Rollblock is flourishing, so much so that it has started capturing the attention of Sui and Avalanche users. Its rise is no fluke. The platform uses cryptocurrency to offer a gaming experience that’s fast, secure, and fair—a combination that’s hard to beat. At Rollblock, the focus isn’t just on gaming; it’s on rewarding you as part of the community. By holding RBLK tokens, you can join the Hold to Earn program, which lets you earn a share of the casino’s daily profits.

So, whether you’re a gaming enthusiast or an investor looking for opportunities, Rollblock’s blend of innovation, rewards, and community engagement is hard to ignore. Sui holders roll the dice on Rollblock’s red-hot presale Sui is a fast and secure blockchain designed to make crypto transactions and apps more efficient. Its standout feature is its scalability, meaning it can handle a lot of transactions without slowing down. However, like many newer blockchains, Sui faces challenges. Limited adoption has kept its ecosystem smaller than others, and high competition makes it hard for new projects to stand out. Despite these hurdles, Sui holders are drawn to Rollblock’s presale . The platform’s innovative GambleFi model, coupled with the chance to earn rewards through $RBLK tokens, aligns perfectly with their appetite for fast, secure, and forward-thinking crypto projects. Why Avalanche holders are taking a gamble on the Rollblock presale Avalanche recently launched its Avalanche9000 upgrade, described as the network’s biggest update since its mainnet debut. This upgrade introduced major improvements like drastically reduced fees and easier deployment of Layer-1 chains, making Avalanche more accessible and cost-effective. However, despite its technical benefits, the upgrade hasn’t sparked significant demand, leaving many AVAX holders concerned about its long-term impact. With the AVAX market cap still under pressure, holders are looking for new opportunities. Rollblock’s presale has captured their attention, offering a chance to diversify into a growing platform that combines innovative gaming with security and scalability. Final thoughts If you’re looking to diversify, Rollblock is where the excitement is! Its GambleFi innovation and rewarding $RBLK token are catching the eyes of Sui and Avalanche holders alike. While other tokens struggle for market cap growth, Rollblock is creating a buzz you don’t want to miss. Your move—ready to roll?

The attackers impersonated Animoca and falsely announced the launch of a token. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT attributed the hack to a phishing scam that has recently targeted over 15 crypto-focused X accounts, ultimately stealing almost $500,000. Fraudulent ‘MOCA’ Token Siu’s hacked account shared a link to a fake token called Animoca Brands (MOCA) on the Pump.fun platform, which bore the same name as both the company and its Mocaverse NFT collection. This fraudulent MOCA token was then traced back to the same address behind other fraudulent tokens, ZachXBT confirmed . After being promoted on Siu’s account, the token briefly reached a peak value of almost $37,000, only to crash moments later to a market cap of just $5,735, as per data compiled by Birdeye. Currently, there are only 33 holders of the token. ZachXBT had previously uncovered this sophisticated phishing scheme wherein phishing emails disguised as urgent messages from the X team often cited fabricated copyright issues and tricked victims into resetting their account credentials. The scheme leveraged the credibility of crypto-related accounts with large audiences. A majority of those had more than 200,000 followers. Affected accounts included Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett, and Alex Blania. The first attack was on November 26, involving RuneMine, and the most recent occurred on December 24, affecting Kick, just before Siu’s. 2FA “Not Enough” to Secure Accounts Siu explained that the hacker somehow obtained his password and used the account recovery page to bypass 2FA by submitting a request with a non-registered email address. He tested this process and noted a significant security gap: while the system triggered a login notification to the wrong email, the actual, registered email received no alerts regarding critical actions like a 2FA change request. He said that this lack of notification could have prevented the hack. Siu also added that the hacker submitted a government-issued ID to bypass further security checks, a tactic he suspects was facilitated by phishing. He urged X to implement stronger notifications, particularly for sensitive changes like 2FA modifications, and recommended better verification measures to protect accounts. Siu also warned that 2FA alone is not enough to secure an account and advised maintaining strong password hygiene, as attackers can bypass 2FA once they have access to the password.

The token’s prices have since fallen 80% since a Thursday peak and trade at just over a cent as of Friday. But while late buyers are sitting on losses, the effort still raised over $1 million for the cause. In an X post on Thursday, Runaway founder Siqi Chen said his daughter Mira was diagnosed with a type of brain tumor in September and that research and funding had “been lacking” because of how rare the condition was. His GoFundMe page has raised 80% of its $300,000 target as of Thursday, with all proceeds going directly to research efforts at the Hankinson Lab at the Univerity of Colorado. Chen also posted his Ethereum wallet on the X thread after user demand, later putting his Solana and Bitcoin addresses as users asked for more options. And then Pump.Fun happened. The platform lets anyone issue a token for less than $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned. A user created the MIRA token attached with a picture of Chen and his daughter, with no apparent objective except it being a token that can be traded just like any other memecoin. The user’s Pump.Fun profile shows MIRA was just one of the several tokens they created that day, with all the others failing to break a $6,000 market cap. X user @Waddles_eth later purchased 50% of the supply and sent all of it to Chen, who boosted the memecoin on his X account. That ensured virality for the token and sent prices from fractions of a penny to a peak of 8 cents early Thursday. The value of Chen’s token holdings went from $400,000 to over $18 million as the token went viral. It attracted a peak of $7 million in liquidity (worth in both Solana’s SOL and the memecoin) as the market became widely traded. It attracted over $85 million in trading volumes and over 130,000 transactions, making it the most popular smallcap in the past 24 hours. “I have been on the internet for 30 years and have seen some shit, but this is by far the craziest day of my life,” Chen wrote on X as prices rocketed. “I will be liquidating $1,000 worth of $MIRA every 10 minutes, perpetually. If change this schedule, i commit to announcing it 24 hours in advance.” “If you want to rug it to $0, go for it - at the end of the day we set out to raise $200K and we will end up with at least $1M towards rare disease research,” Chen stated. Community response to the whole event has been overwhelmingly positive, with several users pointing out how such memecoins can contribute to positive outcomes in the world. Memecoins are largely based on virality, attention and community hype. They are considered non-serious among professional investors but have seen massive demand and preference in the past year compared to larger venture capital-backed crypto tokens — which are perceived as enriching rich investors at the expense of smaller retail traders. But MIRA shifted some of the tides. “I think memecoins are dumb and have no future and I don't touch them. But if I wanted to make a case for them I would now know where to start,” X user @JaEsf said. “This is beautiful and quite crazy that you can do that with crypto. EVM, Solana or any chain. This is why Crypto exist! Simplify movement of assets,” said @mbaril010, another X user. Meanwhile, @waddles_eth, the user who originally sent half the token’s supply to Chen, said the overall outcome met their expectations. “When I saw the story about Mira and her illness, I thought it would be good to buy and send supply to you with the hopes of getting the SOL community behind a good cause on Christmas,” they said in a now-viral X post. “I'm really glad that it worked out the way that it has and I hope that the money helps to find a cure both for Mira and anyone else with her condition.” Crypto for good may finally become a thing in the new year.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-27 07:56:56

In a new YouTube strategy session, Pal says that the leading smart contract platform by volume is forming a bullish wedge pattern on its weekly chart, setting the top altcoin up for a breakout. “The weekly chart of Ethereum hasn’t yet broken out, but it’s very close. So whether we break out this month, which is my hunch, and then maybe retest in the January pullback from liquidity, or we pull back here for a bit and then explode through afterward, either way, that chart, that wedge pattern, to me, is one of the most powerful patterns in all of crypto and suggests we’ve got a very big move in Ethereum to come.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube Pal also believes that Ethereum paired against Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ) could shoot up based on the ISM Manufacturing Index, which is viewed as an indicator of the health of the US economy. “The business cycle is the coincident factor for the Ethereum/Bitcoin cross. So that says as the ISM starts rising ETH starts outperforming Bitcoin. And why is that? Well, it’s a function of ISM being confidence in the economy, disposable income or free cash flows from businesses. People have more money and feel better and have more confidence as the ISM goes up. The business cycle’s better. We’re earning a bit more. Our businesses are doing better, we’re making a bit more profit. And we recycle those profits into investments, and we go further out in the risk curve, which would be Ethereum.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube The former Goldman Sachs executive goes on to note that ETH/BTC is also forming a bullish wedge on its weekly chart. “It’s another wedge. This is the ETH/Bitcoin weekly cross. Look at the big picture. ETH basically is at the same level versus Bitcoin that it was in 2017. It has held value over time, which is very important. It shows that this thing is around and it’s here to stay. So what we’re doing is bouncing off the bottom channel now, just as the ISM is about to pick up, and we either break that wedge, which is a big deal, because that would be ETH outperforming Bitcoin even further, or we stay in that larger range but get to the top of the range. My base case is we breakout and ETH outperforms.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube ETH/BTC is trading for 0.03501 BTC ($3,354) at time of writing.

According to a recent press release , major stablecoin issuer Tether ( USDT ) has invested $2 million into the venture capital space through Arcanum Capital’s Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund II.

Morehead, who has been investing in Bitcoin since 2013 when it was just $65, expressed his belief in the four-year Bitcoin cycle in a recent interview. Morehead argues that the Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed event that slows down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, is the primary driver of these cycles. He compares the halving to the closure of half of the world’s copper mines, an event that would undoubtedly cause copper prices to rise. He notes that miners typically sell off their Bitcoin holdings to cover operating costs, and the halving effectively squeezes supply while demand remains constant, sending prices soaring. Related News: Company CEO Talks About Bitcoin: “People Want to Hold More Bitcoin, Not Less” While Morehead acknowledges that the impact of each halving diminishes over time, it remains important in the current market. He cited Pantera Capital’s accurate predictions for previous halving cycles, including an accurate prediction for Bitcoin’s price on August 15, 2020. Based on its data, Pantera predicts that the low point of the current cycle occurred approximately 400 days before the most recent halving (April 19, 2024), with the peak occurring approximately 480 days later, around August 2025. Morehead also touched on the interaction between macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin. He expressed skepticism about the Fed’s ability to lower interest rates, citing a growing economy, low unemployment, and high wage inflation. He believes current interest rates are appropriate given the economic climate. He also voiced concerns about the US’s $2 trillion budget deficit, even in times of economic prosperity, hinting at potential future economic challenges. While he did not explicitly link this to a positive Bitcoin outlook, he did imply that these macroeconomic conditions create a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

On Jan. 10, 2025, at 2:00 (UTC+8), Binance announced its support for the Optimism ( OP ) network upgrade and hard fork. To facilitate the upgrade, Binance will temporarily halt token deposits and withdrawals on the OP network starting from 1:00 (UTC+8) on the same day. The OP network upgrade is designed to enhance the network’s user experience, scalability, and overall performance. Binance has assured users that the trading of tokens supported by the OP network will remain unaffected during this period. A major update or modification to a blockchain network’s protocol that is incompatible with earlier versions is known as a hard fork . This implies that all network participants must update their software to the most recent version to continue engaging in network activities. Hard forks often resolve security vulnerabilities, introduce new features, or boost the network’s scalability and efficiency. Hard forks have historically played a pivotal role in the development of blockchain technology. For instance, the “Merge” transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while the “London” update introduced EIP-1559, which replaced the traditional auction-based fee model with a base fee that is burned (removed from circulation) and an optional priority fee (tip) for faster transactions. This improved gas fee predictability and added a deflationary element to Ethereum’s ( ETH ) supply. These enhancements highlight the importance of continuous innovation and security in blockchain networks.

Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflow on Thursday, with Ark’s ARKB and BlackRock’s IBIT supporting the trend. Notably, this change in fund flows comes after the investment instruments recorded massive outflow since December 19, which has sparked concerns in the broader crypto market. Bitcoin ETF Inflow Regains Momentum The US Spot Bitcoin ETF has recorded a significant outflux recently, with BTC witnessing a sharp decline. This robust outflux also appeared to have weighed on the investors’ sentiment, which has further triggered the volatility in the market. However, the sentiment appeared to have changed recently, as evidenced by the recent fund flow trend. According to Farside Investors data , the overall US Spot BTC ETFs recorded an influx of $475.2 million on Thursday. Fidelity’s FBTC led the influx trend with a $254.4 million inflow on December 26, reflecting the regaining confidence of the investors. Simultaneously, ARK’s ARKB and BlackRock’s IBIT noted inflows of $186.9 million and $56.6 million, respectively.

For context, the BTC ETFs recorded an outflow of $1.51 billion from December 19 through December 24, which has weighed on the investors’ sentiment, especially after the robust inflow over the past few weeks. Considering that, it appears that the institutional interest in the digital assets space is once again soaring. For context, the US Spot Ethereum ETF also recorded an inflow of $117.2 million yesterday, with Fidelity’s FETH leading with an $83 million influx. Source: Farside Investors BTC Recovery Ahead? Bitcoin price today was down about 3% and exchanged hands at $94,975 despite the positive US Spot Bitcoin ETF inflow. Its trading volume was up about 28% and the crypto touched a 24-hour high of $97,784. Furthermore, BTC Futures Open Interest fell about 3% in the last 4-hour time-frame, reflecting the bearish trend noted in the broader market. Meanwhile, the analysts also shared some gloomy forecasts for BTC , as it has lost its crucial support recently. Bitcoin has slipped recently due to a flurry of reasons, with top experts predicting a BTC crash to $60K ahead, which has fueled discussions in the market. However, despite the gloomy sentiment, some market experts remained optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the flagship crypto. Despite the short-term pullback amid the holiday mood, the crypto is likely to make a strong recovery ahead, potentially hitting new highs in the coming days. On the other hand, Bitwise has recently filed for a new BTC ETF to track companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and others. This also showcases the growing institutional confidence towards the flagship crypto. Having said that, the largest crypto by market cap is expected to rebound in the coming days, despite these short-term declines.

Even though these digital currencies are still newsmakers, the focus is now turning to new ventures that have greater potential and better usage models. One such project is Rexas Finance (RXS), an ERC-20 token, which has attracted crypto whales with its asset tokenization and project ecosystem design strategy. In contrast with established cryptocurrencies, Rexas Finance has definite edges, making it an ideal investment for those who want to leverage opportunities in the coming year. Rexas Finance (RXS): Crypto Whales Focusing on Utility Rexas Finance is gradually becoming one of the most favored options among investors who focus on projects with sound business models and strong fundamentals, taking a long-term view. With its strategy of tokenizing physical assets and promoting blockchain applications, it has proven itself as an innovator with a focus on profitability. As an Ethereum blockchain-based token, RXS integrates into the wider crypto ecosystem due to the efficiency and compatibility of the ERC-20 standard. Tokenization and Key Features Driving Crypto Whales Interest The primary convenience Rexas Finance offers is fractional ownership of real estate, fine art, and precious metals through its tokenization model. Besides attracting crypto whales, retail investors are also facilitated, as the investment potential of these markets is expanded. For instance, users of the platform have access to the Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Launchpad. These tools help users design custom tokens and facilitate decentralized funding for blockchain projects. These solutions address the needs of both individuals and institutional users, suggesting a potential for mass adoption. Rexas Finance has also integrated an extensive staking system that encourages long-term token storage by compensating users, thereby preventing massive sell-offs. Additionally, the features and scalability provided by the Ethereum blockchain make the project a strong contender in the tokenization sector. Presale Details and Tokenomics Rexas Finance has performed exceptionally well in all its presale phases, raising over $30 million and selling more than 364 million tokens across all nine stages. Currently in the tenth stage, the price of RXS is set at $0.15. Even at this price, early participants from the presale price of $0.03 in stage 1 have reaped significant returns, reflecting the demand for RWA token and the project as a whole, with crypto whales leading the way in securing a strong position in the market. Rexas Finance Tokenomics The tokenomics of Rexas Finance is clearly well thought out to support balanced growth. The maximum supply is capped at one billion tokens, with 42.5% allocated to presale, giving early investors a significant entry point. Additionally, 22.5% is allocated for staking rewards to encourage long-term holding. The liquidity pool consists of 15% of the total supply, while 10% is reserved for treasury to support the company’s development. Other allocations include marketing (3%), team incentives (3%), giveaways (2%), and partnerships (2%). This well-distributed allocation ensures that core areas are adequately financed for the project’s growth, thereby, pausing as one of cryptocurrencies with most potential in 2025. Security, Visibility, and Giveaway Rexas Finance’s smart contracts are audited by CertiK, a globally recognized blockchain security company. This audit assures investors that the platform’s source code has no exploitable flaws, enhancing trust in the project. Additionally, the early-stage cryptocurrency is visible on Coinbase, increasing credibility and generating more interest from the market, including crypto whales. Rexas Finance has also introduced a $1 million giveaway program to incentivize engagement. Participants can earn RXS tokens by performing simple tasks, such as sharing the project on social media, referring others, and purchasing tokens during the presale. This rewards early investors and helps build a strong community for the project. Conclusion Despite Bitcoin and Ethereum remaining prominent constituents in most portfolios, the growing attention towards ventures like Rexas Finance signals a shift in investor strategy. With RXS’s focus on tokenization, robust tokenomics, and other key features, the project presents significant opportunities as demonstrated by crypto whales actions.

Here’s Average Amount Held by XRP Holders,https://timestabloid.com/updated-xrp-rich-list-heres-average-amount-held-by-xrp-holders/,"As 2024 ends soon, we decided to delve into some important XRP statistics to provide crucial insight into the digital asset’s investment landscape. Recent data from rich-list.info highlights the distribution of XRP across accounts, shedding light on the asset’s ownership. As of the latest analysis, there are 5,767,344 XRP accounts, collectively holding 61,9 billion XRP. This brings the average balance per account to 10,741.25 XRP. Distribution Insights The distribution remains concentrated among a relatively small number of high-balance accounts. For instance, only 6 accounts hold over 1 billion XRP, totaling 7.89 billion XRP. There are 22 accounts with balances between 500 million and 1 billion XRP, holding a combined 11.79 billion XRP. Accounts with balances between 100 million and 500 million XRP are 57, with a cumulative balance of 11.8 billion XRP. In contrast, smaller accounts dominate the lower ranges. 2.45 million accounts hold between 20 and 500 XRP, collectively accounting for only 189.29 million XRP. 2.21 million accounts hold less than 20 XRP, with a combined balance of 23.92 million XRP. These figures show a pronounced disparity in XRP holdings, with the largest accounts owning the majority of the total supply. Whales are not new in the XRP ecosystem, but this data shows the concentration of massive amounts of XRP among just a few investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Performance With XRP currently trading at $2.29, the average account balance of 10,741.25 XRP translates to approximately $24,597.46. This valuation shows how even average XRP holders have thousands of dollars. This distribution reflects broader trends within the cryptocurrency space, where whales exert significant influence. For XRP investors, understanding these dynamics is critical, as the concentration of holdings may impact liquidity, price stability, and more. This distribution also shows the growth in the market over the past few months. A similar analysis in late August showed the average XRP holder at 12,350.86 XRP. Although the average amount of tokens held has dropped slightly, the current value is more than three times the valuation of $7,214.13 from August, and the lower XRP amount can be explained by investors taking profits during the recent price rally. The XRP ecosystem continues to grow, with millions of accounts participating. With notable developments like the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , the ecosystem’s growth is expected to accelerate.

38176447,https://coinpaprika.com/news/will-sam-bankman-fried-get-a-presidential-pardon-from-biden-,1735290862,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38176447.jpeg,Will Sam Bankman-Fried Get a Presidential Pardon from Biden?,https://coinpaprika.com/news/will-sam-bankman-fried-get-a-presidential-pardon-from-biden-,"Speculation is growing around Sam Bankman-Fried potentially receiving a presidential pardon following his conviction for fraud and money laundering. The former FTX founder, sentenced to 25 years in prison, has become the center of heated debates due to his substantial political donations and the leniency of his sentence compared to the scale of his crimes. In 2020, when FTX was at its peak, Bankman-Fried donated $5.2 million to pro-Biden super PACs, becoming the second-largest individual donor to the Democratic Party after Michael Bloomberg. Historical cases show parallels, such as Marc Rich, who was pardoned by Bill Clinton after his ex-wife made significant donations to the Democratic National Committee, and Paul Pogue, who received clemency from Donald Trump following large campaign contributions from his family. The debate intensified after Elon Musk suggested on social media that a pardon for Bankman-Fried is a tangible possibility. Prediction platform Kalshi even estimates a 12% chance of Biden granting clemency. This comes after President Biden recently pardoned Michael Conahan, who was implicated in the notorious “kids-for-cash” scandal. These decisions have raised concerns about whether political donations are influencing high-profile pardons. Another layer of controversy stems from the campaign finance violation charges against Bankman-Fried, which were dropped due to his extradition agreement with the Bahamas. Originally, he faced multiple charges, including conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws. However, these charges were excluded because the Bahamian government did not consent to their inclusion in the extradition process. Although prosecutors initially planned a separate trial for these charges, they later decided not to proceed, stating the evidence would duplicate that of the first trial. Bankman-Fried's sentencing to 25 years for orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in history is seen by many as surprisingly lenient . FTX’s collapse resulted in over $16 billion in customer and creditor losses and wiped out more than $100 billion from the crypto market. Prosecutors had initially sought a 50-year sentence, highlighting the enormous financial damage and the erosion of public trust in the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, key figures in the scandal, such as Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, received significantly lighter consequences due to their cooperation with authorities. Critics argue that Bankman-Fried’s political donations and connections might pave the way for preferential treatment. Prominent lawyer Richard W. Painter warned that any president granting clemency under such circumstances should face impeachment. The ethical dilemma surrounding presidential pardons is not new, but Bankman-Fried’s case brings it sharply into focus, particularly given the sheer scale of his financial misconduct. Despite these discussions, it’s important to note that a presidential pardon is far from guaranteed . While past cases suggest a pattern of influential donors receiving clemency, proving a direct link between donations and pardons remains difficult. Presidents often justify such decisions on various grounds, and motivations can be complex and opaque. The crypto community remains divided. Some believe Bankman-Fried’s political influence could secure his early release, while others argue that the public scrutiny surrounding his case makes a pardon highly unlikely. Regardless of the outcome, the debate highlights ongoing concerns about the intersection of wealth, political power, and justice in high-profile financial crime cases. Bankman-Fried's case serves as a stark reminder of the ethical challenges surrounding presidential clemency. As his prison term begins, all eyes remain on the Biden administration and the potential political and public fallout of any decision to grant or deny a pardon.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-27 09:14:22

The company has made a $2 million injection into Arcanum Capital’s Emerging Technologies Fund II, signaling its commitment to advancing Web3 projects. As reported by the Financial news portal Traders Union, Tether’s investment in Arcanum Capital’s fund focuses on decentralized Web3 initiatives, aiming to enhance financial privacy, facilitate cross-border payments, and expand banking access for the unbanked. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stressed the need to preserve individual freedoms in financial systems, emphasizing the role of censorship-resistant technologies. “ A key concern today is the evolving relationship between financial systems and individual freedoms, particularly in the context of increasing restrictions on open communication ,” Ardoino stated. Arcanum’s Managing Partner, James McDowall, also highlighted the fund’s mission to address vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems, particularly in geopolitically sensitive regions. The focus on blockchain-based secure remittance solutions seemingly aligns with Tether’s broader goals of financial autonomy and decentralization. Tether seeks diversification through strategic investments Tether’s investment in Arcanum is just one part of its diversification strategy. In October, Tether facilitated a $45 million oil transaction using its USDT stablecoin and proposed a boron-backed token to the Turkish government, leveraging Turkey’s global dominance in boron production. The company also made headlines in December with a $775 million commitment to Rumble, a video platform known for its emphasis on free speech. The investment includes a $250 million cash injection and support for Rumble’s tender offer to purchase 70 million shares. Following the announcement, Rumble’s stock surged by 50% in after-hours trading, showcasing Tether’s growing influence beyond cryptocurrency markets. Tether is also venturing into artificial intelligence (AI), with plans to launch an AI platform in Q1 2025. According to CEO Ardoino, this platform will allow users to interact with AI through mobile devices, marking a significant step in the company’s innovation roadmap. “ Next year, we plan to deploy at least half of the profits in investments,” Ardoino said, underlining Tether’s aggressive approach to growth and diversification. “Our investment is just at the beginning .” Regulatory challenges and opportunities While the entity is experiencing significant growth, with its market capitalization surpassing $140 billion in 2024, the company faces regulatory challenges in Europe. The introduction of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations has made the relationship between the stablecoin issuer and European exchanges uneasy. The European Union issued a directive mandating the delisting of USDT from exchanges by December 30, 2024, unless it complies with MiCA regulations. MiCA, the EU’s comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, imposes strict requirements for transparency, auditing, and oversight of stablecoins. As one of the most actively traded digital assets, USDT faces potential removal from European exchanges if it fails to meet these standards, potentially causing significant disruptions to market activity and investor confidence. Analysts suggest this could limit the stablecoin issuer’s reach in the region, but it also provides an opportunity to focus on the Americas, where crypto adoption is accelerating. In the US, Tether’s expansion efforts align well with the crypto-friendly policies expected under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Howard Lutnick , CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and a major Tether stakeholder, is set to join Trump’s cabinet as Commerce Secretary. Lutnick’s involvement is expected to foster a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets and could aid Tether’s US growth trajectory.

Price targets point to new highs TRON poised for growth amid altcoin season hopes Conclusion With a new surge in cryptocurrency gains anticipated, 2025 may offer unprecedented opportunities for investors aiming for extraordinary growth. Spotting digital currencies set for significant appreciation could lead to remarkable profits. This article explores three promising altcoins that might deliver exceptional returns, engaging those keen to benefit from the next major market upswing. DOGEN: The meme token for real alphas According to the team at DOGEN, DOGEN lifestyle is designed for those who strive for the top. DOGEN is primed to explode, with a 700% surge projected before the presale wraps up. As meme tokens take center stage this altcoin season, DOGEN is heating up for thousand-fold gains. Early adopters will lead the charge, leaving others scrambling to catch up. DOGEN is the new alpha in the Solana ecosystem, holding its own against heavyweights like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, tokens that have delivered mind-blowing 1000% gains. Currently flying under the radar, DOGEN is gearing up to smash records in the upcoming bull run. This is a good chance to get in early before the world catches on. DOGEN is more than a token, it’s a community-driven movement. For the hardcore believers, there’s an exclusive airdrop opportunity. Users can flex their DOGEN spirit on social media, stack tokens during the presale, and recruit others to join the movement using their referral link. For every recruit, they’ll earn a juicy 20% of their Golden Points from token buys, turning influence into serious profits. But it doesn’t stop there. DOGEN’s multi-level referral program is as rewarding as it is fierce. Users will score 7% of every token bought by their direct referrals (1st level) and unlock additional levels of rewards as the network grows. Interested investors can join the DOGEN army today. Is SUI set to soar? Price targets point to new highs Despite a recent dip of 11.37% over the past week, SUI has shown impressive growth, gaining 18.91% in the last month and surging 382.74% over six months. Trading between $3.56 and $5.02, the price sits near its moving averages, indicating consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 42.34, suggesting the coin isn’t overbought.

With an anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, SUI might be poised for substantial gains ahead. TRON poised for growth amid altcoin season hopes TRON is showing strong signs of potential growth. Over the past six months, its price has surged by over 100%, indicating strong upward momentum. Despite a slight dip of around 14% in the past week, the coin has risen by about 20% in the last month. Currently trading between $0.21 and $0.29, TRX is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.34. Breaking through this barrier could propel the price toward the next resistance at $0.42, offering substantial gains. The relative strength index is neutral, suggesting room for further upward movement. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, TRX could be set for significant appreciation. Conclusion While SUI and TRX have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a top pick. Designed for those seeking the best in life, DOGEN embodies luxury and success.

A new study shows that almost 65% of Ethereum ‘s transactions could be processed at the same time, potentially making the network much faster. In a Friday blog post , analysts at layer-1 network Sei ( SEI ) revealed that many of Ethereum’s transactions don’t depend on each other and could run simultaneously, allowing the network to handle more transactions and improve its speed. Right now, Ethereum processes transactions one after another, which is also known as sequential processing. For example, if someone sends 1 ( ETH ) to one person and then that person sends 1 ETH to someone else, these transactions need to happen one after the other. If they were processed at the same time, the second one would be wrong because your balance wouldn’t be updated yet. Yet, some transactions don’t affect each other, Sei’s study reveals. You might also like: Starknet debuts parallel transaction execution on testnet As analysts at Sei explain, if Bob sends 1 ETH to Alice and someone else sends you 1 ETH at the same time, they don’t interfere with each other. These transactions can happen in parallel, meaning they can be processed at the same time. The study found that 64.85% of Ethereum transactions are like this, meaning they could be processed in parallel, without waiting for others to finish. If this method is used, Ethereum could process many more transactions and become faster. “Each block averages 60.77 dependent transactions, indicating significant potential for parallel execution optimization.” Sei However, there are still some challenges. Some transactions still need to be processed one after the other because they rely on each other, what is also known as dependency. According to Sei’s calculations, about 35.15% of transactions on Ethereum are dependent on others. There are different ways to improve Ethereum’s speed. One idea is called “optimistic concurrency control,” a method used by the Sei protocol, which lets transactions happen at the same time, assuming they won’t cause problems. After the transactions finish, the system checks if any conflicts happened. If there’s a problem, the system can redo those transactions. This approach could help Ethereum process transactions faster while keeping things simple for developers. In the future, Ethereum could also use sharding , which splits the network into smaller pieces to help process transactions faster, Sei admits.

Citi Analysts Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-rise-in-bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins-continue-in-2025-citi-analysts-explained/,"The year 2024, which began with the acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, ends with Donald Trump's presidential victory. Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies are leaving behind a record-breaking year, driven by major events such as ETF approval and Trump's election victory. So What Awaits Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in 2025? While there are many predictions on this subject, Citi analysts recently announced their expectations for 2025. According to Business Insider, Citi analysts listed six factors that will determine the future of cryptocurrencies. Citi analysts predict strong crypto growth in 2025 driven by Trump policies, rising ETF inflows, and stablecoin innovations. “Bitcoin ETFs kicked off the sector’s rally in January. In September, a series of central bank rate cuts and other policies contributed to the rally, paving the way for a growth economy. But no development was more critical for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than Donald Trump’s victory, which helped push Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time, sending altcoins soaring. We expect this rise to continue in 2025.” Analysts, who explained the 6 factors that will support the rise in 2025, put ETF inflows in the first place. Citi analysts stated that they expect spot Bitcoin ETF inflows to continue strongly in 2025 and that it will be the most important driving force of the rise. Analysts said that apart from ETFs, the positive regulations of the Trump administration, the expanding stablecoin market, the macroeconomic environment, the widespread use of crypto, and the increasing portfolio allocation ratio will support the rise in BTC and crypto. Citi analysts said the macroeconomic environment is likely to support risky assets such as cryptocurrencies through the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, analysts noted that institutions will increase their allocations of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, adding that the increased allocation could boost the price of Bitcoin. Analysts recently said that Trump, who is preparing to take office in January 2025, will implement policies that could significantly affect the crypto market, which would be positive for prices. “Trump promised to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment,” they said. *This is not investment advice.

The proposed Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF is designed to offer exposure to bonds issued by corporations that use the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies. The Bitcoin Bond ETF In a December 27 post on X, the firm stated, “Strive’s first of many planned Bitcoin solutions will democratize access to Bitcoin bonds, which are bonds issued by corporations to purchase Bitcoin.” The announcement further noted that these bonds offer attractive risk-return characteristics associated with Bitcoin but are currently out of reach for most investors. The ETF aims to bridge this gap by providing everyday Americans and institutional investors with easier access to BTC-related financial instruments. According to the filing submitted on December 26, the proposed ETF will invest in securities from companies like MicroStrategy, which has become a prominent player in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Since 2020, under the leadership of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has invested approximately $27 billion in the coin. These purchases were financed through equity offerings and convertible bonds, which typically carry low or no interest but can be converted into shares under specified conditions. The Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF will be actively managed and will achieve its exposure to BTC-linked bonds either directly or through derivatives such as swaps and options. To maintain liquidity and collateral for these instruments, the fund will invest in high-quality, short-term assets like U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments. While details regarding the management fee have not been disclosed, actively managed funds often come with higher fees compared to passive alternatives. Strategic Context Since its start in 2022, Strive Asset Management has focused on addressing long-term economic risks, including the global fiat debt crisis, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. The company stated, “We strongly believe there is no better long-term investment to hedge against these risks than thoughtful exposure to Bitcoin.” The asset manager views the flagship cryptocurrency as an important part of a diversified investment portfolio, encouraging both individual and institutional investors to allocate funds directly to Bitcoin, BTC bonds, and companies focused on the cryptocurrency. Ramaswamy, who launched Strive with a focus on capitalism-driven strategies, has maintained a high-profile presence in both business and politics. Although he briefly ran against Donald Trump in the 2023 Republican presidential primary, he later endorsed the President-elect. Upon winning, Trump appointed Ramaswamy to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), an initiative aimed at reducing government waste, with X owner Elon Musk.

However, renowned analysts are sounding the alarm, predicting a drastic correction to $60,000. #Bitcoin $BTC will CRASH to $60,000!!! At least, that's what some of the most renowned analysts are saying. Let's dive in — Ali (@ali_charts) December 26, 2024 Tone Vays believes that trading below $95,000 is a ominous sign, increasing the likelihood of a downturn to $73,000. Peter Brandt echoes this sentiment, warning of a potential breakdown below $70,000. Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s optimistic forecast of $250,000 by 2025 is tempered by Mark Newton’s prediction of a near-term drop to $60,000. Is Bitcoin Gearing For A Major Dip? On-chain analysis suggests that a correction to $70,000 is plausible, with a significant support zone breached at $97,300. Savvy investors appear to be bracing for impact, with over 33,000 bitcoins worth $3.23 billion flowing into exchanges in the past week. Profit-taking is also on the rise, with $7.17 billion in bitcoin profits realized on December 23 alone. Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 For the bullish outlook to prevail, bitcoin must reclaim its critical support zone and sustain a daily close above $100,000. If achieved, this could pave the way for a new leg up to $168,500. However, the bears are circling, and a failure to reclaim this level could spell disaster for the cryptocurrency.

While the European Union spent years crafting its shiny new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ), Trump came in swinging with promises to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet.” The result? Crypto giants like Binance are dumping Europe and packing their bags for the States. Bitcoin’s insane rally to $108,000 this year—double what it was last year—is no coincidence. Trump’s win and his plans to overhaul U.S. crypto regulations have pumped confidence back into the market. Retail and institutional investors are betting on a White House that actually wants crypto to thrive. MiCA , meanwhile, looks like an over-engineered relic that no one has time for. MiCA faces trouble as costs pile up MiCA is supposed to clean up the crypto mess left by disasters like FTX, Genesis, and Celsius. It forces companies offering services like trading and custody to get authorized in the EU. But it comes with a fat price tag. Even Tether, the world’s biggest stablecoin, won’t comply with MiCA and is getting kicked off regulated EU exchanges. Some companies, like Coinbase and Circle, have managed to secure their licenses, though it’s clear the EU is bleeding talent. Meanwhile, Trump is rolling out the red carpet. He’s appointing pro-crypto folks like Paul Atkins as SEC chair and David Sacks as a White House crypto czar. “We’re going to do something great with crypto,” Trump said recently. Companies that fled U.S. regulations under Biden are now scrambling to come back. Binance US’s interim CEO, Norman Reed, even teased a return of dollar services in 2025, saying, “It is not a matter of if, but when.” Trump’s big crypto plans crush EU hopes Trump’s administration also wants to set up a national Bitcoin reserve, pouring $21 billion annually into the plan over five years. This would make the U.S. a global leader in Bitcoin holdings, leaving Europe to play catch-up. The Bitcoin Policy Institute has been screaming about this for years, and now it looks like Trump is the first to actually listen. Access to banking is also on Trump’s to-do list. His administration plans to order banks to provide services to crypto companies, reversing the hostile stance seen under Biden. This means no more shutting out crypto firms just because they’re crypto. Industry insiders are betting this will bring a flood of new investments into the U.S. market. While Europe fiddles with MiCA, Trump’s team is drafting new principles for agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The goal is to create a system that actually works for businesses, unlike the restrictive measures slapped down during Biden’s term.

Singapore-based web3 firm Matrixport says there are still many risks that could disrupt Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) bull market in 2025. In a research note on Dec. 27, the firm pointed to Google’s “Willow” quantum chip with 105 qubits as reigniting discussions about potential threats to Bitcoin’s security. While the technology is still in its early innings, Matrixport noted that the “theoretical risks warrant attention.” You might also like: Avalanche CEO calls for freezing Satoshi-era million Bitcoins amid quantum computing concerns Inflation expectations are also rising, partly due to possible tariffs under Trump’s presidency. The report says these tariffs had “minimal impact” during his first term but warns that the Fed’s response to fiscal policies could affect monetary policy next year. “ the FOMC could adopt a more hawkish stance if a Trump presidency seemed increasingly likely or was confirmed—both of which have now come to pass. This scenario introduces new uncertainties for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market, as the Fed’s response to potential fiscal policies under Trump could shape the trajectory of monetary policy.” Matrixport Matrixport highlighted that regulatory pressure often marks turning points for Bitcoin. The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has eased concerns, but macroeconomic factors now take center stage. “Inflation should not present a major issue next year,” the report states, adding that this could allow the Fed to maintain a dovish stance. Bitcoin’s future, according to Matrixport, now hinges on how it navigates these emerging challenges.

On Dec. 26, over 1.8% of BONK’s entire supply, amounting to 1.69 trillion tokens worth over $51 million was burned as part of the dog-themed meme coin’s community holiday token burning event dubbed the “BURNmas.” Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion ❗️❗️❗️ #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 Initially proposed in late November, the project planned to burn 1,000 BONK for every X post using the hashtag #LetsBONK, and 10,000 BONK for every new follower gained on Instagram and TikTok, with a final target of burning 1 trillion tokens. The idea was to spur community engagement and increase visibility for the token during the holiday season. However, due to higher-than-expected engagement across social media platforms, the initial target of 1 trillion tokens was surpassed. In response, BonkDAO members voted in favor of an updated proposal to increase the burn amount to 1.69 trillion tokens. You might also like: BonkDAO announces plans to burn 1.69t BONK in “BURNmas” event Token burns are a common occurrence in the crypto space, especially among meme coins like BONK, which boasts a total supply of 100 trillion tokens, now reduced to 90.97 trillion after recent burns. By permanently removing a chunk of tokens from circulation, these events aim to tighten supply dynamics, theoretically boosting scarcity and, in turn, driving up the token’s value. For instance, following BONK’s previous token burn event on July 29, when 84 million tokens valued at over $2 million at the time were removed from circulation, it resulted in a 25% rally for the token. This time, however, the BURNmas spectacle failed to deliver, with the token dropping over 7% following the event with its market cap hovering around $2.3 billion. Why is BONK price going down? While there was no solid reason that sparked the sell-off, BONK’s ( BONK ) decline coincided with a broader downturn in the crypto market, fueled by a risk-off sentiment driven by Bitcoin’s lackluster performance, struggling to recover above the $100k mark. Additionally, holiday-induced low trading activity saw BONK’s volume drop over 8% in the past 24 hours. Frustration also brewed among several BONK enthusiasts, who voiced dissatisfaction over the team’s failure to execute the token burn on Christmas Day as originally promised. This delay may have dampened investor confidence and contributed to the sell-off. Another potential reason why BONK dropped is that many investors may have rotated their investments into Pudgy Penguins’ token, Pengu (PENGU). Just days after launching, PENGU amassed a market cap of over $2.2 billion and even briefly surpassed BONK as the largest meme coin on the Solana blockchain on Dec. 26. The token has also outperformed BONK over the past week, gaining over 32% compared to BONK’s 7.2% rally. At press time, the token had formed a god candle on its daily chart, which is typically a sign of whale activity. The sudden price rise managed to mitigate some of the day’s losses, bringing the token’s price to $0.000030. If more investors follow suit, it could spark the next leg up for the meme coin toward the key resistance level at $0.000034, a level BONK has tested twice this week but failed to breach.

Through the index, users can track trends and price changes without having to buy individual tokens or ETFs . Thus, traders can buy or sell USDT trading pairs alongside altcoins on the index. A futures index is an instrument typically used to monitor stock markets. Its allows traders to track the performance of certain assets in the market, such as commodity shares. Therefore, investors are able to assess or hedge against the market movements to determine the best course of action. This is because traders can immediately monitor other assets within the broader market, not just the ones they hold.

Chief Product Officer of BingX, Vivien Lin, stated the new futures and altcoin trading feature will offer a number of major cryptocurrencies and compile them into a singular list to make it easier for users to monitor market trends. “This index trading pair should help our less experienced users with their trading goals more easily, particularly when they are unsure which asset to trade and just want to trade major altcoins in general with leverage,” said Lin. The platform ensures that the index composition will be updated regularly on a quarterly basis to showcase current movements response to market conditions.

Hackers have been using sophisticated techniques to steal private keys, wallet data, and other sensitive information, which has resulted in substantial financial loss for victims. The attackers used a phishing domain that mimicked a legitimate Zoom domain, “app[.] us4zoom[.] us.”, reported SlowMist on Dec. 27. Source: SlowMist The scam site illustrated Zoom’s interface and tricked users into hitting the “Launch Meeting” button. The button did not open the Zoom application; it started downloading a malicious installation package called “ZoomApp_v.3. 14. dmg.” After installation, this package ran a script called “ZoomApp.file” that asked users to put in their system password. https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1872526964789219563 Upon analyzing, SlowMist reported that the script called a hidden executable file to deploy named “.ZoomApp”. The app tried to access data like system information, browser cookies, KeyChain data, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. The compressed data was then transmitted to a server under the hackers’ control, associated with the IP address 141.98.9.20, which has been labeled as malicious by multiple threat intelligence services.

This included stored passwords, cryptocurrency wallet details, and sensitive Telegram credentials, among other information. This allowed the attackers to obtain wallet mnemonic phrases and private keys, which facilitated the theft of large amounts of cryptocurrency. The attackers’ back-end system, located in the Netherlands, tracked user interactions through the Telegram API, with signs that they employed Russian-language scripts. The phishing campaign went live on Nov. 14, 2024, and has already attempted to steal millions of dollars in crypto from various users. Zoom scam on the Ethereum chain SlowMist tracked the on-chain transfer of funds using an anti-money laundering tool, MistTrack. A profit of more than $1 million was among the addresses of one of the hackers, where cryptocurrencies USD0++ and MORPHO were converted into 296 Ethereum ( ETH ). The stolen money was transferred to a series of platforms, including Binance, Gate.io, Bybit, and MEXC .

Most tokens were in the red this week, but that doesn’t mean there’s no hope for a bullish turn. Seasoned traders know you should always buy the dip. They also know to buy early, as evident from the frenzy around presales like Solaxy ($SOLX), Flockerz ($FLOCK), and Meme Index ($MEMEX). Let’s unpack the cryptocurrency market’s state today – and what early-stage altcoin projects might secure your tomorrow. Crypto Prices Update: $BGB & $PENGU Rise, $XRP Struggles $BTC dipped 6% after it failed to break above the $101K resistance zone yesterday. The monthly high of $108K appears out of reach in the near future, but things may change when Trump steps into office . $ETH’s performance was not unlike $BTC’s. Turbulent is the word. $XRP had it the worst – despite the number of XRP wallets growing, the token could only briefly cross the $2.28 zone this week. Bitget Token ($BGB) is the undisputed top gainer with a recent price surge to around $7.68 and a market cap of approximately $10.75 billion. Other weekly leaders include FTX Token ($FTT), Virtuals Protocol ($VIRTUAL), Zcash ($ZEC), and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU). The latter is now the fifth-largest meme coin by market cap, above $WIF and $FLOKI. On the other hand, $FARTCOIN lost 13.22% of its value – not that it’s surprising for meme coins relying solely on speculation. Among categories, we’ve witnessed a spike in interest for exchange-based (+6.6% market cap change) and AI (+17%) tokens. Cat-themed tokens like $POPCAT and $MOG are losing ground to the dog pack, like $WIF and $FLOKI. Early Bird Gets the Worm It’s not easy to jump on a train that departed in 2009. $BTC may still offer long-term potential, but it’s unlikely to surge like fresh meme coins – at least in the short term. That’s why gutsy investors turn to presale crypto. Lower entry points and higher staking rewards allow you to amplify potential returns. $SOLX is one such project. Within two weeks from launch, it raised $6M and garnered over 30K X followers. The reason? Solaxy is the world’s first Solana Layer-2 solution for meme coins. It promises no more congestion, high fees, and failed transactions. While $FLOCK may not boast $SOLX’s rapid fundraising pace, its community-centered governance model gives it the potential for sustained growth. The revolutionary Vote-to-Earn system lets you earn tokens by voting on project development proposals. In 26 days, $FLOCK will list on DEXs at a higher price, so now is the last chance to secure your share of tokens at $0.00653. $MEMEX continues the trend of meme coins with real utility. Every investor’s biggest hurdle is picking which project to bet on. Meme Index helps to diversify your portfolio and spread the risk. It achieves this with 4 meme coin indexes catering to different risk appetites: Titan is the least volatile and features top coins like $DOGE and $SHIB; Moonshot and MidCap include mid-tier tokens; and Frenzy offers the highest potential returns through new projects. The presale had just kicked off and has already raised $577K. One $MEMEX now costs $0.0146285, but the price will increase shortly. Stay Grounded in This Volatile Market Suspicions are high that the current market state is just a temporary correction, not the end of the bull run. And it could, in fact, be an opportune time to grow your portfolio at discounted prices. Remember to do your own research and diversify your investments. No project can guarantee returns, so invest only as much as you can potentially lose.",Altcoin News|Crypto News,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-27 09:44:43

The tokenless chain by Coinbase carries more than 8M transactions per day, and is a leader both in raw numbers and in the complexity of tokenized transfers. Base is leading the momentum of L2 chains, in addition to the expansion of Arbitrum and Optimism. The L2 narrative slowed down in 2024 when it came to general hype, but the actual infrastructure was one of the most widely used Web3 features. Base reached a record of 8.8M transactions per day, surpassing other top L2s which together achieve 5.5M transactions per day. The L2 expansion at the end of 2024 shifted its priorities, unlike the earlier days of airdrop farming. The trend matches the expectations for 2025, where apps would be the drivers of activity and adoption. Base led the way, and top L2s retained peak transaction counts toward the end of 2024. | Source: GrowThePie The past year shifted the balance of L2 chains, displacing Polygon in several categories. The Polygon chain derived most of its activity from Polymarket bets. The chain retains legacy status for some apps, though it lost its previous inflow of activity based on Web3 games and NFTs. Toward the end of 2024, Polygon was lagging as projects picked other networks to launch their apps and tokens. L2 chains are also absorbing value, both through native token launches and inflows from Ethereum. Based on L2Beat data, L2 chains lock in more than $58B , mostly held within optimistic rollups. Toward the end of 2024, Ethereum held $68.42B in value locked, mostly based on LidoDAO and Aave. L2s retain varied app profiles The growth in L2 activity comes from each chain retaining a profile of apps and activities. Arbitrum and Optimism established themselves as hubs for DeFi and DEX trading. Base gets its heightened activity from high-liquidity trading and moving cbBTC, the newly issued wrapped BTC token. The other source of activity is AI agents, after Virtuals Protocol launched on Base. AI agents are tokenized, and are quickly becoming the most actively traded asset class on Base. Different chains are leaders in their category, specializing in specific smart contracts. DeFi activity made ZK Sync Era, Arbitrum, and Optimism peak performers. Base is the leader in CeFi activity , as it carries some of the utility transactions for Coinbase. For the Taiko chain, WETH9 is the busiest smart contract , fueling DeFi with a wrapped version of Ethereum. For Base, the leading contract is a MEV strategy executor. Those contracts are the most prominent based on gas burned, due to bandwidth constraints and competition. For Base, the contract with the biggest transaction count belongs to Uniswap V3. Recently, the Uniswap DEX also posted a record , after achieving peak monthly volume on its Base version. L2s keep adding to Ethereum burn L2 chains have shown they can successfully scale Ethereum tasks and carry high-speed activity. As of December 27, L2 blob fees were the third-biggest source of ETH burns, helping to curb inflation. Blob fees continue to be a top factor for daily ETH burns. | Source: Ultrasound Money Ethereum is still slightly inflationary, with inflation going back to 0.5% annualized. Most L2s are competing for blob space on Ethereum, but paying out relatively small fees to use the L1 layer. Taiko remains one of the most common sources of payments to L1, as the chain does not slow down its transaction posting to Ethereum. The past year saw conflicts arise on the exact role of L2s and whether they were harming Ethereum. In the second half of the year, L2 chains achieved a form of equilibrium, as both Ethereum participants and L2 validators could earn fees. Some apps continue to use their Ethereum versions, making the L1 chain retain some of the busiest smart contracts. Ethereum is still the biggest carrier of stablecoins , as the ERC-20 version of USDT is the most widely traded and transacted. L2 chains have taken up some of the transaction count and meme token activity, but they have only retained a fraction of the available stablecoin liquidity. Instead, L2s use wrapped versions of ETH as a valuable collateral, and expand by hosting a new selection of decentralized apps.

Airdrop Details and Eligibility The Jupiter team is finalizing specific criteria for the airdrop, with ongoing discussions within the community to refine the eligibility guidelines. The distribution strategy focuses on two main groups: Users and Stakers: Rewards will be distributed based on trading activity and staking contributions. Carrots and Good Cats: A designation for prominent community supporters who will receive additional incentives. The draft eligibility framework suggests that trading volume on Jupiter products in the past year will play a significant role. For example, users with an annual trading volume of at least $800 will receive 50 tokens, while those with a trading volume of $29,000 will be given 250 tokens. This isn’t Jupiter’s first major token distribution. The platform has already given away around 1 billion JUP tokens in 2023 to users who had traded at least $1,000 in volume prior to a snapshot taken in November of that year. Tokenomics Update JUP’s circulating supply is currently 1.35 billion tokens with a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens. However, Jupiter plans to burn 3 billion tokens in August 2024 in a move approved by the community, reducing the maximum supply to 7 billion. Jupiter's Role in the Solana Ecosystem Launched in October 2021 by developer nicknamed “Meow,” Jupiter aggregates liquidity from various DEXs on Solana to provide users with the best rates for token swaps. The platform also offers perpetual trading products, adding to its utility and appeal. Over the past 24 hours, Jupiter reported an impressive $2.3 billion in trading volume, underscoring its important role in the Solana ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

This is part of Sui’s monthly process, which increases the circulating supply and impacts investor holdings. Despite a recent 5.31% dip over the past week, SUI has been a standout performer, surging by 31.25% in the last month and hitting an ATH of $4.93 after trading below $1. Now, at $4.26, it boasts a one-year gain of 413%, far outpacing XRP’s 250% gain. Analysts see a rise of $5 in the coming months with a scope to rise higher than expected. So is SUI a better option for profit-takers? Let’s see its growth potential. Raoul Pal’s Bullish Take on SUI Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, is bullish about SUI’s future, suggesting it could outperform major players like XRP and Solana (SOL) during this bull run. Pal highlights SUI’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern as a signal of its potential upside. With Pal’s insight the coin has the potential to break out in 2025 and many analysts even target above $5 for SUI by Q1 of 2025. While acknowledging Solana’s strength as a proven protocol, Pal sees SUI as a riskier but more rewarding investment. He also believes SUI’s upward trend could outpace XRP, Solana, and ETH even as XRP shows signs of a potentially explosive move after breaking its seven-year downtrend. Pal advises being wise in diverting the portfolio with an aim of targeting established coins and giving a small portion to these quick profit-giving assets to sail safely in this bear market. Technically, Good Time to Invest in SUI? SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently crossed $1.65 billion, a milestone that has fueled its price momentum. This growth is linked to its expanding network and bullish chart patterns, including a breakout from a head-and-shoulders formation. However, indicators like the MACD histogram turning negative suggest caution, while the RSI remains neutral. SUI is giving tough competition to XRP is quite surprising for crypto investors who are looking for a new investment opportunity. Since the coin is down at this moment it is a good time to stack the coin before the price rises.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|SOL|TRADING|XRP|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 10:10:17
