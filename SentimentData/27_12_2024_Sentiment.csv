Is a 1000x Move Possible?,https://thecoinrise.com/dogecoin-price-enters-critical-level-as-this-doge-killer-rises-is-a-1000x-move-possible/,"Dogecoin has been a major player in the crypto market since its launch, rivaling other memecoins with its wide community adoption and celebrity endorsement. However, its recent downside has faced challenges from emerging DOGE killers like PropiChain . Its revolutionary approach to tackling major real estate loopholes like inefficiencies, fraud risks, and high transaction costs has been a propeller of its token presale, which continues to attract attention from major investors. In this article, we will discuss how PropiChain could outrank the Dogecoin price and make over a 1000x move when it launches, as well as the unique features that make it stand out as a formidable competitor. The Widespread Community Adoption of Meme coins and its Impact on the Dogecoin Price Dogecoin’s continuous dominance in the market has been attributed to its passionate community, celebrity endorsements, and widespread adoption as a tipping currency. With these communities’ most loyal community support and guidance, the Dogecoin price has seen significant highs through community takeovers (CTOs) and Cabals spearheading them. Dogecoin has also experienced real-world use cases as legal tenders for charitable donations, service payments, and a niche in micropayments. However, despite its enduring popularity, Dogecoin entering a critical level has spiraled the growth of projects like PropiChain, which combines utility and innovation, to challenge its dominance and the Dogecoin price trajectory. How PropiChain Could Make a 1000x Move After Launch PropiChain’s signal to investors as one of the most prominent altcoins to outpace the Dogecoin price as a beam of hope during this critical level. Below are some unique features and how they propel its price trajectory to make over 1000x after launch. Advanced AI Technologies: PropiChain AI tools are designed to offer provisional assistance to users as they navigate the platform by providing predictive market analysis, which encompasses real-time evaluation of market trends, identification of emerging patterns, and prediction of future market behaviors. Its property filtering tools also provide sophisticated filters that consider anticipated market growth, investment potential, and properties’ historical performance irrespective of location. Metaverse Capabilities: The platform allows users to explore and invest in virtual real estate, bridging physical and digital assets. Through its virtual tours, stagings, and meetings, international investors can experiment with different layouts and designs in an immersive virtual environment and interactive experience surpassing traditional methods. RWA Tokenization: PropiChain’s approach to tokenizing assets involves digitizing properties in small and large proportions, ensuring seamless virtual transactions on a secure blockchain network. This further reduces fraud and streamlines complex processes that demand physical documentation as it democratizes access to highly valued assets to everyday investors rather than large-scale investors. Conclusion The Dogecoin Price is at a crossroads, facing challenges from innovative projects like PropiChain . With its presale already raising nearly $1M, crypto insiders are bullish about its roadmap and price trajectory to surpass DOGE. PropiChain is offering investors a chance to purchase the PCHAIN token for $0.004 in its round two presale, the lowest it will ever be before it surges after its launch. Moreover, its BlockAudit review and CoinMarketCap listing provide additional reassurance for investors. So if you are investing $1000 now, your portfolio is expected to see a massive gain of over $100,000 as it replicates the 2017 Dogecoin price, especially when it continues to gain momentum. Hurry now, and be a part of this transition before it’s too late!

What is this technology about, and how does DePIN work? Table of Contents What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? What are the DePIN options? Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? Theoretical studies in cryptocurrencies have long predicted that encryption tools currently implemented in the blockchain will be used on the Internet and impact the physical world sooner or later. Nick Szabo noted at the end of the 20th century that smart contracts can automatically manage physical objects. More than 25 years have passed, and the blockchain is firmly embedded in our lives. This is primarily due to cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to break records and is supported by significant physical infrastructure. At first glance, this confirms an actual physical presence in our world. However, the boundaries of decentralized technologies continue to expand with the advent of solutions such as DePIN. What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? DePIN meaning a Decentralized physical infrastructure network. Blockchain participants use a public ledger and cryptocurrency to build and maintain specific, real-world infrastructure projects. Simply speaking, DePIN involves using DePIN blockchain to run and sustain decentralized networks of equipment that can serve a common purpose. This enables the network to be built on decentralized, horizontal connections rather than the hierarchical approach typically seen with large infrastructure projects such as bridges or roads. Building and managing physical infrastructure networks is expensive and complex, so historically, they have been the domain of large corporations or governments with capital and resources. In contrast, DePIN encourages voluntary cooperation among participants. People can participate in DePIN networks by using their own hardware or purchasing specialized hardware for specific tasks. Options range from simple hard drives to weather stations. However, DePINs are typically built around capabilities that are available to the general public. Max Thake, co-founder of peaq, explained crypto.news that DePIN uses tokens to incentivize people to use connected hardware to offer services to other people: “Let’s imagine a smartphone-focused DePIN like Roam Network. The smartphones, owned by regular people, are the hardware component, the data on local connection quality they gather is the goods. Telecom companies looking to improve their services buy this data on a Web3 marketplace, which is where the smart contracts come into play, enabling the value exchange between the supply and demand sides.” Max Thake, co-founder of peaq You might also like: DePIN early-stage fundraising has grown 296% YoY: Messari What are the DePIN options? There are two types of DePINs: Physical Resource Networks (PRN) and Digital Resource Networks (DRN). PRNs are decentralized networks where providers give hardware resources (such as sensors or internet access), and these resources are tied to a specific location. Their contribution to the network is location-dependent, therefore they are not interchangeable. DRNs are networks where providers provide resources determined by their function, not location. Here, location does not matter. Examples of such resources include computing power, bandwidth, and storage. DePIN Sector Map | Source: Messari Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN DePIN can theoretically wholly transform how we manage and interact with physical infrastructure. Using blockchain and smart contracts , this model increases the efficiency and transparency of systems, allowing the community to make decisions independently. DePIN can be considered a kind of “industrial DAO ,” where all participants have equal opportunities and ensure the independence of the infrastructure. The system is flexible and can be scaled horizontally. With the successful attraction of motivated users, the creation of a decentralized physical infrastructure can be significantly accelerated. The pricing model in DePIN crypto systems is also considered more accessible and fair since infrastructure assets are publicly owned, and the cost of services is determined not by the company’s benefits but by availability. Rewarding participants in the form of tokens allows users to receive regular passive income with the benefit of society. However, significant disadvantages should be considered: Vulnerability to hacks and errors. High volatility of tokens. There is a need for technical knowledge to maintain a decentralized infrastructure. Nevertheless, with DePIN, blockchain powers real-world DePIN use cases and value exchanges, it is inherently linked to real-world supply and demand, which makes this segment uniquely positioned for sustainable, healthy growth. “People won’t stop using navigation apps, ordering food, or using the Web because Bitcoin took a dive. DePIN merges web3 with real value instead of speculation and offers it a chance to live up to its promise of changing the world.” Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? According to Messari analysts, in 2023, the DePIN ecosystem grew to more than 650 projects, and the number of nodes increased by 600,000. Researchers noted the main trends in the development of DePIN in 2024. Experts believe meme tokens will contribute to massively adopting projects like the BONK airdrop for Solana Saga smartphone users. Analysts also consider Asia to be the region with the most significant potential for the rapid development of decentralized infrastructure, expecting that some of the most influential projects in the sector will appear here from 2024 to 2025. The first development in the DePIN field appeared about ten years ago. During this time, the number of projects increased significantly. The sector’s market capitalization is more than $20 billion, excluding RWA and blockchain oracles, according to experts from Messari. Source: Messari Speaking about the future of DePIN, Thake expects it to become an industry staple alongside the entire supporting stack, from DePIN-crowdsourced data for training models to decentralized compute and Web3 federated learning markets for AI agents. “Some of the most exciting implementations of the DePIN model will be in the energy industry, especially when it comes to green energy, which requires flexible and decentralized grids, while most old-school ones follow the centralized model. People will soon earn by harvesting solar energy and contributing to the power grid.” However, DePIN projects are not yet popular even among participants in the cryptocurrency industry, let alone the widespread adoption of the concept. Implementing decentralized infrastructure may take time since DePIN faces problems that must be solved. However, experts are confident that this system will play a key role in shaping the future and changing the principles of operation of physical infrastructure.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

The purchase is the start of a strategy to put up to 90% of the company’s surplus cash into cryptocurrency, as pioneered by industry leaders like MicroStrategy, and also it represents a larger corporate trend toward embracing digital assets. KULR’s Bitcoin treasury plan According to an announcement on Thursday, the coins were purchased at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. This is only the beginning of many more purchases since KULR plans to invest up to 90% of its available cash into Bitcoin. KULR has selected Coinbase Prime to provide custody solutions and self-custodial wallet services for its crypto assets. Following the announcement of the Bitcoin strategic reserve, the KULR stock value increased by 40%. KULR Technology Group is led by its CEO, Michael Mo, who discussed in an interview that he took inspiration from the way MicroStrategy approaches Bitcoin. Mo said , “ He calls BTC digital energy, which really resonated with our mission because we are an energy management company for batteries and space applications are our core.” The link between KULR’s core business and Bitcoin’s fundamental technology is a strategic alignment in their investment strategy. To confirm the support of shareholders for the initiative, KULR undertook a survey to assess the endorsement of this novel financial approach. The feedback was predominantly favorable. Cryptocurrency as corporate cash Mo continued, “We received an overwhelming ‘Yes.’ Here we are buying our first block of BTC and entering into the future of money.” Additionally, he expressed his strong belief in Bitcoin, asserting, “We believe that BTC is the future of money.” KULR now adds to the growing list of companies embracing BTC as part of there treasury reserve. On December 23, a Canada-based company, Matador Technologies, announced it will top up its balance sheet with $4.5 million in Bitcoin, as part of a long-term strategy for capital preservation. Quantum BioPharma, a biopharmaceutical company, also joined the trend by investing $1 million in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on December 20. In Japan, Metaplanet recently bought its largest Bitcoin to date, acquiring nearly 620 BTC. The phenomenon of corporate acquisition of Bitcoin was first brought into the limelight by MicroStrategy, which initiated its investments in Bitcoin back in 2020. Currently holding over 444,000 BTC, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its cryptocurrency holdings, aiming to buy more Bitcoins worth $42 billion more in the near future, pending the approval of shareholders. KULR’s Chief Executive Officer expects a future in which the integration of high-tech technologies creates a new corporate structure. He outlined this vision: “ We envision that the future of a dynamic corporation is based on three pillars: super intelligence through AI, an automated workforce through robotics, and the future of money through BTC, he added. “I believe the whole industry is still at the very early stage of figuring out how to tie them together,” suggesting that KULR’s Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader, long-term vision for corporate evolution.

The transfer will take place on March 8, 2025, marking the culmination of DMM Bitcoin’s liquidation process after a devastating $305 million hack in May 2024. Liquidation and Transfer Process In a December 25 notice , SBI VC indicated that customer accounts would be ready by the transfer date, and they would not have to register afresh but would instead be transitioned automatically by the company. Both fiat and cryptocurrency held by former DMM users will be transferred to SBI, with the company inheriting reports of all transactions conducted on the fallen exchange. The Tokyo-based firm initially offered 24 virtual assets for trade on its platform, but its acquisition of DMM Bitcoin will add an extra 14 cryptocurrencies to its books, including Tron (TRX), The Sandbox (SAND), Algorand (ALGO), and Maker (MKR). Additionally, as part of the deal, SBI will take over all leveraged trading pairs previously offered by DMM except those it already provides. The company also clarified that it would not transfer any open positions in leveraged trading. Per the notice, staking stocks will be automatically triggered, with customers that held Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Oasys (OAS), Flare (FLR), and Hedera (HBAR) on DMM eligible for staking on SBI. They are expected to receive their first staking reward in April 2025 if they continue holding the assets. Hacking Fallout DMM Bitcoin announced its decision to stop operations after months of recovery efforts from a multi-million dollar attack at the end of May failed. The platform lost more than 4,500 BTC, valued at around $305 million, in what is Japan’s second-largest crypto breach after another exchange, Coincheck, lost $523 million worth of NEM tokens in a 2018 incident. The DMM hack is suspected to have been carried out by threat actors linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), known as TradeTraitor. In July, investigators revealed that over $35 million stolen from the exchange had been laundered via the infamous Cambodian online marketplace Huione Guarantee. At the time, pseudonymous on-chain detective ZachXBT likened the laundering techniques to those used by another DPRK-linked outfit, the notorious Lazarus Group. Soon after it was exploited, DMM immediately pledged to make affected customers whole. However, even after borrowing 50 million yen to reimburse users, the damage to its operations proved too great, leading to the decision to transfer all assets to SBI VC Trade. The firm confirmed the acquisition in a December 2 announcement, insisting that it would work to ensure a smooth transition for clients.

Is the Santa Rally already over?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-stocks-tumble-as-bitcoin-remains-stuck-at-95k-is-the-santa-rally-already-over/,"Wall Street’s so-called Santa Claus rally seems to have tripped over its own feet, while Bitcoin, the supposed king of volatility, is just sitting there like a lump, stuck at $95,000. Is this how we’re ending 2024? Flat stock performance, stagnant Bitcoin, and investors gnawing on their nails instead of celebrating a year-end windfall? The Dow barely scraped together a gain of 0.04%, the S&P 500 dipped by 0.02%, and the Nasdaq went completely nowhere. Treasury yields? Through the roof. The 10-year note hit its highest point since May, sitting at 4.58% before a late-day pullback. This surge in yields is a big problem for growth stocks, especially tech giants, which have propped up the market all year. Now, the “Magnificent Seven” are wobbling, and with them, the hopes of a December rally. Santa Claus rally hits a brick wall For those who don’t obsess over market quirks, the Santa Claus rally is a cute little phenomenon where stocks rally in the final trading days of the year, thanks to low liquidity, year-end bonuses, and tax-loss harvesting. It started to look promising earlier this week. Then reality smacked Wall Street upside the head. Mixed economic data, hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical tensions quickly killed the buzz. The Fed is holding firm on its less-than-dovish outlook for 2025, with way fewer rate cuts than markets were hoping for. Higher yields are squeezing growth stocks, which is terrible news for a market dominated by mega-cap tech. The S&P 500’s top ten stocks now account for 40% of the index’s market cap, a level that blows past the peak of the Dot-Com bubble. If these giants stumble, the rest of the market doesn’t stand a chance. New U.S. jobless claims data added to the tension. Initial claims dropped slightly, which sounds great, but ongoing claims climbed to their highest levels since 2021. Translation: People are losing jobs, and they’re struggling to find new ones. Combine that with uncertainty surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, and you’ve got a sense of the market chaos. Bitcoin’s glory days feel like ancient history Meanwhile, Bitcoin is sitting there doing absolutely nothing. It’s been bouncing between $92,500 and $96,000 for days now, a far cry from its December peak of $108,268. As of press time, it’s down 3.6% on the day, trading at $95,693. That’s a drop of over $3,500 in 24 hours, and the market capitalization is down to $1.89 trillion. Trading volume isn’t exactly inspiring either, clocking in at about $39.59 billion. This isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The entire crypto market feels sluggish. Analysts blame profit-taking after Bitcoin’s monster rally earlier this month, as well as tighter liquidity driven by the Fed’s hawkish cut. Still, there are glimmers of life. Institutional interest hasn’t dried up. MicroStrategy, always the Bitcoin cheerleader, added another $561 million worth of BTC to its stash. Bitcoin ETFs are still pulling in cash, with weekly inflows topping $300 million even in this downturn. But for the average trader, this kind of stagnation is painful. The Fear & Greed Index, which measures investor sentiment, is sitting at 54—smack in the middle of neutral territory. Will the Santa Claus rally make a last-minute comeback? Can Bitcoin escape its $95,000 prison? Or are we staring at the start of a rough 2025? No one knows.

The company recently forced Copilot onto Microsoft 365 users in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. And as if the decision wasn’t irritating enough, they slapped a price hike on top of it. In these regions, Microsoft 365—known for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—now includes Copilot whether customers want it or not. Users like Alistair Fleming, a YouTuber in Australia, are discovering that their monthly bills have surged. “It went from A$11 to A$16,” Fleming reportedly said, and all he got was a hyperactive AI assistant that wouldn’t leave him alone. “Every time I finished a line, its rainbow logo popped up, offering to ‘help.’ It’s annoying.” A desperate decision to profit from AI This aggressive rollout is all part of Microsoft’s plan to milk its massive investment in AI. Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s tech, is a key piece of CEO Satya Nadella’s strategy to expand the company’s software dominance. Earlier this year, Microsoft launched the premium consumer version of Copilot in the United States at $20 a month, on top of the standard $7 Microsoft 365 subscription. The company claimed it was a game-changing assistant, capable of generating emails, summarizing meetings, and creating entire PowerPoint presentations. But whether it’s worth the extra cash is a hotly debated question. Here’s the thing: people are not exactly lining up to use Copilot. Between May 2023 and mid-December, Copilot’s chatbot app was downloaded 37 million times, according to Sensor Tower. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT raked in a mind-blowing 433 million downloads in the same period. Microsoft might call this a “success,” but let’s not pretend Copilot is winning any popularity contests. For businesses, Copilot comes with an even heftier price tag—$30 per user. Corporate clients are Microsoft’s bread and butter, but the response to Copilot has been lukewarm at best. Many companies have doubts about its accuracy, data security, and whether it actually adds value. A Microsoft spokesperson refused to comment on how happy (or unhappy) corporate customers are, sticking to the usual “we meet global privacy standards” script. Microsoft wants to ditch OpenAI (sort of) While Copilot relies heavily on OpenAI’s technology, Microsoft is already working on alternatives. Reuters recently reported that Microsoft is building its own AI models, like Phi-4, and customizing open-weight models to power Copilot. The goal is to reduce costs and gain more control. This is a noticeable change from Microsoft’s earlier fanfare about its partnership with OpenAI. Back in March 2023, the company proudly announced Copilot’s reliance on OpenAI’s GPT-4. Now, Microsoft seems eager to tone down that reliance. It’s not cutting ties entirely though. OpenAI is negotiating to remove a clause from its agreement with Microsoft that limits the latter’s access to future artificial general intelligence (AGI) models. If this happens, Microsoft could maintain access to cutting-edge OpenAI tech without restrictions, even as it builds its own systems.

The Khao Kheow Open Zoo revealed that Buterin joined their Wildlife Sponsorship Program, pledging 10 million baht, or around $293,000 USD, to support Moo Deng and her family, in a Dec. 26 announcement . Buterin expressed in a post on X his commitment to supporting Moo Deng over the next two years “with my 10M THB donation, maybe more as I set aside 88 ETH for [pygmy hippopotamuses] + frens.” The move by Buterin spiked the memecoin’s price by as high as 70% to $0.0002446 before retracing to $0.0001924, which is a 55% increase in the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing Rexas Finance as a top pick for those who missed SHIB and PEPE. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Presale achievements Components: A unique ecosystem Ensuring investor benefits Conclusion Many investors who got in early on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have become extremely rich. But for those who missed these two tokens, there is a new token that has the potential to provide massive gains — Rexas Finance (RXS) . Rexas Finance shows great future promise due to its unique real-world asset features, strong tokenomics, and upcoming presale stages. This, along with a Certik audit completion and planned exchange listings, make it a great option for high returns. Rexas Finance: A new real-world asset investment mechanism Rexas Finance is at the helm of the tokenization process. Interested users will easily access high-value assets like real estate, fine art, and collectibles via blockchain tokenization through its platform. This method of investing will fence off a huge proportion of the market previously occupied by the affluent, making it possible for the average investor to join in. Instead of having the purchase barrier of millions to buy a piece of real estate, users will be able to buy fractionalized real estate with RXS tokens. To increase liquidity and lower costs, tokenization allows for filling a growing asset digitization shift that the market is seeing. The immense market potential that Rexas Finance promises, combined with its presale, makes it stand out. Presale achievements With a total of over 364 million tokens sold, the RXS presale has been immensely successful, raising more than $30 million through its stages. The presale started at $0.03 in Stage 1, growing over 400% to the stage 10 price of $0.15. The investors’ trust is quite clear from the performance of this presale. It shows that the fundamentals and the vision of the project are sturdy. Many other crypto projects get a lot of funding from VC firms, but Rexas Finance has managed to do well without a single VC firm, allowing a fairer start for early investors. The growth witnessed without any external support reiterates the strength of the project’s future.

Rexas Launchpad: This is meant for upcoming blockchain-based ventures that need exposure and assistance. Rexas Estate: Focused on real estate tokenization in a manner that will involve fractional ownership and more accessibility. Rexas Treasury: This will serve as a reliable source of investment for future development of the platform. These features will help mitigate challenges in the blockchain space, giving RXS the capacity to be a good and practical investment. The application of utility gives the platform a competitive advantage over other conjectural meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. Ensuring investor benefits Investing in cryptocurrency should be done with great consideration, as security comes first. RXS has been certified by Certik, ensuring that it adheres to safety and transparency measures. Many investors become hesitant about crypto owing to the prevalence of terms such as rug pulls and scams. However, with Certik’s backing, Rexas Finance seeks to be a more reliable investment. Additionally, Rexas Finance offers early investor giveaways worth up to $50,000 in RXS tokens just by referring friends or engaging with the community on social media. Unlike other obscure cryptocurrencies with lengthy processes, Rexas Finance is easy to buy. Connect a MetaMask wallet and use USDT or ETH to purchase RXS tokens. Investors have a fantastic opportunity to participate in the project during its low-cost presale rates. Conclusion As Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin were hyped years ago, Rexas Finance is a new promising investment. The combination of real-world tokenization, outstanding tokenomics, and a successful presale suggests a massive increase in value. With its planned $1 million giveaway and anticipated listings in 2025, Rexas Finance could be among the best cryptocurrency investments for those seeking life-changing results.

That’s $166 million an hour, $2.7 million every minute, and a mind-numbing $45,000 a second. It’s a figure so obscene yet it’s the reality of America’s financial position. This reckless spending has pushed the U.S. Debt-to-GDP ratio to 121%, a level not even reached during World War II. In comparison, it was just 60% in 2008, back when the Great Recession first hit, because yeah, it came back last year. Since 2020, the U.S. has added $13 trillion to its debt. That’s a 57% increase in under five years. Meanwhile, as 2025 approaches, prediction markets are betting there’s a 36% chance the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) might trim $250 billion from federal spending. Sounds like a lot, right? Except it wouldn’t even scratch the surface of the deficit problem. The dollar’s grip on global finance Despite this insane financial chaos, the dollar isn’t going anywhere. For decades, doomsayers have warned about the dollar’s downfall, but it keeps flexing like an undefeated champ. From the oil crisis of the 1970s to the rise of the euro, from Japan’s economic ascent to China’s manufacturing takeover, the dollar has seen it all—and survived. Why? Because the world has no other choice. Right now, over 60% of global reserves are held in dollars. About 90% of all foreign exchange trades involve the greenback. International trade invoices? Mostly in dollars. And let’s not forget U.S. Treasuries—the so-called “safe haven” for global investors. Other currencies, like the euro or the Chinese yuan, have tried to make a play for the top spot, but they just don’t have the same liquidity or trust. China, often hyped as the dollar’s biggest threat, has its own issues. The yuan accounts for a tiny fraction of global transactions and is tightly controlled by Beijing. Investors don’t trust a currency that can’t flow freely. Meanwhile, the euro had a strong debut but lost credibility after a series of debt crises rocked the eurozone. These problems have left the dollar as the last man standing in a very shaky financial world. The dollar’s dominance is woven into the fabric of global trade and finance. The U.S. can borrow at levels that would bankrupt any other country because the dollar is still the world’s default currency. But how long can this game go on? Debt: The privilege and the price For decades, the U.S. has leaned on what economists call its “exorbitant privilege.” Basically, the world trusts the U.S. government to pay its bills, so investors keep buying Treasuries no matter how much debt America racks up. This allows Washington to borrow trillions for wars, stimulus packages, or even public-health emergencies. But that trust isn’t unlimited. Critics warn that America’s debt addiction could eventually blow up in its face. The sheer scale of the debt—combined with those $4 billion-a-day interest payments—has people wondering how much longer the U.S. can live beyond its means. And it’s not like anyone has a plan. Barack Obama tried to rein in spending with a high-powered deficit committee, but their recommendations went nowhere. Donald Trump once called the dollar both “too strong” and “too weak” while pursuing massive tax cuts that ballooned the debt even further. Joe Biden hasn’t fared much better, pushing pandemic-era spending packages that added trillions more to the tab. What’s the long-term strategy here? No one seems to know. U.S. is the dollar’s worst enemy But even countries that criticize America’s policies rely on the greenback. China, for instance, might talk about “de-dollarizing,” but it still issues dollar-denominated bonds to attract investors. Saudi Arabia recently sold $2 billion in dollar bonds. Even the much-discussed BRICS currency is years away, if it happens at all. Until something better comes along, the dollar will stay on top. But let’s not pretend this is a good thing. The dollar’s dominance allows the U.S. to print money and pile on debt without facing the kind of crises that cripple other nations. This creates a dangerous feedback loop: Washington borrows because it can, and the world keeps enabling it because they don’t have another option. The real question isn’t whether the dollar will collapse—it’s what could trigger its decline. Some economists argue that America itself poses the biggest threat to its currency. Excessive sanctions, for example, have already pushed some countries to explore alternatives. If the Oval overplays its hand, it could accidentally speed up the search for a credible dollar rival, just as Russia’s president Vladimir Putin predicted.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the project says it has been working closely with a respected asset manager to create a FLOKI-based ETP for European inventors, set to launch in Q1 of next year. “We’ve been actively working with a respected asset manager and an ETP issuer to launch a Floki ETP for quite a while now. After months of due diligence and painstaking effort, we’ve been told that the Floki ETP is on track to go live in early Q1, 2025. This proposal is to have the Floki DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) approve liquidity for the Floki ETP!” An ETP allows investors to expose themselves to specific assets without the need to actually purchase them. In the proposal, the Floki team says the ETP is already in its advanced stages and will become tradable on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland, as soon as next year and become the second meme coin in the world with a live ETP. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way. This is a big move that is almost unprecedented in this space, because Dogecoin is currently the only memecoin in the WORLD, with a live ETP, and Floki could become the next memecoin with an ETP besides Dogecoin.” The proposal also includes provisions for burning FLOKI tokens as well as providing liquidity for the ETP. “The purpose of this DAO proposal is to seek approval from the Floki DAO for providing liquidity to the ETP… We currently hold 16,310,285,772.6 FLOKI tokens in [a crypto wallet] and propose using a portion of them to provision liquidity for the ETP while burning the remainder on the day the ETP launches.” FLOKI is trading for $0.000177 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 23:02:00

Table of Contents Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments 3 promising altcoins for last-minute Investment Lesser-known altcoins for last-minute investments As the cryptocurrency market approaches the end of 2024, investors are keenly observing altcoins that exhibit the potential for significant growth before the year’s close. While established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have garnered substantial attention, newer entrants like Pepe (PEPE) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are also capturing the market’s interest. This shift in attention underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where new projects can rapidly gain prominence, influencing trading strategies and market trends. Understanding the strategy for last-minute investments Investors are seeking final chances in the crypto marketplace hoping to earn cash before a new year. This period usually shows extra moves in the market with traders eager t͏o improve their stash for end-year outcomes. One way that is noticed is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves saving a set amount of cash at normal times, regardless of the market condition. This method reduces the impact of market rises and falls and cuts down the risk of making poor choices from fast market shifts. Another is Market Cycle Investing, which refers to timing funds on the crypto market’s circular nature. By checking old data and market trends, investors seek to buy when the market is down and sell when it’s up. There’s also a mix of investments. By spreading money over different types of digital coins, investors can handle risk and raise the chance for gains. Mixing helps to balance the ups and downs found in the crypto market. It’s key to know that while these me͏thods can work, they also have risks as the crypto market is always changing. As such, doing a deep study and matching buy choices with personal money goals and risk comfort is crucial.

The firm offering less volatile access to Bitcoin also holds U.S. Treasuries for liquidity. Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF Strive Asset Management, run by Vivek Ramaswamy, is filing with the SEC on a “ Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF. ” The 485A filing suggests investment landscapes shift from the old “follow the money” to new “follow the Bitcoin.” The proposed ETF is going to offer access to MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds, which have become so popular due to the potentially more favorable regulatory climate under the new administration. This is an important step by Strive as digital assets are gaining popularity in the financial world. The demand for MicroStrategy’s bonds that convert into stocks based on Bitcoin’s performance has been strong broader market for Bitcoin-related investments. There is also an expectation that following Donald Trump’s recent election victory, regulatory hurdles may ease for digital assets and more institutions will look at crypto-related financial products at ease. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Funds, has been open about the strategy of the fund, pointing out that he is going to focus on vehicles that would be best suited by having a digital asset-friendly administration. His comments give an insight into what might be expected in 2025. Investment Strategy and Objective Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF strategy lies investment in what they describe as “Bitcoin Bonds. ” These are convertibles from a company such as MicroStrategy that happens to plough large proportions of the proceeds of bonds into Bitcoin. The use of derivative instruments by this ETF will enable to managing their exposure in these securities. The main objective of this fund is to replicate Bitcoin for investors through these Bitcoin Bonds and derivatives, allowing the investor to have less volatile exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it. The fund will invest in U.S. government securities, primarily Treasuries, to ensure liquidity and support its derivative positions. It may also invest in other investment companies specializing in Bitcoin-related financial instruments to diversify its approach to capturing the potential of Bitcoin. It indicates the growing acceptance of bitcoin in traditional finance and thereby has portrayed a strategic change towards digital assets that will help redefine how investment strategies get built. With Ramaswamy’s background opposition to corporate governance norms as well as his firm, which opposes ESG; this particular ETF might find investors who are looking out for non-traditional options which highlights the Bitcoin’s aspects. As 2025 begins, this kind of ETF could set up a trend that encourages broader crypto integration into investment portfolios.

Analyst Breaks Down the Data",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/who-profited-during-bitcoin-100000-surge-analyst-breaks-down-the-data/,"Bitcoin ongoing price movement has sparked intense analysis as it continues to hover below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching an all-time high above $108,000 last week, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain upward momentum ever since. With this performance, BTC’s on-chain data has been brought to the spotlight to uncover the factors driving recent selling pressures and investor behavior. One key focus has been the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) indicator, which provides valuable insights into Bitcoin holders’ activity based on their holding periods. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? Who Cashed Out Their Bitcoin Gains? According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as Yonsei Dent, data reveals that Bitcoin investors who bought their holdings between six to twelve months ago were the most active sellers during the recent price surge. This group largely entered the market during the initial excitement surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in the year. While this selling activity exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, the asset has managed to stabilize within the $90,000–$100,000 range. Interestingly, long-term holders, defined as those holding Bitcoin for over a year, have shown minimal selling activity. Historical trends suggest that these seasoned investors are likely anticipating elevated price levels before considering substantial profit-taking. Meanwhile, Dent pointed to the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric showing a noticeable decline in older Bitcoin being moved in December compared to November. Historically, reduced activity from long-term holders during price corrections often signals market resilience and potential for future upward momentum. The analyst wrote: The ‘Binary CDD’ indicator at the bottom of the chart shows a decline in the selling of older Bitcoin in December compared to November. This suggests that many long-term holders may anticipate even higher prices before selling. Binance Reserves Signal Market Confidence Speaking of higher prices, another crucial metric suggesting a significant move brewing for Bitcoin comes from Binance’s Bitcoin reserves, which have been steadily declining since August. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted that Binance’s reserves recently hit their lowest level since January. This trend is significant because a similar decline earlier in the year preceded a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price. The reduction in exchange reserves typically indicates that investors are moving their Bitcoin holdings away from centralized exchanges and into private wallets. Such behavior suggests reduced selling pressure and a preference for long-term holding strategies. Historically, declining reserves on exchanges have often aligned with periods of strong market optimism and price rallies. Notably, as BTC currently still trades at a price of $95,567 down by 2.7% in the past day, the confluence of these factors—long-term holder confidence, reduced activity from older wallets, and declining exchange reserves—presents a cautiously optimistic picture for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors look to 1Fuel as Cardano (ADA) Ethereum (ETH) struggle. Table of Contents ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum ADA faces high-selling pressure Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Conclusion With the current retracements, some altcoins have found it difficult to regain momentum. Ethereum, which rose to $4,000, nearing its ATH of $4,792, has declined drastically. Cardano trails a similar path, falling below $0.91. Should there be more retracements, analysts suggest they might consolidate at their current values or experience further decreases. However, a new token, 1Fuel , has been gaining traction and recording an increase in sales. Currently, in its second phase selling at $0.012, 1Fuel has raised $835,000, with experts ranking it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy for 2025. ETH struggles to maintain bullish momentum In the past 24 hours, ETH has struggled to break out of $3,477 resistance and has assumed a bearish state with a high chance of ETH dipping below $3,300 before a rebound. ETH’s long/short ratio — a metric to track the ratio of buyers to sellers in the market — is at 0.98 and on the verge of entering 1, a bullish sign. This means that investors believe that ETH still has the potential to increase, allocating more funds to it. However, if ETH reverses from its current price, there’s a possibility of it dipping to $3,000, which will result in a massive loss for these investors. The uncertainty surrounding the ETH’s rally has caused investors to eye 1Fuel because of its potential offerings. 1Fuel has recorded a massive increment in its token presales, and it’s set to change the investment narratives in the cryptocurrency market in 2025. ADA faces high-selling pressure ADA is currently trading at $0.86. The token has seen a 9.63% decline in its trading volume. This indicates that there’s high selling pressure, pushing ADA’s price downwards. ADA may gain momentum if it drops into the $0.73–$0.63 range, where buyer interest is anticipated. However, investors should exercise caution, as market volatility could push prices below this range, leading to potential losses. Whales eye 1Fuel following ADA and ETH struggle Experts predict at least a 500% surge in price after 1Fuel launches on top cryptocurrency exchanges. Notably, investors will get a 30% APR on all their staked coins, meaning they can earn passively. 1Fuel will also support P2P trading on its platform, giving room for users to trade directly with other users at low fees. Furthermore, with 1Fuel, users will get a built-in AI-powered feature that will make all the functions in the cryptocurrency wallet easy for them to use, facilitating seamless transactions. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market regains momentum, coins like ETH and ADA have been finding it hard to join the bullish trend. However, 1Fuel is set to create a buzz in the altcoin market. The new crypto is currently selling at $0.012 but is expected to surge more than 100x once it hits top cryptocurrency exchanges. To learn more about 1Fuel, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

Table of Contents Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Bitcoin Conclusion A trader famed for accurately forecasting Bitcoin’s price movements now suggests that a meme token, currently priced at $0.0007, could soar to $1 in 2025. This bold prediction has caught the attention of the crypto world, sparking curiosity about the potential of this overlooked token. Trump ignites meme coin season — Catzilla set for takeoff Donald Trump’s comeback has lit a fire under the crypto market, with meme coins roaring back into the limelight. While blue-chip tokens make incremental gains, Catzilla is ready to leap ahead, positioning itself as the apex predator in this new meme coin renaissance. Trump’s vision of a pro-crypto America sets the stage for unparalleled growth, creating the perfect storm for meme coins to thrive. Among them, Catzilla stands tall, ready to shatter expectations and claim the throne. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s here to rewrite the playbook for decentralized finance. Starting at just $0.0002, Catzilla’s presale climbs to $0.0016 over 14 stages, offering early adopters significant growth opportunities. Stage 4 is live at $0.0006, with a 16.67% price increase looming. Catzilla doesn’t just offer investment opportunities; it empowers the community with its a unique referral system: 8% USDT on direct referral purchases. 2% USDT on second-tier referrals. 1% USDT on third-tier referrals. With BTC and other major coins seemingly losing momentum, Catzilla rises as the ultimate underdog poised for greatness. You might also like: 4 overlooked cryptos poised to turn $200 into half a million: Catzilla on spotlight Bitcoin Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, using blockchain technology to enable decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Its transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and earn BTC as rewards. With a capped supply of 21 million BTC and halving events that reduce miners’ rewards every four years, Bitcoin is designed to be scarce. This scarcity, along with increasing adoption, gives it potential as a digital store of value. Conclusion With BTC and other major coins showing less short-term potential, Catzilla steps up as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering a 700% ROI during its presale. Its triple utility empowers holders through governance, rewards, and staking. Catzilla seeks to unite enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom, inviting participation in the battle against crypto villains.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 00:22:00

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Jason Pizzino tells his 123,400 followers that investor sentiment indicates traders now are closer to the end of the bull market than the start. “Bitcoin and crypto ‘end-stage’ emotional volatility has dramatically increased which only suggests we are much closer to the end than the beginning of the cycle. That might seem like an obvious statement now, but wait until the market gets closer to the final top; it won’t be so obvious which is generally a signal within itself.” In an accompanying video update, Pizzino says historically, when the market gets excited and overconfident, stagnation tends to follow. “I think a lot of people believe this cycle should run until the end of 2025, but what if we’re seeing a lot of that excitement come back into the market? Every time it goes up, all I see is just everyone getting super bullish and then it pauses for a bit, corrects, and then we start on the next move. So I’m just keeping an open mind.” Source: Jason Pizzino/X The trader’s chart uses Bitcoin ( BTC ) as an example. According to Pizzino, the top crypto asset by market cap may correct or trade sideways all the way until October 2025. “Looking somewhere [between] Q2 out to Q3, just the beginning of Q4… Most people can’t handle six to 10 months. They talked about a drop of one month and they all freaked out yesterday, it’s absolutely bonkers out there, which is why I think we are in those final moves, basically the end of the cycle.” BTC is trading at $98,900 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

Bitcoin Average Coin Age Has Been Trending Up Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the recent trend in the Average Coin Age for Bitcoin. The “Average Coin Age” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of how long the average BTC token has been staying dormant for. A coin is said to be dormant when it sits still inside an address without being involved in any sort of transaction activity. The longer the coin stays in this state, the more it ‘ages’ up. Related Reading: XRP Jumps 4%, Whale Reacts With $69 Million Coinbase Deposit Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day and 365-day moving averages (MAs) of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the 30-day MA of the Bitcoin Average Coin Age has seen some sharp spikes this year, but also some equally steep declines. This would suggest that the investors have been participating in some phases of HODLing, but they have also not been shying away from taking some profits. On the whole, however, the holders have shown notable resolve, as the 365-day MA of the indicator has been in a constant state of uptrend since the end of the 2022 bear market. Statistically, the longer investors hold onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them at any point. As such, the fact that the investors have been increasingly preferring to keep their coins dormant can be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency’s price. Interestingly, this trend didn’t develop during the 2021 bull market, as even though the 30-day MA of the Average Coin Age saw a period of uptrend, the 365-day MA moved down throughout the year instead. This could imply the average investor has become smarter this cycle. In the short-term, the 30-day MA of the indicator has been rapidly climbing, which implies the Bitcoin market is currently in one of the phases of active accumulation.

Following the latest jump, nearly a third of the asset’s tokens in circulation haven’t been involved in a transaction since more than five years ago.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 01:45:00

Avalanche (AVAX) is riding high after traders spotted massive potential in FX Guy’s trading systems, aiming for up to 20x returns. Meanwhile, SEI (SEI) is turning heads with its lightning-fast Layer-1 blockchain, built to handle the demands of high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). These projects are grabbing attention for good reason—2024 is shaping up to be a year of bold moves and even bigger gains in the crypto space. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , a project with its eyes set on solving the very problems that have held crypto back from mainstream adoption. With a groundbreaking partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is about to make crypto transactions as simple as buying a cup of coffee. Its innovative features are designed for real-life usability, putting it in a league of its own.

Picture small businesses finally embracing crypto payments without worrying about complexity. Freelancers get paid instantly, without waiting for banks to clear funds. And regular users manage their digital assets with ease. With Qubetics, the barriers to entry are crumbling fast. The numbers speak for themselves. Qubetics’ presale is in its 14th stage, and it’s already sold over 377 million tokens to more than 11,800 holders, raising $7.8 million. Priced at just $0.0377 right now, $TICS tokens will see a 10% price increase this weekend as the 15th stage kicks off. If you’re looking to get in on the action, now’s the time to act. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling New Heights in 2024 Avalanche has cemented itself as a force to be reckoned with in decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming.

The token’s rally has gathered massive interest from large-scale investors, who have heavily invested in the token over the last few days. Related Reading: ONDO Faces 30% Correction Risk If It Loses $1.46 Support – Top Analyst New Solana Token Steals The Spotlight On December 17, the Pudgy Penguins Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project launched its official token, PENGU, on the Solana Blockchain. The token has moved through the ranks, flipping other Solana-based tokens and gathering massive attention in nine days. Pudgy Penguins, one of the largest NFT collections, consists of 8,888 unique cartoons of cute penguins and has a market capitalization of 205,757 ETH. In anticipation of the token launch, the project surged as the second-largest NFT collection, only falling behind CryptoPunks. Since its launch three years ago, the project has seen its community significantly grow and “cemented itself in the hearts and minds of everyday people and culture,” according to the project’s team. Additionally, it is expected to contribute to the project’s governance despite not having a specific use case announced yet. As such, the newly launched cryptocurrency aims to “expand its community and further widen the reach” of the project by allowing old and new users “to align” themselves with the penguins. According to CoinGecko data, the Solana-based memecoin debuted with a 500% surge to a market capitalization of $3.5 billion but registered massive volatility in the following days. Just hours after launching, PENGU’s price retraced over 50% before descending to a $1.4 billion market cap on December 20. The token hovered between the $0.025-$0.037 range over a few days, stabilizing around the range’s upper zone on Christmas Eve. Whales Fill Their Bags As PENGU Flips BONK Amid the market’s momentary Christmas Day gains, the token broke above this range and climbed to the $0.042 mark on Thursday morning, hitting a $2.6 billion market cap. During this 18% rally, the token flipped dogwifhat (WIF) and BONK to become the largest Solana memecoin by market cap, currently holding its position as the sector’s leader. PENGU became the fourth largest memecoin by this metric, just behind Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Additionally, in the last 24 hours, the token has seen a 25% increase in market activity, with a daily trading volume of $1.92 billion. According to on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain, Crypto whales have also noticed PENGU’s rally, with several large-scale investors filling their bags over the past week.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 03:03:00

If you’ve been keeping your eyes peeled on the crypto scene, you know that meme coins have taken the market by storm, and this month, there’s one standout that’s going to make your wallet roar with excitement. Forget the usual suspects; we’re talking about BTFD Coin and its epic festive offer. With its community-driven approach, innovative gaming features, and legendary presale numbers (more than $4.5 million raised to this day), BTFD Coin is leading the charge. If you thought the price was already a steal, hold on tight—thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can unlock a jaw-dropping 50% bonus ! This isn’t just any sale. The bonus draws inspiration from the iconic 1973 market crash, a time when savvy investors seized the moment and rode the waves to success. So buckle up, because BTFD Coin is ready to rocket into 2025. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin to Watch for the Long Haul When it comes to the best new meme coins to invest in this month, BTFD Coin has earned its spot at the top. Not only is it packed with insane features like high-yield staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that’ll keep you entertained for hours, and a strong, vibrant community, but it also offers an incredible opportunity for long-term growth. The festive 50% offer that you can unlock with the BIG50 code is the cherry on top. Let’s be real—who doesn’t love a good deal? Now, you might be wondering, “Why the 1973 market crash?” Well, it’s all about history repeating itself. Back in the ‘70s, the oil market crashed, and while many investors panicked, others saw an opportunity to buy in low and hold for the long term. Just like them, you’ve got the chance to grab BTFD Coin with a massive deal—before it potentially blows up and leaves everyone else in the dust. Let’s break it down with an investment example: If you put $6,000 into BTFD Coin at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d initially receive 46,153,846 $BTFD tokens. But here’s the kicker—with the BIG50 bonus, you’ll snag an additional 50% tokens, bringing your total to 69,230,769 coins. If the price rises to $0.0006 (a target many analysts are predicting), that investment could skyrocket to $41,538.46. ANDY: The Pepe Sidekick Changes the Game If you’ve been around the crypto scene, you’ve probably heard of Pepe, the meme king of crypto. Now, meet ANDY, Pepe’s lifelong best friend, who has finally decided to launch his own meme coin and show the world what he’s made of. ANDY is all about fun, memes, and good vibes. And while it might not have the same explosive growth as some of the bigger coins out there, ANDY has a dedicated fanbase and a unique position in the market. With a circulating supply of 1 trillion ANDY coins, the token is all about community, making it an appealing option for anyone who’s looking to hop onto the Pepe train. Currently, the price of ANDY is sitting at $0.000196, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.7 million. While the coin is currently down by about 14%, it’s still a solid contender in the meme coin race. If you’re looking for something a bit different, ANDY could be worth a closer look. DOGS: A Community-Driven Coin with a Woof Another contender in the meme coin world is DOGS, a coin that’s all about community ownership and fun vibes. Built on the TON blockchain, DOGS has already created a buzz by leveraging Telegram’s vast user base and incorporating meme culture into its core. If you’re part of the Telegram community, you’ve probably seen the iconic DOGS mascot popping up everywhere. However, like ANDY, DOGS has recently faced a bit of a dip, with the price down by around 7% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, the DOGS project is far from being counted out. It boasts a market cap of over $270 million and a dedicated following that keeps the coin’s spirit alive. With a circulating supply of over 500 billion coins, DOGS is another community-driven coin that’s worth keeping an eye on. How to Claim Your Bonus on BTFD Coin’s Presale Today If you’re ready to take advantage of this killer offer, here’s how you can claim your 50% bonus: Go to the Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50 , and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and take a look at the updated amount. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

ETH is now showing bearish signs and might slide below the $3,300 level. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,550 zone. The price is trading below $3,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bearish momentum if it settles below the $3,300 level. Ethereum Price Dips To Support Ethereum price struggled to continue higher above the $3,550 resistance and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin . ETH traded below the $3,450 and $3,420 support levels. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,225 swing low to the $3,543 high.

It is now testing the $3,300 support and is above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,225 swing low to the $3,543 high. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,380 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,420 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,500. A clear move above the $3,500 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. More Losses In ETH?

Meanwhile, Ethereum traders recently made some impressive profits, and one trader earned $1.1M from a leveraged short. Analysts also predict that ETH could outperform Bitcoin in early 2025. Ethereum ETFs, like BlackRock’s ETHA, are already gaining momentum by attracting millions in inflows, contrasting with Bitcoin ETFs. Vitalik Buterin Adopts Viral Pygmy Hippo Moo Deng Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, captured the internet’s attention by adopting Moo Deng, a pygmy hippopotamus that became a viral sensation earlier this year. The announcement was made by Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo on Dec. 26 through a post on X which revealed that Buterin contributed 10,000,000 Thai Baht (or $292,000) to support Moo Deng and her family as part of the Wildlife Sponsorship Program. The zoo is extremely grateful that Buterin will be supporting Moo Deng over the next two years. Moo Deng rose to fame in September of 2024 thanks to her playful personality and the widely shared videos posted by the zoo, which captivated audiences worldwide. After the adoption announcement, Buterin indicated that his support could extend further, and revealed plans to allocate 88 ETH, which is equivalent to over $290,000, to assist Moo Deng and her companions. Buterin’s philanthropy in 2024 also included a $180,000 Ethereum donation to the biotech charity Kanro, which came from meme coins that were sent to his wallet. The viral phenomenon of Moo Deng extended beyond just the confines of social media, and even inspired the creation of a Solana-based meme coin named MOODENG . Early investors reaped impressive profits from the token, and one trader transformed a $1,300 investment into $3.4 million. However, the token’s success was short-lived as its value plummeted by about 58% from its peak price of $0.62 in mid-November 2024. Data from Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, revealed that more than 99% of traders suffered losses or gained less than $1,000. Out of 8.5 million wallets, only 50 earned up to $1,000, while five wallets achieved profits between $1,000 and $10,000. Just one wallet managed to exceed $10,000 in earnings. Despite the financial turbulence, Moo Deng is still a symbol of joy and community engagement, now with the added support of one of cryptocurrency’s most influential figures. Trader Nets $1.1M on Ether Short MOODENG was not the only token that traders lucked out on. A crypto trader recently made more than $1.1 million in profit in just two days by strategically shorting Ethereum (ETH) during the current market correction. By using a 50x leveraged short position, the trader borrowed 19,186 Ether, worth more than $64.5 million, when its price was $3,428. This position was opened on Dec. 24, and also earned the trader over $680,000 in funding fees. According to blockchain data from Hypurrscan , the short position carries a liquidation price above $4,750. On-chain intelligence firm Lookonchain revealed that the trader faced a $1.2 million loss on the first day. However, the market's subsequent downturn flipped the position into a highly profitable trade. While leveraged trading can amplify returns, it still carries some serious risks. These risks took center stage in January of 2024 during an incident where a trader lost over $161,000 after being liquidated on a leveraged position. The past year has seen other traders make extraordinary profits in the volatile crypto market. Bitcoin’s historic climb past $100,000 on Dec. 5 was especially a boon for many, while meme coin traders also saw good returns. One such trader turned a $27 investment into $52 million over 600 days by capitalizing on PEPE’s meteoric rise. Another trader in May achieved a $46 million profit from a $3,000 investment in PEPE. Ether Poised for Breakout Traders can make even more money off ETH as the altcoin is showing potential for a breakout against Bitcoin in January 2025. TradingView data revealed that the ETH/BTC ratio strands close to 0.0356, and MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe suggested it could surpass 0.04 in January. The last time the ratio hit 0.04 was on Dec. 8, when ETH reached $4,018. Van de Poppe expects increased inflows into Ether in the coming month, while Bitcoin may experience outflows that could potentially consolidate its price. This shift could trigger an “altcoin run,” which happens when alternative tokens like Ethereum gain more market momentum. Already, key Ethereum ecosystem tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mantle recorded impressive price increases recently. Bitcoin , meanwhile, continues to trade below the $100,000 mark. Despite reaching the six-figure milestone on Dec. 5, its current performance contrasts with the enthusiasm building around Ethereum and altcoins. Analysts also predict that spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could outperform Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. Nate Geraci , the president of ETF Store, shared that inflows into ETH ETFs are aligning with those of gold ETFs and may accelerate even more in the near future. Pseudonymous trader Brent compared Ether’s current state to a ”ball forcibly held underwater,” which means that the altcoin has the potential for explosive growth. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen noticed earlier in December that the ETH/BTC ratio’s decline is either over or nearing its conclusion, which also sets the stage for potential growth over the next 6 to 12 months. Ethereum ETF Gains Momentum While Bitcoin ETFs Face Outflows BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), attracted almost $44 million in inflows on Christmas eve, bringing its total net assets to $3.65 billion, according to data from SoSoValue . In contrast, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) faced outflows of $188 million, contributing to an overall $338 million bleed from Bitcoin ETFs on the same day. Among the Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and ARK’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded outflows of $83.16 million and $75 million, respectively. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) stood out as the only product in the green, gaining $8.5 million in inflows. Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF also performed well after attracting roughly $6 million in inflows. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite the recent underperformance, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is still a standout success thanks to it amassing close to $54 billion in net assets in less than a year. This achievement cements its position as one of the most successful cryptocurrency stories of the year. Industry experts, including Bitwise, predict that the total Bitcoin ETF inflows next year could surpass those of 2024. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed the estimated holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, though the exact number of coins owned by Nakamoto is still unknown.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-27 03:30:47

The idea? To offer investors a way to gain exposure to firms embracing the “Bitcoin standard.” Curious what that means? Let’s break it down. A Closer Look at Bitwise’s Plan The proposed fund, called the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF , is no ordinary ETF. To qualify for inclusion, companies must hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their reserves. That’s not all. They also need a market capitalization of at least $100 million, daily liquidity of $1 million, and less than 10% of their stock privately held. Source : SEC Edgar Here’s where it gets interesting: the ETF doesn’t weigh companies based on their market size, like most funds do. Instead, it focuses on the value of their Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy, which holds a whopping 444,262 BTC, would dominate the ETF, even though Tesla owns far fewer Bitcoin (9,720 BTC) but has a much larger market cap. Each holding, however, is capped at 25% to keep things balanced. Bitcoin’s Growing Corporate Appeal Why are companies diving into Bitcoin? Partly because it’s great for their stock prices. Take KULR Technology Group , for instance. They bought 217.18 BTC for $21 million earlier this month. That decision paid off big time, boosting their stock price by 40%. And let’s not forget Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency has soared 117% this year, hitting a record high of $108,000 in December. Even now, it’s holding steady at around $95,800. It’s clear that Bitcoin’s appeal is only growing. What to Expect Bitwise’s ETF isn’t the only one vying for attention. Strive, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed for an ETF focused on Bitcoin bonds. It’ll be interesting to see how these competing proposals play out. For investors looking to bet on Bitcoin’s rising adoption, these ETFs could open exciting new doors. But as always with crypto, there’s a mix of potential and uncertainty.",News|Bitcoin ETF|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 03:54:28

Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created simultaneously, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This method transforms the blockchain into a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). By generalizing Nakamoto consensus, Kaspa achieves secure operation with very high block rates. Currently, it produces one block per second, aiming to increase to 10 blocks per second and potentially 100 in the future. This results in minimal confirmation times, primarily limited by internet latency. Kaspa’s implementation includes features such as Reachability to query the blockDAG’s topology and block data pruning, with plans for block header pruning. It supports Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and will later include subnetwork support, which will facilitate future layer 2 solutions. The coin introduces innovations in blockchain technology and addresses scalability while maintaining security. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s technological advancements may be noteworthy to those following developments in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While KAS and DOT are strong, XYZVerse’s pioneering all-sport memecoin unites fans and aims for massive growth, making it a standout in the bull run.

These activities, which include cryptocurrency theft and IT-related foreign currency generation, are said to be funding Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. Crypto Crimes Funding Military Developments In a press statement released on Boxing Day, the South Korean government announced it had designated 15 North Korean IT employees and one organization under independent sanctions. The individuals allegedly belong to the 313th General Bureau, an entity tied to the DPRK’s Ministry of Munitions Industry, which oversees the country’s weapons development programs. Among them, Kim-Cheol-Min is accused of working secretly for technology firms in the United States and Canada, funneling large sums of money to the North Korean regime. Another individual, Kim Ryu-Sung, previously faced indictment in the U.S. for violating sanctions. The measures will also target the Chosun Geumjeong Economic Information Technology Exchange Company, which is claimed to dispatch IT workers abroad to help generate foreign currency for North Korea. The money is reportedly used to finance military developments in the pariah nation. Once the sanctions come into effect on December 30, 2024, South Korean laws require that any financial transactions with the affected individuals and entities must receive approval from the Financial Services Commission or the Governor of the Bank of Korea. Growing North Korean Threat The restrictions against the alleged DPRK agents come even as a recent Chainalysis report revealed that North Korean actors were responsible for 61% of the $2.2 billion stolen in 2024 in crypto heists across the globe. The hackers used sophisticated tactics, including malware deployment and social engineering, allowing them to target major digital asset companies. In one instance, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Radiant Capital suffered a $50 million hack attributed to the North Koreans. The attackers orchestrated the breach through malware distributed via Telegram, exploiting weaknesses in the platform’s security. Additionally, the notorious hacking outfit, the Lazarus Group, has been linked to another $50 million heist, this time on the Upbit crypto exchange. South Korean authorities, in collaboration with the FBI and Swiss prosecutors, confirmed the group’s involvement and shed light on its ties to the DPRK’s main intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Kaspersky Labs security analyst Vasily Berdnikov also connected the syndicate with an elaborate hacking plot that involved cloning a popular blockchain game and embedding malicious code within its website, allowing it to install malware on the systems of anyone playing the game. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have been tackling related issues.

All attention is now drawn to 1Fuel (OFT) , the token behind the cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet in development to simplify transactions. Experts say that at presale stage 2, with over $800,000 raised so far, its current price of $0.012 is a bargain. Here’s a deeper look: ADA falls below $1 as investors back off Investors in ADA are backing out one after the other, as reflected in the weeks of decline. ADA dropped by 12% in the past week alone, placing it at $0.91 at press time with technical indicators hinting at further decrease. Investors are closing their positions on ADA as the only hope for a bounce back hinges on a descending channel, involving prices dropping lower (within a support and resistance line) before bouncing higher. Analysts say ADA could fall as low as $0.60 before any major upward momentum occurs. With ADA’s trading volume declining by 9.90% and its price dropping 1.61% in the last 24 hours, this suggests a market divergence with possible exhaustion in the buying, indicating an incoming decline. Investors, not wanting to be caught in this downside murkiness, are leaving ADA and seeking better alternatives. XRP has also been ruled out as a profitable asset to purchase. XRP investors might begin opting out After a month-long rally, XRP has now dropped. Over the past 7 days, it caused investors to lose 5.36%, falling as low as $1.9. However, XRP is currently trading within a consolidation channel known as an asymmetrical triangle. The price trading in this channel involves a slow and steady buying of the asset (in this case, XRP ) at a low price before a final upswing. However, this phase could last weeks or even months, leaving investors uncertain about when a meaningful rally will surface for XRP . Following the recent downturn and the lack of a definitive date for a rally, investors are turning to 1Fuel . With its presale price at $0.012, experts claim it is the cheapest cryptocurrency to buy in 2024 . 1Fuel: Investor’s yield generator, ahead of ADA and XRP 1Fuel has become the talk of the crypto community as its presale stage 2 has generated $800,000 in nearly two weeks, driven purely by market interest. Experts project that 1Fuel could deliver 100x returns by the end of its presale and upon the launch of its associated wallet. The wallet aims to solve critical pain points in the crypto ecosystem, including cross-chain transaction inefficiencies, unified gas fees, and streamlined off-ramp and on-ramp solutions. With a clear roadmap and strong market interest, 1Fuel is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the best crypto investments of 2024 . Conclusion As one of the best crypto investments of 2024 , with the potential to return 100X and backed by the anticipated cryptocurrency wallet , it is without doubt that experts are correct in predicting 1Fuel’s potential to outperform other crypto assets in the market, ADA and XRP inclusive.

Solana and Its Role In Blockchain Technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for speed and scalability. It allows developers to build decentralized applications while competing with platforms like Ethereum. The system processes transactions quickly without relying on sharding or side chains. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is used for transaction fees, program execution, and network rewards. Its architecture supports developers with tools across various programming languages. This versatility makes Solana suitable for hosting projects requiring high performance. The coin’s value is tied to its ecosystem’s growth and adoption. SOL appeals to those looking for efficient blockchain solutions. The focus on high capacity and developer-friendly tools positions Solana as an option for scalable innovations in blockchain technology. Avalanche: Efficient Blockchain with Customizable Subnet Functionality Avalanche is a fast, energy-efficient blockchain with low fees. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second and finalizes them in under two seconds. Its structure includes three chains for specific tasks like transactions and smart contracts. Users can create custom Subnets tailored to specific needs. The network uses a hybrid consensus model combining classical and Nakamoto methods. AVAX, its native token, is used for fees, staking, and running Subnets. It can also support payment systems and the creation of custom blockchains. This combination of speed, functionality, and adaptability makes Avalanche and AVAX appealing in the evolving blockchain market. Conclusion While Solana and Avalanche may offer steady growth, they show less short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN embodies luxury and success for those seeking the best. With expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN is poised to dominate this altcoin season, building a community of alpha leaders who settle for nothing less.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 04:30:00

Positioned as the most explosive crypto opportunity of the year, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers investors a rare chance to capitalize on a New Year’s miracle of unprecedented proportions. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 65,500% Rally That Could Define Your New Year WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly rising as one of the most thrilling tokens in the cryptocurrency landscape. While the Cardano price is expected to surpass $5 by March 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is capturing global investor attention with a predicted jaw-dropping 65,500% surge by January. Experts attribute this explosive potential to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) groundbreaking utilities, including an AI-powered, decentralized platform loaded with cutting-edge features like AI-enhanced portfolio management, a multimodal chatbot, and convenient QR-based Scan & Pay solutions. These innovations ease DeFi investments, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a market leader and a long-term asset for generating massive gains beyond January 2025. Furthermore, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) security features appeal to institutional and retail investors as they guarantee the safety of user assets.

With analysts forecasting a 65,500% surge by January and the possibility of extending gains to 75,000%, investors are looking at WallitIQ (WLTQ) as more than an opportunity but a revolution. . ADA’s $5 Breakthrough: Cardano Price Prediction For 2025 The Cardano price has been steadily gaining traction as one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. With a promising roadmap and robust technological advancements, analysts now predict the Cardano price could break the $5 milestone from $0.897 by March 2025, making it a key contender in the race for blockchain dominance. A major driver for this projected surge in the Cardano price is its revolutionary proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which offers unparalleled energy efficiency and scalability. As more developers flock to the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, the demand for ADA, the native token, continues to rise. This growing adoption fuels optimism that the Cardano price will skyrocket in the coming years. In addition, Cardano’s (ADA) strategic partnerships and expanding utility further solidify its position as a market leader. From powering decentralized applications to facilitating secure smart contracts, the platform’s versatility is attracting investors. Experts believe these developments could catapult the Cardano price into uncharted territory. As the crypto market matures, regulatory clarity and institutional interest are also expected to play a pivotal role in ADA’s growth. With these favorable conditions, the Cardano price breaking $5 by March 2025 seems increasingly plausible. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale: The Future Of Crypto Growth Starts Here While the Cardano price climbs toward the $5 milestone, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the true standout in the crypto world. Predictions point to an astonishing 65,500% surge by January 2025, positioning WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the most bullish asset on the market. Backed by a successful SolidProof smart contract audit , WallitIQ (WLTQ) is earning trust among investors, while its presale price of just $0.0243 offers an unbeatable opportunity for massive returns. Combining reliability with unparalleled growth potential, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has quickly become the go-to token for those aiming to achieve life-changing profits by 2025. With demand skyrocketing, WallitIQ (WLTQ)’s presale is selling out rapidly, making this a limited opportunity to secure a position in this high-growth token. Experts anticipate that the token’s value will soar by 65,500% in the coming months, offering a rare chance to transform your portfolio.

This optimistic outlook is driven by India’s progressive efforts to create frameworks that build trust, boost innovation, and expand blockchain use. India’s Growing Importance in Crypto Regulation India’s growing role in cryptocurrency regulation is gaining attention, especially as 2024 marked major advancements in crypto adoption and institutional interest, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $108K . One of the defining moments was the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Therefore, Vishal Sacheendran, Head of Regional Markets at Binance, believes India will take the lead in global crypto regulation by 2025, helping to build trust and support growth in the industry. Sacheendran also highlighted Binance’s efforts to keep up with India’s changing rules. The company has been working to grow its presence in the country, showing its commitment to offering safe and legal crypto services. Sacheendran further notes that the future of crypto is not just about trading but about creating a decentralized and innovative digital ecosystem that benefits everyone. India’s Shifting Stance Towards Crypto India’s journey toward crypto regulation began in 2019 with a draft bill proposing a complete ban on cryptocurrencies. However, this bill was never presented in Parliament, and over time, India’s approach became less strict, influenced by global trends. During a recent Parliament session , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has advised the government to create rules for cryptocurrencies. Still, the government believes that any ban would need global cooperation. However, the government has also introduced taxes on virtual assets. A 30% tax on crypto profits began on April 1, followed by a 1% TDS from July 1. These rules have caused a drop in trading activity on crypto exchanges in India.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 04:50:11

You don’t just buy coins and hope they go up anymore. Strive Asset Manager, a firm founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is pushing the boundaries with a new kind of fund. They’ve filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF, which could let investors profit from companies that are big on Bitcoin—without directly owning any. Strive files for “Bitcoin Bond” ETF… Would seek exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy. pic.twitter.com/ybJjbVFWUN — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 26, 2024 If that sounds a bit confusing, don’t worry. The idea is actually pretty simple. Companies like MicroStrategy have been using bonds to invest in Bitcoin for years. Strive wants to bring that strategy to investors like you. What Exactly Are Bitcoin Bonds? Bitcoin bonds aren’t actually Bitcoin. They’re more like loans companies take out. MicroStrategy, for example, issues bonds to raise cash, which they then use to buy Bitcoin. These bonds are interesting because they can turn into shares of the company later. It’s a risky move, but for MicroStrategy, it’s been a jackpot. Their stock has soared over 2,200% since 2020. Strive’s ETF wants to jump into this space. Instead of just buying Bitcoin, the fund would invest in these bonds. It’s an active approach, meaning managers make decisions on which bonds to pick. They might also use tools like swaps and options to maximize returns. Source : SEC Edgar The fees haven’t been announced yet, but actively managed funds typically cost more than regular index funds. Whether or not that’s worth it will depend on how the Bitcoin bond ETF performs. Politics and Crypto: How Does Ramaswamy Fit In? Let’s talk about Vivek Ramaswamy for a second. He’s not just some Wall Street guy. He’s also a major political player. In 2023, he ran against Donald Trump in the Republican primaries. After losing, he turned around and endorsed Trump. Now, the two seem to be working toward a common goal—making the U.S. a leader in innovation, including crypto. Under Trump, the crypto world has seen some big shifts. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins is set to lead the SEC, and David Sacks, PayPal’s ex-COO, has been named “AI and Crypto Czar.” These moves suggest a friendlier attitude toward crypto, which could make it easier for funds like Strive’s ETF to get approved. What’s Next for Bitcoin Investors? If Strive’s ETF gets the green light for the Bitcoin bind ETF, it could open the door for a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Instead of dealing with the ups and downs of owning Bitcoin directly, people can invest in bonds tied to the cryptocurrency. It’s less risky in some ways, but still gives exposure to Bitcoin’s growth. This isn’t just about one fund, though. It’s part of a bigger trend of blending traditional finance with the crypto world. As more companies adopt Bitcoin into their strategies, tools like this ETF could make it easier for everyday investors to get involved. This shows how Bitcoin is making its place in the financial world.

Bitcoin (BTC) price backtracked to the $96k level, whereas Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP mirrored a slumping movement.

Besides, the total market volume from yesterday witnessed a 5% increase to $123.46 billion. Let’s delve deeper into the top coins and their price action on December 27. Crypto Prices Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, & XRP Take Heat Amid the broader market’s recent volatility due to the U.S. Fed’s Hawkish stance with rate cuts, top cryptos such as BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL face heat across the broader market.

Notably, ETH’s futures OI witnessed a marginal 1% increase to $23.47 billion. Moreover, the derivatives volume rocketed 29% in value to $35.69 billion. Market watchers continue to eye the crypto for further price action shifts amid a broader turbulent market.

However, despite the recent correction, a CoinGape report revealed that Solana could reach between $400 and $500 in this cycle. XRP Price Today At press time, XRP price dipped nearly 3.5% and is currently trading at $2.18. Its intraday low and high were $2.13 and $2.25, respectively.

Salame and Ellison pleaded guilty to the charges against them, which were criminal fraud charges and seven federal counts of fraud and conspiracy, respectively. With their guilty plea, they saved themselves and the prosecution from a lengthy trial process. Both of them pleaded guilty in 2023 and were sentenced this year in May. Rewarding the cooperation of the fraudulent FTX execs In the federal prison system, inmates can earn sentence reductions through good behavior and participation in rehabilitation programs. Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison. She began her sentence at the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution on November 7. She was scheduled to be released in October of 2026, but prison records state that her release date is now July 20, 2026. The new release date is more than three months shy of two years. Ellison’s attorneys declined to comment, but the early release can be attributed to the fact that Ellison was a star witness in the criminal trial against her ex-boyfriend, Sam Bankman-Fried. Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in federal prison and began his sentence in October. He was due for release in April of 2032, but now his release date, as listed on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, is March 1, 2031. This new date is over a year earlier than his initial release schedule. Salame’s attorneys have also not commented on the matter. However, a spokesperson of the Bureau of Prisons stated that incarcerated individuals could earn time off their sentences for good behavior under the 2018 First Step Act, according to a Business Insider report. Singh, who was arrested alongside the other executives, assisted the prosecution and testified against Bankman-Fried. He got no prison time. The infamous FTX implosion 2022 Before it went bankrupt, FTX was a leading crypto exchange globally, while its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), had achieved near superstar status, making waves even in political circles. The exchange platform was associated and endorsed by public figures and it was believed to be the gold standard for safe and secure cryptocurrency trading. The platform quickly collapsed in 2022 when users pulled their funds following rumors about FTX’s improper ties to Alameda Research. SBF was the CEO of FTX, and his girlfriend at the time, Caroline Ellison, led Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund founded by Bankman-Fried before the creation of FTX. After the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried, his girlfriend Caroline Ellison, Ryan Salame and Nishad Singh were all promptly arrested on criminal fraud charges. The mastermind behind the operation, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The prison records currently have no date listed for his release.

This marks a significant drop from its November 22 peak of $0.000053. Open interest in BONK has also fallen to $8.32 million, the lowest in three months, as traders shift their focus to other assets. Despite these setbacks, BONK remains a low-cost token with a strong community and hopes of regaining its top spot in the meme token market . Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 Massive Token Burn to Revive Interest In a big move to boost its value, Bonk DAO burned 1.69 trillion tokens, reducing the total supply from 100 trillion to 91 trillion. This burn, worth over $52 million, was approved by 99% of the community and completed in a single Solana transaction. The burn was part of BONK’s second-anniversary celebration, aiming to reduce supply and make the token more valuable. Community Participation The token burn campaign, which ran from November 15 to December 25, involved the community through social media activities and collaborations with ecosystem partners. Bonk DAO’s wallet still holds 9% of the total supply, making it the largest holder, even surpassing Binance. Additionally, 4.8% of the supply is locked in staking pools, further limiting the number of tokens in circulation. Challenges and Competition Despite this significant token burn, BONK’s price has not seen a major rally. Newer Solana meme tokens like Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU and DogWifHat (WIF) are gaining popularity . PENGU, with a market cap of $2.4 billion, has surpassed BONK as the leading Solana meme token .

XRP’s price has remained above the $2 region despite the bear’s attempts to push it to former lows. Despite a sharp dip on Friday, when the price dipped below the $2 level, sending FUD among investors, XRP still enjoys an over 40% monthly surge. Similarly, Tron has steadily risen, aiming to surpass $1 by 2025. Tron price movement has already recorded a monthly surge of over 13% with a YTD of 135%. Like Ripple and Tron, Lunex Network is also eying impressive gains, increasing 300% to hit the $0.0048 price target. This remarkable gain has been attributed to the project’s unique features, which include a no-KYC check. Lunex Network’s No KYC Requirement Lures More Investors Lunex Network is set to disrupt the DeFi market with a no-KYC check approach to decentralized finance. Unlike most projects associated with invasive KYC policies, Lunex Network aims to provide users with the best level of privacy, allowing them to stake, trade, and manage their assets efficiently. This unique approach will help simplify the Lunex onboarding process while making the DeFi space more open and diverse. Lunex Network also elevates users’ experiences with cross-chain solutions, allowing them to swap over 50K tokens across 40-plus blockchains. This unique feature allows users to carry out transactions quickly and at a lower cost than other platforms. Currently, the LNEX token is priced at $0.0048, a significant rally from its starting price of just $0.0012. The project has collected over $5.5M in presale revenue and is targeting $6M by the end of 2024. Its unique features, including anonymity, decentralization, and security, place it in a better position to gain more in Q1 of 2025. Ripple Bulls Outshine The Bears Ripple’s bulls managed to overcome the bears, forcing a reversal in XRP’s price . This move confirms Ripple’s strong support, which could increase its price. Its relative strength index is also above the midline, meaning the bulls are still in charge. Additionally, the debut of XRP’s anticipated RLUSD stablecoin added fuel to the crypto’s price movement. Ripple is also in talks with Bitstamp about plans to build a derivatives exchange on Ripple’s Ledger, which might boost XRP’s price in 2025. The Fibonacci retracement levels of 0.382, 0.5, and 0.618 are also critical in identifying XRP’s resistance and support levels during its correction period. A breakout above its triangle pattern could signal bullish momentum, targeting previous highs. According to CryptoFayZ ’s price prediction for XRP, the token’s bullish breakout might see it hit $5 soon. Tron Hits Record Revenue While Eying the $1 Milestone by 2025 Tron recorded $21.66M in revenue on December 3, 2024. This impressive accomplishment led to widespread attention, boosting the demand for Tron. The growth of altcoin, hovering within the $0.24 region , has been remarkable. Since Tron’s launch in 2017, when the RTX token was priced at just $0.0019 during presale, the altcoin has already delivered exceptional returns. This unique performance highlights the transformative opportunities that early investments in cryptocurrency can offer. Its technical indicators including the relative strength index at 47, however, point to a neutral position. Despite this, its growing adoption and network developments could help Tron’s price achieve a $1 milestone in 2025. Its impressive performance and increasing revenue streams position Tron’s future in the positive, making it a standout option for investors seeking massive returns in 2025. Will LNEX Match Ripple and Tron Price Movements? Ripple and Tron are among the top altcoins with the unique ability to record significant growth in 2025. Nonetheless, Lunex Network’s no-KYC feature and unique cross-chain swap feature put it in a better position to enjoy more substantial gains and attract more investors while eying the $1 region.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 05:53:00

Experts Warn of Major Crash,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-to-crash-hard-to-60k-experts-warn-of-major-crash/,"The post Bitcoin Price To Crash Hard To $60K! Experts Warn of Major Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has been struggling recently, experiencing a noticeable decline over the past two weeks. As BTC dropped to $95,120 , the crypto enthusiast is in fear of a massive crash ahead. A prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that several prominent figures in the crypto industry have warned that Bitcoin’s price could potentially fall to $60K. Drop Below $95K Could Trigger Crash Ali Martinez highlights a prediction from Tone Vays, a well-respected figure in the crypto space. Vays warns that if Bitcoin’s price falls below $95,000, it could set the stage for a sharp correction down to around $73,000. Some investors are already preparing for this possibility. In fact, over the past week, more than 33,000 Bitcoins , worth around $3.23 billion, were moved to exchanges, suggesting that traders are preparing for further decline. A Repeat of the 2018 Crash? Another notable figure mentioned by Martinez is Peter Brant, a veteran trader who famously predicted the Bitcoin crash in 2018. Brant has voiced concerns that Bitcoin might break below a key technical pattern, the expanding triangle, which could lead to a drop to around $70,000. Hey trolls — this is not a prediction. Just always pointing out possibilities, not probabilities, not certainties. No screen shot is necessary $BTCA right angled broadening triangle could project back into the 70s and a test of the parabolic modality pic.twitter.com/n5sy6DxAMb — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 20, 2024 Interestingly, on December 23rd alone, Bitcoin saw over $7.1 billion in realized profits, which could indicate that many traders are capitalizing on the current volatility. Could Bitcoin Hit $60,000? Martinez also brings up predictions from Mark Newton, Managing Director at Fundstrat, and analyst Benjamin Cohen. Both have expressed concerns that Bitcoin’s price could eventually fall to the $60,000 range. Cohen suggests Bitcoin’s price could follow a similar path to other assets like the QQQ, which could result in a crash around the time of political events, such as on Donald Trump’s presidential oath days. Yet, Bullish Hope for Bitcoin! Despite the bearish predictions, out that Bitcoin recently broke a key support level at $97,300. For the bearish outlook to be avoided, Bitcoin would need to rise above this level and stay above $100,000. If this happens, Bitcoin could see a new rise, with some experts predicting prices could reach $168,500. Amidst fears of a crypto crash, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index remains in the “Greed” zone at 74. This suggests that some traders are still hopeful and believe Bitcoin could experience a massive breakout soon.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 05:56:56

As one of the most established crypto trading platforms, HTX has consistently strived for breakthroughs, leading the industry development with premium products and services. The futures business has been a key focus for the platform this year. Through sustained efforts, HTX has achieved significant progress in this domain. Data shows that the platform’s total futures trading volume in 2024 has reached approximately $900 billion so far, representing a 70% increase compared to 2023. Additionally, the scale of futures trading exhibited a steady month-over-month growth trend. The success stems from two factors. On the one hand, HTX’s team has stayed ahead by closely following the latest market trends and hotspots, continually expanding its asset map. Over the year, the platform listed more than 80 new futures trading assets, with nearly 70 of them experiencing growth rates exceeding 200%. By December 2024, HTX had supported over 160 futures trading assets, providing users with a diverse range of trading options. On the other hand, HTX’s proactive optimization and bold innovations in futures products have played a pivotal role in its growth. Notably, the introduction of its exclusive product, “SmartEarn,” has redefined industry standards while presenting users with unique revenue opportunities. SmartEarn Draws Over 260,000 Users, Becoming an Instant Hit SmartEarn, a pioneering Earn product created by HTX, officially launched on November 14. It enables users to earn a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) on the assets in their Futures account, regardless of whether they are holding a position or not. SmartEarn’s zero-threshold requirement, high flexibility, and high yield perfectly align with the needs of futures users, making it an instant success. As of December 26, just over a month since its launch, SmartEarn has attracted more than 260,000 users. Offering a 6% APY on funds in Futures accounts and the lowest funding rate for futures positions, SmartEarn empowers HTX’s futures business with a significant boost. The total futures trading volume has increased by 88% over the past 30 days, and the Q4 futures trading volume has surged by 50% compared to Q3. Users have also reaped significant benefits, with the highest individual earnings for SmartEarn users reaching up to 24,641 USDT. In addition to launching this groundbreaking product, HTX continues to enhance its existing features. In 2024, HTX completed more than 30 upgrades to its futures services, including TP/SL price protection and real-time position updates. In an effort to improve the user experience, HTX has launched 15 enhancements to its futures copy trading product, including the ability for users to follow multiple lead traders and optimize the trader ranking system. As of November 2024, the user base of HTX’s copy trading has experienced a remarkable growth of over 700% compared to the start of the year. Today, HTX Futures, powered by an outstanding user experience and with SmartEarn as its flagship product, have become a major player in the highly competitive field of crypto derivatives. Year-End Highlights: Three New Futures Products Scheduled for Successive Launches As 2024 winds down, HTX is still ramping up efforts to enhance user experiences. Right now, three new futures products have either gone live or are arriving soon. Zero-Cost Futures Position Event Recently, HTX launched the Zero-Cost Futures Position Event to offer newcomers an effortless entry into futures trading. This event offers free futures positions. By participating, users will receive predefined positions, including specific trading pairs, leverage, direction, and size. This allows them to get accustomed to futures trading mechanics and gain hands-on experience in a live trading environment. If a user’s position results in a profit, the gains will be credited as Futures Trial Bonuses to their Futures account, offering opportunities for future gains. However, losses in this position will not affect their account balance. Futures Grid HTX is set to upgrade its futures grid functionality by the end of December, offering users a smarter, strategy-based trading tool. This upgrade boosts capital efficiency while minimizing risk, making it well-suited for seizing opportunities in volatile markets. Once users set their futures grid parameters, the bot will handle the execution, freeing them from the need to monitor the tiny changes in the tickers. What’s even better, HTX charges no extra fees for this service. Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading Around Lunar New Year 2025, HTX will launch Multi-Assets Collateral for Futures Trading, allowing traders to use multiple assets as collateral for trading the USDT-M futures. This new feature will provide a more convenient trading experience, especially for users trading futures with multiple assets. 2024 has seen HTX achieve impressive results in boosting the competitiveness of its futures products. The success of SmartEarn, coupled with the substantial growth in futures trading volume and the number of futures traders, stands as a testament to user recognition of HTX’s efforts. This recognition has been a key driver of HTX’s innovation. Looking ahead to 2025, HTX will continue to optimize its futures services and products, focusing on enhancing core trading functions and the copy trading section. More efforts will be made to increase liquidity, with a particular focus on strengthening the market depth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular cryptos to ensure a smoother trading experience. Furthermore, HTX will continue to drive the comprehensive development of its ecosystem. By delivering exceptional user experiences, generating wealth effects, implementing robust security strategies, and deploying cutting-edge technologies, the platform will solidify its leading position in the cryptocurrency industry. In 2025, HTX is poised to outperform expectations.

As a result, the large-cap altcoin, with a total valuation of about $406 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $23 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level. With the TOTAL2 having already retested the previous all-time high (ATH), around $1.6 trillion, Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards $5k soon. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been forming a macro reversal pattern, coupled with the bullish divergence on the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI). Ethereum Whales Prepares for Major Uproar With Bitcoin price having outperformed the majority of large and mid-cap altcoins in the past two years, whale crypto investors have been repositioning their portfolios in preparation for a parabolic altseason. Moreover, the Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI) and volume recently surged to a new ATH of above $23 billion. According to on-chain data analysis provided by Coinglass, the overall supply of Ethereum on centralized exchanges declined from 16.12 million on November 29, to hover about 15.3 million at the time of this writing. The notable decline of Ethereum on CEXes is majorly attributed to the rising demand from the U.S. spot Ether ETF issuers. Led by BlackRock’s ETHA, and Fidelity’s FETH, the US spot Ether ETF issuers have attracted more than $2.64 billion in cumulative total net inflow since inception, thus a total assets under management of about $12.01 billion. On Thursday, the US spot Ether ETFs registered net cash inflows of about $117 million and a total value traded of around $390 million. Meanwhile, on-chain data analysis shows a while investors withdrew 1,500 Ether, worth $5.21 million, from Binance in the last 24 hours. Ethereum rebounds from crucial support, setting the stage for a potential rally. Read Ethereum price prediction for the latest market insights! What Next? From a technical analysis standpoint, Ethereum price has rebounded from a falling logarithmic trend, which formed year-to-date, thus signaling potential bullish uproar in the near term.

Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/meme-index-memex-raises-450k-in-presale/,"The post Next Crypto to Explode? Meme Index (MEMEX) Raises $450K in Presale for First Decentralized Meme Coin Index appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The festive season did wonders for Meme Index ($MEMEX) , as it smashed through the $450K milestone in its presale just after Christmas. Meme Index is a unique platform that offers the first-ever decentralized index for meme coins. Rather than just investing in a single token, Meme Index bundles numerous tokens into four baskets, each with a different risk and upside profile. Instead of betting on a single token, investors can choose an index—or multiple indexes—to determine how aggressive or conservative they’d like to be. The whole platform is built around its native $MEMEX governance token, which is currently live in presale. Currently, $MEMEX is priced at just $0.0146285, but it will increase within 48 hours when the next presale phase starts. A Strong Year for Meme Coins One of the biggest crypto trends of the year has been the rise of meme coins, with the sector collectively reaching a value of $137 billion at one point. Some of the hottest meme coins, like Pepe ($PEPE) and Mog Coin ($MOG), saw an over 1,200% upside in 2024 alone. There are also lesser-known projects like Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), which blew the market away with a 2,000% gain since November. While these successes are hard to ignore, they also reveal how volatile meme coins can be. That’s where the Meme Index comes in. It helps investors hedge their bets by diversifying risk into various coins rather than concentrating their investment on a single bet. One Governance Token for Four Indexes As we saw above, Meme Index has four indexes. $MEMEX holders govern all four indexes and any future updates. If a new meme coin takes off and the community wants to add it to an index, $MEMEX token holders can propose and vote on it. Each index has a different level of risk and upside. Investors can choose a level of risk that aligns with their objectives. For instance, the Titan Index concentrates on the top 10 meme coins with a market cap exceeding $1 billion (such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE). While it provides exposure to established meme coins, it still carries more volatility than standard large-cap cryptos. It could be the right choice if you want to avoid more obscure meme tokens. Conversely, the Moonshot Index features coins that are either listed or about to be listed on top exchanges but have yet to attain a $1 billion market cap. This is ideal for those who want to gain exposure to growing coins without investing too heavily in speculative projects. Next on the list is the Midcap Index . It includes meme coins with a market cap between $50 and $250 million. This tier can bring high reward potential if a token moves up to the next tier, though it comes with added volatility. The last one is the Meme Frenzy Index , a high-stakes basket of brand-new meme coins that may soar to the moon or crash to the ground in days. This option is suitable for high-risk-taking investors chasing exponential gains and certainly not for those playing safe. How to Buy $MEMEX With over $450,000 raised in the presale in just a few days, many early supporters are confident that the project can stand out in the meme coin space. Per the Meme Index whitepaper , the total supply of $MEMEX tokens is limited to 15 billion. The platform has allocated 15% of these tokens to early buyers for the ongoing presale. You can visit the official Meme Index presale page to buy $MEMEX. You can connect a compatible crypto wallet by clicking ‘Connect Wallet’ and pay with $USDT, $ETH, $BNB, or a credit card. Buyers can then directly stake these tokens via the Meme Index staking protocol . The APY is currently over 3,900%. Although this rate will decrease once more participants start staking, it offers an attractive option for $MEMEX holders who want to earn high passive rewards. It’s worth noting that security has been a top priority for Meme Index. It has audited its smart contracts by Coinsult and SolidProof, where both firms flagged no critical vulnerabilities. You can join the Meme Index community on Telegram and follow its X account to keep up with the latest news and project updates.

Thus, top market public-listed firms like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Coinbase, Semler Scientific, Metaplanet, and others would be part of this index. For its new Bitcoin ETF, the asset manager has set minimum criteria such as 1,000+ BTC holdings, and more. Here’s What Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Company ETF Will Offer Bitwise Asset Manager has announced a new Bitcoin ETF investment fund tracking companies that adopt the Bitcoin standard via corporate treasury holdings. In its filing prospectus, the firm said that the fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in securities that comprise the index. This will include top Bitcoin holding companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR), Marathon Digital (MARA), Coinbase (COIN), Tesla (TSLA), Semler Scientific (SMLR) , Metaplanet (MTPLF) and others. However, to qualify for the inclusion in the index, the company has put some key criteria: Hold a minimum of 1,000 Bitcoins in their corporate treasury. Maintain a market capitalization of at least $100 million. Have a minimum average daily liquidity of $1 million. Maintain a public-free float of at least 10%. Below is the list of the companies that could be part of the new Bitcoin Standard Company ETF from Bitwise. Source: HODL15Capital Industry leaders have shown interest in being part of the new investment fund from Bitwise. Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel stated: ” I assume MARA would have to be included as we hold over 44,000 BTC in our treasury”. Similarly, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich also stated that his company would qualify for the new Bitcoin ETF adding: “Metaplanet is a Bitcoin standard company with at least 1000 BTC in its corporate treasury”. On the other hand, Semler Scientific CEO Eric Semler recently stated: “In the near future, I predict it will be considered IRRESPONSIBLE for public companies not to own Bitcoin on their balance sheets”. MicroStrategy Also Part of Bitcoin Bonds ETF In another development, Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive Asset Management has filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF with the US SEC. The ETF aims to provide exposure to “Bitcoin Bonds,” defined as convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies intending to allocate all or a substantial portion of the proceeds toward purchasing Bitcoin, as per the SEC filing . This development, amid the latest development from Bitwise, has further fueled market optimism. However, commenting on Strive Asset Management’s development, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated: “Vivek’s ETF company has filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF that will track (using swaps) convertible bonds issued for the purpose of buying Bitcoin- so essentially it’s a Microstrategy convertible bond ETF until other firms do the same”. Over the last four years, MicroStrategy has been raising funds through the issuance of equity and convertible bonds. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor called for a special shareholders meeting for voting on the company’s 21/21 plan, a proposal to secure $21 billion through equity financing and an additional $21 billion through bond issuance over the next three years, and further expand its Bitcoin holdings. Citing strong demand for Bitcoin in the market, Bitwise remains confident that BTC and top altcoins like Ethereum, and Solana will hit fresh all-time highs in 2025.

38171839,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398639,1735281626,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,SpacePay’s Solution: A Deep Dive Into How 0.5% Fees Change Payment Economics,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/spacepays-solution-a-deep-dive-into-how-0-5-fees-change-payment-economics/,"The post SpacePay’s Solution: A Deep Dive Into How 0.5% Fees Change Payment Economics appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the payment processing sector, fees might seem like small percentages, but their impact on business profits is high. Traditional credit card processors charge merchants between 2.5% and 3.5% per transaction, meaning a store making $10,000 monthly loses up to $350 just in processing fees. SpacePay fundamentally changes this equation with its 0.5% fee structure, allowing merchants to keep more of their earnings while still maintaining profitable platform operations. As presale funding approaches $1 million with tokens at $0.002441, this sustainable economic model attracts both businesses and investors. To understand how SpacePay achieves this balance, think of traditional payment processing like a relay race where each runner (intermediary) takes a portion of the fee. A typical credit card payment passes through six different entities, each adding their costs to the final fee. SpacePay’s technology creates a direct path between customer and merchant, similar to replacing that relay race with a single sprinter. Why Traditional Payment Fees Hurt Business Growth Traditional payment processing creates a complex chain of fees that steadily erodes business profits. Let’s examine a typical credit card transaction: When a customer pays $100, the merchant doesn’t receive $100. Instead, they lose between $2.50 and $3.50 to various processing fees. This might not sound big for a single purchase, but consider how these fees compound over thousands of transactions. To fully understand this impact, imagine a busy coffee shop serving 200 customers daily with an average purchase of $5. With traditional payment processors charging 3%, the shop loses $0.15 on each transaction. Across 200 daily customers, that’s $30 lost to fees every day. Over a month, these fees consume $900 of potential profit – enough to cover utility bills or employee wages. The problem extends beyond visible fees. Traditional payment systems often include hidden costs that further reduce profits. Monthly terminal rental fees typically range from $30-$100 per device. Then there are PCI compliance fees, statement fees, and minimum processing fees. A single store might pay over $1,500 annually just in equipment and maintenance costs before counting per-transaction fees. How SpacePay Creates Sustainable Payment Economics SpacePay’s 0.5% fee structure works because of smart technological design. Consider the same coffee shop from our previous example, now using SpacePay. With 200 daily customers spending $5 each, the shop pays just $0.025 in fees per transaction. This reduces their daily fee cost from $30 to only $5, saving $25 every business day. Over a month, these savings add up to $750 that stays in the business rather than going to payment processors. The revenue distribution model shows how SpacePay maintains profitability while charging lower fees. From each 0.5% transaction fee, the platform allocates portions to different essential functions. Part of the fee supports technical operations and security. Another portion funds the revenue sharing program for token holders. The remaining amount goes toward platform development and growth. This careful distribution ensures every participant in the ecosystem benefits while keeping fees low for merchants. Let’s examine how this works in practice using a retail store example. A clothing store processing $20,000 monthly in traditional card payments currently loses $600-700 in fees. Switching to SpacePay reduces these fees to just $100, saving $500-600 monthly. These savings compound even further because SpacePay eliminates terminal rental fees and other hidden charges. The store can reinvest these savings into inventory, marketing, or staff wages. The platform achieves this efficiency through automated processes. Unlike traditional systems that require multiple intermediaries, SpacePay’s technology handles verification, conversion, and settlement in one seamless operation. This streamlined approach reduces operating costs while maintaining security and speed, proving that efficient technology can make lower fees sustainable for everyone involved. SpacePay’s Major Achievements SpacePay’s success starts with strong private investment backing. The platform secured $750,000 from private investors who recognized its potential to transform payment processing. This early funding provided the foundation for building a secure, efficient payment system. The platform’s technical readiness demonstrates another milestone. SpacePay completed its Minimum Viable Product (MVP), proving the technology works effectively in real-world conditions. The successful development of the payment processing system, merchant dashboard, and security features shows how SpacePay turns its vision into working solutions. Industry recognition came through the “New Payment Platform of the Year” award at the CorporateLiveWire Global Awards 2022/23. This award validates SpacePay’s innovative approach to solving payment challenges. The combination of low fees, instant settlements, and merchant protection caught the attention of payment industry experts. Building Economic Value Through Community SpacePay’s approach to value creation extends beyond simple fee savings. The platform’s presale success, now approaching $1 million with tokens at $0.002441 , demonstrates how combining payment efficiency with community benefits creates lasting economic value. Think of it as building a financial ecosystem where every participant – from small merchants to token holders – contributes to and benefits from the network’s growth. The revenue sharing program shows this collaborative economics. When merchants process payments through SpacePay, a portion of the 0.5% fee flows back to token holders. To understand how this works, consider a network processing $1 million daily in transactions. The total fees would generate $5,000 daily, with a major portion distributed among the community. This creates a direct link between platform usage and token holder rewards, encouraging everyone to support network growth. The upcoming staking program adds another layer of economic benefit. Token holders who stake their SPY tokens will earn regular rewards from platform activity. Participating in this economic ecosystem starts at SpacePay’s website. New investors can join using various cryptocurrencies (USDT, AVAX, BASE, MATIC, ETH, BNB) or bank cards. The investment process follows clear steps: Visit the official website Connect your crypto wallet Choose your payment method Enter your investment amount Complete the transaction As SpacePay moves toward exchange listings, early supporters gain ground-floor access to a platform that’s changing payment economics.

The pullback from the levels above $98,000 can be treated as a major setback, as this revives the possibility of a yearly close below the $100K milestone. With this, the market participants could become less optimistic in 2025, which may delay the revival of a strong ascending trend, targeting a new ATH above $110K. Bitcoin bulls have pushed the price above $96,000 as the selling volume exhausted to a large extent. Regardless of this, the price is stuck close to the crucial support at $96,071, which keeps the bearish possibilities alive. However, the token remains within the bullish range, with a major support level of around $95,850, where a massive sell-wall has been built. As per the data shared by popular analyst Ali , nearly 822 BTC may be liquidated if the price hits $95,850. Hence, if the price hits this level, there is a possibility of a huge pullback as the sell orders of 822 BTC could be processed. However, there are huge sell orders above the levels between $96,100 and $95,900 where more than 100 BTC are feared to be liquidated at each price range. This suggests the Bitcoin price rally continues to trade within the bearish range, as a minor plunge may trigger a huge sell-off. What’s next? Will BTC price rebound and close the yearly trade above $100K or remain consolidated below the range? The short-term price action of Bitcoin suggests neither bulls nor bears are possessing the required strength as the price remains stuck within a range. However, the technicals suggest a quick surge in the price could occur anytime from now. The stochastic RSI is trading within the oversold range and has been trying to validate a rebound. However, the possibility of a bullish crossover remains distinct as the levels are about to undergo a bearish crossover, suggesting some more price drain before the next price action. Meanwhile, the MACD suggests a drop in the selling pressure, hence suggesting a potential trend reversal. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is expected to remain consolidated below $100K until the end of the year, which may attract a significant buying volume in 2025.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 06:42:08

His analysis comes following XRP’s historic surge to a multi-year high. The asset is currently consolidating, trading at $2.29. The digital asset experienced massive growth in November 2024, achieving a remarkable increase of almost 300% following the United States presidential election results on November 5th, when Donald Trump secured victory. This surge culminated in XRP almost reaching $2.90 on December 5th, establishing its highest valuation since 2018. Despite the current market correction and price stabilization, Ramos maintains an optimistic outlook. I know – XRP RIPPLE HOLDERS WILL GET RICH – My take, my urgency, the plan – DO IT before $3 $XRP pic.twitter.com/B0TZN1xozp — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) December 23, 2024 XRP’s Building Up For Something Big Ramos interprets the present consolidation phase, particularly during the December holiday, as a strategic accumulation opportunity. He attributes the current market stability to reduced trading activity during Christmas, as market participants temporarily shift their focus to seasonal celebrations. When evaluating potential catalysts for XRP’s next significant price movement, Ramos emphasizes the expanding institutional presence in cryptocurrency markets. He references MicroStrategy’s acquisition of 5,262 Bitcoin, valued at $561 million, as evidence of growing institutional confidence in digital assets. According to Ramos, this institutional momentum could generate increased attention across the cryptocurrency sector, potentially benefiting XRP. Ramos also highlights several specific developments that could drive XRP’s value appreciation. Among these factors, the prospective approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is particularly significant. Multiple companies are already pursuing ETF listings , and Ramos suggests that major financial institutions like BlackRock might explore similar initiatives. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Catalysts for XRP’s Growth Ramos also identified Ripple’s recent launch of RLUSD , its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, as another crucial development. This new financial instrument enhances the XRP ecosystem’s utility and could attract increased enterprise adoption. The analyst anticipates that RLUSD’s growing market presence might catalyze broader institutional and retail participation in the upcoming months. The broader cryptocurrency market context also supports Ramos’s positive outlook. Bitcoin’s surge in late November and early December sent it above $100,000 for the first time, and the broader market has experienced a massive rise, with a current market cap exceeding $3 trillion. Ramos anticipates the cryptocurrency market capitalization will reach $4 trillion, leading to new all-time highs. The overall outlook for the market is bullish, and many experts have big expectations for XRP in 2025. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Meanwhile, Japan's economic data presented a mixed outlook: retail sales growth accelerated, industrial production contracted, and the jobless rate remained steady.

India ( SENSEX ) rose +0.47% to 78,998 in morning trade on Friday, after being flat the day before, mainly supported by gains in auto, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare sectors. A statement from the government lifted sentiment, as India's economy is expected to grow at around 6.5% in FY 2024/25 despite a challenging environment. The forecasts are close to the lower end of its 6.5%-7% projection, as global uncertainties pose a dampening threat. Australia ( AS51 ) rose +0.50% to finish at 8,262 on Friday, reaching its highest level in over a week and gaining for the 3rd straight session, supported by gains in consumer discretionary, energy, and materials after the Christmas break.

Institutional Bitcoin Bulls Line Up!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitwise-files-for-new-bitcoin-etf-institutional-bitcoin-bulls-line-up/,"A new move came from Bitwise, a giant company that has spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. Accordingly, Bitwise has made a new application to track the stocks of companies that hold at least 1K BTC. Bitwise reported that it has filed an application with the US SEC for a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which aims to track the stock performance of companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. At this point, the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in companies that hold at least 1,000 Bitcoin. To be included in Bitwise’s ETF, companies holding Bitcoin must also have a market capitalization of at least $100 million, average daily liquidity of at least $1 million, and a free float ratio of less than 10 percent. ETF Store president Nate Feraci shared a table on his X account showing which companies hold more than 1,000 BTC. According to this table, MicroStrategy ranked first, followed by Marathon Digital, Riot, Hut8, Tesla and Coinbase. Accordingly, companies on this list will be included in Bitwise's new Bitcoin Standard Company ETF. As the cryptocurrency sector shows interest in being part of Bitwise’s new ETF, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel said: “I think MARA will need to be included as we hold over 44,000 BTC in our treasury.” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich also stated that his company would be eligible for the new Bitcoin ETF, saying, “Metaplanet is a Bitcoin-standard company with at least 1000 BTC in its corporate treasury.” Companies holding > 1,000 btc… via @HODL15Capital h/t @Roubini18 pic.twitter.com/E91ky56iEI — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 27, 2024 *This is not investment advice.

While bulls are trying to defend the crucial support of $95,000, on-chain data and market analysts show that chances of a BTC price crash to $60,000 by Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 19, are much higher. On-Chain Data Flashes Bitcoin Price Crash Signals Following the rally to $100K levels, the Bitcoin selling pressure intensified pushing the BTC price all the way to $95,000 once again. On-chain data also shows weakness, as there is not enough ammunition for Bitcoin price to continue the rally. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that Bitcoin’s critical support zone now lies between $97,041 and $93,806. He also warned that if Bitcoin fails to hold this demand area, it could see a sharp decline to $70,085. Source: Ali Charts Exchange Reserve Surge Puts Pressure on Bitcoin Price Another concerning matter has been the BTC exchange reserves, which have soared amid the Bitcoin price surge to its all-time high of $100K. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reports that savvy investors seem to be preparing for a potential bearish scenario. Over the past week, more than 33,000 Bitcoin, valued at over $3.23 billion, have been transferred to exchanges. This movement suggests heightened caution and possible selling pressure in the market. Source: Ali Charts On the other hand, profit booking for BTC has also surged over the past week. On December 23, Bitcoin investors collectively realized over $7.17 billion in profits, highlighting significant market activity and profit-taking during the holiday period, reported Martinez. Additionally, derivatives data shows that traders aren’t quite optimistic about Bitcoin in the near term. The percentage of traders holding long positions on Bitcoin ($BTC) on Binance has declined sharply, falling from 66.73% to 53.60%. What Are The Chances Of BTC Reveral To Bullish Rally? On Christmas day, Bitcoin price breached a crucial support level at $97,300, where 1.51 million wallets collectively purchased approximately 1.49 million BTC, according to analyst Ali Martinez. For bearish sentiment to be overturned, Bitcoin must reclaim this significant support zone and, more importantly, achieve a daily close above the $100,000 mark. Martinez further added that if the Bitcoin bulls manage to sustain the $100K support, the BTC price can rally to $168,000 as per the Mayer Multiple. Source: Ali Charts However, BTC price today was 2.2% down and exchanged hands at $96,038. Its market cap stood at $1.9 trillion, and the 24-hour trading volume has shot up 24% all the way to $46 billion. The 24-hour liquidation stands at $55 million with $44 million being in long liquidation. Analysts Predict BTC Crash By Donald Trump Inauguration Several crypto market analysts predict further downside for Bitcoin if it loses the crucial support of $95,000. Crypto analyst Tone Vays has expressed concern over Bitcoin ($BTC) trading below the critical $95,000 level. Vays warns that such a move is “very, very bad,” as it significantly raises the likelihood of a correction toward $73,000. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has cautioned that Bitcoin price may be on the verge of breaking down from a “broadening triangle” pattern. If this occurs, Brandt suggests the price could experience a retracement toward the $70,000 zone. Source: Peter Brandt On the other hand, Fundstrat remains optimistic, projecting that Bitcoin price could reach $250,000 by 2025. However, according to market expert Mark Newton, a pullback to $60,000 may occur before that surge. Finally, Benjamin Cowen from IntoTheCryptoVerse, speculates that Bitcoin (BTC) may follow a similar price pattern to the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). If this occurs, a flash crash to $60,000 could take place around the inauguration of Donald Trump. As BTC faces chances of a crash, investors are turning bullish on altcoins . Crypto market analysts believe that the altcoin season isn’t over and that altcoins could see a strong recovery from now onwards. Although, many investors might seem to have given up the hope, the recovery in altcoins could be stronger.

While high-profile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate the market, there are numerous lesser-known, low-cost tokens that could yield impressive profits in the coming years. With the right mix of technology, strong community support, and innovative solutions, these cryptocurrencies present exciting opportunities for investors who are willing to take a calculated risk. Among these promising projects is Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain platform combining artificial intelligence with decentralized networks. Currently in its presale at just $0.003 , Lightchain AI offers an affordable entry point for early investors. With a solid roadmap and growing interest from the crypto community, Lightchain AI could be one of the top picks for 2025, providing the chance to turn small investments into substantial fortunes as it gains traction in the rapidly evolving AI and blockchain sectors. Why Afforadable Cryptos Matter for Investors Affordable cryptocurrencies offer an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially maximize profits. While high-priced coins like Bitcoin may have large potential returns, their high cost of entry can deter smaller investors from getting involved. This is where affordable cryptos come into play – they provide a lower barrier to entry, allowing everyday investors to get in on the ground floor of promising projects with huge growth potential. Additionally, investing in affordable cryptos allows for greater risk management. High-priced coins are often subject to extreme volatility, making it difficult for investors to manage their risk exposure. Lower-priced tokens tend to be less volatile and can help balance out a portfolio by reducing overall risk. What to Look for in Affordable Cryptos When considering affordable cryptocurrencies, it’s important to do thorough research and look for key indicators of potential success. Here are a few factors to consider when evaluating these tokens Technology: Look for projects with innovative technology that solves real-world problems or disrupts traditional industries. A strong technological foundation can help a crypto gain traction and attract investors. Community support: The strength and engagement of a project’s community can play a significant role in its success. Keep an eye out for active communication channels, supportive communities, and a dedicated team working towards the project’s goals. Roadmap: A clear roadmap outlining the milestones and goals of a project is crucial in determining its potential growth. A project with a well-defined roadmap and achievable goals is more likely to attract investors and see success. Lightchain AI Affordable and Promising Top Pick For 2025 Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a top pick for 2025, offering an affordable investment opportunity with its presale token priced at just $0.003. By combining artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI aims to solve scalability, security, and efficiency issues faced by traditional blockchain networks. Its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, enhancing network performance. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables real-time analytics and decentralized AI model training directly on the blockchain. With a solid roadmap that includes key milestones like the testnet and mainnet launches in 2025, Lightchain AI is positioned for substantial growth. This innovative project offers a promising entry point for investors seeking exposure to both the AI and blockchain industries, making it one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space.

The Crypto AI sector could experience a bullish trend this year due to the rapid adoption of its technology. On the other hand, the meme narrative, despite lacking substantial innovation, continues to make waves in the cryptocurrency realm. Here are the top 10 AI-based altcoins with the potential to skyrocket in 2025. This selection is based on strong technical indicators and the bullish price action of these AI tokens. Let’s get started: Bitttensor (TAO) Bittensor is one of the top AI-based tokens currently struggling to gain momentum, similar to major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. However, over the longer time frame, TAO appears to be trading within a range of $432 to $702. Amid market uncertainty, the TAO price has reached the lower boundary of this range, signaling a potential upside rally in the coming days. Source: Trading View Additionally, TAO appears to be forming a bullish double-bottom price action pattern on its weekly time frame. After forming its first bottom in November 2024, the token recently formed its second bottom. Based on its recent price action, if TAO sustains above the $430 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 52% to reach the $720 mark in the future. This bullish price action on the weekly time frame positions TAO as a top AI-based altcoin. Near Protocol (NEAR) Following the presidential election results in the United States, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged by over 125%, rising from $3.60 to $8.05. However, due to market uncertainty and profit-taking, the price has corrected by 37%, reaching the crucial Golden Fibonacci zone while also finding support at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, NEAR’s current daily chart indicates a strong buying opportunity with a 1:8 risk-to-reward ratio. If NEAR maintains support above the $4.80 mark, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 57% to reach $8.11 in the coming days. The Graph (GRT) Similar to NEAR, The Graph (GRT) has also experienced a notable price decline and has now reached the Golden Fibonacci zone, making it an ideal investment for 2025. However, due to market uncertainty, GRT appears to be consolidating within a tight range. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that the token could soar by 66% in the coming days. This bullish thesis will hold only if GRT remains above the $0.20 mark; otherwise, this bullish outlook may fail. Render Network (RENDER) Render Network (RENDER) currently appears to be consolidating within a tight range near strong support provided by the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the crucial horizontal level of $6.80. Source: Trading View Additionally, RENDER’s price action pattern shows similarities to TAO and GRT. Based on recent price action, if RENDER maintains support above the $6.70 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 60% to reach $11.60 in the future. Internet Computer (ICP) Amid market uncertainty, ICP, the native token of Internet Computer, experienced a price decline of over 35% and found support at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the horizontal level of $9.50. However, the ICP price now appears to be recovering. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ICP could rally by 45% to reach the $15.30 level in the coming days. This bullish thesis will hold only if ICP remains above the $9.50 mark; otherwise, it may fail. Artificial Super Intelligence (FET) During the ongoing price correction phase, the top AI-based altcoin, Artificial Super Intelligence (FET), appears to have recovered after experiencing a price decline of over 45% in recent weeks. Following this notable drop, FET has reached a crucial support level at the $1.14 mark, which has historically served as a strong support zone and an area of significant buying pressure. Source: Trading View Since September 2024, FET has tested this level four times, and each time it has rebounded with buying pressure and upward momentum. Experts and analysts anticipate a similar rally. Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that FET could soar by 69% to reach the $2.05 mark in the future. This bullish price action cements FET’s position as a top AI-based altcoin. Theta Network (THETA) THETA, the native token of Theta Network, is poised for significant upside momentum as it has formed a bullish price action pattern on its daily time frame. The altcoin saw substantial gains in November 2024 but has experienced a price decline of over 35% since the beginning of December 2024. Source: Trading View This decline has resulted in the formation of a descending triangle pattern on the daily time frame, and THETA is now on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical price momentum, if THETA breaks out of the pattern and closes a daily candle above the $2.41 mark, it could rally by 40% to reach $3.32 in the future. Unlike meme coins, THETA stands out as one of the top AI-based altcoins with the potential to skyrocket in 2025. Filecoin (FIL) Filecoin (FIL) is one of the top AI-based crypto projects that has been consistently attracting attention from crypto enthusiasts, not only for its performance but also for its blockchain-based storage solution. Amid a recent price decline, FIL has experienced a drop of over 40%. Source: Trading View However, the price has recently found support at a crucial level of $4.90 and the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Additionally, FIL has paused its continuous decline at the 61.8% Golden Fibonacci zone. Based on the recent price action and these bullish factors, there is a strong possibility that FIL could soar by 65% to reach the $8.20 mark in the future. AIOZ Network (AIOZ) AIOZ, the native token of the AIOZ network, has gained significant attention from crypto enthusiasts following its impressive 240% upside rally last month. Source: Trading View However, as market sentiment shifted, it experienced a price decline of over 38% and is currently testing a strong support level of around $0.83. Based on recent price action, if AIOZ holds this support level, it could rally by 50% to reach the $1.30 mark in the future. Injective (INJ) Amid the recent price correction, INJ, the native token of Injective, has experienced a significant price decline of over 40% and has reached a crucial support trendline that it has been following since August 2024. Historically, whenever the asset reaches this support level, it experiences buying pressure and upward momentum. Source: Trading View Experts and analysts are expecting a similar price rally this time. Based on recent price action, if INJ holds above the $20 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 61% in the coming days. These top AI-based altcoins, supported by strong technical analysis and market activity, hold the potential for notable gains in 2025, beyond the predicted.

Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 But is the market overhyping the targets what is the realistic target BTC can hit in the upcoming bull market, let’s get the insights from analysts. Dan’s Bitcoin Prediction 2025 Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera Capital, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $117,000 by August 2025. He bases this forecast on Bitcoin’s historical price movements around its halving events, which happen every four years. The halving reduces the reward for miners, and Morehead points out that Bitcoin’s price usually starts rising about 400 days before the halving and peaks around 480 days after the event. The last halving took place in April 2024, cutting the reward for miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Morehead believes that Bitcoin’s price will follow this pattern and climb to $117,000, which would represent a 22.53% increase from its current price of $95,484. Macro Factors Can’t Be Ruled Out… In addition to the halving effect, Morehead also factors in macroeconomic conditions and political developments that could help drive Bitcoin’s price higher. He expects these factors to contribute to Bitcoin’s potential growth and help it reach the target of $117,000 by mid-2025. Morehead’s prediction comes during a time when Bitcoin is already showing strong growth, and many investors are watching the halving closely for signs of a continued bull market. If Bitcoin follows its historical trend, the coming months could see significant price gains as it heads toward its next peak. Other Bold Predictions: Could Bitcoin Hit $500K? Pantera’s optimistic outlook echoes other ambitious predictions. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, recently speculated that Bitcoin could soar to $500,000 if Donald Trump implements his plan to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile. This proposal, revealed at the Bitcoin Conference earlier this year, has sparked widespread interest, with some suggesting that other countries might follow the U.S. lead. With Japan’s rejection of the Bitcoin Reserve plan, it will be a good opportunity for the US to take the first mover advantage to become the Bitcoin leader globally. Even Perianne Boring, Digital Chamber CEO also said that Bitcoin will hit $800,000 under Trump’s leadership. With Bitcoins rising trend, analysts see these short-term dips as a great opportunity to enter the market like Microstrategy is doing right now. But you need to be careful as experts also believe in a market crash possibility if Trump’s policies get delayed due to political differences.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 07:00:46

Bitcoin (BTC), a major player in the crypto world, has seen its price fall to $96,200 recently . Amidst this price drop, many are asking: where is Bitcoin headed next? As 2025 approaches, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, has made a bold prediction: Bitcoin could skyrocket to $200,000 before ever dropping back to $50,000. Bitcoin To Hit $200K By 2025 In a recent interview with CNBC , Tom Lee shared an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin. He predicts that Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 in 2025, driven by several key factors. Lee pointed to the changing U.S. political landscape and the potential for the government to accumulate Bitcoin as important catalysts for growth. He believes these developments show that Bitcoin is becoming a legitimate alternative to traditional stores of value like gold. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Here’s When Bitcoin Price Will Hit $117,000 , Lee further noted that many people are considering adding Bitcoin to their retirement portfolios, which could increase demand significantly. Lee didn’t stop at Bitcoin. He also expects altcoins to experience a major surge. He forecasted that Ethereum’s price could rise to between $5,000 and $6,000, while Solana and other promising altcoins might also see big gains during this market rally. Bitcoin As a Strategic Reserve Lee also mentioned that under the leadership of President Donald Trump, bitcoin will soon become a Strategic Reserve. These changes, he believes, will provide the necessary environment for Bitcoin to reach new heights. Will Bitcoin Ever Drop Back to $50K? While there are always risks in any market, Lee is confident that Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise. He argues that the $50,000 price range may be behind us, as Bitcoin continues to gain more support from institutions and governments. Meanwhile, Lee predicts that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 before it ever sees a major downturn. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It’s a market filled with excitement, community power, and yes, massive volatility! Whether you’re in it for the fun or eyeing some quick gains, there’s always a meme coin that’s caught your attention. But hey, if you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join for short-term gains, you’re in the right place. With so many new players entering the scene, it’s a tough choice. But, there’s one coin that’s standing out right now — BTFD Coin. The presale has been nothing short of amazing (raising over $4.5 million so far), and here’s the kicker — there’s a 50% offer going on right now! Thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can snag more BTFD tokens at today’s price. And what better time than now, as we’re drawing inspiration from the 1973 oil market crash, which left its mark on the financial world and gave birth to many opportunities. Let’s dive into the coins that could potentially bring those short-term gains you’re after — from BTFD Coin to Bonk’s ‘BURNmas’ to the SPX6900 dip. BTFD Coin: The December Star BTFD Coin is proving to be the star of the show in 2024, and it’s not just about the memes. It’s all about community, staking rewards, and a super fun Play-to-Earn game . If you’ve ever thought that meme coins were just about a viral moment and didn’t have any real potential, think again. BTFD Coin is the meme coin that’s about to flip the script on what you can expect from this genre. With features like high-stakes APY and a game that rewards players with BTFD tokens, this is one meme coin that’ll keep on giving. But here’s the cool part: It’s still in presale, which means you’ve got the chance to get in early at a super-low price. And thanks to the BIG50 bonus code, you can take advantage of 50% additional tokens on your BTFD purchases. Back in 1973, the oil market saw a massive downturn, but that didn’t stop savvy investors from jumping on opportunities — and that’s exactly what you can do now with BTFD Coin. The market crash birthed investment opportunities that left many with great returns, and this is the 1973 mindset — buy the dip, and watch your rewards grow. If you decide to invest $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’ll snag yourself 7,692,307 $BTFD tokens. But wait—here’s where it gets even better: by using the BIG50 code, you’ll get 50% more tokens! That’s an additional 3,846,153 tokens, bringing your total to 11,538,460 $BTFD tokens for your $1,000 investment. Now, let’s talk about future potential. If the price of BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 (which analysts are eyeing as a reasonable target), your $1,000 investment could grow to $6,923. Bonk’s ‘BURNmas’: A Community-Driven Event with Big Potential BonkDAO, the meme coin that’s had crypto enthusiasts on their toes for a while now, is making waves again. This time, it’s with an event called ‘BURNmas’, where BonkDAO has announced plans to burn 1.69 trillion BONK tokens — worth around $54.52 million. Yes, you read that right. This move aims to reduce the circulating supply, making the token more scarce, and possibly influencing the market dynamics. So, what does that mean for BONK? Well, burning such a large portion of tokens could lead to a short-term price surge. And history tells us that when BonkDAO executed a similar burn back in July 2024, the price jumped by 25% in just a day. For those looking for the best new meme coins to join for short-term gains, Bonk could be the one to keep an eye on. At the time of writing, Bonk is trading at $0.0000330, but with the BURNmas event in the pipeline, it might just give investors a chance to snag some gains. As always, it’s important to keep an eye on the market for any fluctuations or surprises. SPX6900: A 5% Dip in the Market, But Is It Just a Temp Blip? SPX6900, another meme coin on the radar, has been feeling the heat lately with a 5% dip over the last 24 hours. The price is sitting at $0.799299, with a market cap of $744 million.

The report indicates that there was a 40% annual rise in the number of cyber attacks in 2024 compared to 2023, with 165 incidents costing $2.3 billion in damages. The sum was still down 37% from the fraud peak in 2022, but complex schemes and breaches surged this year. Access control breaches made up most of that damage, with 67 incidents totaling $1.9 billion. Other attack vectors included smart contract vulnerabilities, leading to losses of $456.8 million over 98 incidents, and address poisoning assaults, resulting in $68.7 million in a single major case. These attack methods demonstrate the loopholes in blockchain networks and decentralized applications that scammers still take advantage of.

In a Dec. 26 regulatory filing , Bitwise said the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in equity securities of publicly traded firms that have adopted the “Bitcoin standard” by holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in their corporate treasuries. These securities include “common stock, depositary receipts (both American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”), tracking stocks and other equity units. Such securities may be issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies including companies operating in emerging market countries,” the filing noted. To qualify for inclusion, companies must have at least $100 million in market capitalization, average daily liquidity of at least $1 million, and a public free float of under 10%. These criteria will be assessed based on quarterly and annual corporate reports. In terms of weighting, the ETF will prioritize the market value of each company’s Bitcoin holdings rather than its overall market capitalization, which is typically the case with traditional equity ETFs.

For instance, Marathon Digital Holdings, with over 44,000 BTC in its reserves, will have a higher weighting in the ETF than Tesla, which holds 9,720 BTC, despite its significantly larger $1.42 trillion market capitalization compared to Marathon’s $6.55 billion. However, no stock will exceed a weighting of 25% in the fund to ensure diversification and prevent overexposure to any single company. Commenting on the filing, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, said that the ETF could see many companies vying for a spot in the index. Fuelled by Bitcoin’s performance this year, a wave of Wall Street-focused investment products has emerged, catering to the growing appetite among institutional investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regulated and familiar financial vehicles. Bitwise, for instance, proposed a Bitcoin-Ethereum mixed crypto ETF to U.S. regulators. According to the Nov. 26 S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the ETF aims to provide balanced exposure between Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering investors a diversified approach to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. On Dec. 21, New York-based GraniteShares filed for a set of leveraged ETFs aimed at tracking prominent companies with significant crypto exposure, including Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy, and Robinhood. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Grayscale Investments filed to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an exchange-traded fund.

In a report published by Cyvers , a Web3 security company, it was revealed that these scams mainly tricked the Ethereum blockchain with 150,000 wallet addresses conned across 800,000 transactions. What are Pig Butchering Scams? Pig Butchering is an extended and very sophisticated fraud in which the criminals build up close relationships with their targets, and persuade them to invest in various fake cryptocurrency platforms. After making these big investments, they vanish, and the gullible investors end up with nothing. These schemes include highly targeted investors hence having led to an increase in cyber threats in the crypto industry by 40% this year. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Weekly Report: $2.2 Billion Stolen in 2024, Centralized Exchanges Hit Hard , People Aren’t the Only Ones Being Hurt; Firms This Time Suffer From Access Control Hacks Access control breaches were also to a significant extent behind crypto fraud this year: the share of such incidents was 81% and the financial losses, according to the study. These comprised 41.6% of all the reported cases, but the losses arising from such incidences call for the strengthening of protective modalities against unauthorised access and transfers. In another report by Chain analysi s, digital currency theft rose to $2.2 billion based on 303 incidents in 2024, from $1.8 billion in 2023; North Korean hackers accounted for $1.34 billion in 2024, which was more than double that of 2023. A major shift materialized to centralized applications instead of DeFi systems, including attacks like Japan’s DMM Bitcoin($305m) and Indian WazirX($234.9m) . Regarding funds’ redistribution, experienced hackers used mixers and bridges between blockchains for 90% of stolen funds, while the private key’s poor management let the fraudsters steal 43.8% of the money. The risks are such that they encourage people to adapt to cryptocurrency but also warn them to stay alert, check all the investment offers thoroughly and stay with reliable service providers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Strong inflows into crypto ETFs expected to drive market growth throughout 2025. Stablecoins and regulatory changes will play a key role in shaping crypto’s future. As the crypto market recorded a 90% increase in total market capitalization in 2024, experts highlighted key factors influencing its growth trajectory in 2025. According to a Citigroup report , the future of digital assets depends on economic conditions, crypto ETF performance, regulatory changes, and the expanding role of stablecoins. Macro Environment Supporting Crypto in Early 2025 Citigroup analysts project that digital currencies will benefit from a positive economic environment into the first quarter of 2025. However, they caution that shifts in U.S. economic policies and stock market fluctuations could increase volatility, potentially creating challenges for digital assets.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 07:20:00

One key analyst highlights that Trump’s administration could significantly boost Bitcoin’s price by pushing for the tokenization of traditional assets, such as stocks from major companies like Apple and Amazon. This could lead to a world where assets are traded digitally, making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies even more integral to the financial system. The analyst believes this could unlock trillions of dollars in new digital assets, creating a massive opportunity for Bitcoin in 2025. Analyst Say Trump wants Bitcoin’s price up Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also revealed that Trump plans to clean out the SEC and install individuals who are more supportive of Bitcoin. Trump is expected to treat Bitcoin as part of the U.S. strategic reserve, which could further boost the cryptocurrency’s position in the global economy. Analysts believe that Trump will measure his success by Bitcoin’s price and will take credit for any future surges. Some even predict that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 under his leadership. Moreover, another analyst, Kristen Smith, the CEO of the Blockchain Association, also echoed similar sentiment and pointed out that the lack of a clear regulatory framework for Bitcoin exchanges has stopped its growth. With Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, she believes that regulatory clarity will encourage more big companies to invest in Bitcoin, making it a mainstream asset. Further pointing towards the regulatory issues Coinbase and Robinhood faced could have been avoided with transparent policies saving investors money. Overall, analysts agree that Trump’s presidency could be a turning point for Bitcoin, with clearer regulations, more institutional adoption, and a more favorable attitude toward cryptocurrencies. This could lead to Bitcoin reaching a new high with a global presence. Not All Agree to Trump’s Promises… Ethan Vera, COO at Seattle-based Luxor Technology said in a recent Bloomberg interview that Trump’s plans to mine all remaining Bitcoin mining to be done in the US are fake and impractical as Bitcoin mining is a costly and energy process Also majority of miners is spread across the globe where energy is cheap.

Table of Contents Catzilla: A giant leap for meme coins CHILLGUY: New digital asset SHIRO Coin: Emerging crypto with promising potential Catwifhat: Deflationary coin with perpetual auto-burn on Solana Notcoin: A community token bridging gaming and web3 technology Conclusion The crypto scene could witness remarkable shifts in 2025, with certain meme-based coins hinting at tremendous growth. These unique digital currencies, driven by internet culture and community enthusiasm, might be on the cusp of significant leaps. Uncover five of these intriguing tokens that could potentially make a notable impact on the market and draw substantial attention. Catzilla: A giant leap for meme coins In the dynamic landscape of meme coins, few contenders roar as loudly as Catzilla. Inspired by the success stories of Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE, Catzilla combines the humor and chaos of meme culture with kaiju-inspired storytelling. Picture a colossal, Godzilla-like cat wreaking havoc while rallying a community of gamers, anime fans, and crypto enthusiasts.

Its 14-stage presale structure ensures multiple entry points for investors, with token prices progressively rising.

Catzilla’s value lies in its threefold offering: immersive gameplay, a mission-driven vision, and a thriving community. Players can dive into epic game experiences while earning rewards, all within a unifying movement that merges meme culture with financial empowerment. More than just a token, Catzilla embodies resistance against the greed and manipulation often seen in crypto markets.

Designed to enhance transaction efficiency and security, it seeks to address common challenges in the crypto space. CHILLGUY’s technology focuses on improving scalability and user experience, which could set it apart from existing digital currencies. In the current market cycle, with continued interest in emerging cryptocurrencies, CHILLGUY presents potential opportunities for investors. Its attractiveness depends on its technological developments and the adoption rate within the crypto community. SHIRO Coin: Emerging crypto with promising potential SHIRO is a cryptocurrency designed to offer innovative solutions in the blockchain industry. It aims to enhance transaction speed and security while reducing costs. SHIRO utilizes advanced technology to improve scalability and user experience. In the current market cycle, SHIRO appears attractive to investors looking for new opportunities. Its potential lies in addressing challenges faced by existing cryptocurrencies. With unique features and growing adoption, SHIRO could play a significant role in the future of digital currencies. Catwifhat: Deflationary coin with perpetual auto-burn on Solana Catwifhat is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain featuring a unique auto-burn mechanism. Introduced in December 2023, it applies a 4% burn fee to every on-chain transaction, including DEX buys, sells, and wallet transfers. This deflationary measure reduces the supply of CWIF over time. Since all contract authorities were revoked day 1, the auto-burn cannot be altered and will continue indefinitely. The perpetual reduction in supply may influence the coin’s value dynamics. In the current market cycle, CWIF presents a distinct model within the memecoin space. Notcoin: A community token bridging gaming and web3 technology Notcoin began as a viral Telegram game that introduced many users to web3 through a tap-to-earn mining mechanic. NOT is a community token where users earn by exploring web3 products, playing games, and contributing to the ecosystem. Web3 builders can offer their products to the community via Notcoin campaigns. The coin leverages gaming to make web3 accessible and engaging. In the current market cycle, Notcoin’s blend of gaming and web3 technology may attract users seeking interactive and rewarding experiences in the crypto space. Conclusion CHILLGUY, SHIRO, CWIF, and NOT show less short-term potential. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as a leading meme coin, aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone with a 700% ROI potential during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising over 14 stages. It offers governance features, loyalty rewards, and passive staking options, uniting enthusiasts in the fight against crypto villains.

That’s the kind of momentum that turns heads, and Rollblock has done just that. With its innovative GambleFi platform, Rollblock has ignited a buying frenzy among Sui and Avalanche users, raising nearly $7.5 million so far. The excitement is fueled by its community-backed model and potential to disrupt the casino market. With Rollblock’s RBLK token gaining traction, the project’s market cap could skyrocket post-launch, making this presale a red-hot opportunity for early investors seeking substantial returns. Rollblock presale frenzy: Road to $7.5M and a $40.M market cap in sight “The internet is the new frontier for gambling, and online casinos are leading the way.” These words from Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. perfectly capture why Rollblock is making waves right now. In just its 9th presale , Rollblock is flourishing, so much so that it has started capturing the attention of Sui and Avalanche users. Its rise is no fluke. The platform uses cryptocurrency to offer a gaming experience that’s fast, secure, and fair—a combination that’s hard to beat. At Rollblock, the focus isn’t just on gaming; it’s on rewarding you as part of the community.

So, whether you’re a gaming enthusiast or an investor looking for opportunities, Rollblock’s blend of innovation, rewards, and community engagement is hard to ignore. Sui holders roll the dice on Rollblock’s red-hot presale Sui is a fast and secure blockchain designed to make crypto transactions and apps more efficient. Its standout feature is its scalability, meaning it can handle a lot of transactions without slowing down. However, like many newer blockchains, Sui faces challenges. Limited adoption has kept its ecosystem smaller than others, and high competition makes it hard for new projects to stand out. Despite these hurdles, Sui holders are drawn to Rollblock’s presale . The platform’s innovative GambleFi model, coupled with the chance to earn rewards through $RBLK tokens, aligns perfectly with their appetite for fast, secure, and forward-thinking crypto projects. Why Avalanche holders are taking a gamble on the Rollblock presale Avalanche recently launched its Avalanche9000 upgrade, described as the network’s biggest update since its mainnet debut. This upgrade introduced major improvements like drastically reduced fees and easier deployment of Layer-1 chains, making Avalanche more accessible and cost-effective. However, despite its technical benefits, the upgrade hasn’t sparked significant demand, leaving many AVAX holders concerned about its long-term impact. With the AVAX market cap still under pressure, holders are looking for new opportunities. Rollblock’s presale has captured their attention, offering a chance to diversify into a growing platform that combines innovative gaming with security and scalability. Final thoughts If you’re looking to diversify, Rollblock is where the excitement is! Its GambleFi innovation and rewarding $RBLK token are catching the eyes of Sui and Avalanche holders alike.

The attackers impersonated Animoca and falsely announced the launch of a token. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT attributed the hack to a phishing scam that has recently targeted over 15 crypto-focused X accounts, ultimately stealing almost $500,000. Fraudulent ‘MOCA’ Token Siu’s hacked account shared a link to a fake token called Animoca Brands (MOCA) on the Pump.fun platform, which bore the same name as both the company and its Mocaverse NFT collection. This fraudulent MOCA token was then traced back to the same address behind other fraudulent tokens, ZachXBT confirmed . After being promoted on Siu’s account, the token briefly reached a peak value of almost $37,000, only to crash moments later to a market cap of just $5,735, as per data compiled by Birdeye. Currently, there are only 33 holders of the token. ZachXBT had previously uncovered this sophisticated phishing scheme wherein phishing emails disguised as urgent messages from the X team often cited fabricated copyright issues and tricked victims into resetting their account credentials. The scheme leveraged the credibility of crypto-related accounts with large audiences. A majority of those had more than 200,000 followers. Affected accounts included Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett, and Alex Blania. The first attack was on November 26, involving RuneMine, and the most recent occurred on December 24, affecting Kick, just before Siu’s. 2FA “Not Enough” to Secure Accounts Siu explained that the hacker somehow obtained his password and used the account recovery page to bypass 2FA by submitting a request with a non-registered email address. He tested this process and noted a significant security gap: while the system triggered a login notification to the wrong email, the actual, registered email received no alerts regarding critical actions like a 2FA change request. He said that this lack of notification could have prevented the hack. Siu also added that the hacker submitted a government-issued ID to bypass further security checks, a tactic he suspects was facilitated by phishing. He urged X to implement stronger notifications, particularly for sensitive changes like 2FA modifications, and recommended better verification measures to protect accounts. Siu also warned that 2FA alone is not enough to secure an account and advised maintaining strong password hygiene, as attackers can bypass 2FA once they have access to the password.

The token’s prices have since fallen 80% since a Thursday peak and trade at just over a cent as of Friday. But while late buyers are sitting on losses, the effort still raised over $1 million for the cause. In an X post on Thursday, Runaway founder Siqi Chen said his daughter Mira was diagnosed with a type of brain tumor in September and that research and funding had “been lacking” because of how rare the condition was. His GoFundMe page has raised 80% of its $300,000 target as of Thursday, with all proceeds going directly to research efforts at the Hankinson Lab at the Univerity of Colorado. Chen also posted his Ethereum wallet on the X thread after user demand, later putting his Solana and Bitcoin addresses as users asked for more options. And then Pump.Fun happened. The platform lets anyone issue a token for less than $2 in capital, after which they choose the number of tokens, theme, and meme picture to accompany it. When the market capitalization of any token reaches $69,000, a portion of liquidity is deposited to the Solana-based exchange Raydium and burned. A user created the MIRA token attached with a picture of Chen and his daughter, with no apparent objective except it being a token that can be traded just like any other memecoin. The user’s Pump.Fun profile shows MIRA was just one of the several tokens they created that day, with all the others failing to break a $6,000 market cap. X user @Waddles_eth later purchased 50% of the supply and sent all of it to Chen, who boosted the memecoin on his X account. That ensured virality for the token and sent prices from fractions of a penny to a peak of 8 cents early Thursday. The value of Chen’s token holdings went from $400,000 to over $18 million as the token went viral. It attracted a peak of $7 million in liquidity (worth in both Solana’s SOL and the memecoin) as the market became widely traded. It attracted over $85 million in trading volumes and over 130,000 transactions, making it the most popular smallcap in the past 24 hours. “I have been on the internet for 30 years and have seen some shit, but this is by far the craziest day of my life,” Chen wrote on X as prices rocketed. “I will be liquidating $1,000 worth of $MIRA every 10 minutes, perpetually. If change this schedule, i commit to announcing it 24 hours in advance.” “If you want to rug it to $0, go for it - at the end of the day we set out to raise $200K and we will end up with at least $1M towards rare disease research,” Chen stated. Community response to the whole event has been overwhelmingly positive, with several users pointing out how such memecoins can contribute to positive outcomes in the world. Memecoins are largely based on virality, attention and community hype. They are considered non-serious among professional investors but have seen massive demand and preference in the past year compared to larger venture capital-backed crypto tokens — which are perceived as enriching rich investors at the expense of smaller retail traders. But MIRA shifted some of the tides. “I think memecoins are dumb and have no future and I don't touch them. But if I wanted to make a case for them I would now know where to start,” X user @JaEsf said. “This is beautiful and quite crazy that you can do that with crypto. EVM, Solana or any chain. This is why Crypto exist! Simplify movement of assets,” said @mbaril010, another X user. Meanwhile, @waddles_eth, the user who originally sent half the token’s supply to Chen, said the overall outcome met their expectations. “When I saw the story about Mira and her illness, I thought it would be good to buy and send supply to you with the hopes of getting the SOL community behind a good cause on Christmas,” they said in a now-viral X post. “I'm really glad that it worked out the way that it has and I hope that the money helps to find a cure both for Mira and anyone else with her condition.” Crypto for good may finally become a thing in the new year.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-27 07:56:56

In a new YouTube strategy session, Pal says that the leading smart contract platform by volume is forming a bullish wedge pattern on its weekly chart, setting the top altcoin up for a breakout. “The weekly chart of Ethereum hasn’t yet broken out, but it’s very close. So whether we break out this month, which is my hunch, and then maybe retest in the January pullback from liquidity, or we pull back here for a bit and then explode through afterward, either way, that chart, that wedge pattern, to me, is one of the most powerful patterns in all of crypto and suggests we’ve got a very big move in Ethereum to come.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube Pal also believes that Ethereum paired against Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ) could shoot up based on the ISM Manufacturing Index, which is viewed as an indicator of the health of the US economy. “The business cycle is the coincident factor for the Ethereum/Bitcoin cross. So that says as the ISM starts rising ETH starts outperforming Bitcoin. And why is that? Well, it’s a function of ISM being confidence in the economy, disposable income or free cash flows from businesses. People have more money and feel better and have more confidence as the ISM goes up. The business cycle’s better. We’re earning a bit more. Our businesses are doing better, we’re making a bit more profit. And we recycle those profits into investments, and we go further out in the risk curve, which would be Ethereum.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube The former Goldman Sachs executive goes on to note that ETH/BTC is also forming a bullish wedge on its weekly chart. “It’s another wedge. This is the ETH/Bitcoin weekly cross. Look at the big picture. ETH basically is at the same level versus Bitcoin that it was in 2017. It has held value over time, which is very important. It shows that this thing is around and it’s here to stay. So what we’re doing is bouncing off the bottom channel now, just as the ISM is about to pick up, and we either break that wedge, which is a big deal, because that would be ETH outperforming Bitcoin even further, or we stay in that larger range but get to the top of the range. My base case is we breakout and ETH outperforms.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube ETH/BTC is trading for 0.03501 BTC ($3,354) at time of writing.

Morehead, who has been investing in Bitcoin since 2013 when it was just $65, expressed his belief in the four-year Bitcoin cycle in a recent interview. Morehead argues that the Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed event that slows down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, is the primary driver of these cycles. He compares the halving to the closure of half of the world’s copper mines, an event that would undoubtedly cause copper prices to rise. He notes that miners typically sell off their Bitcoin holdings to cover operating costs, and the halving effectively squeezes supply while demand remains constant, sending prices soaring. Related News: Company CEO Talks About Bitcoin: “People Want to Hold More Bitcoin, Not Less” While Morehead acknowledges that the impact of each halving diminishes over time, it remains important in the current market. He cited Pantera Capital’s accurate predictions for previous halving cycles, including an accurate prediction for Bitcoin’s price on August 15, 2020. Based on its data, Pantera predicts that the low point of the current cycle occurred approximately 400 days before the most recent halving (April 19, 2024), with the peak occurring approximately 480 days later, around August 2025. Morehead also touched on the interaction between macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin. He expressed skepticism about the Fed’s ability to lower interest rates, citing a growing economy, low unemployment, and high wage inflation. He believes current interest rates are appropriate given the economic climate. He also voiced concerns about the US’s $2 trillion budget deficit, even in times of economic prosperity, hinting at potential future economic challenges. While he did not explicitly link this to a positive Bitcoin outlook, he did imply that these macroeconomic conditions create a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

On Jan. 10, 2025, at 2:00 (UTC+8), Binance announced its support for the Optimism ( OP ) network upgrade and hard fork. To facilitate the upgrade, Binance will temporarily halt token deposits and withdrawals on the OP network starting from 1:00 (UTC+8) on the same day. The OP network upgrade is designed to enhance the network’s user experience, scalability, and overall performance. Binance has assured users that the trading of tokens supported by the OP network will remain unaffected during this period. A major update or modification to a blockchain network’s protocol that is incompatible with earlier versions is known as a hard fork . This implies that all network participants must update their software to the most recent version to continue engaging in network activities. Hard forks often resolve security vulnerabilities, introduce new features, or boost the network’s scalability and efficiency. Hard forks have historically played a pivotal role in the development of blockchain technology. For instance, the “Merge” transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while the “London” update introduced EIP-1559, which replaced the traditional auction-based fee model with a base fee that is burned (removed from circulation) and an optional priority fee (tip) for faster transactions. This improved gas fee predictability and added a deflationary element to Ethereum’s ( ETH ) supply. These enhancements highlight the importance of continuous innovation and security in blockchain networks.

Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflow on Thursday, with Ark’s ARKB and BlackRock’s IBIT supporting the trend. Notably, this change in fund flows comes after the investment instruments recorded massive outflow since December 19, which has sparked concerns in the broader crypto market. Bitcoin ETF Inflow Regains Momentum The US Spot Bitcoin ETF has recorded a significant outflux recently, with BTC witnessing a sharp decline. This robust outflux also appeared to have weighed on the investors’ sentiment, which has further triggered the volatility in the market. However, the sentiment appeared to have changed recently, as evidenced by the recent fund flow trend. According to Farside Investors data , the overall US Spot BTC ETFs recorded an influx of $475.2 million on Thursday. Fidelity’s FBTC led the influx trend with a $254.4 million inflow on December 26, reflecting the regaining confidence of the investors. Simultaneously, ARK’s ARKB and BlackRock’s IBIT noted inflows of $186.9 million and $56.6 million, respectively.

For context, the BTC ETFs recorded an outflow of $1.51 billion from December 19 through December 24, which has weighed on the investors’ sentiment, especially after the robust inflow over the past few weeks. Considering that, it appears that the institutional interest in the digital assets space is once again soaring. For context, the US Spot Ethereum ETF also recorded an inflow of $117.2 million yesterday, with Fidelity’s FETH leading with an $83 million influx. Source: Farside Investors BTC Recovery Ahead? Bitcoin price today was down about 3% and exchanged hands at $94,975 despite the positive US Spot Bitcoin ETF inflow. Its trading volume was up about 28% and the crypto touched a 24-hour high of $97,784. Furthermore, BTC Futures Open Interest fell about 3% in the last 4-hour time-frame, reflecting the bearish trend noted in the broader market. Meanwhile, the analysts also shared some gloomy forecasts for BTC , as it has lost its crucial support recently. Bitcoin has slipped recently due to a flurry of reasons, with top experts predicting a BTC crash to $60K ahead, which has fueled discussions in the market. However, despite the gloomy sentiment, some market experts remained optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the flagship crypto. Despite the short-term pullback amid the holiday mood, the crypto is likely to make a strong recovery ahead, potentially hitting new highs in the coming days. On the other hand, Bitwise has recently filed for a new BTC ETF to track companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and others. This also showcases the growing institutional confidence towards the flagship crypto. Having said that, the largest crypto by market cap is expected to rebound in the coming days, despite these short-term declines.

Even though these digital currencies are still newsmakers, the focus is now turning to new ventures that have greater potential and better usage models. One such project is Rexas Finance (RXS), an ERC-20 token, which has attracted crypto whales with its asset tokenization and project ecosystem design strategy. In contrast with established cryptocurrencies, Rexas Finance has definite edges, making it an ideal investment for those who want to leverage opportunities in the coming year. Rexas Finance (RXS): Crypto Whales Focusing on Utility Rexas Finance is gradually becoming one of the most favored options among investors who focus on projects with sound business models and strong fundamentals, taking a long-term view. With its strategy of tokenizing physical assets and promoting blockchain applications, it has proven itself as an innovator with a focus on profitability. As an Ethereum blockchain-based token, RXS integrates into the wider crypto ecosystem due to the efficiency and compatibility of the ERC-20 standard. Tokenization and Key Features Driving Crypto Whales Interest The primary convenience Rexas Finance offers is fractional ownership of real estate, fine art, and precious metals through its tokenization model. Besides attracting crypto whales, retail investors are also facilitated, as the investment potential of these markets is expanded. For instance, users of the platform have access to the Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Launchpad. These tools help users design custom tokens and facilitate decentralized funding for blockchain projects. These solutions address the needs of both individuals and institutional users, suggesting a potential for mass adoption. Rexas Finance has also integrated an extensive staking system that encourages long-term token storage by compensating users, thereby preventing massive sell-offs. Additionally, the features and scalability provided by the Ethereum blockchain make the project a strong contender in the tokenization sector. Presale Details and Tokenomics Rexas Finance has performed exceptionally well in all its presale phases, raising over $30 million and selling more than 364 million tokens across all nine stages. Currently in the tenth stage, the price of RXS is set at $0.15. Even at this price, early participants from the presale price of $0.03 in stage 1 have reaped significant returns, reflecting the demand for RWA token and the project as a whole, with crypto whales leading the way in securing a strong position in the market. Rexas Finance Tokenomics The tokenomics of Rexas Finance is clearly well thought out to support balanced growth. The maximum supply is capped at one billion tokens, with 42.5% allocated to presale, giving early investors a significant entry point. Additionally, 22.5% is allocated for staking rewards to encourage long-term holding. The liquidity pool consists of 15% of the total supply, while 10% is reserved for treasury to support the company’s development. Other allocations include marketing (3%), team incentives (3%), giveaways (2%), and partnerships (2%). This well-distributed allocation ensures that core areas are adequately financed for the project’s growth, thereby, pausing as one of cryptocurrencies with most potential in 2025. Security, Visibility, and Giveaway Rexas Finance’s smart contracts are audited by CertiK, a globally recognized blockchain security company. This audit assures investors that the platform’s source code has no exploitable flaws, enhancing trust in the project. Additionally, the early-stage cryptocurrency is visible on Coinbase, increasing credibility and generating more interest from the market, including crypto whales. Rexas Finance has also introduced a $1 million giveaway program to incentivize engagement. Participants can earn RXS tokens by performing simple tasks, such as sharing the project on social media, referring others, and purchasing tokens during the presale. This rewards early investors and helps build a strong community for the project. Conclusion Despite Bitcoin and Ethereum remaining prominent constituents in most portfolios, the growing attention towards ventures like Rexas Finance signals a shift in investor strategy. With RXS’s focus on tokenization, robust tokenomics, and other key features, the project presents significant opportunities as demonstrated by crypto whales actions.

Here’s Average Amount Held by XRP Holders,https://timestabloid.com/updated-xrp-rich-list-heres-average-amount-held-by-xrp-holders/,"As 2024 ends soon, we decided to delve into some important XRP statistics to provide crucial insight into the digital asset’s investment landscape. Recent data from rich-list.info highlights the distribution of XRP across accounts, shedding light on the asset’s ownership. As of the latest analysis, there are 5,767,344 XRP accounts, collectively holding 61,9 billion XRP. This brings the average balance per account to 10,741.25 XRP. Distribution Insights The distribution remains concentrated among a relatively small number of high-balance accounts. For instance, only 6 accounts hold over 1 billion XRP, totaling 7.89 billion XRP. There are 22 accounts with balances between 500 million and 1 billion XRP, holding a combined 11.79 billion XRP. Accounts with balances between 100 million and 500 million XRP are 57, with a cumulative balance of 11.8 billion XRP. In contrast, smaller accounts dominate the lower ranges. 2.45 million accounts hold between 20 and 500 XRP, collectively accounting for only 189.29 million XRP. 2.21 million accounts hold less than 20 XRP, with a combined balance of 23.92 million XRP. These figures show a pronounced disparity in XRP holdings, with the largest accounts owning the majority of the total supply. Whales are not new in the XRP ecosystem, but this data shows the concentration of massive amounts of XRP among just a few investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Performance With XRP currently trading at $2.29, the average account balance of 10,741.25 XRP translates to approximately $24,597.46. This valuation shows how even average XRP holders have thousands of dollars. This distribution reflects broader trends within the cryptocurrency space, where whales exert significant influence. For XRP investors, understanding these dynamics is critical, as the concentration of holdings may impact liquidity, price stability, and more. This distribution also shows the growth in the market over the past few months. A similar analysis in late August showed the average XRP holder at 12,350.86 XRP. Although the average amount of tokens held has dropped slightly, the current value is more than three times the valuation of $7,214.13 from August, and the lower XRP amount can be explained by investors taking profits during the recent price rally. The XRP ecosystem continues to grow, with millions of accounts participating. With notable developments like the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , the ecosystem’s growth is expected to accelerate.

38176447,https://coinpaprika.com/news/will-sam-bankman-fried-get-a-presidential-pardon-from-biden-,1735290862,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38176447.jpeg,Will Sam Bankman-Fried Get a Presidential Pardon from Biden?,https://coinpaprika.com/news/will-sam-bankman-fried-get-a-presidential-pardon-from-biden-,"Speculation is growing around Sam Bankman-Fried potentially receiving a presidential pardon following his conviction for fraud and money laundering. The former FTX founder, sentenced to 25 years in prison, has become the center of heated debates due to his substantial political donations and the leniency of his sentence compared to the scale of his crimes. In 2020, when FTX was at its peak, Bankman-Fried donated $5.2 million to pro-Biden super PACs, becoming the second-largest individual donor to the Democratic Party after Michael Bloomberg. Historical cases show parallels, such as Marc Rich, who was pardoned by Bill Clinton after his ex-wife made significant donations to the Democratic National Committee, and Paul Pogue, who received clemency from Donald Trump following large campaign contributions from his family. The debate intensified after Elon Musk suggested on social media that a pardon for Bankman-Fried is a tangible possibility. Prediction platform Kalshi even estimates a 12% chance of Biden granting clemency. This comes after President Biden recently pardoned Michael Conahan, who was implicated in the notorious “kids-for-cash” scandal. These decisions have raised concerns about whether political donations are influencing high-profile pardons. Another layer of controversy stems from the campaign finance violation charges against Bankman-Fried, which were dropped due to his extradition agreement with the Bahamas. Originally, he faced multiple charges, including conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws. However, these charges were excluded because the Bahamian government did not consent to their inclusion in the extradition process. Although prosecutors initially planned a separate trial for these charges, they later decided not to proceed, stating the evidence would duplicate that of the first trial. Bankman-Fried's sentencing to 25 years for orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in history is seen by many as surprisingly lenient . FTX’s collapse resulted in over $16 billion in customer and creditor losses and wiped out more than $100 billion from the crypto market. Prosecutors had initially sought a 50-year sentence, highlighting the enormous financial damage and the erosion of public trust in the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, key figures in the scandal, such as Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, received significantly lighter consequences due to their cooperation with authorities. Critics argue that Bankman-Fried’s political donations and connections might pave the way for preferential treatment. Prominent lawyer Richard W. Painter warned that any president granting clemency under such circumstances should face impeachment. The ethical dilemma surrounding presidential pardons is not new, but Bankman-Fried’s case brings it sharply into focus, particularly given the sheer scale of his financial misconduct. Despite these discussions, it’s important to note that a presidential pardon is far from guaranteed . While past cases suggest a pattern of influential donors receiving clemency, proving a direct link between donations and pardons remains difficult. Presidents often justify such decisions on various grounds, and motivations can be complex and opaque. The crypto community remains divided. Some believe Bankman-Fried’s political influence could secure his early release, while others argue that the public scrutiny surrounding his case makes a pardon highly unlikely. Regardless of the outcome, the debate highlights ongoing concerns about the intersection of wealth, political power, and justice in high-profile financial crime cases. Bankman-Fried's case serves as a stark reminder of the ethical challenges surrounding presidential clemency. As his prison term begins, all eyes remain on the Biden administration and the potential political and public fallout of any decision to grant or deny a pardon.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-27 09:14:22

The company has made a $2 million injection into Arcanum Capital’s Emerging Technologies Fund II, signaling its commitment to advancing Web3 projects. As reported by the Financial news portal Traders Union, Tether’s investment in Arcanum Capital’s fund focuses on decentralized Web3 initiatives, aiming to enhance financial privacy, facilitate cross-border payments, and expand banking access for the unbanked. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stressed the need to preserve individual freedoms in financial systems, emphasizing the role of censorship-resistant technologies. “ A key concern today is the evolving relationship between financial systems and individual freedoms, particularly in the context of increasing restrictions on open communication ,” Ardoino stated. Arcanum’s Managing Partner, James McDowall, also highlighted the fund’s mission to address vulnerabilities in traditional financial systems, particularly in geopolitically sensitive regions. The focus on blockchain-based secure remittance solutions seemingly aligns with Tether’s broader goals of financial autonomy and decentralization. Tether seeks diversification through strategic investments Tether’s investment in Arcanum is just one part of its diversification strategy. In October, Tether facilitated a $45 million oil transaction using its USDT stablecoin and proposed a boron-backed token to the Turkish government, leveraging Turkey’s global dominance in boron production. The company also made headlines in December with a $775 million commitment to Rumble, a video platform known for its emphasis on free speech. The investment includes a $250 million cash injection and support for Rumble’s tender offer to purchase 70 million shares. Following the announcement, Rumble’s stock surged by 50% in after-hours trading, showcasing Tether’s growing influence beyond cryptocurrency markets. Tether is also venturing into artificial intelligence (AI), with plans to launch an AI platform in Q1 2025. According to CEO Ardoino, this platform will allow users to interact with AI through mobile devices, marking a significant step in the company’s innovation roadmap. “ Next year, we plan to deploy at least half of the profits in investments,” Ardoino said, underlining Tether’s aggressive approach to growth and diversification. “Our investment is just at the beginning .” Regulatory challenges and opportunities While the entity is experiencing significant growth, with its market capitalization surpassing $140 billion in 2024, the company faces regulatory challenges in Europe. The introduction of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations has made the relationship between the stablecoin issuer and European exchanges uneasy. The European Union issued a directive mandating the delisting of USDT from exchanges by December 30, 2024, unless it complies with MiCA regulations. MiCA, the EU’s comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, imposes strict requirements for transparency, auditing, and oversight of stablecoins. As one of the most actively traded digital assets, USDT faces potential removal from European exchanges if it fails to meet these standards, potentially causing significant disruptions to market activity and investor confidence. Analysts suggest this could limit the stablecoin issuer’s reach in the region, but it also provides an opportunity to focus on the Americas, where crypto adoption is accelerating. In the US, Tether’s expansion efforts align well with the crypto-friendly policies expected under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Howard Lutnick , CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and a major Tether stakeholder, is set to join Trump’s cabinet as Commerce Secretary. Lutnick’s involvement is expected to foster a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets and could aid Tether’s US growth trajectory.

Price targets point to new highs TRON poised for growth amid altcoin season hopes Conclusion With a new surge in cryptocurrency gains anticipated, 2025 may offer unprecedented opportunities for investors aiming for extraordinary growth. Spotting digital currencies set for significant appreciation could lead to remarkable profits. This article explores three promising altcoins that might deliver exceptional returns, engaging those keen to benefit from the next major market upswing. DOGEN: The meme token for real alphas According to the team at DOGEN, DOGEN lifestyle is designed for those who strive for the top. DOGEN is primed to explode, with a 700% surge projected before the presale wraps up. As meme tokens take center stage this altcoin season, DOGEN is heating up for thousand-fold gains. Early adopters will lead the charge, leaving others scrambling to catch up. DOGEN is the new alpha in the Solana ecosystem, holding its own against heavyweights like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, tokens that have delivered mind-blowing 1000% gains. Currently flying under the radar, DOGEN is gearing up to smash records in the upcoming bull run. This is a good chance to get in early before the world catches on. DOGEN is more than a token, it’s a community-driven movement. For the hardcore believers, there’s an exclusive airdrop opportunity. Users can flex their DOGEN spirit on social media, stack tokens during the presale, and recruit others to join the movement using their referral link. For every recruit, they’ll earn a juicy 20% of their Golden Points from token buys, turning influence into serious profits. But it doesn’t stop there. DOGEN’s multi-level referral program is as rewarding as it is fierce. Users will score 7% of every token bought by their direct referrals (1st level) and unlock additional levels of rewards as the network grows. Interested investors can join the DOGEN army today. Is SUI set to soar? Price targets point to new highs Despite a recent dip of 11.37% over the past week, SUI has shown impressive growth, gaining 18.91% in the last month and surging 382.74% over six months. Trading between $3.56 and $5.02, the price sits near its moving averages, indicating consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 42.34, suggesting the coin isn’t overbought.

With an anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, SUI might be poised for substantial gains ahead. TRON poised for growth amid altcoin season hopes TRON is showing strong signs of potential growth. Over the past six months, its price has surged by over 100%, indicating strong upward momentum. Despite a slight dip of around 14% in the past week, the coin has risen by about 20% in the last month. Currently trading between $0.21 and $0.29, TRX is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.34. Breaking through this barrier could propel the price toward the next resistance at $0.42, offering substantial gains. The relative strength index is neutral, suggesting room for further upward movement. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, TRX could be set for significant appreciation. Conclusion While SUI and TRX have less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a top pick. Designed for those seeking the best in life, DOGEN embodies luxury and success.

A new study shows that almost 65% of Ethereum ‘s transactions could be processed at the same time, potentially making the network much faster. In a Friday blog post , analysts at layer-1 network Sei ( SEI ) revealed that many of Ethereum’s transactions don’t depend on each other and could run simultaneously, allowing the network to handle more transactions and improve its speed. Right now, Ethereum processes transactions one after another, which is also known as sequential processing. For example, if someone sends 1 ( ETH ) to one person and then that person sends 1 ETH to someone else, these transactions need to happen one after the other. If they were processed at the same time, the second one would be wrong because your balance wouldn’t be updated yet. Yet, some transactions don’t affect each other, Sei’s study reveals. You might also like: Starknet debuts parallel transaction execution on testnet As analysts at Sei explain, if Bob sends 1 ETH to Alice and someone else sends you 1 ETH at the same time, they don’t interfere with each other. These transactions can happen in parallel, meaning they can be processed at the same time. The study found that 64.85% of Ethereum transactions are like this, meaning they could be processed in parallel, without waiting for others to finish. If this method is used, Ethereum could process many more transactions and become faster. “Each block averages 60.77 dependent transactions, indicating significant potential for parallel execution optimization.” Sei However, there are still some challenges. Some transactions still need to be processed one after the other because they rely on each other, what is also known as dependency. According to Sei’s calculations, about 35.15% of transactions on Ethereum are dependent on others. There are different ways to improve Ethereum’s speed. One idea is called “optimistic concurrency control,” a method used by the Sei protocol, which lets transactions happen at the same time, assuming they won’t cause problems. After the transactions finish, the system checks if any conflicts happened. If there’s a problem, the system can redo those transactions. This approach could help Ethereum process transactions faster while keeping things simple for developers. In the future, Ethereum could also use sharding , which splits the network into smaller pieces to help process transactions faster, Sei admits.

Citi Analysts Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-rise-in-bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins-continue-in-2025-citi-analysts-explained/,"The year 2024, which began with the acceptance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, ends with Donald Trump's presidential victory. Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies are leaving behind a record-breaking year, driven by major events such as ETF approval and Trump's election victory. So What Awaits Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in 2025? While there are many predictions on this subject, Citi analysts recently announced their expectations for 2025. According to Business Insider, Citi analysts listed six factors that will determine the future of cryptocurrencies. Citi analysts predict strong crypto growth in 2025 driven by Trump policies, rising ETF inflows, and stablecoin innovations. “Bitcoin ETFs kicked off the sector’s rally in January. In September, a series of central bank rate cuts and other policies contributed to the rally, paving the way for a growth economy. But no development was more critical for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than Donald Trump’s victory, which helped push Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time, sending altcoins soaring. We expect this rise to continue in 2025.” Analysts, who explained the 6 factors that will support the rise in 2025, put ETF inflows in the first place. Citi analysts stated that they expect spot Bitcoin ETF inflows to continue strongly in 2025 and that it will be the most important driving force of the rise. Analysts said that apart from ETFs, the positive regulations of the Trump administration, the expanding stablecoin market, the macroeconomic environment, the widespread use of crypto, and the increasing portfolio allocation ratio will support the rise in BTC and crypto. Citi analysts said the macroeconomic environment is likely to support risky assets such as cryptocurrencies through the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, analysts noted that institutions will increase their allocations of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, adding that the increased allocation could boost the price of Bitcoin. Analysts recently said that Trump, who is preparing to take office in January 2025, will implement policies that could significantly affect the crypto market, which would be positive for prices. “Trump promised to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment,” they said. *This is not investment advice.

The proposed Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF is designed to offer exposure to bonds issued by corporations that use the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies. The Bitcoin Bond ETF In a December 27 post on X, the firm stated, “Strive’s first of many planned Bitcoin solutions will democratize access to Bitcoin bonds, which are bonds issued by corporations to purchase Bitcoin.” The announcement further noted that these bonds offer attractive risk-return characteristics associated with Bitcoin but are currently out of reach for most investors. The ETF aims to bridge this gap by providing everyday Americans and institutional investors with easier access to BTC-related financial instruments. According to the filing submitted on December 26, the proposed ETF will invest in securities from companies like MicroStrategy, which has become a prominent player in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Since 2020, under the leadership of Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has invested approximately $27 billion in the coin. These purchases were financed through equity offerings and convertible bonds, which typically carry low or no interest but can be converted into shares under specified conditions. The Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF will be actively managed and will achieve its exposure to BTC-linked bonds either directly or through derivatives such as swaps and options. To maintain liquidity and collateral for these instruments, the fund will invest in high-quality, short-term assets like U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments. While details regarding the management fee have not been disclosed, actively managed funds often come with higher fees compared to passive alternatives. Strategic Context Since its start in 2022, Strive Asset Management has focused on addressing long-term economic risks, including the global fiat debt crisis, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. The company stated, “We strongly believe there is no better long-term investment to hedge against these risks than thoughtful exposure to Bitcoin.” The asset manager views the flagship cryptocurrency as an important part of a diversified investment portfolio, encouraging both individual and institutional investors to allocate funds directly to Bitcoin, BTC bonds, and companies focused on the cryptocurrency. Ramaswamy, who launched Strive with a focus on capitalism-driven strategies, has maintained a high-profile presence in both business and politics. Although he briefly ran against Donald Trump in the 2023 Republican presidential primary, he later endorsed the President-elect. Upon winning, Trump appointed Ramaswamy to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), an initiative aimed at reducing government waste, with X owner Elon Musk.

However, renowned analysts are sounding the alarm, predicting a drastic correction to $60,000. #Bitcoin $BTC will CRASH to $60,000!!! At least, that's what some of the most renowned analysts are saying. Let's dive in — Ali (@ali_charts) December 26, 2024 Tone Vays believes that trading below $95,000 is a ominous sign, increasing the likelihood of a downturn to $73,000. Peter Brandt echoes this sentiment, warning of a potential breakdown below $70,000. Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s optimistic forecast of $250,000 by 2025 is tempered by Mark Newton’s prediction of a near-term drop to $60,000. Is Bitcoin Gearing For A Major Dip? On-chain analysis suggests that a correction to $70,000 is plausible, with a significant support zone breached at $97,300. Savvy investors appear to be bracing for impact, with over 33,000 bitcoins worth $3.23 billion flowing into exchanges in the past week. Profit-taking is also on the rise, with $7.17 billion in bitcoin profits realized on December 23 alone. Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 For the bullish outlook to prevail, bitcoin must reclaim its critical support zone and sustain a daily close above $100,000. If achieved, this could pave the way for a new leg up to $168,500. However, the bears are circling, and a failure to reclaim this level could spell disaster for the cryptocurrency.

While the European Union spent years crafting its shiny new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ), Trump came in swinging with promises to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet.” The result? Crypto giants like Binance are dumping Europe and packing their bags for the States. Bitcoin’s insane rally to $108,000 this year—double what it was last year—is no coincidence. Trump’s win and his plans to overhaul U.S. crypto regulations have pumped confidence back into the market. Retail and institutional investors are betting on a White House that actually wants crypto to thrive. MiCA , meanwhile, looks like an over-engineered relic that no one has time for. MiCA faces trouble as costs pile up MiCA is supposed to clean up the crypto mess left by disasters like FTX, Genesis, and Celsius. It forces companies offering services like trading and custody to get authorized in the EU. But it comes with a fat price tag. Even Tether, the world’s biggest stablecoin, won’t comply with MiCA and is getting kicked off regulated EU exchanges. Some companies, like Coinbase and Circle, have managed to secure their licenses, though it’s clear the EU is bleeding talent. Meanwhile, Trump is rolling out the red carpet. He’s appointing pro-crypto folks like Paul Atkins as SEC chair and David Sacks as a White House crypto czar. “We’re going to do something great with crypto,” Trump said recently. Companies that fled U.S. regulations under Biden are now scrambling to come back. Binance US’s interim CEO, Norman Reed, even teased a return of dollar services in 2025, saying, “It is not a matter of if, but when.” Trump’s big crypto plans crush EU hopes Trump’s administration also wants to set up a national Bitcoin reserve, pouring $21 billion annually into the plan over five years. This would make the U.S. a global leader in Bitcoin holdings, leaving Europe to play catch-up. The Bitcoin Policy Institute has been screaming about this for years, and now it looks like Trump is the first to actually listen. Access to banking is also on Trump’s to-do list. His administration plans to order banks to provide services to crypto companies, reversing the hostile stance seen under Biden. This means no more shutting out crypto firms just because they’re crypto. Industry insiders are betting this will bring a flood of new investments into the U.S. market. While Europe fiddles with MiCA, Trump’s team is drafting new principles for agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The goal is to create a system that actually works for businesses, unlike the restrictive measures slapped down during Biden’s term.

Singapore-based web3 firm Matrixport says there are still many risks that could disrupt Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) bull market in 2025. In a research note on Dec. 27, the firm pointed to Google’s “Willow” quantum chip with 105 qubits as reigniting discussions about potential threats to Bitcoin’s security. While the technology is still in its early innings, Matrixport noted that the “theoretical risks warrant attention.” You might also like: Avalanche CEO calls for freezing Satoshi-era million Bitcoins amid quantum computing concerns Inflation expectations are also rising, partly due to possible tariffs under Trump’s presidency. The report says these tariffs had “minimal impact” during his first term but warns that the Fed’s response to fiscal policies could affect monetary policy next year. “ the FOMC could adopt a more hawkish stance if a Trump presidency seemed increasingly likely or was confirmed—both of which have now come to pass. This scenario introduces new uncertainties for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market, as the Fed’s response to potential fiscal policies under Trump could shape the trajectory of monetary policy.” Matrixport Matrixport highlighted that regulatory pressure often marks turning points for Bitcoin. The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has eased concerns, but macroeconomic factors now take center stage. “Inflation should not present a major issue next year,” the report states, adding that this could allow the Fed to maintain a dovish stance. Bitcoin’s future, according to Matrixport, now hinges on how it navigates these emerging challenges.

On Dec. 26, over 1.8% of BONK’s entire supply, amounting to 1.69 trillion tokens worth over $51 million was burned as part of the dog-themed meme coin’s community holiday token burning event dubbed the “BURNmas.” Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion ❗️❗️❗️ #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 Initially proposed in late November, the project planned to burn 1,000 BONK for every X post using the hashtag #LetsBONK, and 10,000 BONK for every new follower gained on Instagram and TikTok, with a final target of burning 1 trillion tokens. The idea was to spur community engagement and increase visibility for the token during the holiday season. However, due to higher-than-expected engagement across social media platforms, the initial target of 1 trillion tokens was surpassed. In response, BonkDAO members voted in favor of an updated proposal to increase the burn amount to 1.69 trillion tokens. You might also like: BonkDAO announces plans to burn 1.69t BONK in “BURNmas” event Token burns are a common occurrence in the crypto space, especially among meme coins like BONK, which boasts a total supply of 100 trillion tokens, now reduced to 90.97 trillion after recent burns. By permanently removing a chunk of tokens from circulation, these events aim to tighten supply dynamics, theoretically boosting scarcity and, in turn, driving up the token’s value. For instance, following BONK’s previous token burn event on July 29, when 84 million tokens valued at over $2 million at the time were removed from circulation, it resulted in a 25% rally for the token. This time, however, the BURNmas spectacle failed to deliver, with the token dropping over 7% following the event with its market cap hovering around $2.3 billion. Why is BONK price going down? While there was no solid reason that sparked the sell-off, BONK’s ( BONK ) decline coincided with a broader downturn in the crypto market, fueled by a risk-off sentiment driven by Bitcoin’s lackluster performance, struggling to recover above the $100k mark. Additionally, holiday-induced low trading activity saw BONK’s volume drop over 8% in the past 24 hours. Frustration also brewed among several BONK enthusiasts, who voiced dissatisfaction over the team’s failure to execute the token burn on Christmas Day as originally promised. This delay may have dampened investor confidence and contributed to the sell-off. Another potential reason why BONK dropped is that many investors may have rotated their investments into Pudgy Penguins’ token, Pengu (PENGU). Just days after launching, PENGU amassed a market cap of over $2.2 billion and even briefly surpassed BONK as the largest meme coin on the Solana blockchain on Dec. 26. The token has also outperformed BONK over the past week, gaining over 32% compared to BONK’s 7.2% rally. At press time, the token had formed a god candle on its daily chart, which is typically a sign of whale activity. The sudden price rise managed to mitigate some of the day’s losses, bringing the token’s price to $0.000030. If more investors follow suit, it could spark the next leg up for the meme coin toward the key resistance level at $0.000034, a level BONK has tested twice this week but failed to breach.

The ALTCOIN Index includes ETH ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), SOL ( SOL ), BNB, DOGE, ADA, TRX, AVAX, and SHIB. Through the index, users can track trends and price changes without having to buy individual tokens or ETFs . Thus, traders can buy or sell USDT trading pairs alongside altcoins on the index. A futures index is an instrument typically used to monitor stock markets. Its allows traders to track the performance of certain assets in the market, such as commodity shares. Therefore, investors are able to assess or hedge against the market movements to determine the best course of action. This is because traders can immediately monitor other assets within the broader market, not just the ones they hold.

Chief Product Officer of BingX, Vivien Lin, stated the new futures and altcoin trading feature will offer a number of major cryptocurrencies and compile them into a singular list to make it easier for users to monitor market trends. “This index trading pair should help our less experienced users with their trading goals more easily, particularly when they are unsure which asset to trade and just want to trade major altcoins in general with leverage,” said Lin. The platform ensures that the index composition will be updated regularly on a quarterly basis to showcase current movements response to market conditions.

Hackers have been using sophisticated techniques to steal private keys, wallet data, and other sensitive information, which has resulted in substantial financial loss for victims. The attackers used a phishing domain that mimicked a legitimate Zoom domain, “app[.] us4zoom[.] us.”, reported SlowMist on Dec. 27. Source: SlowMist The scam site illustrated Zoom’s interface and tricked users into hitting the “Launch Meeting” button. The button did not open the Zoom application; it started downloading a malicious installation package called “ZoomApp_v.3. 14. dmg.” After installation, this package ran a script called “ZoomApp.file” that asked users to put in their system password. https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1872526964789219563 Upon analyzing, SlowMist reported that the script called a hidden executable file to deploy named “.ZoomApp”. The app tried to access data like system information, browser cookies, KeyChain data, and cryptocurrency wallet credentials. The compressed data was then transmitted to a server under the hackers’ control, associated with the IP address 141.98.9.20, which has been labeled as malicious by multiple threat intelligence services.

This included stored passwords, cryptocurrency wallet details, and sensitive Telegram credentials, among other information. This allowed the attackers to obtain wallet mnemonic phrases and private keys, which facilitated the theft of large amounts of cryptocurrency. The attackers’ back-end system, located in the Netherlands, tracked user interactions through the Telegram API, with signs that they employed Russian-language scripts. The phishing campaign went live on Nov. 14, 2024, and has already attempted to steal millions of dollars in crypto from various users.

Base is leading the momentum of L2 chains, in addition to the expansion of Arbitrum and Optimism. The L2 narrative slowed down in 2024 when it came to general hype, but the actual infrastructure was one of the most widely used Web3 features. Base reached a record of 8.8M transactions per day, surpassing other top L2s which together achieve 5.5M transactions per day.

The Polygon chain derived most of its activity from Polymarket bets. The chain retains legacy status for some apps, though it lost its previous inflow of activity based on Web3 games and NFTs. Toward the end of 2024, Polygon was lagging as projects picked other networks to launch their apps and tokens. L2 chains are also absorbing value, both through native token launches and inflows from Ethereum. Based on L2Beat data, L2 chains lock in more than $58B , mostly held within optimistic rollups. Toward the end of 2024, Ethereum held $68.42B in value locked, mostly based on LidoDAO and Aave. L2s retain varied app profiles The growth in L2 activity comes from each chain retaining a profile of apps and activities. Arbitrum and Optimism established themselves as hubs for DeFi and DEX trading. Base gets its heightened activity from high-liquidity trading and moving cbBTC, the newly issued wrapped BTC token. The other source of activity is AI agents, after Virtuals Protocol launched on Base. AI agents are tokenized, and are quickly becoming the most actively traded asset class on Base. Different chains are leaders in their category, specializing in specific smart contracts. DeFi activity made ZK Sync Era, Arbitrum, and Optimism peak performers. Base is the leader in CeFi activity , as it carries some of the utility transactions for Coinbase. For the Taiko chain, WETH9 is the busiest smart contract , fueling DeFi with a wrapped version of Ethereum. For Base, the leading contract is a MEV strategy executor. Those contracts are the most prominent based on gas burned, due to bandwidth constraints and competition. For Base, the contract with the biggest transaction count belongs to Uniswap V3. Recently, the Uniswap DEX also posted a record , after achieving peak monthly volume on its Base version. L2s keep adding to Ethereum burn L2 chains have shown they can successfully scale Ethereum tasks and carry high-speed activity. As of December 27, L2 blob fees were the third-biggest source of ETH burns, helping to curb inflation. Blob fees continue to be a top factor for daily ETH burns. | Source: Ultrasound Money Ethereum is still slightly inflationary, with inflation going back to 0.5% annualized. Most L2s are competing for blob space on Ethereum, but paying out relatively small fees to use the L1 layer. Taiko remains one of the most common sources of payments to L1, as the chain does not slow down its transaction posting to Ethereum. The past year saw conflicts arise on the exact role of L2s and whether they were harming Ethereum. In the second half of the year, L2 chains achieved a form of equilibrium, as both Ethereum participants and L2 validators could earn fees. Some apps continue to use their Ethereum versions, making the L1 chain retain some of the busiest smart contracts. Ethereum is still the biggest carrier of stablecoins , as the ERC-20 version of USDT is the most widely traded and transacted. L2 chains have taken up some of the transaction count and meme token activity, but they have only retained a fraction of the available stablecoin liquidity. Instead, L2s use wrapped versions of ETH as a valuable collateral, and expand by hosting a new selection of decentralized apps.

Airdrop Details and Eligibility The Jupiter team is finalizing specific criteria for the airdrop, with ongoing discussions within the community to refine the eligibility guidelines. The distribution strategy focuses on two main groups: Users and Stakers: Rewards will be distributed based on trading activity and staking contributions. Carrots and Good Cats: A designation for prominent community supporters who will receive additional incentives. The draft eligibility framework suggests that trading volume on Jupiter products in the past year will play a significant role. For example, users with an annual trading volume of at least $800 will receive 50 tokens, while those with a trading volume of $29,000 will be given 250 tokens. This isn’t Jupiter’s first major token distribution. The platform has already given away around 1 billion JUP tokens in 2023 to users who had traded at least $1,000 in volume prior to a snapshot taken in November of that year. Tokenomics Update JUP’s circulating supply is currently 1.35 billion tokens with a maximum supply of 10 billion tokens. However, Jupiter plans to burn 3 billion tokens in August 2024 in a move approved by the community, reducing the maximum supply to 7 billion. Jupiter's Role in the Solana Ecosystem Launched in October 2021 by developer nicknamed “Meow,” Jupiter aggregates liquidity from various DEXs on Solana to provide users with the best rates for token swaps. The platform also offers perpetual trading products, adding to its utility and appeal. Over the past 24 hours, Jupiter reported an impressive $2.3 billion in trading volume, underscoring its important role in the Solana ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

This is part of Sui’s monthly process, which increases the circulating supply and impacts investor holdings. Despite a recent 5.31% dip over the past week, SUI has been a standout performer, surging by 31.25% in the last month and hitting an ATH of $4.93 after trading below $1. Now, at $4.26, it boasts a one-year gain of 413%, far outpacing XRP’s 250% gain. Analysts see a rise of $5 in the coming months with a scope to rise higher than expected. So is SUI a better option for profit-takers? Let’s see its growth potential. Raoul Pal’s Bullish Take on SUI Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, is bullish about SUI’s future, suggesting it could outperform major players like XRP and Solana (SOL) during this bull run. Pal highlights SUI’s breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern as a signal of its potential upside. With Pal’s insight the coin has the potential to break out in 2025 and many analysts even target above $5 for SUI by Q1 of 2025. While acknowledging Solana’s strength as a proven protocol, Pal sees SUI as a riskier but more rewarding investment. He also believes SUI’s upward trend could outpace XRP, Solana, and ETH even as XRP shows signs of a potentially explosive move after breaking its seven-year downtrend. Pal advises being wise in diverting the portfolio with an aim of targeting established coins and giving a small portion to these quick profit-giving assets to sail safely in this bear market. Technically, Good Time to Invest in SUI? SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently crossed $1.65 billion, a milestone that has fueled its price momentum. This growth is linked to its expanding network and bullish chart patterns, including a breakout from a head-and-shoulders formation. However, indicators like the MACD histogram turning negative suggest caution, while the RSI remains neutral. SUI is giving tough competition to XRP is quite surprising for crypto investors who are looking for a new investment opportunity. Since the coin is down at this moment it is a good time to stack the coin before the price rises.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|SOL|TRADING|XRP|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 10:10:17

According to data from CryptoQuant contributor and market analyst Maartunn, the average USDT transaction size rose from $4,273 in June 2023 to $9,718 in December 2024 . This trend highlights increased activity from larger market participants, suggesting growing trust and adoption of the TRON blockchain. The Rise of USDT on TRON TRON has become one of the most prominent platforms for Tether transactions, rivaling Ethereum in terms of transaction volume and efficiency. The network’s low fees and high throughput make it an attractive choice for both retail and institutional users, fueling its growth as a major player in the stablecoin ecosystem. Key Milestones Increased Transaction Size : The doubling of average transaction size signals a shift towards larger transactions, potentially reflecting adoption by institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. Dominance in Stablecoin Transfers : TRON now processes a significant portion of global USDT transfers, thanks to its efficient infrastructure. Why TRON Is Gaining Momentum The TRON Network’s growth in USDT transaction volume can be attributed to several key factors: 1. Low Transaction Fees TRON offers negligible fees compared to Ethereum, making it an appealing option for large transactions. This cost efficiency is particularly important for high-frequency and high-value transactions. 2. High Transaction Speed With the ability to process thousands of transactions per second, TRON provides a seamless experience for users who require fast and reliable transfers. 3. Institutional Adoption The increase in average transaction size suggests that institutional players, such as hedge funds, trading firms, and high-net-worth individuals, are embracing TRON for their USDT transactions. 4. Growing Trust in TRON As stablecoin adoption continues to grow, TRON’s consistent performance and secure network have contributed to increased trust among market participants.

Its role as a stable, dollar-pegged asset makes it a preferred choice for traders and institutions alike. USDT on TRON vs. Ethereum Cost : TRON’s minimal fees offer a clear advantage over Ethereum’s sometimes unpredictable gas fees. Adoption : While Ethereum remains a hub for DeFi and NFTs, TRON’s focus on stablecoin transactions gives it an edge in this specific niche. Institutional Use Cases Larger USDT transaction sizes on TRON may reflect its increasing use for: Cross-border payments Arbitrage trading Settlement of large trades on centralized and decentralized exchanges Insights from CryptoQuant’s Maartunn Maartunn, a CryptoQuant contributor, emphasized that the growth in USDT transaction volume on TRON aligns with broader market trends, including the rising adoption of stablecoins for institutional purposes.

Ecosystem Growth : Increased activity may attract more developers and projects to the TRON ecosystem. Increased Competition : Other networks, such as Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, may need to innovate to compete with TRON’s cost and efficiency advantages. Challenges Ahead Despite its growth, TRON faces challenges that could impact its trajectory: Regulatory Scrutiny : Stablecoins like USDT are under increased regulatory focus, which could affect their adoption across platforms. Competition : Networks such as Solana, Avalanche, and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions continue to evolve, offering alternatives to TRON. Scalability Demands : As transaction volume grows, TRON must ensure its network remains scalable and efficient. Conclusion The doubling of USDT’s average transaction size on the TRON Network reflects its growing appeal among larger market participants, including institutions and high-net-worth individuals.

38181135,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114894,1735300161,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Luxor COO Skeptical About Trump’s Promise to Mine All Remaining Bitcoin in the U.S.,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-mining-us-trump-localization/,"Luxor COO Skeptical About Trump’s Promise to Mine All Remaining Bitcoin in the U.S. Ethan Vera, Chief Operating Officer of Luxor Technologies, has raised concerns about President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitious promise to localize all remaining Bitcoin mining operations within the United States. Vera’s skepticism stems from the global distribution of mining power, where U.S.-based miners currently account for less than 50%, facing stiff competition from major mining hubs like China and Russia. Trump’s Vision for Bitcoin Mining in the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to make the United States a dominant player in the Bitcoin mining industry. His plan involves localizing all remaining Bitcoin mining operations to strengthen the country’s position in the crypto space and ensure energy security while reducing reliance on foreign entities. This promise aligns with Trump’s broader agenda of “America First,” focusing on economic independence and technological leadership. However, such a bold commitment raises questions about its feasibility and the challenges involved. Why Luxor’s Ethan Vera Is Skeptical Ethan Vera, whose company Luxor Technologies specializes in Bitcoin mining and related services, outlined several key obstacles to achieving Trump’s goal: 1. Current Share of Mining Power U.S.-based Bitcoin miners control less than 50% of the global mining hash rate, with significant portions dominated by China, Russia, and other countries. This imbalance highlights the difficulty of centralizing mining operations solely within the U.S. 2. International Competition China : Despite regulatory crackdowns, China remains a key player due to its access to cheap hardware and energy. Russia : Benefiting from abundant natural resources, Russia has emerged as another major mining hub, leveraging its cold climate and inexpensive electricity. Emerging Markets : Countries in Central Asia and South America are also gaining traction, offering low-cost energy and favorable regulatory environments. 3. Infrastructure Challenges Scaling up Bitcoin mining in the U.S. requires significant investment in infrastructure, including data centers, power generation facilities, and advanced cooling systems. These demands could strain existing energy grids and face resistance from local communities concerned about environmental impacts. 4. Energy Consumption and Sustainability Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, consuming vast amounts of electricity. Balancing Trump’s localization promise with sustainable energy practices presents another challenge, particularly given the growing emphasis on reducing carbon footprints. U.S. Bitcoin Mining Landscape The U.S. has made notable strides in Bitcoin mining, particularly following China’s crackdown on crypto activities in 2021. States like Texas, Wyoming, and Kentucky have emerged as mining hotspots due to their crypto-friendly policies and access to affordable energy. Advantages for U.S. Miners Stable Regulatory Environment : The U.S. offers greater legal clarity compared to many competitors. Access to Capital : American mining firms benefit from a well-developed financial ecosystem, allowing them to raise funds more easily. Innovation : Companies in the U.S. are at the forefront of developing efficient mining technologies and exploring renewable energy solutions. Remaining Challenges Despite these advantages, the U.S. must contend with high energy costs in some regions, logistical barriers, and competition for mining equipment. Global Competition: The Reality Check Trump’s plan to localize Bitcoin mining must contend with the decentralized and competitive nature of the global mining industry. China’s Mining Comeback Although China officially banned crypto mining in 2021, reports indicate a resurgence in underground operations. Chinese miners still access low-cost hardware and hydroelectric power during rainy seasons, maintaining their influence. Russia’s Expanding Hash Rate Russia’s colder climate and cheap electricity make it an attractive location for mining farms. The government has also expressed interest in regulating and supporting the industry, positioning itself as a competitor to U.S. dominance. Diversifying Geographies Countries like Kazakhstan, El Salvador, and Canada are investing in mining infrastructure, providing further diversification to the global mining network. Feasibility of Localizing Bitcoin Mining in the U.S. Trump’s pledge to localize Bitcoin mining raises important questions: Is Full Localization Achievable? Given the global nature of Bitcoin mining, achieving complete localization in the U.S. may be impractical. Instead, policies could focus on increasing the U.S. share of mining power while collaborating with global partners. How to Address Energy Concerns? Promoting renewable energy adoption in mining could align Trump’s vision with sustainability goals, making it more palatable to regulators and environmental advocates. Will It Require Policy Overhauls? Achieving significant progress may require incentives such as tax breaks, grants for renewable energy projects, and easing restrictions on industrial-scale mining operations. Conclusion Ethan Vera’s skepticism about Trump’s promise to centralize all Bitcoin mining operations in the U.S. underscores the complexity of the cryptocurrency mining landscape. While the U.S. has the potential to expand its influence in the sector, achieving full localization faces significant challenges, including global competition, infrastructure demands, and energy concerns. Trump’s vision, though ambitious, could serve as a catalyst for greater investment and innovation in the U.S. crypto mining industry. By addressing these challenges strategically, the U.S. might not only increase its share of Bitcoin mining but also set global standards for sustainable and efficient mining practices.

On Friday, BGB price witnessed an over 20% uptick as the crypto exchange revealed an 800 million token burn plan to bolster the coin’s tokenomics. As a response, market watchers are now extensively eyeing the crypto optimistically, awaiting further gains in light of recent community developments. BGB Price Bullish As Team Reveals New White Paper Bolstering Tokenomics In an official Bitget announcement , the crypto exchange revealed a new version of the BGB white paper, sparking optimistic market discussions globally. As per the announcement, 800 million BGB, which is currently held by the core team, will be burned in one go. This massive burn marks the destruction of nearly 40% of the crypto’s total supply. The total value burned exceeds over $5 billion at the time of reporting. In turn, market enthusiasts expect phenomenal gains in the asset’s price ahead, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, the token burn mechanism permanently reduces an asset’s circulating supply by transferring it to a null address. Intriguingly, another popular crypto that showcases a similar tokenomics-bolstering effect is Shiba Inu. CoinGape reported the meme coin to be leveraging constant SHIB burns , projecting bullishness over its future price movements. Similarly, in light of Bitget’s massive token burn plan, even BGB price remains optimistically eyed by crypto market participants. Also, the new white paper revealed that the total supply of the token will be reduced to 1.2 billion, while 100% of it will be fully circulated. Notably, the crypto’s team will repurchase and burn the Bitget token at ‘20% of the quarterly profits of the exchange and wallet business starting in 2025.’ This endeavor is expected to further bolster the coin’s tokenomics, fueling a bullish impact on price. Intriguingly, amid the new white paper saga, on-chain data provider EmberCN spotlighted on X, a unique address that may be used for the 800 million token burn chronicle. Per EmberCN, the address 0x85CF1.., which currently holds 564 million BGB (28.2 %), may be used for the massive burn. Market watchers continue to monitor the exchange’s on-chain movements amid such ecosystem developments. Bitget Token Soars Over 20% At the time of reporting, BGB price rocketed nearly 22% intraday and is currently trading at $8.39. Its intraday low and high were $6.78 and $8.49, respectively. Notably, the coin took a bullish intraday trajectory, aligning with the abovementioned optimistic announcement. Besides, it’s also worth mentioning that recent community developments have further immersed the coin in a bullish bubble. The crypto exchange recently revealed that it is merging Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) with BGB in an effort to revolutionize the ecosystem. This announcement has, in turn, reverberated optimism for the crypto project globally.

Recently, Jacob King, an analyst from the cryptocurrency newsletter Whalewire, added fuel to the debate by sharing his polarizing take on X (formerly Twitter). King described Bitcoin as “utterly useless,” labeling it a “malignant grift” that thrives on speculative delusions and promises of easy profits. “The Greatest Thought Experiment of Our Lifetime” King began his critique by acknowledging Bitcoin’s conceptual ingenuity, calling it “the greatest thought experiment of our lifetime.” He highlighted its significance in showcasing how easily greed can manipulate human behavior. According to King, Bitcoin’s rise is a testament to the susceptibility of individuals to promises of quick wealth, often clouding rational judgment. From Online Gambling to Global Speculation In his post, King traced Bitcoin’s origins, arguing that it began as a niche tool for internet poker players seeking anonymity. Over time, however, he believes it has morphed into something far more concerning: A “Malignant Grift” King described Bitcoin as a predatory system, exploiting the hopes of everyday investors drawn by tales of astronomical returns. Speculative Frenzy He suggested that Bitcoin’s value is propped up not by utility but by “delusional speculators” who invest based on the fear of missing out (FOMO). A Dangerous Game Comparing the cryptocurrency market to a game of musical chairs, King warned that when the music stops, many will be left facing significant losses. Is Bitcoin Truly Useless? While King’s critique is scathing, it raises questions about Bitcoin’s true value and utility. Let’s examine some arguments for and against his claim: Arguments Supporting King’s Critique Lack of Intrinsic Value : Bitcoin does not generate cash flow like stocks or provide utility like commodities, leading critics to question its inherent worth. Energy Consumption : Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining mechanism consumes vast amounts of electricity, leading to environmental concerns. Speculative Nature : Critics argue that Bitcoin’s value is driven more by hype than by tangible use cases. Counterarguments Digital Gold : Proponents liken Bitcoin to gold—a store of value rather than a traditional asset. Decentralization : Bitcoin offers an alternative to centralized financial systems, empowering users with greater control over their assets. Global Utility : In regions with unstable economies or restrictive monetary policies, Bitcoin provides a lifeline for transferring and preserving wealth. Bitcoin: A “Malignant Grift” or Revolutionary Technology? The label of “malignant grift” used by King is especially provocative. It suggests not only deception but also harm inflicted on those who invest. Yet, many argue that Bitcoin has achieved groundbreaking milestones: First Decentralized Cryptocurrency : Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology, inspiring thousands of other projects. Financial Inclusion : For unbanked populations, Bitcoin offers a means to participate in the global economy. Institutional Adoption : Despite criticisms, major companies and financial institutions have integrated Bitcoin into their portfolios and payment systems. The Risk of Speculative Bubbles King’s warning about Bitcoin being a “giant game of musical chairs” touches on a legitimate concern: market bubbles. Historically, speculative bubbles are characterized by: Overvaluation : Prices rise far beyond an asset’s fundamental value. FOMO : Investors pile in, fearing they’ll miss out on gains. Inevitable Collapse : When confidence wanes, prices plummet, leaving many with significant losses. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise and occasional sharp declines fit this pattern, fueling skepticism from analysts like King. Community Reactions to King’s Criticism King’s post on X has sparked heated discussions across the crypto community: Supporters of King’s View : Critics of Bitcoin have praised King for calling out what they see as fundamental flaws in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Advocates : Proponents have countered his claims, arguing that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and adoption potential far outweigh its speculative risks. Conclusion Jacob King’s declaration that Bitcoin is “utterly useless” has reignited debates about the cryptocurrency’s true value and purpose. While his criticisms highlight undeniable risks associated with speculative behavior and environmental impact, Bitcoin’s supporters argue that its revolutionary technology and potential for financial inclusion are too significant to ignore. As Bitcoin continues to evolve, its utility, adoption, and market dynamics will remain central to discussions about its role in the global financial landscape. For investors and observers alike, King’s critique serves as a reminder to approach the cryptocurrency market with caution, critical thinking, and a clear understanding of risks.

38181251,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114888,1735300283,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"MIRA Meme Coin Reaches $80 Million Market Cap, Supporting Rare Brain Tumor Research",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mira-meme-coin-80m-market-cap/,"MIRA Meme Coin Reaches $80 Million Market Cap, Supporting Rare Brain Tumor Research The cryptocurrency community has witnessed the rise of a unique project, as the MIRA meme coin —a digital token created to support research on rare brain tumors in children—has reached an $80 million market capitalization. This milestone highlights the growing intersection of crypto innovation and philanthropic efforts, with MIRA emerging as a beacon of hope for families affected by rare diseases. The Story Behind MIRA Meme Coin The creation of MIRA meme coin was sparked by a heartfelt appeal from Siqi Chen, the CEO of a tech company, whose young daughter Mira was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor. Turning to the platform X (formerly Twitter), Chen called for donations to fund research into the disease. In an extraordinary act of solidarity, a user on Pump.fun, a platform dedicated to meme coins, created MIRA, a token designed to generate support and awareness for the cause. Soon after, an anonymous X user purchased 50% of the total supply of MIRA and transferred it to a project wallet under Chen’s control. This move transformed the meme coin from a niche initiative into a powerful tool for fundraising and advocacy. Reaching an $80 Million Market Cap As of December 27, 2024, the market capitalization of MIRA has reached $80 million. This remarkable growth is fueled by a combination of community-driven enthusiasm, philanthropic intent, and the broader appeal of meme coins in the crypto space. Siqi Chen has committed to liquidating $1,000 worth of MIRA tokens every 10 minutes, ensuring a steady flow of funds toward brain tumor research. This innovative approach demonstrates the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies to address real-world challenges through collective action. What Makes MIRA Unique? MIRA meme coin stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency market for several reasons: 1. A Philanthropic Mission Unlike most meme coins that thrive on humor or speculative trading, MIRA has a clear social purpose: supporting research on rare pediatric brain tumors. This mission has resonated deeply with the crypto community, driving widespread support. 2. Community-Driven Development The creation and subsequent success of MIRA underscore the power of community action. From its inception by a Pump.fun user to the large donation by an anonymous X user, MIRA’s journey reflects the decentralized and collaborative ethos of the blockchain space. 3. Sustainable Fundraising Through Chen’s planned liquidation strategy, MIRA ensures a consistent allocation of resources to its cause, balancing the volatility of crypto markets with the need for reliable funding. The Broader Impact of Meme Coins in Philanthropy The success of MIRA highlights a broader trend in the crypto industry: the use of meme coins for charitable causes. While meme coins have often been dismissed as speculative assets, projects like MIRA demonstrate their potential for meaningful impact. 1. Raising Awareness Meme coins have the power to reach a wide audience, leveraging humor, relatability, and virality to draw attention to important issues. 2. Mobilizing Communities Cryptocurrency communities are often highly engaged and action-oriented, making them ideal participants in philanthropic initiatives. 3. Innovating Fundraising Models Blockchain technology offers transparency and efficiency, ensuring that funds raised through meme coins are used for their intended purpose. Challenges and Opportunities While MIRA’s success is inspiring, it also highlights some challenges associated with combining cryptocurrencies and philanthropy: Volatility : Meme coins are notorious for price fluctuations, which could impact the stability of funds raised. Regulatory Scrutiny : As crypto projects grow in prominence, they may face increased regulatory oversight. Sustained Engagement : Maintaining long-term interest in a cause-driven meme coin requires ongoing community engagement and transparency. Despite these challenges, MIRA’s achievements demonstrate the immense opportunities for blockchain to drive social change. Conclusion The rise of the MIRA meme coin, with its $80 million market cap, showcases the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies in addressing real-world issues. Born out of a personal plea for help, MIRA has become a symbol of hope, innovation, and the power of community. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, projects like MIRA will likely inspire more initiatives that blend blockchain technology with philanthropy, proving that digital currencies can do more than just create wealth—they can create impact.

38181288,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114879,1735300422,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,$14.3 Billion in Bitcoin Options to Expire on December 27: What It Means for the Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-options-expiration-december-27/,"$14.3 Billion in Bitcoin Options to Expire on December 27: What It Means for the Crypto Market The cryptocurrency market is bracing for a major financial event as $14.3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire at 08:00 UTC on December 27, 2024. This massive options expiration is accompanied by the maturation of $3.75 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options, signaling a pivotal day for traders and market observers. The put/call ratio for Bitcoin options is reported at 0.69, with a max pain price of $85,000, according to Deribit, a leading crypto options exchange. For Ethereum, the put/call ratio stands at 0.41, with a max pain price of $3,000. These metrics offer crucial insights into market sentiment and potential price movements, providing traders with an opportunity to assess risk and strategy as the expiration approaches. Understanding Bitcoin Options Expiration Bitcoin options are derivative contracts that grant traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell BTC at a predetermined price before the contract expires. The expiration of options often leads to increased market volatility, as traders seek to adjust their positions. The put/call ratio —calculated by dividing the number of put options by call options—indicates the market’s sentiment. A ratio below 1, as observed with both Bitcoin (0.69) and Ethereum (0.41), suggests a bullish outlook. Meanwhile, the max pain price —the price point where the most options contracts expire worthless—provides insight into market manipulation strategies and trader losses. Bitcoin’s Max Pain Price: $85,000 The max pain price of $85,000 for Bitcoin reflects a significant point of interest for traders. This value represents the price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, leading to potential financial losses for traders. For Bitcoin to reach this max pain price, market activity and sentiment would need to align significantly, possibly triggering volatility in the hours leading up to expiration. Market participants will likely monitor price trends closely as this event unfolds. Traders positioned for either side of the options contracts—whether bullish or bearish—could see considerable gains or losses depending on the settlement price. Ethereum’s Max Pain Price: $3,000 Ethereum’s options market will also witness a substantial expiration on the same day, with $3.75 billion worth of contracts maturing. The max pain price of $3,000 reflects similar market dynamics. Although Ethereum’s market size is smaller than Bitcoin’s, the impact of its options expiration could still ripple across the broader cryptocurrency space. Impact on the Crypto Market The expiration of such a large volume of options often contributes to heightened volatility in the crypto market. With billions of dollars at stake, the event has implications for liquidity, market sentiment, and trading strategies. Liquidity Impact : Expirations often lead to increased liquidity as traders close out positions or roll contracts forward. Market Sentiment : The put/call ratios suggest a bullish sentiment for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially pushing prices higher.

This achievement was made possible by harnessing excess electricity generated by the Grand Renaissance Dam , a massive hydropower project. According to Bitcoin News , Bitcoin mining now accounts for 18% of Ethiopia’s electricity revenue , showcasing the potential for sustainable energy to power economic growth in Africa. How Ethiopia’s Bitcoin Mining Initiative Works 1. Utilizing Excess Hydropower The Grand Renaissance Dam, one of Africa’s largest hydropower projects, produces more electricity than Ethiopia currently consumes. Instead of letting this excess energy go to waste, the Ethiopian government has redirected it to power Bitcoin mining operations . 2. Global Investment Attraction The availability of low-cost, sustainable energy has attracted global investors to Ethiopia’s mining sector, boosting infrastructure development and foreign investment. 3. Government Support In February 2024 , the Ethiopian government signed agreements to supply electricity for Bitcoin mining, integrating cryptocurrency production into its broader economic strategy. Economic Impact of Bitcoin Mining in Ethiopia Ethiopia’s foray into Bitcoin mining has had significant implications for its economy: 1. Revenue Generation $1 Billion in Revenue : Mining operations have added a substantial revenue stream to Ethiopia’s economy, accounting for nearly one-fifth of its electricity revenue . Global Recognition : The initiative has placed Ethiopia on the map as an emerging player in the crypto and renewable energy sectors. 2. Energy Optimization Efficient Resource Use : By leveraging unused hydropower, Ethiopia has optimized its energy output while reducing waste. 3. Employment Opportunities The mining operations have created jobs in technology, logistics, and energy management, contributing to local economic development. Sustainable Energy Meets Cryptocurrency Ethiopia’s success highlights the synergy between sustainable energy and cryptocurrency mining: 1. Environmentally Friendly Mining Bitcoin mining often faces criticism for its high energy consumption. By using hydropower, Ethiopia offers a model for green mining practices . 2. Unlocking Africa’s Energy Potential Many African countries have untapped renewable energy resources. Ethiopia’s approach demonstrates how these resources can be monetized through innovative technologies like cryptocurrency mining. 3. Diversification of Revenue Streams By entering the cryptocurrency space, Ethiopia has diversified its economy, reducing reliance on traditional sectors like agriculture. Challenges and Risks Despite its success, Ethiopia’s Bitcoin mining initiative faces several challenges: 1. Regulatory Scrutiny As cryptocurrency adoption grows, regulatory frameworks may need to be strengthened to address concerns about transparency and governance. 2. Infrastructure Development Scaling mining operations requires significant investments in infrastructure, including cooling systems and network connectivity. 3. Market Volatility The profitability of Bitcoin mining is tied to cryptocurrency prices, exposing Ethiopia to market risks. Lessons for Other Nations Ethiopia’s Bitcoin mining strategy offers valuable insights for other countries, especially those with surplus renewable energy: Maximizing Resource Utilization : Countries with excess energy can emulate Ethiopia’s model to create new revenue streams. Fostering Innovation : Combining sustainable energy with blockchain technology can drive economic transformation. Engaging Global Investors : Ethiopia’s success demonstrates how strategic initiatives can attract foreign investment and expertise. Conclusion Ethiopia’s $1 billion Bitcoin mining milestone underscores the transformative potential of combining sustainable energy with innovative technology . By leveraging the Grand Renaissance Dam’s hydropower, Ethiopia has positioned itself as a leader in green cryptocurrency mining , offering a blueprint for other nations to follow. As the country continues to refine its approach and scale operations, Ethiopia’s journey highlights the vast opportunities at the intersection of renewable energy and the digital economy .

Citing insights from CryptoQuant contributor Burrakesmeci , the analysis points to rising Taker Buy Volume on Binance as a key indicator of growing demand and potential upward momentum. What Is Taker Buy Volume? Taker Buy Volume measures the total value of buy transactions executed by market takers—traders who place market orders that match existing limit orders on the exchange. Why It Matters Trend Indicator : Higher Taker Buy Volume suggests increased demand for Bitcoin, often signaling bullish sentiment. Market Confidence : Consistently rising buy volume indicates that investors are willing to pay the market price, a strong signal of confidence. Rising Taker Buy Volume on Binance Higher Lows Signal Upward Momentum Since October 28 , Taker Buy Volume on Binance has been establishing higher lows, reflecting sustained buying interest. Key milestones include: December 1 : Volume dipped below $5 billion . December 15 : Hovered just under $6 billion . December 25 : Surpassed $6 billion , reinforcing the upward trend. What Three Higher Lows Mean Technical analysts often interpret three consecutive higher lows as a sign of an emerging bullish trend. This pattern aligns with the broader market anticipation of Bitcoin revisiting the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin’s Path to $100K: Factors at Play 1. Market Sentiment and Psychological Resistance $100,000 is a significant psychological barrier, often acting as a magnet for traders aiming to capitalize on major price milestones. Positive sentiment driven by institutional adoption and increased ETF inflows could push BTC closer to this level. 2. Binance Data as a Bellwether As one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance’s trading metrics, such as Taker Buy Volume, offer a reliable snapshot of market trends. Rising buy activity indicates robust demand, suggesting that investors expect further price appreciation. 3. Macro and Fundamental Drivers Spot Bitcoin ETFs : Continued inflows into ETFs have brought fresh capital to the market. Halving Event : The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 is expected to reduce supply, historically a bullish catalyst. Institutional Interest : Companies and funds increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against macroeconomic instability. Potential Risks and Corrections While the rising Taker Buy Volume points to bullish potential, Burrakesmeci warns that the market may be overheated: 1. Short-Term Corrections Bitcoin’s volatile nature often results in sharp pullbacks, even during bullish trends. Corrections are common near key resistance levels like $100,000, as traders take profits. 2. Macro Uncertainty Global economic conditions, including interest rate decisions and regulatory changes, could impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. 3. Overleveraged Positions Excessive leverage in the market may lead to liquidations, amplifying downward pressure during corrections. Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Previous Milestones Bitcoin has approached key psychological levels in past bull cycles, often requiring multiple attempts to break through resistance: Cycle Year Key Resistance Level Outcome 2017 $20,000 Reached milestone but corrected sharply. 2021 $64,000 Surpassed resistance but faced volatility. 2024 $100,000 (predicted) Pending test of psychological barrier. Analyst’s Outlook for 2024 Burrakesmeci remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to retest $100,000, citing the following indicators: Sustained Buy Demand : Rising Taker Buy Volume is a strong bullish signal. Market Resilience : Despite corrections, Bitcoin has shown the ability to recover and build momentum. However, the analyst emphasizes the importance of closely monitoring trading activity and macroeconomic trends as the year progresses. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rising Taker Buy Volume on Binance suggests a potential retest of the $100,000 level by the end of 2024, marking a major milestone in its adoption and market performance. While short-term corrections and macro uncertainties could pose challenges, the overall trend remains positive, supported by growing institutional interest and strong demand signals. For investors, aligning with these market indicators and maintaining a balanced strategy could provide opportunities to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next major price move.

The token, launched just three hours ago, has already lost 99% of its value, with the deployer retaining the largest share. PeckShield’s warning serves as a crucial reminder for investors to exercise caution when dealing with newly launched tokens, particularly those lacking transparency. What Is the SquidGame Token Scam? The SquidGame token scam mirrors tactics used in previous fraudulent schemes, where deceptive marketing and a familiar theme lure unsuspecting investors. Key Details Identified by PeckShield Deployed on Base Network The token was launched on Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base , a popular platform known for low fees and scalability. The use of Base may have lent an air of legitimacy to the project, deceiving investors. Deployer Holds the Majority The token’s deployer retains the largest share, enabling them to manipulate the market. Such practices often lead to rug pull scenarios , where the deployer dumps their holdings, crashing the token’s value. 99% Value Drop Within hours of launch, the token’s value plummeted by 99% , leaving investors with significant losses. How Scammers Exploit New Investors Scammers often capitalize on popular themes or trends to create tokens that appear legitimate but are designed to defraud investors. Tactics Used in the SquidGame Token Scam Name Recognition : Leveraging the popularity of “Squid Game,” a widely recognized franchise, to attract attention. Fake Hype : Generating artificial excitement through social media and online forums. Low Transparency : Deploying tokens with unclear ownership, governance, or utility. Protecting Yourself from Token Scams To avoid falling victim to scams like the SquidGame token, investors should adopt the following practices: 1. Research Before Investing Verify the project’s website, team, and whitepaper. Look for audits or reviews from reputable blockchain security firms like PeckShield. 2. Check Ownership Distribution Avoid tokens where a single entity holds a disproportionate share. Use blockchain explorers to analyze wallet distributions. 3. Monitor Community Feedback Engage with the project’s community to gauge sentiment and transparency. Be wary of overly positive or scripted reviews. 4. Beware of Unrealistic Promises Avoid projects offering guaranteed returns or making bold, unsupported claims. Why Base Network Is a Target The Base network , built by Coinbase, has gained popularity for its low fees and developer-friendly environment. However, its rise has also made it a target for malicious actors: Low Deployment Costs : Scammers can deploy tokens at minimal expense, increasing the frequency of fraudulent schemes. Growing User Base : The network’s popularity attracts both legitimate projects and opportunistic scammers. While Base offers robust infrastructure, users must remain vigilant and rely on trusted security measures. Previous Scam Trends and Lessons Learned The SquidGame token scam is not the first instance of fraudulent tokens exploiting popular culture. Scam Token Key Tactic Outcome Squid Game Token (2021) Capitalized on Netflix series fame Rug pull after price surge Elder Scrolls Token Used gaming franchise branding Immediate value crash Meta Coin Mimicked Facebook rebranding Regulatory crackdown These examples highlight the recurring patterns of crypto scams and the need for investor awareness. What’s Next for the SquidGame Token? PeckShield’s timely alert has likely mitigated further losses for potential investors. However, the incident raises broader concerns: Increased Scrutiny : Platforms like Base and Coinbase may face pressure to enhance monitoring for fraudulent token launches. Community Education : Greater emphasis on educating investors about identifying and avoiding scams is essential. Regulatory Attention : Authorities may accelerate efforts to regulate token launches and enforce stricter standards. Conclusion The SquidGame token scam on Base underscores the persistent risks in the cryptocurrency market. PeckShield’s alert highlights the importance of vigilance and due diligence in protecting oneself from fraudulent schemes. As the crypto ecosystem evolves, both investors and platforms must prioritize security and transparency to foster trust and prevent similar incidents.

38181401,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115067,1735300683,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto May Face Less Favorable Macro Conditions in 2025, Citi Warns",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-macro-conditions-2025-citi-analysis/,"Crypto May Face Less Favorable Macro Conditions in 2025, Citi Warns Cryptocurrencies may encounter a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2025, according to a new report from Citigroup . Analysts have outlined six critical factors that could determine the success or failure of the digital asset market, emphasizing the importance of macroeconomic stability, ETF inflows, and regulatory developments . While the first quarter of 2025 is expected to support cryptocurrencies as risk assets, Citi warns of growing uncertainty due to potential policy shifts and increased market volatility later in the year. Six Key Factors for Crypto’s Success in 2025 Citi analysts identified the following factors as pivotal for the cryptocurrency market in 2025: 1. Supportive Macro Backdrop A favorable macroeconomic environment—marked by stable interest rates and inflation—could encourage risk-taking and drive capital into cryptocurrencies. However, Citi warns that U.S. policy shifts and global market volatility might disrupt this stability beyond Q1 2025. 2. Inflows into Spot ETFs Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been significant market drivers in 2024, and continued inflows will be crucial for maintaining liquidity and investor interest. Citi analysts predict that crypto ETFs will remain a dominant force, especially as institutional adoption grows. 3. Integration into Multi-Asset Portfolios For institutions to increase their cryptocurrency allocations, crypto returns must consistently outperform equities and offer diversification benefits. Broader portfolio integration could enhance crypto’s appeal to traditional investors. 4. Stablecoin Issuance Stablecoins are expected to play a pivotal role in the DeFi ecosystem , offering liquidity and stability in an otherwise volatile market. Growth in stablecoin issuance may signal greater adoption of blockchain-based financial systems. 5. Regulatory Developments Regulatory clarity remains critical for institutional adoption. Citi highlights the need for balanced policies that promote innovation while addressing risks like fraud and market manipulation. 6. Economic Uncertainty Uncertainty tied to stock market volatility and global economic conditions could push investors toward or away from cryptocurrencies, depending on the perceived risks and opportunities. Macroeconomic Outlook for 2025 Short-Term Optimism Citi analysts suggest that Q1 2025 may be favorable for cryptocurrencies, with a stable macro backdrop supporting risk assets. Key factors include: Moderation in interest rate hikes by central banks. Improved investor sentiment amid economic stabilization. Long-Term Concerns Beyond Q1, Citi warns of potential headwinds: U.S. Policy Shifts : Changes in fiscal or monetary policy could disrupt market stability. Market Volatility : Increased turbulence in equity and bond markets may spill over into crypto. Spot ETFs and Institutional Adoption Spot cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly in the U.S., have emerged as a game-changing development, attracting billions in inflows. ETF Inflows as a Growth Driver Continued capital inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs are expected to bolster market liquidity and confidence. These products provide regulated exposure to crypto assets, making them accessible to a broader range of investors. Institutional Adoption Challenges For institutions to deepen their crypto investments, the asset class must consistently deliver higher risk-adjusted returns than traditional equities. Citi emphasizes the importance of integrating crypto into multi-asset portfolios to enhance diversification and returns. Stablecoins and DeFi: A Bright Spot Stablecoins remain a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly in DeFi applications : Role in the Market Provide liquidity and act as a bridge between traditional and digital finance. Enable seamless transactions and minimize volatility risk for DeFi participants. Growth Potential Citi analysts expect stablecoins to continue leading DeFi innovation, with increased issuance signaling adoption in emerging markets and cross-border payments. Challenges Ahead Despite positive trends, Citi’s report underscores several challenges that could hinder crypto’s growth in 2025: 1. Regulatory Headwinds Stricter regulations or uncertainty could slow adoption, particularly among institutions. Balancing innovation with consumer protection remains a delicate task for policymakers. 2. Competition with Equities Cryptocurrencies must outperform traditional assets to attract institutional interest, particularly during periods of economic stability. 3. Market Volatility While volatility attracts traders, it deters long-term investors seeking stability and predictable returns. Conclusion Citigroup’s analysis highlights a mixed outlook for cryptocurrencies in 2025. While the first quarter may present favorable conditions for growth, uncertainty looms in the latter part of the year, driven by potential policy shifts, market volatility, and regulatory challenges . Nevertheless, spot ETFs, stablecoins, and DeFi remain promising areas of development, offering opportunities for adoption and innovation. As crypto continues to evolve, its ability to navigate macroeconomic and regulatory challenges will determine its long-term success.

Challenges and Risks Despite the bullish inflows, there are challenges and risks to consider: Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price movements remain unpredictable, potentially impacting ETF performance. Regulatory Changes : Future regulatory actions could alter the landscape for Bitcoin ETFs. Competition : As more ETFs enter the market, existing products must differentiate themselves to maintain inflows. Conclusion The $475.15 million net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 26 mark a significant milestone, showcasing growing investor confidence in Bitcoin’s potential as a mainstream asset. Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB led the charge, reflecting their appeal among both retail and institutional investors.

Some have predicted that Ripple (XRP) could be the best investment, as they predict a 700% rise over the next few months. Others are looking beyond the top coins, with Fantom and the new MemeFi altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) among the standouts. XRP Price To Surge 700% XRP has been on a stellar run since late November and has been the highest gainer among the top 10 coins in the market, nearly quadrupling its value over the past four months. Analysts expect the token to break out after a three-week consolidation in December, with the short-term target of XRP price being set at $3.5. After this, the token will embark on a run that experts believe will yield over 700% in returns. (Image courtesy of Bark Meta ). Investors are also eyeing Fantom after the recent launch of the Sonic mainnet, an EVM-compatible high-throughput layer 1 blockchain network that promises to change the game. Sonic promises over 10,000 transactions per second, with finality achieved in less than a second. While FTM has shed nearly 30% in the past week, Sonic’s launch could revitalize the token ahead of the New Year. Analysts note that it must break above $1.1 in the short term to surge over the first few weeks of 2025. Investors Rush To Yeti Ouro Meme Contest Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro has become one of the most talked-about crypto projects in recent days, following the success of its presale and a new meme contest that’s generating buzz on social media platforms. Meanwhile, the Yeti Ouro meme contest has wrapped up, with some of the participants sharing their innovative creations – https://x.com/nayansingh08/status/1871866750641532951?s=10 The project is in the second stage of its presale, where investors have already purchased over 10 million tokens, raising $179,000. In the previous stage, the project sold out all its allocated tokens and raised $1.2 million in a few weeks. Yeti Ouro sets itself apart from most projects by focusing on utility rather than hype, speculation and quick gains. The project, deployed on Ethereum, is built around Yeti Go, a thrilling play-to-earn game in which players are rewarded with YETIO tokens for winning their races. Yeti Go was developed by avid gamers in partnership with the studios behind Call of Duty, The Witcher 3, Spider-Man and other iconic global successes. It is built with Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, which makes it engaging and immersive. To win, players must dodge hazards, obstacles and attacks from other players. They can also attack opponents using weapons purchased with YETIO. Additionally, they can stake the tokens to unlock exclusive rewards.

Analyst Javon Marks recently projected that DOGE will attain a target of $2.28 by year-end. This positive perspective is founded on a synthesis of market sentiment and technical analysis. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Analyst Puts Target Above $0.37 Short-Term Bullish Momentum The technical side shows good bullish momentum in the short and medium term for Dogecoin. There’s likely to be an approximate rise of 206% over the next three months with the current sentiment of the market. This is indicative of increased interest in DOGE because it continues to position itself as a potential investment vehicle. In the next six months, a more tempered but still significant growth of 51% is expected, according to CoinCheckup. That means that the upward trend in Dogecoin can persist at a healthy rate. Bull Market Patterns The Fibonacci expansion analysis shows Dogecoin’s bull market patterns, which fuels Javon Marks’ forecast. DOGE rose from $0.00009 to $0.00748, matching the 1.618 Fibonacci level in 2015–2017. The 2020–2021 cycle saw it rise from $0.00168 to $0.73, surpassing the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $0.03912. $DOGE (Dogecoin) Update: The history hasn’t changed and still points to a fairly high likeliness of a price run to AND ABOVE the 1.618 Fib Extension level as it did every cycle prior to this and this time around, that’d result in a more than 570% increase from here to $2.28+! https://t.co/BtYB3vaWHH pic.twitter.com/Fdvqb7FtCW — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 25, 2024 Even though the price has dropped about 46% since its high point of $0.48, people are still generally hopeful. A lot of people think that DOGE could easily break through barrier levels and go to higher levels if the market as a whole is in a good mood. At the time of writing, the price of DOGE is around $0.3227. If Marks’ prediction holds true, then DOGE would have risen by 606% by the end of 2024. Dogecoin (DOGE) prices have gone up and down a lot in the past. In 2017, the coin started a parabolic rise that saw it rise by 200% and then drop by 40%. After that, it went up by an insane 5,000%. DOGE went through a similar trend in 2021. It went up 476%, then down 56%, and then up to 120%. Medium To Long-Term Predictions Looking forward to the one-year mark, the projections are still quite conservative at 24%, which will probably indicate stabilization after the initial growth. Although the short-term prospects for Dogecoin are extremely bullish, medium- and long-term gains might moderate with the change of market conditions.

In short, the convergence of political development, technical factors, and social sentiment has created a unique environment for growth. With DOGE gaining more ground as a payment method for many businesses, its utility in the cryptocurrency ecosystem will also grow.

Following a post-Christmas market dip, the uptick in large deposits suggests that whales are preparing to buy crypto assets, which could lead to a market-wide price increase. Notably, seven Binance deposits involving the FDUSD stablecoin —each valued at over $9 million —were recorded in the past 24 hours, including a massive $50 million transfer . Whale Behavior: A Key Market Indicator Whale activity is a critical factor in understanding cryptocurrency market trends. These large investors, with significant holdings, have the ability to influence price movements through their trading strategies. Why Whale Stablecoin Deposits Matter Market Timing : Stablecoin deposits often precede major buying activity, as whales transfer funds to exchanges in preparation for acquisitions. Liquidity and Volume : Large stablecoin inflows boost liquidity, paving the way for substantial purchases without causing excessive price volatility. Sentiment Shift : Increased whale activity is frequently associated with renewed optimism, signaling potential market recovery or growth. FDUSD and Its Role in Whale Transactions FDUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, has become a popular choice for large transactions due to its stability and wide acceptance on exchanges like Binance. $50 Million Deposit : The single largest FDUSD transaction highlights the scale of whale involvement, reflecting substantial buying power. Frequent Deposits : Multiple transfers suggest sustained activity rather than isolated events, indicating strategic accumulation. What Does This Mean for the Market? 1. Accumulation Phase Whale stablecoin deposits are often a precursor to accumulation phases, where large investors increase their holdings of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Market Impact : As whales buy, their activity can drive prices higher, attracting additional investors and creating positive momentum. Altcoin Opportunity : While Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely targets, smaller-cap altcoins may also benefit from increased liquidity and broader market optimism. 2. Buying Signal Santiment’s analysis positions the current wave of whale deposits as a strong buying signal , particularly for traders seeking to align with market trends. Short-Term Gains : Inflows suggest potential upward price action in the near term. Long-Term Strategy : Accumulation by whales could signal confidence in the market’s long-term prospects. Historical Context: Whale Deposits as Market Catalysts Whale activity has historically acted as a reliable indicator of market trends: Period Whale Activity Market Outcome Q1 2021 Large stablecoin deposits Triggered a bull market for Bitcoin Q3 2022 Withdrawal of funds from exchanges Preceded a prolonged market correction Q4 2024 Current stablecoin deposits Signals accumulation and potential rally These patterns underscore the influence of whales on market direction, particularly during periods of uncertainty or transition. Cautions and Considerations While whale activity provides valuable insights, it’s important to approach such signals with a degree of caution: Volatility Risks : Sudden buying or selling by whales can amplify market volatility. Market Conditions : Broader economic factors, such as interest rates or regulatory changes, may still impact overall trends. Diversification : While whale signals can be bullish, investors should maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. Conclusion The recent surge in stablecoin deposits by whale addresses , as reported by Santiment, highlights a potential buying opportunity in the cryptocurrency market. With significant FDUSD transactions indicating strategic preparation for accumulation, prices across the market could see upward momentum in the coming days. For traders and investors, aligning strategies with whale activity could offer a chance to capitalize on this trend.

Bitcoin ($BTC) continues to outperform. However, have Ethereum ($ETH) and Solana ($SOL) now hit bottom against their $BTC pairs? Bitcoin Dominance breakdown confirmation Source: TradingView The chart to watch for the first signs of any big altcoin movement is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D). An ascending wedge that has been forming since June 2022 looks to finally be breaking down. Domination broke below the end of the wedge and it looks like the break may be confirmed. Traders and investors could then look for a lower low to take dominance below 54.6%, with an eventual target of 48% down to 40%. $ETH at huge support against its $BTC pair Source: TradingView $ETH is at a very critical point against its $BTC pair (ETH/BTC). A long-time descending channel has taken $ETH to a hugely important horizontal support level at 0.036 BTC. If this support were to fail, and also the coincidence of the ascending bull market trendline, it would likely be game-over for $ETH - at least until the start of the next bull market. A bounce must happen from this current level, and given the weight of the support, this really should happen. That said, the Stochastic RSI momentum indicator at the bottom of the chart has just recorded a turn down of the indicator line. This line is very likely to continue down, with a last chance to bounce at the 50.00 level. This last chance must be taken. $SOL ready for massive bounce against $BTC Source: TradingView Compared to ETH/BTC, the SOL/BTC chart is incredibly bullish. What initially looked like a bull pennant, broke down in early December after being rejected from its upper trendline. The price carried on down and came to rest on top of the massively important horizontal support level of 0.00186 BTC. It now appears that this could also be the bottom of a bull flag, and if this is the case, a breakdown wouldn’t have occurred. The concurrence of the bull flag trendline and the horizontal price level are acting as massive support. It would be expected that $SOL continues to bounce from here, with a climb back to the top of the bull flag and a potential breakout from there back to all-time highs. A further factor in favour of $SOL is the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart. The indicator lines have hit the bottom and are just starting to turn upward. The momentum for $SOL over $BTC is likely to rise steeply. Watch this pair closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This marks the third consecutive day of positive inflows, underscoring rising investor confidence in Ethereum’s potential as a mainstream asset. According to data from Farside Investors , leading ETFs such as BlackRock’s ETHA , Fidelity’s FETH , and Grayscale’s ETH were among the top performers, driving the majority of the inflows. Spotlight on Leading Ethereum ETFs 1. Fidelity’s FETH Dominates with $83 Million Fidelity’s FETH ETF led the day with an impressive $83 million in inflows. The strong performance reflects Fidelity’s reputation as a trusted name in asset management and its ability to attract institutional and retail investors alike. 2. BlackRock’s ETHA Gains $28.2 Million BlackRock, a dominant player in the ETF market, saw $28.2 million in inflows to its ETHA fund. The company’s influence and extensive client base contribute significantly to the growing acceptance of Ethereum-based ETFs. 3. Grayscale’s ETH Adds $6 Million Grayscale, known for pioneering crypto investment vehicles, reported $6 million in inflows to its Ethereum spot ETF. Though smaller than its competitors, Grayscale’s inflows indicate sustained interest in Ethereum among long-term investors. Understanding Spot Ethereum ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs allow investors to gain direct exposure to the price of Ethereum without holding the underlying asset. These ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, offering a familiar entry point for institutional and retail investors. Key Benefits Regulated Framework : Operate within U.S. securities regulations, ensuring transparency and security. Ease of Access : Enable investors to participate in Ethereum’s growth without managing wallets or private keys. Mainstream Adoption : Signal broader acceptance of Ethereum in traditional financial markets. Why the Inflows Are Significant The inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs highlight several important trends in the crypto and financial markets: 1. Institutional Adoption Large inflows, particularly into Fidelity and BlackRock ETFs, signal strong institutional interest in Ethereum as a credible investment. Ethereum’s utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts makes it a compelling choice for long-term portfolios. 2. Broader Market Confidence Positive inflows during a traditionally quiet holiday season suggest growing confidence in Ethereum’s market stability and potential. 3. Regulatory Milestone The success of these ETFs indicates that U.S. regulators are increasingly comfortable with spot crypto products, potentially paving the way for more innovation in the sector. Comparison with Bitcoin ETFs Ethereum ETFs are following the path set by Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have seen strong demand since their approval. However, Ethereum’s unique capabilities, such as its role in DeFi and NFTs, set it apart from Bitcoin. Metric Spot Bitcoin ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs Adoption Timeline Established earlier Recently launched Utility Digital gold narrative DeFi and smart contracts Recent Inflows Steady Accelerating rapidly What’s Driving the Demand? 1. Ethereum’s Growing Use Cases Ethereum’s applications in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions continue to expand, enhancing its value proposition for investors. 2. Attractive Market Conditions As Ethereum’s price stabilizes following 2024’s market volatility, investors are seizing opportunities to accumulate exposure through regulated products. 3. Diversification Strategy For institutions and individuals, Ethereum ETFs offer a way to diversify portfolios without the complexities of directly managing crypto assets. Potential Impacts of Ethereum ETF Inflows Increased Price Stability Large, consistent inflows into spot ETFs can reduce market volatility by creating sustained demand. Boosted Liquidity ETFs channel significant capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing market depth and liquidity. Market Validation The success of these products validates Ethereum as a mainstream financial asset, encouraging broader adoption. Conclusion The $117.2 million in net inflows to U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on December 26 underscores Ethereum’s growing appeal among institutional and retail investors. With Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale leading the charge, Ethereum is cementing its position as a cornerstone asset in the cryptocurrency market. As the market continues to evolve, the success of spot Ethereum ETFs signals a promising future for the integration of crypto assets into traditional finance. For investors, these ETFs represent an accessible and regulated way to participate in Ethereum’s growth, further solidifying its role in the global financial landscape.

AI16Z and its ELIZA ecosystem token remain one of the staples in the newly created AI agent space. A whale address has been accumulating AI16Z in the past few days, with the first substantial purchase starting on December 26. Whale buying once again signals accumulation for AI16Z, one of the top AI agent tokens. AI agents knocked off meme tokens The new storage wallet mainly holds AI16Z and ZEREBRO, another trending AI agent. Nansen tags the address itself as a “Zerebro Whale.” The other notable wallet, tagged “Michi Whale,” rolled over from POPCAT into AI16Z and MICHI. The two whale wallets also contain minor holdings from previous meme cycles, especially animal and viral memes on Solana. Meme tokens remain one of the strongest narratives at the end of 2024. However, the sector as a whole went through a drawdown, with its total valuation sliding under $100B. Despite this, both whales and retail are on the lookout for the next hot category of memes. It is precisely AI agents that started to deliver returns in the past day, rising from a valuation of around $8.7B to over $9.64B. The growth of AI agent tokens is driven by outliers, staging unexpected rallies. Whales make use of the short-term price fluctuations, while also betting on having sufficient liquidity to be able to realize profits. Truth Terminal still holds cult status, while boosting the FARTCOIN rally. AI16Z sparks competition between AI agent platforms Social media users quickly got bored of AI agents as a single personality. However, the agent market is spawning a new series of projects, aiming to provide utility and long-term sustainability. Toward the end of 2024, several platforms for launching new AI agents and tokens have appeared. Those platforms model their activity after Pump.fun, though with a more complex process of creating agents and deploying them on social media. While agents themselves compete for mindshare, platform tokens are singled out for their potential to reflect the growth of the entire AI agent space. AI16Z and its Eliza agent launchpad helped the token appreciate by 58% in the past week and draw the attention of buyers. AI16Z traded at $0.88, near its all-time high. While ELIZA was announced early and tried to market its launchpad brand, Virtuals Protocol locked in the biggest share of value in December. The token is second only to Virtuals Protocol, the leading AI agent launchpad on Base. VIRTUAL also traded close to its record price at $3.13. The two leading tokens made up around 30% of the entire market cap of AI agent assets. For now, the market does not reflect the newly rising agents, which are yet building up their social media presence. The biggest earner this time was Phala Network (PHA), expanding by 192% in the past week, close to its yearly high of $0.33. Phala Network reinvented itself after launching its 2.0 version on December 25. The platform does not explicitly deal with launching AI agents but with infrastructure for AI computation. Phala Network’s infrastructure is used for trusted AI token launches, making it indispensable in the new on-chain experiment. PHA also rose after the success of Spore.fun, a platform where AI agents compete and evolve independently. The Phala Network technology is also applied among projects from the Eliza framework by AI16Z. The recent token rallies show the AI agent space is increasingly connected, bringing both mindshare on social media and liquidity for new projects. The sector is also trying to build up liquidity and set up value transfers between agents. The AI narrative displaced the older types of AI tokens, which focused on nodes and consensus and often failed to deliver a usable product. The recent rise in AI agent platforms displaced previous narratives, such as shared GPU infrastructure for rendering and other tasks. The current drive is for infrastructure to tap the activity and value of AI personalities while adding meme tokens and DeFi elements.

The ‘BTC treasury operations virus is spreading’,https://finbold.com/will-wall-street-adopt-the-bitcoin-standard-the-btc-treasury-operations-virus-is-spreading/,"United States companies are one step closer to adopting what Bitcoin ( BTC ) enthusiasts call “the Bitcoin standard” for treasury operations. Analysts weighed in as a new Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) waits approval, further spreading the BTC virus in Wall Street. On December 26, Bitwise filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch the “Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF.” As described, the ETF will invest in over-$100 million market cap companies holding at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries. With that, the asset manager intends to provide further indirect Bitcoin exposure to Wall Street’s stock market. At the same time, Bitwise’s proposed fund, if approved, could encourage more companies to follow MicroStrategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR ) example. “The btc treasury operations virus is spreading,” Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store and host of ETF Prime Podcast, commented . SEC Filing: Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. Companies eligible for the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF Bitwise has filed for the “Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF,” targeting companies with significant Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy leads the pack with over 444,262 BTC in its treasury, setting a precedent for corporate adoption. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is another company that holds substantial reserves, with 9,720 BTC. Notably, Semler Scientific (NASDAQ: SMLR ) has also embraced the Bitcoin standard for its treasury, holding 2,084 BTC. Publicly traded companies like KULR Technology Group have recently announced a $21 million investment in Bitcoin, joining the trend. However, it only holds 217.2 BTC and would not be eligible for the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF. Rumble, LQR House, RemixPoint, Genius Group, Cosmos Health, and Jiva Technologies have announced plans to allocate portions of their treasuries to Bitcoin, ranging from $1 million to $20 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries data , there are 21 companies in the world and 13 in the U.S. that would be eligible for Bitwise’s new ETF as of December 27, 2024. Companies holding at least 1,000 BTC. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net These moves come as Bitcoin’s market value continues to rise, with the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time high of over $108,000 in December 2024. This ETF, if approved, would invest in companies holding at least 1,000 BTC, worth around $100 million. Bitwise’s initiative aims to provide investors with exposure to firms adopting Bitcoin, potentially reshaping corporate finance strategies. Moreover, the ETF’s weighting based on Bitcoin holdings could highlight smaller firms with large crypto reserves, increasing the growth potential. This development marks a pivotal moment for BTC’s integration into mainstream corporate finance, opening doors for a potential Bitcoin standard.

According to CoinMarketCap (CMC) , the current score signals that the cryptocurrency market is firmly in Bitcoin Season , with most altcoins underperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. What Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures market dynamics by comparing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. Scoring Mechanism Scores of 1–24 : Strong Bitcoin Season. Few altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Scores of 25–49 : Bitcoin Season dominates, but some altcoins show strength. Scores of 50–74 : Neutral territory, with a balanced performance between Bitcoin and altcoins. Scores of 75–100 : Altcoin Season. A majority of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. For the market to officially enter Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies must outperform Bitcoin in price gains during the specified period. Current Market Sentiment: Bitcoin Season Prevails With the Altcoin Season Index at 40, Bitcoin continues to outperform most altcoins, a characteristic of Bitcoin Season. Key Implications Investor Focus on Bitcoin Bitcoin dominance signals strong market confidence in BTC as the primary cryptocurrency. Many traders may be consolidating holdings into Bitcoin during periods of uncertainty or high volatility. Altcoin Underperformance Only a minority of altcoins have outpaced Bitcoin, reflecting weaker momentum in the altcoin market. Projects with strong fundamentals or unique use cases may still see gains but are exceptions rather than the rule. Shift in Liquidity Liquidity often flows into Bitcoin during Bitcoin Season, potentially causing reduced trading volumes and price stagnation in altcoins. Historical Context: Altcoin vs. Bitcoin Seasons Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons are cyclical and depend on market sentiment, investor behavior, and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin Season Characteristics Dominance of Bitcoin in market capitalization and trading volume. Stronger price stability compared to altcoins. Often coincides with early phases of bull markets or periods of consolidation. Altcoin Season Characteristics Altcoins consistently outperform Bitcoin. Market enthusiasm for smaller projects, often fueled by speculation. Typically occurs during later stages of bull markets or after Bitcoin’s price stabilizes. Period Altcoin Season Index Market Phase Q1 2021 85 (Altcoin Season) DeFi and NFT boom Q4 2022 15 (Bitcoin Season) Bitcoin recovery post-crash Q4 2024 (Current) 40 (Bitcoin Season) Bitcoin-led bull market Factors Influencing the Index 1. Bitcoin’s Dominance Bitcoin currently enjoys a dominant position in the market due to macroeconomic factors such as institutional interest and its perception as a safe-haven asset. 2. Market Liquidity During Bitcoin Season, liquidity tends to flow into BTC, reducing capital availability for altcoins. 3. Altcoin-Specific Events Individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or significant upgrades may still outperform Bitcoin, but these are outliers during Bitcoin Season. 4. Broader Market Trends Early stages of bull markets often favor Bitcoin. Later stages may see liquidity shift into altcoins, leading to Altcoin Season. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? The Altcoin Season Index at 40 suggests the market is not yet ready for a full-fledged Altcoin Season. However, certain scenarios could shift dynamics: Potential for Bitcoin Continuation If Bitcoin continues its bullish trend, its dominance could increase, prolonging Bitcoin Season. Signs of an Altcoin Rally A surge in Ethereum or other leading altcoins could catalyze a shift toward Altcoin Season. Significant announcements or technological breakthroughs in altcoins might attract investor attention. Macro Trends to Watch Regulatory developments and institutional adoption will play pivotal roles in shaping market sentiment. Market conditions, such as Bitcoin’s stability or corrections, may dictate liquidity flows into altcoins. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s drop to 40 highlights the cryptocurrency market’s current preference for Bitcoin over altcoins. As Bitcoin Season continues, traders and investors may focus on BTC as the leading asset in the space. However, the cyclical nature of the market suggests that Altcoin Season could return, especially if Bitcoin’s dominance plateaus or altcoins demonstrate compelling use cases. Monitoring key metrics like Bitcoin dominance, liquidity flows, and altcoin performance will be essential for navigating the market.

The initiative unfolds in multiple coordinated stages, beginning with an immediate burn of 5.44 million AXGT tokens on December 20th at 3 PM EST, derived from accumulated liquidity pool fees. This initial action sets the stage for a more substantial strategic burn scheduled for February 13th, 2025, when 122 million AXGT tokens-representing 12.2% of the total supply will be permanently removed from the currently unallocated reserve of 490 million tokens. This larger burn deliberately mirrors the exact amount sold during the presale phase. At the heart of this phase lies the Metric Based Ignition Algorithm, a sophisticated system that introduces permanent deflationary mechanics to the ecosystem. The fully automated, contract-driven system will maintain a consistent 0.5% burn on all buy and sell transactions, operating continuously through a publicly accessible model. This autonomous system analyzes market data and ecosystem metrics in real-time, ensuring optimal token dynamics. ""This phase represents a significant advance in our token utility,"" said Christopher Crecelius, Founder of AxonDAO. ""Through the implementation of our Metric Based Ignition Algorithm and strategic burns, we're establishing a self-sustaining ecosystem that directly supports scientific advancement while maintaining robust tokenomics."" The strategic framework is further strengthened by a planned liquidity lock scheduled for January 2nd, 2025. This comprehensive approach, combining algorithmic burns, strategic supply reduction, and secured liquidity, creates a robust foundation for sustainable ecosystem growth. Central to this strategic initiative is the locking of AXGT-ETH liquidity pools, which establishes an automated funding mechanism for the DeSci Wallet. Through this approach, a portion of all trading fees are automatically channeled into scientific research funding, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where market activity directly advances medical innovation. This represents the first implementation of its kind in the DeSci space, where traditional market dynamics are transformed into catalysts for scientific progress. ""Our transition to a data-driven, autonomous approach for token dynamics marks a new chapter for AxonDAO,"" states Maciej Stachowiak, Co-Founder and CTO of AxonDAO. ""The Metric Based Ignition Algorithm ensures that every transaction not only contributes to the ecosystem's strength but also advances our core mission of supporting groundbreaking scientific research."" AxonDAO's community continues to expand, now encompassing over 29,000 token holders alongside growing partnerships with leading healthcare institutions. The platform maintains its commitment to innovation, enabling secure, anonymous health data contribution while ensuring participants retain full sovereignty over their information.

While we expect the rise to continue in 2025, prediction market investors are expecting new highs for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2025. Popular prediction platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi show that bets on Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching all-time highs next year are dominant. According to the data, Kalshi prices a more than 60% probability that Bitcoin will reach at least $125,000 in 2025, while Ethereum will reach at least $5,000. Polymarket sets the probability of BTC reaching $120,000 before the end of March as 50%. Experts stated that this rise indicates that the US will approve ETFs for multiple altcoins and that there is the potential to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves. Traders on Polymarket are also predicting that the US will approve XRP, Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) ETFs with 75%, 69%, and 51% probability of approval respectively by July 31. The probability of Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF approval remains low at 22%. Finally, Kalshi users predict that there is a 59% probability that US President-elect Donald Trump will create a national strategic Bitcoin reserve during his presidency, while Polymarket users indicate that there is only a 29% probability that Trump will launch a BTC reserve within his first 100 days in office. *This is not investment advice.

After a steep climb in November, the PI is now correcting, reverting to the bearish trends that have also seen BTC trade at around $95k. This correction aligns with the volatile nature of crypto markets, suggesting a potential further drop before any rebound to the $100 mark. Is Pi Network Price Set for a 30% Drop Before Reaching $100? After experiencing a 12% rise over the last month, the Pi Network could be heading for a downturn, similar to trends seen in other cryptocurrencies. Even though Pi hit its record high of $330.65 on the 30th of December 2022, it has fallen by 85.51%. The current market trends suggest a 30% downside which would place Pi’s value at $33. Conversely, a market recovery could propel it toward a $50 resistance level. This forecast aligns with movements in major crypto markets like Bitcoin, which has recently approached the $95,000 threshold. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have also experienced declines, further indicating a broader market correction. The Pi price is currently at $48.11, with a 2% decrease in the past day. The price of the Pi Network has been very volatile in its short existence. The last trading sessions have depicted a negative trend in the chart. It has anchored in the region of crucial demand levels at $36.87 and $33.14. Previous surges to activity were key at one point pushing the price to $100 which is a psychological point. Technical indicators on the 4-hour chart shows depict a mixed sentiment. The RSI hovers near the 50 mark, suggesting a neutral momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD presents a slight bearish crossover, implying potential downward pressure. Pi Network Price Chart Pi Network Price Gears Up for 2025 Launch As the Pi Network is set to launch on the Open Network, especially in Q1 2025, many people are talking about KYC verification as a critical process. This process is crucial for pioneers wishing to fully engage with the Mainnet. Ensuring a seamless transition to the Open Network involves getting many users KYC-verified. This verification enables pioneers to actively participate using their Pi tokens once the network is operational. The focus is on bridging the gap between users approved through KYC and those who have transitioned to the Mainnet. This strategic preparation might influence the market’s recovery as the launch approaches. Why do we need to reduce the gap between the number of KYC’d and Mainnet migrated Pioneers? Because we want to include as many of them as possible in the Open Network! pic.twitter.com/KFRedhfISa — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) December 27, 2024 Pi Network price risks a 30% drop due to market fluctuations and preparation for its launch in 2025.

Ethereum rallies with $1.5b inflows into BlackRock’s ETF, sparking optimism for altcoins and a potential 2025 market surge. Table of Contents BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF hits record $1.5b inflows in 16 days. Ethereum set for a new year rally: Is $4,500 within reach? Can top altcoins follow Ethereum’s suit? Conclusion The market is down, but institutional inflow hasn’t fizzled one bit. This month, Ethereum is making a serious wave, as BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF has recorded a staggering $1.5b in inflow since November. The 16-day streak has revitalized market sentiment, with analysts looking forward to a major New Year’s rally for top altcoins. With technical indicators aligning and institutional adoption accelerating, could 2025 mark the start of a monumental turn for Ethereum and other altcoins? Let’s find out. BlackRock spot Ethereum ETF hits record $1.5b inflows in 16 days. The Ethereum market has entered a new era of optimism. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF has set the pace for an extraordinary resurgence after recording a staggering 16-day streak culminating in a jaw-dropping $1.5 billion since November 20. This momentum builds on its $1.7b haul since launching in July, showcasing investor appetite for Ethereum. Ethereum’s post-election rally and the renewed interest in blockchain innovation have revitalized investor sentiment. Notably, Ethereum’s price surged past $4,000 following these record inflows. In fact, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic ETFs, Jay Jacobs, thinks the inflow is merely the “tip of the iceberg.” Ethereum set for a new year rally: Is $4,500 within reach? \With Ethereum’s price holding firm above $3,400, the market is buzzing with speculation of a New Year rally that could send ETH soaring by 30%. Over the weekend, Ethereum saw significant buying pressure as investors rotated from Bitcoin. This shift, paired with Ethereum staking inflows of 59k ETH and net outflows from exchanges of 130k ETH, signals bullish sentiment. Some analysts believe Ethereum could mirror its performance from early 2021, echoing previous market cycles. If the current trend persists, this top altcoin could challenge its yearly high of $4,093 and possibly breach its 2021 all-time high of $4,800. Can top altcoins follow Ethereum’s suit? The spotlight on Ethereum’s rally is reigniting interest in top altcoins. Projects like Remittix capture investors’ imagination with its huge potential and unique PayFi solution. Remittix is a crypto-to-fiat cross-border remittance network that bridges crypto with local payment networks globally. What sets Remittix apart is its versatility, it facilitates individual transactions and enables crypto enterprises to handle invoices, salaries, and merchant payments. This level of functionality marks a significant step forward in crypto adoption, particularly in emerging markets where traditional payment systems often face limitations. As Ethereum continues to advance with institutional support and use cases, it raises a critical question: Will projects like Remittix and other top altcoins ride the wave to new highs in 2025? Its ongoing presale is all the proof investors need. The presale accrued close to $500k in mere days, and price is still at just $0.0156. Conclusion Ethereum’s record-breaking inflows through BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF signal a powerful shift in market dynamics. As ETH pushes past key resistance levels, a new all-time high could be within reach. Meanwhile, top altcoins like Remittix are capturing attention with smart use cases and rapid presale momentum, hinting at a broader market resurgence. With 2025 on the horizon, the crypto landscape is primed for explosive growth, making now a pivotal moment for investors to watch closely.

Not that only, it has also advised others to allot 2% of their total portfolio to this digital asset. However, a recent incident raised suspicions about possible selling for the investment firm, which could crash the crypto market due to its high holdings. BlackRock Transferred $1.88B To New Wallets The IBIT ETF provider owns around 2.6% of the total Bitcoin supply, bringing its holdings to 553.162k BTC. Interestingly, the firm bought $1B worth of BTC during the recent dip. Still, its recent Bitcoin transfers are concerning, as it has transferred billions of BTC to Coinbase, one of the most prominent in the top crypto exchanges list. According to Arkham intelligence findings , Blackrock transferred $1.88B worth of BTC on December 26. The transfer happened through multiple transactions to Coinbase wallets, which brought everyone’s attention to transfers. Although the funds are still there, it is uncertain whether the digital asset manager will sell them or keep them there. More importantly, the firm has recently divided all its BTC holdings into 29 wallets, so transferring to a new wallet suddenly gives a hint of upcoming selling. Regardless, it has $ 56.5B worth of assets, of which Bitcoin is responsible for $52.98B. At the same time, the IBIT ETF is overcoming outflows , which could eventually affect the Bitcoin price. However, yesterday’s inflows helped reduce the impact of earlier outflows, so now the question is only about the investment firm’s possible selling. Crypto Analysts Analyzed The BlackRock’s Potential BTC Sell Although there is no clear explanation behind this BTC transfer, a few analysts have analyzed the scenario and concluded two reasons. According to analysts, these transfers must have been made for future sales to fix the profit or to manipulate the crypto market. Bitcoin has been struggling since the FED’s 25 bps rate cut decision . With that, the BTC price collapsed to $92k before making a recovery, currently trading at $96k, but ATH sits at $108.2k. The present time is quite crucial for BTC, and this investment company’s decision could make or break the token. Atlas, a crypto analyst, claims that even if Blackrock sells BTC to manipulate the crypto market, this is not a big deal, as they tried the same thing a few days ago. He believes that the market would gain its strength back like it did before. Additionally, considering the fixed profit perspective, this is a basic thing, as reports reveal that the firm buys Bitcoin at an average of between $50-60k, so they have already made 2x returns. However, if they sold only half of their total BTC holding, it could create a mass sell-off, initiating either a bear market or altcoin season. Bear market because Blackrock’s influence is really high. Some say it is 2-3 times the influence of Mt Gox. and Germany combined. As a result of its sell-off, fear could take over the market, dropping the bitcoin price and trading volume. Eventually, this could bring a bear market. In the other scenario, Bitcoin selling will push investors to the altcoins, initiating an altcoin season. Will Bitcoin Price Drop To $60K? The selling pressure has surrounded Bitcoin from all directions ever since it failed to hold the $100k support on Christmas. An earlier CoinGape report clarified this further as the BTC on-chain data shows weakness, restricting its rally. More importantly, Bitcoin is now moving in a critical zone, between $97,041 and $93,806, where its failure to hold its demand could drop the price to $70k. Additional damages could happen with the $14B worth of Bitcoin options expiring today. Interestingly, many analysts have predicted the Bitcoin price crash to $60k around Donald Trump’s inauguration. Blackrock selling BTC could play a critical role in that, increasing the odds of happening.

Analysts and fans are preparing for a booming altcoin season driven by a decrease in Bitcoin dominance and a larger change in market trends. Among the possible breakout stars are XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and the fresh entrant Minotaurus (MTAUR). Here’s the reason these crypto coins are set for rapid growth. 3 Crypto Coins Poised to Soar 50X as Altcoin Season Approaches As Bitcoin dominance drops, let’s explore three crypto coins that could increase in value by 50X in the upcoming altcoin season. 1. Ethereum (ETH): A Crypto Coin Poised for Takeoff Ethereum has consistently been popular among investors and developers alike. As @CryptoELlTES pointed out, ETH is poised for a considerable surge soon. He predicts that Ethereum price may increase from its current value at $3,415.63 to as high as $5,000, with even bolder forecasts going up to $15,000. Source: @CryptooELITES (X) Reasons Ethereum Is Set to Surge: Market fundamentals: Although Bitcoin is volatile, ETH has shown impressive stability. Experts such as @ItoShimotsuma observe that the second-largest crypto coin, frequently surpasses Bitcoin in performance during years following a halving event. Technical indicators: A significant head-and-shoulders formation pointed out by James CryptoGuru establishes ETH’s upcoming target at $6,000, with an ambitious goal of $8,100. Institutional adoption: Ethereum consistently draws considerable institutional interest, enhancing its long-term potential. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): The Underdog with Massive Upside A relative newcomer, Minotaurus (MTAUR) has captured attention during its presale with competitive pricing and innovative features. Priced at just 0.00006001 USDT during the presale, MTAUR offers a 70% markdown compared to its expected listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Why Minotaurus Could Skyrocket: Innovative tokenomics: MTAUR’s unique features and use cases make it a promising early-stage cryptocurrency for the next altcoin season. Presale buzz: The presale has attracted significant interest, positioning MTAUR for a strong debut. Undervalued entry point: With such a low initial price, this best gaming token to buy could yield high yields for early buyers, one it hits major exchanges. 3. XRP: Legal Wins and Ecosystem Growth Driving Momentum XRP is about to make history. Recent developments, such as clearer regulations and an expanding ecosystem, place it as a leading candidate for significant gains. Trading today at $2.21, @Steph_iscrypto emphasizes a positive outlook for XRP, suggesting it could hit $35 in 2025 and exceed $300 in the future. Essential Drivers for XRP’s Growth: Regulatory certainty: Ripple’s lawsuit against the SEC has shifted positively for the company, boosting investor confidence. Burn mechanism: Each transaction on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) incinerates a tiny portion of XRP, enhancing its rarity. Adoption boom: In December 2024, a remarkable 30,641 new XRP accounts were opened in one day, indicating increased interest.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 12:22:00

Help Resolve $36 Tln US Debt Crisis?,https://coingape.com/can-elon-musk-doge-help-resolve-36-tln-us-debt-crisis/,"The United States grapples with an alarming $36 trillion debt, sparking urgent calls for action among the market participants. Amid this, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), led by Vivek Ramaswamy, is being hailed as a potential game-changer. Traders and market enthusiasts speculate that this initiative might slash government spending while potentially boosting Dogecoin, as its ticker resembles the department’s acronym. Can Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E. Resolve US Debt Crisis? Elon Musk has repeatedly warned that unchecked government overspending could bankrupt the United States. Now, with the creation of D.O.G.E. under Donald Trump’s administration, the market eagerly awaits the potential impact of the department in resolving the issue. Besides, the prediction market platform Kalshi indicates growing confidence in the department’s potential to deliver significant spending cuts. According to Kalshi data , the odds of D.O.G.E. achieving at least a $250 billion reduction in government spending have surged to 39%. Interestingly, 26% of traders predict cuts of $500 billion, while 18% expect reductions of $750 billion or more. A smaller, optimistic group believes a $1 trillion cut is possible, with an 11% probability. Meanwhile, sharing these projections on X, Elon Musk emphasized the urgency of the matter and said “We either fix this or go de facto bankrupt.” Musk’s leadership through D.O.G.E. in addressing the crisis, paired with his track record of innovation, offers hope to many amid this financial turmoil. Dogecoin Gains Momentum Amid Soaring Speculations Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E. formation has also reignited enthusiasm for Dogecoin, the top meme coin long backed by Musk. Historically, Dogecoin has surged following Musk’s endorsements, and its association with the department’s acronym adds fuel to speculation. Previously, the cryptocurrency experienced significant rallies when Musk publicly supported it through X posts. Besides, D.O.G.E.’s creation by the Trump administration has further strengthened this trend. While no official link exists between the department and Dogecoin, market participants are optimistic about another potential rally. DOGE price today was up around 1% and exchanged hands at $0.3184, while its trading volume fell 6% to $2.31 billion. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto has touched a high and low of $0.3238 and $0.309, respectively. Furthermore, Dogecoin Futures Open Interest also spiked today to $2 billion, indicating that the investors are regaining confidence. The post Can Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E.

The Ministry of Science and Technology just announced that next year’s budget for cutting-edge fields like semiconductors, AI, and aerospace is set to shrink by T$20 billion ($609 million). This comes after opposition lawmakers pushed through a controversial law to redirect central government funds to local municipalities. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) isn’t happy, and neither are the thousands of protesters who took to the streets last week. A second blow came from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which warned that budget cuts could jeopardize the nation’s partnerships with global tech giants like Micron, AMD, and Nvidia . Their exact words? “Insufficient future budgets will affect Taiwan’s international AI technology partnerships.” Taiwan’s AI dominance under threat Taiwan’s tech industry isn’t just any industry. It’s the backbone of the global AI boom. In the second quarter of 2024, Its economy grew 5.09% year-over-year, driven largely by AI innovations and semiconductor manufacturing. Taiwan makes up over 90% of the world’s AI servers. The AI market forecast in the country is set to grow by 28.49% annually through 2030, potentially hitting $6.57 billion in value. But all that growth depends on funding, and that’s exactly what’s at risk. The cuts will strip T$11.6 billion from next year’s technology projects and a total of T$29.7 billion from economic initiatives. If the funding goes, so does the momentum. Corporations aren’t thrilled either. A recent survey shows that 85.1% of Taiwanese companies are eager to jump into smart healthcare collaborations, and 77.7% are heavily invested in AI tech. However, with less government support, those plans could fall apart. For a country already struggling to keep up with global software giants like Google and Microsoft, this isn’t good news. The government rolled out the Taiwan AI Action Plan 2.0 in 2023, targeting AI integration in healthcare, labor, and sustainability. They poured money into data centers and supercomputing facilities. These aren’t small projects we’re talking about. Taiwan’s AI infrastructure supports everything from advanced robotics to machine learning algorithms powering industries like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.

Dogecoin eyes a 2025 rally while Rollblock’s GameFi solutions positions it to outpace DOGE, SOL, and XRP with real-world utility. Table of Contents Rollblock takes the lead with decentralized gaming platform Dogecoin records high network activity, Open Interest peaks Solana faces uncertain market sentiment despite flashing recovery signal XRP records mysterious whale activity amid market downturn Rollblock to overthrow DOGE, SOL and XRP Dogecoin is preparing for an explosive rally in 2025 while Solana and XRP face an uncertain market sentiment. Even if Dogecoin surpasses SOL and XRP soon, can it compete with Rollblock’s GameFi project? Let’s find out. Rollblock takes the lead with decentralized gaming platform Rollblock is taking the lead as the most hyped DeFi altcoin before 2025. By bringing disruptive blockchain technology to the world of online gaming, Rollblock has launched the market’s first decentralized gaming platform. Rollblock’s GameFi project has already raised more than $7.7 million in its presale, reflecting the high investor confidence in RBLK’s growth. Rollblock is setting itself apart from other DeFi altcoins by combining blockchain-level transparency with thrill and excitement. Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem has already passed a comprehensive audit by SolidProof and has obtained an e-gaming license from Gaming Anjouan, showcasing the platform’s commitment to user security. Rollblock also encrypts all financial information and bets directly on-chain, protecting users against all kinds of data fraud and third-party manipulation. Users can sign up on Rollblock with an email address, purchase the native RBLK token with any compatible cryptocurrency, and start enjoying the thrilling games on Rollblock’s casino. Rollblock’s gaming library already features 7,000+ AI-powered games that include both casino classics and new web3-based titles like KENO and Max Car Racing. One major factor that has been key to investor interest in Rollblock soaring is how they plan to redefine the $450b a year gambling market by giving RBLK holders a share of the casino’s profits. Up to 30% of weekly profits will be shared with holders, buying back RBLK tokens from the open market. This will help boost the price of the token. 60% of the purchased RBLK will then be burned from the supply forever, creating scarcity. The other 40% will be given to RBLK stakers where they could earn APYs of 30%+ – some of the highest in the space. Rollblock’s native RBLK token is currently selling for a low price of only $0.043 in stage 9 of its presale, with analysts already projecting another price jump on Boxing Day. As Rollblock dominates the DeFi space, analysts expect the token to deliver a total of 880% returns to early investors before its official launch in early 2025. You might also like: Amid market correction, ETH, TON traders see benefits of Rollblock’s deflationary crypto Dogecoin records high network activity, Open Interest peaks Dogecoin is witnessing an impressive resurgence from its December lows, with analysts expecting an explosive rally in early 2025. Historically, Dogecoin has followed a similar trend of surging, retracing, and then skyrocketing to a record high. During Q4, Dogecoin has already recorded a 440% surge after the US Presidential election and then retraced 46% while consolidating losses. This makes January 2025 the perfect time for Dogecoin to experience massive buying activity, pushing the price beyond the $1 milestone. These optimistic predictions have increased Dogecoin’s network activity, pushing the token’s Open Interest beyond $2 million. Dogecoin is currently trading for $0.3287 after an intraday decrease of 1.85%, with analysts expecting Dogecoin to reach the $1 milestone soon. Solana faces uncertain market sentiment despite flashing recovery signal Solana has been consolidating its losses for the last few weeks after establishing a new all-time high price in November 2024. Despite Solana’s optimistic market sentiment, sudden buying pressure pushed Solana’s price below the critical $200 support. Solana is still in its corrective period but is beginning to show some signs of recovery on the SOL/USDT daily chart. Solana is currently trading for $197.67 after an intraday increase of only 0.68%. Solana’s current price is above the 100-EMA and 200-EMA trend lines which reflects some upward momentum. However, Solana’s Momentum Indicator and MACD Level are still flashing strong sell signals. Since some analysts have termed Solana as an overbought asset, Solana could experience a steeper decline toward $109.51 soon. XRP records mysterious whale activity amid market downturn XRP’s longstanding lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to end as chair Gary Gensler steps down from office. Analysts were predicting a massive XRP buying spree in early 2025. These predictions have suddenly come to a halt as an XRP whale recently transferred 30.17 million tokens to an unknown Coinbase address. Such whale activity typically suggests a profit-taking sentiment, increasing the bullish pressure on XRP’s price. XRP is currently trading for $2.28 after an intraday decrease of 1.83%. XRP’s trading volume has also decreased by 36.23% during this period, indicating low network activity. As XRP’s Momentum Indicator suggests bearish dominance, analysts expect XRP to face more uncertainty before January 2025. Rollblock to overthrow DOGE, SOL and XRP Based on historical trends, Dogecoin is gearing up for a legendary run, with analysts expecting DOGE to surpass both SOL and XRP in terms of gains. Rollblock, on the other hand, is expected to overthrow Dogecoin with its blockchain-powered GameFi project that offers real utility and scalability to investors.

This comes as part of a series of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks targeting the crypto market. Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, reports that North Korean-affiliated hackers carried out 47 cyberattacks this year, marking a 102.88% increase in the value stolen compared to 2023. While the total number of incidents reached an all-time high of 303, the actual losses in 2024 were second only to 2022’s $3.7 billion. The hackers primarily targeted decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, with private key compromises accounting for 44% of the total theft.

To identify the best crypto presales, you must assess several key factors to ensure the project is both promising and trustworthy. First and foremost, research the project’s team—are they experienced and transparent about their background? A genuine team with a proven track record in the crypto space will be more likely to deliver on their promises. Moreover, look for whitepapers or technical documents that clearly outline the project’s vision, tokenomics, and use cases. Presales with robust planning are often the best crypto presales, as they indicate a well-thought-out long-term strategy. Another crucial step is examining the platform’s security measures, especially after 2024’s surge in hacks like the $1.34 billion theft by North Korean hackers. Security breaches can significantly undermine the value and trustworthiness of a project, so presales with strong encryption and private key protection should be prioritized. Additionally, take a look at the community around the presale; a growing, engaged community is a sign of legitimacy. Social media presence, influencer endorsements, and active discussions on platforms like Telegram and Discord can provide more insight into the project’s credibility. Lastly, always consider the project’s tokenomics: do they have fair distribution, with enough incentives for early investors but not so much that it leads to inflationary risks? Following these steps will ensure you’re investing in only the best crypto presales that offer real, long-term potential.

38184213,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667546,1735306221,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Solana Dips Below $194 – A Continued Consolidation In Sight?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-dips-below-194-resistance/,"Solana price action is at a critical juncture, with the cryptocurrency testing market’s patience, it hovers just below the pivotal $194 resistance level. This threshold has emerged as a significant hurdle as bulls struggle to sustain enough momentum to power a breakout despite recent attempts to push higher. The current phase of consolidation raises important questions about Solana’s next move. A successful breakout above this level could signal the start of a fresh rally, propelling the price toward new highs. However, failure to breach $194 might result in prolonged sideways trading or a potential pullback. Technical Indicators Signal Mixed Momentum Solana trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) raises concerns about the possibility of further downside movement. The 100-day SMA is a significant technical indicator often used to assess an asset’s overall trend. When the price consistently trades below this level, it typically suggests that the market sentiment is leaning toward the bearish side, with selling pressure outweighing buying activity. This situation may signal that SOL is vulnerable to additional losses, especially if the bears continue to dominate the market. A sustained stay below the 100-day SMA might lead to a deeper pullback, potentially testing lower support levels. However, for the bulls to regain control, Solana would need to break above the 100-day SMA and turn it into a support level. Until then, the price could struggle to mount a significant recovery as bearish forces remain in play. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Gearing Up: Is a New Surge on the Horizon? Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Solana’s price may be poised for an upward move. After dipping to a low of 41%, the RSI line is now gradually rising, indicating a possible shift in momentum. A level below 30% typically signals oversold conditions, while levels above 70% suggest overbought conditions. As the RSI recovers and climbs above 41%, this resurgence reflects a growing buying interest. A continued upward movement in the RSI would support the case for an increase in Solana’s price, with the possibility of breaking through key resistance levels. Thus, the rising RSI could be a positive indicator for traders, suggesting that Solana may undergo a recovery in the near term. Market Sentiment: Solana Bulls And Bears In Tug-of-War Solana’s price action below the $194 resistance level reflects a classic battle between bullish optimism and bearish caution. Bulls are fueled by the asset’s recent recovery momentum and broader market support, aiming to push the price past the critical resistance zone. A successful breakout above $194 could act as a strong bullish confirmation, attracting buying interest and driving SOL to the next resistance level at $209. Related Reading: Solana Holds Weekly Support At $180 – Analyst Expects $330 Mid-Term Conversely, bears are equally resolute in defending the $194 level, considering it a key pivot point to halt the ongoing rally. If bears succeed in preventing the price from surpassing this resistance, Solana could begin to decline again, potentially heading toward the $164 support level and beyond.

Despite Coinbase’s decision in mid-December to delist USDt , the stablecoin continues to trade across European exchanges, leaving many investors and traders questioning its future within the EU. MiCA Regulatory Clarity Still Missing for USDt The absence of clear guidance from EU regulators has left the stablecoin in a state of limbo. While no official statement has been made declaring USDt non-compliant with MiCA , its status remains unclear. Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, said in a recent interview that just because regulators have not explicitly stated USDt’s non-compliance does not necessarily mean it complies either. He suggested that exchanges may be adopting a “wait-and-see” approach, anticipating further clarity from European authorities. For now, many European exchanges, such as Binance and Crypto.com, continue to offer USDt trading. Ibañez speculated that Coinbase’s delisting decision could be driven by a desire to avoid regulatory risks ahead of the MiCA deadline, but he noted that not all exchanges are taking the same route. The real question remains whether European regulators will issue a directive by December 30, causing mass delistings, or whether exchanges will gradually pull USDt from their platforms based on evolving regulatory stances. Regulatory Silence Sparks Speculation The uncertainty around USDt’s future in Europe stems from conflicting reports. Some outlets, including Bloomberg, have suggested that European exchanges will be required to delist USDt after December 30, 2024. However, European regulators, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), have refrained from confirming whether USDt falls under MiCA’s restrictions. Despite this, reports indicate that Tether’s USDt could face an eventual ban across Europe, though no official confirmation has been made. In a statement in October 2024, ESMA clarified that it was still working with market participants to address issues related to stablecoins, without providing concrete answers regarding USDt. As the MiCA regulations prepare to go live, all eyes will be on European regulators for guidance on how they will handle Tether’s status. In the absence of definitive regulatory action, the future of USDt in the European market remains shrouded in uncertainty. With the MiCA deadline fast approaching, crypto exchanges, investors, and regulators alike are waiting for the next move.

In a move targeting crypto users, Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) has officially proposed a ban on self-custodial stablecoins, sparking backlash from the community. The initiative, expected to be shaped into regulations next year, aims to prevent individuals from holding cryptocurrencies like USDT or USDC in independent, user-controlled wallets such as Metamask, Phantom, or Trezor. BCB: stablecoins facilitate tax evasion and illicit activities The proposal has been under consideration since at least October, when Roberto Campos Neto, the president of Brazil’s central bank, publicly stated that stablecoins and asset tokenization should be regulated in the country next year. However, it is likely that the plan has been in development for a much longer period. As early as 2023, Neto argued that stablecoins contribute to tax evasion and facilitate illicit activities. According to 2023 data from the BCB, annual cryptocurrency imports totaled $7.4 billion, having soared by 44.2% from January to August compared to the same period last year. Brazilians use stablecoins to hedge against inflation Notably, in recent times the local demand has shifted to stablecoins, which are linked to the US dollar or other real-world assets. This tendency suggests that Brazilian citizens are more likely to use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment rather than merely for investment. It’s hardly a wonder. Brazil has been experiencing increased inflation for several years, which has put downward pressure on the real, further exacerbated by political instability. The BCB has had to raise interest rates multiple times to contain price growth. Turning to stablecoins to protect their assets from devaluation has been only natural for Brazilian citizens. Cross-border crypto transactions available only for VASPs At this moment, it is not clear how the BCB plans to put its concepts into practice. The proposal has it that only authorized virtual asset service providers (VASPs) will be able to conduct cross-border crypto transactions. The transfer of stablecoins pegged to foreign national currencies to self-custodial wallets would be completely banned, and the use of such assets for domestic payments would be severely restricted. Additionally, BCB considers a ban on all cryptocurrency transfers (even beyond stablecoins) to foreign user-controlled crypto wallets. Brazilian VASPs would be required to perform foreign asset transfers only to regulated institutions. Brazil’s stablecoin restrictions likely to boost DeFi platforms However, what appears as a preventive measure to tackle looming dollarization of the Brazilian economy may in fact contribute to further decentralization. Brazilian authorities can force regulated platforms to implement controls on asset transfers but they have virtually no means to control the DeFi market and peer-to-peer transactions. Nevertheless, such a measure is likely to limit the amount of stablecoins changing hands in the local market due to more stringent KYC procedures. Brazil’s government is currently holding a public consultation set to conclude in February 2025. If new regulations are passed, decentralized platforms such as Uniswap or SushiSwap are likely to be among the winners.

The Central Bank of Cambodia now allows commercial banks and payment institutions to provide services involving Category 1 cryptocurrencies, i.e., backed or stable cryptocurrencies. However, unbacked cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, remain prohibited. The development was formalized in a prakas issued on December 26 and announced by NBC on December 27 as reported by The Phnom Penh post. The directive aims to regulate operations and businesses involving digital currencies, reflecting the country’s effort to keep pace with global financial innovations. Under the new directive from the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), commercial banks and payment institutions must obtain prior approval to offer crypto-related services. Authorized institutions can engage in activities such as exchanging crypto assets for fiat currencies, transferring crypto between accounts, and providing custody services. However, they are explicitly prohibited from using their customers’ crypto assets for their own purposes. Historically, Cambodia has banned cryptocurrency transactions and trading due to concerns about high risks, including money laundering, fraud, and illicit activities in the black market. Economic researcher Hong Vanak of the Royal Academy of Cambodia noted the growing global popularity of cryptocurrencies, which are used not only for payments but also traded like stocks due to their highly volatile prices, particularly unbacked cryptocurrencies. Vanak argued that cryptocurrencies provide limited benefits to Cambodia’s national economy due to their digital and decentralized nature, which makes regulation, taxation, and ownership tracking challenging.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

In a recent interview with Scott Melker, Alfred made a bold prediction for Bitcoin. Alfred claimed that Bitcoin will reach $180,000 by March 21, 2025. According to Alfred, the first quarter of 2025 will be very critical for Bitcoin and BTC will make huge gains. “The next two to three months are key to this four-year cycle.” The famous name based his bullish prediction on Bitcoin on the impact of the halving and increasing institutional acceptance through ETFs. Polymerket and Kalshi users are also expecting Bitcoin to reach a new ATH. At this point, Polymarket prices the probability of BTC reaching $120,000 before the end of March at 50%, while Kalshi prices the probability of Bitcoin reaching at least $125,000 in 2025 at more than 60%. *This is not investment advice.

Even if Christmas is not your thing, we would like to take this opportunity to wish every and each one of you good will and fortune in the upcoming year and beyond! Speaking of holidays, Bitcoin tried to gift us with a new rally, but unfortunately the Grinch (in the face of sellers) stepped in and ruined the whole thing. The last seven days turned out to be very choppy in terms of price action. BTC pushed to $99K last weekend but the bears were quick to intervene, initiating a violent move that spanned for a few days, resulting in a drop toward $92,000. But on Christmas Eve, the bulls stepped up and pushed the price back up to $99,000, sparking hopes of a renewed end-of-year rally, which, unfortunately, was for not. The price quickly retraced and is currently trading at around $96,000 – more or less where it was this time last week. This highlights the importance of staying away from excessive leverage because these moves can quickly chop up your portfolio and produce unnecessary losses. That aside, there were some interesting developments. The President-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, reiterated that his administration has big plans for the industry, saying that they will “do something great with crypto.” He argued that the US should not fall behind other countries (naming China, which is surprising to absolutely nobody) when it comes to progress in that field. So, that’s good. In other news, MicroStrategy announced another whopping Bitcoin buy. The company bought more than 5,000 BTC earlier on Monday, solidifying its position as the world’s largest corporate holder by a massive margin. It’s interesting to note that other companies are starting to follow Michael Saylor’s strategy. KULR Technology Group – a publicly-listed firm trading on the New York Stock Exchange – announced a $21 million BTC buy as well as plans of prolonged purchasing strategy as part of their broader policy. Anyways, this is our last weekly market roundup for the year of 2024 and we will see you again next year! It’s incredibly exciting to see how 2025 will turn out – let’s hope that it’s every bit as good!

Dabbling into cryptocurrency price predictions must be one of the more interesting things to do at the end of the year. In this article, we’ve taken a closer look at those that were a hit and those that were a miss. Trump Gets It: Bitcoin Is a Bounty on Abundance Electricity Production. President-elect Donald Trump confirmed that his administration is “going to do something great with crypto.” His motives stem from the fact that he doesn’t want China “or anybody else” to be ahead. MicroStrategy’s Monday Streak Continues With 5,262 BTC Purchase. At this point, it probably doesn’t come much as a surprise to many, but yeah – MicroStrategy, the company spearheaded by one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents, Michael Saylor, bought another 5262 BTC this Monday. Binance Bitcoin Reserves Hit Lowest Level in 2024, Possible Indicator of Bullish Reversal. Despite the most recent slump in Bitcoin’s price, data suggests that there could be room for more upward movement. This is because the BTC reserves on Binance hit their lowest level in 2024 earlier this week, indicating the possibility of a reduced selling pressure and even a supply shock in the near future.

Platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi reveal that traders are betting heavily on both assets reaching unprecedented price levels, reflecting growing confidence in the long-term value of these leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Price Predictions for 2025 According to a report from Cointelegraph , traders on Kalshi predict a greater than 60% chance that Bitcoin will reach at least $125,000 , while Ethereum is expected to surpass $5,000 by the end of 2025. Similarly, Polymarket users assign a 50% probability to Bitcoin reaching $120,000 as early as March 2025. These predictions highlight bullish sentiment across the crypto community, driven by several factors, including increasing institutional interest, adoption of blockchain technology, and macroeconomic trends that favor digital assets. What Are Prediction Markets? Prediction markets are platforms where users can trade contracts based on the outcomes of future events, offering insights into collective expectations. In the context of cryptocurrency, these markets aggregate trader sentiment and serve as a barometer for price speculation. How Prediction Markets Work Users place bets on specific outcomes, such as price targets for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Market prices reflect the collective probability of these outcomes. Platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi use blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security in trading. Prediction markets are often seen as more reliable indicators of sentiment compared to polls, as participants have financial stakes in their predictions. Key Drivers Behind the Optimism The bullish predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025 are underpinned by several macroeconomic and industry-specific factors: 1. Institutional Adoption Major financial institutions are increasingly integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into their portfolios and offering crypto-related services to clients. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, expected to launch in 2025, could drive significant inflows into the market. 2. Supply Dynamics Bitcoin Halving Event : Scheduled for April 2024, this event will reduce Bitcoin’s mining rewards, decreasing the supply of new coins and potentially boosting prices. Ethereum Staking : The continued growth of Ethereum staking reduces circulating supply, creating upward pressure on prices. 3. Broader Market Trends Macroeconomic Conditions : Persistent inflation and economic uncertainty have driven investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Regulatory Clarity : Improved regulations in key markets, including the U.S., have enhanced investor confidence. Bitcoin: On Track for $125,000? Bitcoin’s price predictions for 2025 reflect a confluence of factors driving optimism: Halving Impact : Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events have preceded significant price rallies. With the next halving approaching, many traders expect a supply shock to propel prices. Institutional Demand : Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have set precedents by holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, a trend likely to continue as the asset gains legitimacy. Broader Adoption : Countries like El Salvador and increasing retail participation further solidify Bitcoin’s position as a global asset. While a price target of $125,000 might seem ambitious, previous bull runs have shown Bitcoin’s capacity for exponential growth in a short time. Ethereum: Reaching $5,000 and Beyond Ethereum’s role as the leading smart contract platform makes it a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain innovation. Factors driving its price predictions include: Layer 2 Scaling : The adoption of Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum enhances Ethereum’s scalability and utility, attracting more developers and users. DeFi and NFTs : As the backbone of these sectors, Ethereum continues to dominate in transaction volume and value locked. Staking Growth : The increasing number of ETH staked in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network reduces its circulating supply, creating a deflationary effect. Given these dynamics, a $5,000 target for Ethereum in 2025 aligns with its ongoing evolution and adoption. Potential Risks to Consider While the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, several risks could impact the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum: Regulatory Uncertainty Stricter regulations or unfavorable policies could dampen market enthusiasm. Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, with sharp corrections often following bullish phases. Global Competition Emerging competitors, such as Solana or Avalanche, could challenge Ethereum’s dominance, impacting its price growth. Conclusion Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi offer a snapshot of the crypto community’s expectations for 2025, with traders betting heavily on Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching new highs. Backed by strong fundamentals, increasing institutional interest, and pivotal market events like Bitcoin’s halving, these predictions reflect an optimistic outlook for the leading cryptocurrencies. However, as with any investment, risks remain, and traders should approach predictions with caution. The coming year will undoubtedly be pivotal for the crypto industry, with the potential for both unprecedented growth and unexpected challenges.

SHIB’s price has declined in the past month, but advancements in Shibarium and a robust token-burning mechanism could contribute for another rally soon. SHIB Leads the Pack Despite the most recent correction, 2024 has been highly successful for meme coins, many of which experienced substantial price gains. One example is Shiba Inu (SHIB), the valuation of which has skyrocketed by 115% year-to-date (YTD). The impressive resurgence could be one reason why the self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer has increased its popularity across the globe . Most recently, Kashif Raza (founder of the crypto education platform Bitinning ) revealed that SHIB had been the most-traded cryptocurrency in India this year. Approximately 9% of the local traders have dealt with it, while Pepe (PEPE) ranks second with 8%. Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tether (USDT) follow up next. Raza further maintained that around 5% of the Indian HODLers have included SHIB in their portfolios. DOGE is the leader in this ranking with 8%. According to the research, Jalandhar is the Indian city with the most meme coin traders. In 2024, roughly 18% of the traders residing in the northern town interacted with the niche. The strongest month for SHIB this year was March when the price jumped to a two-year high. Back then, it became the most-traded digital asset on India’s leading crypto exchange, WazirX, surpassing BTC, PEPE, FLOKI, and DOGE. SHIB Price Outlook The price of the meme coin is currently trading far below its peak registered in March. As of this writing, SHIB is worth approximately $0.00002223, which represents a 10% monthly decline. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Still, some important elements suggest that the asset could experience another bull run soon. One example is the further advancement of the layer-2 scaling solution – Shibarium. The network, whose ultimate goal is to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, recently hit another major milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total transactions processed on the protocol exceeded 700 million. Shiba Inu’s burning mechanism should also be mentioned . The successful execution of the program will reduce the tremendous supply of SHIB, potentially making it more valuable (assuming demand doesn’t head south). In the past 24 hours, the burn rate has increased by almost 50%, resulting in 27.4 million tokens destroyed. Since adopting the mechanism, the team and community have burned over 410.7 trillion SHIB, leaving 584.1 trillion in circulation.

However, analysts are optimistic about further rally in the next bull market wave. OKX to Delist Ripple’s Coin and Litecoin Delivery Contracts Crypto exchange OKX announced earlier that it will phase out the generation of XRP and LTC USDT-margined and crypto-margined expiry futures. This is scheduled to be completed by today, December 27. The crypto exchange will officially delist XRP and LTC expiry futures at 8 AM UTC on December 27, 2024. Bi-weekly expiry futures and Bi-quarterly expiry futures were ceased in earlier months by the platform. It also cleared that the currently listed expiry futures will remain unaffected until their respective expiration dates. Amid this delisting news by the top crypto exchange Binance’s peer OKX, there may be some volatility in XRP and LTC prices. This may happen due to traders reacting to the developments.

The token was tied to Siqi Chen, co-founder of Serious Business and Runway, with no previous connections to crypto or memes. The MIRA token saw active trading after a big part of the supply was sent to Siqi Chen, co-founder of Serious Business and Runway. The initial hype around the token suggested the asset would be used to fund research into rare diseases. However, soon after the launch, MIRA went through extreme volatility. Recently, MIRA wiped as much as $500K from a whale trader, who poured more than $1.56M into the token. The buyer is still holding, though. Within hours, the value of the token holdings fell to $718,000, extending its downward trend. Despite the noble cause, once Chen sold his share and whales took profit, the token did not find support from anywhere else. The whale that lost on MIRA has been aping into meme tokens since November, targeting the hottest trending memes. The whale had scored significant gains in the same wallet, with $1.1M in PNUT tokens, and $962K worth of PENGU . MIRA helped fund research, but early buyers took profits MIRA appeared on Christmas day when it was airdropped to Siqi Chen. Later, Chen received a large part of the supply of Kitkat, a new token named after his dog. Chen only provided a crypto wallet after a community request, as an additional payment option to the GoFundMe page for his research cause. MIRA was generated on Solana by an anonymous creator with the message that it would help with scientific funding. The token was named after Mira, Chen’s young daughter, who suffers from a rare and life-threatening form of brain tumor. The token’s initial story was appealing enough to early buyers, but MIRA’s rally was short-lived, leading to large losses. MIRA crashed soon after its launch, as early whales took profits and did not donate to charity or research. | Source: DexScreener Chen himself sold his share of the token, promising to use the funds for further research. However, early traders that sniped the token right after the launch actually made profits, with no intention of supporting science or research. At the same time, other buyers lost a significant part of their net value, expecting buyers to hold MIRA for the long term. “ How much degens make or lose money in the pvp trenches of pump is not something that is any of my business. if you made a lot of money, i’m genuinely happy for you – but please consider donating some of your profits to hankinson lab., if you lost a lot of money, i’m very sorry – but magic internet money is magic internet money,” wrote Chen in a lengthy X post . Still in the first days since its launch, MIRA is yet to have a relief rally, raising questions about the ethics of funding through meme tokens. Before whales realized profits, Chen held up to $18M worth of MIRA tokens. Initially, the share was worth $400K, but MIRA appreciated as rapidly as other meme tokens. However, the asset lacked enough liquidity to absorb real whale selling, leading to deepening losses. Just days after the token’s launch, MIRA liquidity is down to $771K, practically leaving holders unable to sell without crashing the market. MIRA launch sparks a trend of research-funding tokens The hype around MIRA created a new type of meme tokens in the “launch to save” trend. While Chen’s cause had a real-life basis and real research potential, other meme tokens were just created to ride the hype, producing risky assets that would be rug-pulled immediately. Pump.fun saw an inflow of new tokens with the “charity” tag in the days around Christmas. It especially capitalized on people’s generosity. “Charity” has turned into a meta-narrative for new launches, where the token creators do not even bother to actually donate. The creators launch tokens , and then donate a portion to the wallets of legitimate organizations. However, the real goal is to make profitable trades, often leaving the real organizations with no value. Earlier this year, Vitalik Buterin wrote about the potential of meme tokens to raise funds for charity. Buterin himself often liquidates meme assets and sends the funds to support his favorite projects. However, the recent meta-narrative of charity tokens is much riskier, as it may benefit dishonest early holders.

According to the Phnom Penh Post , the NBC formally declared the decision to allow banks to provide services involving Category 1 crypto assets on Dec. 27. Category 1 crypto asset are cryptocurrencies backed by fiat, including stablecoins such as USD Coin ( USDC ), USDT ( USDT ) as well as central bank digital currencies. Though, this also means that Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and other standalone cryptocurrencies are still prohibited in Cambodia. Under this new law, all commercial banks and payment firms must first receive approval from the central bank if they want to provide crypto-related service. Once they are authorized, banks and payment institutions can convert crypto into fiat currencies and vice versa. They will also be allowed to facilitate cryptocurrency transfers between accounts and provide custody services. However, financial institutions are strictly prohibited from using client’s crypto assets for their own benefit. You might also like: Cambodia bans 16 major exchanges including Binance, OKX and Coinbase Before the NBC declaration, Cambodia had banned its citizens from making crypto transactions or trading cryptocurrencies due to the high volatility posed by virtual assets, as well as the widely held perception that crypto facilitates illicit activities such as money laundering and fraud. This landmark move indicates Cambodia is slowly shifting towards the crypto industry, following a global trend seen in countries such as Hong Kong, the U.S. and UAE. Though compared to those countries, Cambodia is still in its very early stages. Earlier this month, Cambodia blocked 16 major crypto exchanges including Binance, OKX, and Coinbase. The exchanges failed to secure licenses from Cambodia’s Securities and Exchange Regulator, which is necessary for operating in the country. Cambodia remains cautious of cryptocurrencies as a whole, however the nation seems to be taking steps towards digital currencies that are pegged to fiat.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he'd accepted an invitation to be the “adoptive father” of pygmy hippo Moo Deng when she grows up. He is also donating 10 million Thai baht ($300,000) to the Khao Kheow Open Zoo near Bangkok where the five-month-old lives, he said in a Thursday posting on X. The donations, made in Moo Deng’s name, will be used to upgrade general zoo operations and create a dedicated pygmy hippo habitat within the premises. Buterin said the donations came on the back of the “wonderful hospitality of Thailand” during November’s annual Ethereum developer conference, and were a “gesture of friendship and respect” to all of the country. “What better way to do that than through a Christmas present to someone who is dear to all Thai people, Moo Deng, and who has become one of the most unexpected and important Thai celebrities on the world stage,"" Buterin said in a letter to the zoo. Moo Deng, or bouncy pork in Thai, became a popular internet meme earlier this year after images of her went viral online. She has two siblings, brother Moo Toon (stewed pork) and sister Moo Waan (sweet pork). A memecoin she inspired, MOODENG on Solana, went similarly viral and hit a market capitalization of above $600 million in November after bagging listings on influential exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. MOODENG was the first token themed on an animal other than a dog or cat to garner massive trading volumes and is considered by some to be the first Thai memecoin . Token prices are down 60% from peak, however, as much of Moo Deng’s popularity remains focused within Thailand and neighboring markets.",Markets|memecoins|Vitalik Buterin|Donations|Moo Deng,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-27 13:47:10

Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) soared from the year-to-date low of $0.02234 in August to $3.4 on Dec. 27. This rally happened because of the rising hype surrounding artificial intelligence agents. AI agents are software tools that use AI to perform tasks for the end user. Virtuals Protocol hopes to become the crypto industry’s biggest decentralized AI agent network by allowing users to create these agents. Some of its top agents have achieved a multi-million market cap. For example, G.A.M.E has a market cap of over $304 million, while Prefrontal Cortex Convo Agent and Luna are valued at over $100 million. Virtuals Protocol’s price action has mirrored that of other big players in the AI space like NVIDIA, Palantir, and Broadcom. All these firms have become giants by focusing on AI solutions. NVIDIA and Broadcom are in the semiconductor industry, while Palantir is building AI software solutions.

Most of Virtuals’ trading volume happens in exchanges like Bybit, Bitget, and Gate. A listing by other top tier-1 exchanges would push it higher. However, numerous risks remain. The AI industry and its accompanying hype may slow down in 2025, affecting most assets. Moreover, there are fears that most AI assets have become highly overvalued. VIRTUAL price faces technical risks VIRTUAL price chart | source: crypto.news The VIRTUAL token faces mean reversion and Wyckoff Method risks. As shown above, Virtual price has moved 90% above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, the concept of mean reversion states that an asset often retreats back to the historical average. As such, if this happens, VIRTUAL will likely drop sharply to meet the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Wyckoff Method states that assets go through numerous stages. In this case, Virtuals Protocol remained in an accumulation phase between May and November, which usually has minimal price movements. It then entered the mark-up phase that is now going on. The coin will now move to the distribution phase followed by the markdown. If this happens, the coin may drop to $2 soon.

A fake Squid Game token was just launched on Base three hours ago, with the creator holding the most tokens. The price of the token has plummeted by 99%, which is a sign of a rugpull. This happens when creators sell their tokens once the price peaks. In this case, the price dropped from $0.1442 to $0.0000000000001269. #PeckShieldAlert Beware of scam #SquidGame tokens circulating in the wild.

The token has dropped 99%. pic.twitter.com/EIdaUldzaF — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) December 27, 2024 Cryptocurrencies, especially those associated with popular trends or big names, can attract attention, even when they have no real value. In this case, the Squid Game Token was heavily hyped, despite glaring red flags that suggested it was too good to be true. It’s a sad fact that many people fall for these types of scams because they don’t take the time to research the project. This incident is a prime example of the dangers of FOMO (fear of missing out) and the role it plays in driving people to make hasty decisions with their money. What Happened in 2021? Squid Game Token was valued at $2,800 per coin in 2021 when a similar scam happened. But once the developers pulled the rug, the token’s value crashed, leaving investors with coins worth almost nothing. This dramatic drop was a stark reminder of how high-risk and unpredictable the world of cryptocurrency can be, especially when scams are involved. The Squid Game Token scam is a wake-up call for anyone considering investing in cryptocurrency. It’s crucial to do your own research and not just follow the crowd.

Investors are now worried that ETH might be reversing its overall price trajectory. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart The daily chart shows that Ethereum’s price has formed a clear double-top pattern at the $4,000 resistance level while getting rejected twice. The $3,500 level has also been broken to the downside, and the market has failed to reclaim it following multiple unsuccessful attempts. At the current stage, a drop lower toward the $3,000 support zone and the 200-day moving average, located around the same level, looks probable. Price’s reaction to this key level could determine the mid-term fate of the market. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, a drop toward the $3,000 level seems less probable, as the market is seemingly climbing toward the $3,500 level to test it again. With the RSI also on the verge of rising above the %50 threshold, the market is demonstrating bullish momentum in this timeframe. This can indicate that a breakout above the $3,500 level is more probable this time. This scenario is of course, valid if the price is able to reach the level soon. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Ethereum Exchange Reserve While Ethereum’s price has been dropping after getting rejected by the $4,000 resistance level, looking at on-chain network activity provides an interesting clue to investors’ behaviour. This chart presents the Ethereum exchange reserve metric, which measures the amount of ETH that is held in trading platforms. This value is also used as a proxy for supply, as the coins held in exchanges can be sold almost any time. As the chart presents, the exchange reserve metric has been gradually rising over the past few months, indicating that the investors are selling their coins, likely for a profit, as the price reaches the $4,000 level. This has been one of the key contributing factors to the current halt in Ethereum’s bullish run. Meanwhile, during the recent price correction, the exchange reserve metric has been dropping and is currently declining below its 100-day moving average. This can indicate a potential accumulation by market participants, that could soon lead to a rally higher for ETH.

However, with the right strategies, you can buy Bitcoin during dips with a favorable risk-to-reward ratio while riding the bull market. Confirming Bull Market Conditions Before accumulating, ensure you're still in a bull market. The MVRV Z-score helps identify overheated or undervalued conditions by analyzing the deviation between market value and realized value. Figure 1: MVRV-Z Score indicates dips are still for buying. View Live Chart 🔍 Avoid Buying when the Z-score reaches high values, such as above 6.00, which would indicate the market is overextended and nearing a potential bearish reversal. If the Z-score is below this, dips likely represent opportunities, especially if other indicators align. Don’t accumulate aggressively during a bear market. Focus instead on finding the macro bottom. Short-Term Holders This chart reflects the average cost basis of new market participants, offering a glimpse into the Short-Term Holder activity. Historically, during bull cycles, whenever the price rebounds off the Short-Term Holder Realized Price line (or slightly dips below), it has presented excellent opportunities for accumulation. Figure 2: Short-Term Holder break-even has historically marked bull market turning points. View Live Chart 🔍 Gauging Market Sentiment Though simple, the Fear and Greed Index provides valuable insight into market emotions. Scores of 25 or below often signify extreme fear, which often accompanies irrational sell-offs. These moments offer favorable risk-to-reward conditions. Figure 3: The Fear and Greed Index highlights moments of extreme fear during macro uptrends, which historically align with strong risk-to-reward buying opportunities for Bitcoin. View Live Chart 🔍 Spotting Market Overreaction Funding Rates reflect trader sentiment in futures markets. Negative Funding during bull cycles are particularly telling. Exchanges like Bybit, which attract retail investors, show that negative Rates are a strong signal for accumulation during dips. Figure 4: Negative Funding Rates due to excessive shorting often provide great opportunities. View Live Chart 🔍 When traders use BTC as collateral, negative rates often indicate excellent buying opportunities, as those shorting with Bitcoin tend to be more cautious and deliberate. This is why I prefer focusing on Coin-Denominated Funding Rates as opposed to regular USD Rates. Active Address Sentiment Indicator This tool measures the divergence between Bitcoin’s price and network activity, when we see a divergence in the Active Address Sentiment Indicator (AASI) it indicates that there’s overly bearish price action given how strong the underlying network usage is. Figure 5: AASI dip buying has historically worked exceptionally well. View Live Chart 🔍 My preferred method of utilization is to wait until the 28-day percentage price change dips beneath the lower standard deviation band of the 28-day percentage change in active addresses and crosses back above. This buy signal confirms network strength and often signals a reversal. Conclusion Accumulating during bull market dips involves managing risk rather than chasing bottoms. Buying slightly higher but in oversold conditions reduces the likelihood of experiencing a 20%-40% drawdown compared to purchasing during a sharp rally. Confirm we’re still in a bull market and dips are for buying, then identify favorable buying zones using multiple metrics for confluence, such as Short-Term Holder Realized Price, Fear & Greed Index, Funding Rates, and AASI. Prioritize small, incremental purchases (dollar-cost averaging) over going all-in and focus on risk-to-reward ratios rather than absolute dollar amounts. By combining these strategies, you can make informed decisions and capitalize on the unique opportunities presented by bull market dips.

PEPE & WIF Sellers Increase While DTX Exchange (DTX) Becomes Ultimate Winner,https://thecoinrise.com/experts-ring-alarms-for-memecoins-pepe-wif-sellers-increase-while-dtx-exchange-dtx-becomes-ultimate-winner/,"Due to the increasing bearish wave, it hasn’t been a great month for all meme coins in the market. Despite Bitcoin’s swift ascent beyond $100k, experts warn that these quirky coins could face a massive sell-off before the year ends. This situation is quite evident with Pepe Coin (PEPE) and DogWifHat (WIF), as they witness more selling pressure. It has spurred many to conclude what could help circumvent their losses and turn their fortunes around. Amidst the ongoing market dip, DTX Exchange has become the ultimate winner with its captivating presale event and approach to the trading world. So far, this viral project has raised over $10.5 million within two months. Let’s find out more about these cryptos in this post. Meme Coins Face Huge Sell-Off: What it Means for Pepe Coin (PEPE) and DogWifHat (WIF) There’s no doubt that meme coins impressed in the 2024 market year, with investors and traders speculating if they could trigger the bull run. Those speculations may be over as the meme coin sector faces huge drawdowns in its overall market cap. Experts have warned that these assets, especially WIF and PEPE, could see more price drops. Starting with Pepe Coin, a careful look at its charts reveals that its upward movement from May 2023 may have ended. Since its December peak price of 0.00002739, PEPE has dipped by over 50% in value, currently sitting at $0.00001747. On the technical side, things aren’t looking great for this once-promising asset, and we might see more bearish moves before the year ends. DogWifHat faces a similar trajectory despite its promising start to the 2024 crypto market. The coin’s weekly chart points to a more bearish phase as the price continues to retrace after its peak price of $4.86 in March. While it recovered briefly to the upside, thanks to Trump’s victory and Bitcoin’s 100k march, WIF now trades at $1.86, a -40% from the past month. As sellers increase on these meme coins, traders could focus on DTX Exchange to help recover their losses before the new year. DTX Exchange Emerges as the Ultimate Winner in the Crypto Market Despite PEPE and WIF’s continued drawdowns, the focus is shifting to DTX Exchange , which could dominate the crypto scene and is perhaps the most talked about in DeFi. This project is designed to be a hybrid platform powered by its innovative layer-1 blockchain technology, VulcanX. DTX isn’t just about hype; it’s about delivering real value. Its hybrid model, combining the strengths of centralized and decentralized systems, has resonated with a global audience. As a result, the altcoin gains value with every passing day. At the center of this ecosystem lies the DTX Token, which holds certain perks for holders and traders. Token holders enjoy reduced trading fees, access to premium features, and loyalty rewards. On top of that, the decentralized governance system gives users voting rights over platform upgrades. This would put power directly into the hands of the community. While meme coins face uncertainties that have shaken investor confidence, DTX Exchange thrives and aims to become a clear alternative. Its interoperability is a game-changer, enabling seamless trading across multiple blockchains. This opens the door to a vast range of assets and liquidity that enhances the user experience. Notably, retail traders and investors are flooding DTX’s presale, eager to claim their stake in what could be a historic crypto rally. This hybrid platform has captivated traders and investors with its presale performance, smashing records in Stage 6. DTX tokens are available at $0.12, and their demand continues to soar. Early backers have already enjoyed significant returns of over 500%, and there are no signs of slowing. As the presale progresses toward its listing price, analysts forecast an explosive rally once the token hits major exchanges. DTX Exchange Could Be the Altcoin That Could Deliver Steady Gains in 2025 The meme coin market may continue to see more selling pressures into the new year. As WIF and PEPE feel the impact of the bearish wave, DTX Exchange is eager to become the ultimate winner. DTX Exchange has all the hallmarks of a market leader: cutting-edge technology, unmatched versatility, and a fair presale gaining traction. It’s no surprise that investors are eyeing it as the better alternative to meme coins. With exchange listings on the horizon, it would be best to take advantage of DTX Exchange’s early stages before it soars.

This marks a movement from the “Extreme Greed” zone into the “Greed” zone, signaling a recalibration of investor sentiment amid subtle market shifts. Provided by Alternative, a software development platform, this metric remains a key tool for gauging the emotions driving the volatile crypto market. What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a numerical representation of market sentiment, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). It combines multiple data points to provide insights into whether the market is overly cautious or excessively exuberant. This widely used metric evaluates six core factors, each contributing to the overall score: Volatility (25%) : Measures market stability or turbulence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading activity and price momentum. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes mentions, engagement, and sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Gathers opinions from market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Reflects the percentage of market capitalization held by Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. Google Trends (10%) : Considers search interest related to crypto terms and keywords. Significance of Dropping to 74 The five-point drop to 74 moves the index from the “Extreme Greed” zone to the “Greed” zone, reflecting a subtle cooling in market enthusiasm. This shift, while not drastic, may suggest increasing caution among investors. Greed Zone : A level of 74 indicates sustained optimism but hints that exuberance may be leveling off. Market Implications : When greed dominates, prices often inflate, potentially leading to corrections as traders lock in profits. Analyzing the Factors Behind the Shift The index’s adjustment reflects real-time changes in the six underlying metrics: 1. Volatility A decrease in extreme price swings could have contributed to a lower score. Stable markets often temper the index, even during bullish phases. 2. Market Momentum and Volume A dip in trading volumes or slowing price momentum across major cryptocurrencies could signal declining enthusiasm, reducing the overall score. 3. Social Media Sentiment A shift in the tone of social media discussions, from overwhelmingly positive to more tempered, may reflect investor caution. 4. Surveys and Community Sentiment Surveys capturing investor outlook may indicate growing uncertainty, even in an environment of broader market gains. 5. Bitcoin Dominance Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s dominance over the total crypto market capitalization could signal shifting focus towards altcoins, impacting the index. 6. Google Trends Lower search interest in cryptocurrency-related topics may suggest a cooling of retail investor excitement. What Does This Mean for Traders and Investors? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a compass for navigating the often-irrational movements of the crypto market. Here’s what the shift means: Cautious Optimism : The “Greed” zone reflects positive sentiment but warns of potential price corrections. Risk Management : Traders may consider adjusting stop-loss levels and diversifying portfolios to hedge against volatility. Market Timing : A drop from “Extreme Greed” can signal the beginning of a consolidation phase, potentially opening entry points for long-term investors. Historical Insights: Trends in the Index Historically, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has demonstrated patterns that align with major price movements. Extreme Greed Levels : Often precede sharp corrections, as excessive optimism leads to overbought conditions. Extreme Fear Levels : Typically align with market bottoms, presenting buying opportunities for contrarian investors. By analyzing past behavior, traders can use the index as a complementary tool alongside technical and fundamental analysis. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? As the index settles into the “Greed” zone, several scenarios could unfold: Sustained Optimism : The market may maintain its bullish trajectory, with prices gradually rising. Cooling Sentiment : If additional metrics weaken, the index could dip further, potentially signaling a short-term correction. Renewed Rally : A sudden surge in trading volume or positive market news could push the index back into the “Extreme Greed” zone. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s drop to 74 on December 27 highlights a subtle shift in market sentiment, moving from “Extreme Greed” to the “Greed” zone. This change reflects a balancing act between bullish momentum and cautious optimism, offering traders and investors valuable insights into the market’s current emotional state. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, staying informed about tools like the Fear & Greed Index can empower participants to navigate volatility and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

However, as the industry prepares itself for a wave of optimism and friendly regulation in 2025, the projects that rest on their technical laurels will be doing themselves a disservice. You might also like: The crypto marketing trap: Hiring crypto experts can backfire | Opinion I don’t blame technical crypto teams for being skeptical of marketing. In this category, you’ll come across many self-branded “web3” or “crypto” marketers who are often promoting a kind of marketing that is not rooted in fundamentals or a comprehensive strategy. Instead, they’re usually signaling a close association with specific crypto projects or kinds of tactics, such as paying key opinion leaders (KOLs), managing influencers, knowing how to shitpost on X, or having a pulse on the crypto meme-du-jour. (To be fair, there’s a place for all of that.) Crypto marketing is different and comes with unique challenges But these “crypto marketers” are also onto something. They’re onto the fact that crypto is not a typical industry and that it requires understanding a unique set of dynamics not found in traditional markets. Since 2021, at Blokhaus, we have supported a range of crypto clients, from layer-1 to layer-2, DeFi protocols, and web3 gaming and social apps. We’ve seen firsthand the challenges facing these projects and the lack of marketing infrastructure, talent, and support that prevents them from reaching their potential. It’s a complex landscape that very few individuals and teams are able to navigate effectively. Crypto projects looking to stand out in what is sure to be a noisy year ahead should be ready to step up their marketing efforts and not settle for shallow tactics. When onboarding marketing roles or agency teams to support your project, here are some key skills you should be looking for: 1. The ability to navigate decentralized ecosystems effectively and be a key point of integration Crypto ecosystems operate fundamentally differently than other sectors. Projects often have decentralized global teams, distinct organizations driving aspects of governance, tech, and business development, and vibrant communities that are not just consumers but active participants in the ecosystem’s evolution. When marketers come to crypto from traditional, centralized organizations, they need a major mindset shift. Rather than dictating and executing a top-down strategy, marketing in a decentralized setting requires the ability to listen, observe, synthesize, and reflect ideas back out into the world that was already there to begin with. In practice, this means you should look for marketing talent who can maintain strong relationships and lines of communication with a multitude of community organizations, ecosystem projects, and stakeholders. Your marketing team should become a key function for integration and alignment and be able to see connections that translate into insights for technical teams—who might be too busy building in decentralized silos to see the big picture. 2. The ability to deeply understand the tech while helping you crystallize the story It’s no mystery why crypto has not yet achieved mainstream adoption—there is little else for the average consumer to do other than speculate on the potential success of various projects. The crypto category is still working out the plumbing (layers and layers and layers of plumbing) of an entirely new infrastructure. Marketers in crypto need to be skilled in a very important way: they need to understand the tech with enough depth and nuance to devise tactics for a range of audiences, from experienced developers to crypto-curious consumers. And they need to be able to do this while helping technical teams crystallize a big-picture vision and story. I encourage crypto teams to view marketing not as a set of nice-to-haves or gimmicks but as an essential function that extends and completes the engineering cycle. Marketing isn’t just about getting clicks and eyeballs; it’s about building a product that fulfills market desires, which requires a continuous feedback loop between developers and marketers. 3. The ability to move as fast as the industry requires while getting out of ‘react’ mode Crypto is volatile and fast-moving, and as a result, many teams in the category are in a constant state of reactivity—understandably so. But it’s one thing to be nimble enough to react and another to not have a clear strategy. It’s also really hard to get away from the pressure of “price goes up,” which leads to the industry’s overreliance on KOLs or influencers to shill tokens. These tactics are not a substitute for a robust marketing strategy centered on solving problems and driving meaningful audience engagement and activity. Effective marketing requires a shift away from token-centric narratives and towards building sustainable ecosystems that users care about. Crypto teams should avoid being so fixated on short-term token price increases that they forget to build a solid strategy that sustains them for the long term. Often, these projects’ technical roadmaps are years long, acknowledging the time and effort required to achieve their engineering vision—this same thinking should be applied to marketing efforts. Yes, the best tech still needs good marketing For crypto to achieve mainstream adoption, marketing must not be viewed as a token price booster or an afterthought. It needs to be an integral component of the process, driving innovation, user adoption, and long-term growth. The technical teams that succeed in breaking through the noise of 2025 and beyond will be the ones that invest in marketing as a strategic function, not a peripheral activity. And while it is certainly challenging to find talent and teams that are as comfortable engaging in technical debates about rollup frameworks as they are making beautiful creative assets, they are out there.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-bitget-announces-burning-plan-for-its-native-token-here-are-the-details/,"Leading cryptocurrency exchange Bitget has announced a major plan to burn 40% of the total supply of its native token, equivalent to 800 million BGB tokens worth approximately $6.8 billion. Bitget Announces Major Token Burn and Quarterly Buyback Plan The initiative involves the launch of a quarterly token burn starting in 2025, funded by 20% of the profits from the exchange’s operations and related crypto wallet services. This approach mirrors strategies used by other major exchanges, including Binance, to prop up token value and produce a deflationary effect. The announcement comes after Bitget’s decision to merge its Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) with Bitget Token (BGB), creating a unified ecosystem token for both its centralized exchange and wallet services. The merger will not change the total BGB supply and the exchange rate will be set at 11.68 BWB / 1 BGB, ensuring a smooth transition for users. Updated Whitepaper and Future Plans Alongside the burn announcement, Bitget released an updated BGB whitepaper outlining the token’s evolving role within its ecosystem. The planned burn and token merger underscore Bitget’s commitment to enhancing BGB’s utility and value proposition for its users. The first quarterly burn is expected to occur in early 2025, signaling the exchange’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its position in the competitive crypto market. *This is not investment advice.

On-chain intelligence provider Santiment highlighted a notable shift in whale activity, with multiple large stablecoin deposits into centralized exchanges, signaling potential increased demand for cryptos. In the past 24 hours alone, Santiment’s dashboard reported seven separate stablecoin deposits to Binance, with individual transfers worth at least $9 million. The largest deposit, according to the dashboard, amounted to $50 million in FDUSD, about 2.33% of the stablcoin’s total supply. 🐳💸 After the post-Christmas market-wide dip, crypto markets are seeing an encouraging trend of whales moving stablecoins to exchanges.

Stablecoins, commonly used for fiat on/off-ramp across exchanges, are often moved to CEXs for asset acquisition. Analysts believe these inflows are a bullish sign, suggesting that traders and institutional players are preparing for potential market moves. Are whales preparing to accumulate crypto assets? The high market activity in stablecoin inflows seemingly coincides with a fall in exchange reserves on cryptos like Bitcoin. According to data from CryptoQuant, spot Bitcoin exchange reserves saw a 5% downtick in the last 30 days, which could mean investors are planning to take up holding positions. Bitcoin spot exchanges reserve 30-day chart. Source: CryptoQuant Moreover, the taker buy volume metric, provided by CryptoQuant, also indicates that Bitcoin demand is on the rise. A surge in taker buy volume often points to heightened interest from traders and increasing buying pressure, a trend typically favorable for prices. On Binance, Bitcoin’s taker buy volume has been on the rise between November 1 and December 25, forming higher lows over this period. Binance’s Bitcoin taker buy volume in December. Source: CryptoQuant This uptrend signals a growing demand for Bitcoin, further suggesting that buying pressure is intensifying, which could support a positive price movement in the near future. Bitcoin, which saw a temporary dip following its failure to participate in the traditional “Santa Claus rally,” remains around the $96,000 mark. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics are showing signs of increased buying pressure, particularly on centralized exchange platforms. Institutional interest in Bitcoin also appears to be on the rise, following a brief period of outflows from Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). According to Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $475.2 million on Thursday, reversing a four-day streak of outflows prior to the holiday. Altcoins experience mixed performance While Bitcoin’s performance remains the focal point, altcoins have also seen some movement. On Christmas Day, several major altcoins posted slight gains. Ethereum rose close to $3,500, marking a 2% increase, while XRP jumped to $2.30, also reflecting a similar upward trend. Other altcoins such as BNB, ADA, TRX, and LINK saw modest increases of around 2% each. However, the post-Christmas correction hit the broader market hard. Ethereum, after peaking near $3,500, has dropped to the $3,400 level, reflecting a 1% daily decline. XRP, Dogecoin, Solana, and others experienced similar setbacks. Cryptocurrencies like ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, HBAR, XLM, and DOT registered more substantial losses, with some falling by up to 9% on Thursday. AAVE, ONDO, and HYPE have seen even steeper declines, plummeting by 10%. Meanwhile, the cumulative market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has experienced a significant pullback. On December 25, the total market cap stood at $3.6 trillion, but by the end of the following day, it had dropped to $3.46 trillion, a decrease of over $100 billion, per Coingecko’s recent updates .

December 2024 is shaped up to be pivotal for meme coins, with BTFD Coin (BTFD) igniting frenzy through its 50% festive bonus for investors using the BIG50 gift code, record-breaking presale of over $4.5 million, and a thriving community backing its revolutionary vision. Meanwhile, Bonk (BONK) battles to retain its foothold and Dogwifhat (WIF) stirs whispers of a comeback. This is more than just another month for crypto; it’s an opportunity to position yourself for massive gains. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin, alongside other movers, makes the Top New Meme Coins to Join in December 2024. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Game-Changer in Meme Coins Imagine logging into the BTFD P2E game’s beta version, manoeuvring through thrilling challenges, and knowing you’re part of something massive even before it launches officially. That’s the magic of BTFD Coin—a movement that’s flipping the crypto narrative. Right now, the BTFD Coin presale is offering an insane 50% bonus with the code BIG50, pricing each coin at $0.00013. If you’ve got $1,000 to invest at this stage, you’d bag a whopping 11.53 million BTFD coins. And once the coin lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your stash could multiply to $6,923.08—a jaw-dropping 592.31% ROI. Since its launch, the presale has been a rocket, smashing past $4.5 million in funding. Over 59 billion coins have already been scooped up by more than 6,700 bullish holders. With the presale in Stage 12 and a cap of 16 stages, you’ve got until January 5, 2025, to ride this wave. Beyond the numbers, the BTFD ecosystem is electrifying. Its staking platform offers an average of 90% APY, while its P2E game promises long-term utility and engagement. Though the beta is reward-free, it’s a tantalising glimpse into what’s coming. Built on Ethereum, the project boasts decentralisation, scalability, and unmatched security. Feeling the FOMO yet? To get in on this, visit the BTFD Presale Page . Connect your wallet, and enter BIG50 for the festive bonus Decide on the investment amount Secure your slice of the next big meme coin before it’s too late. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Resilient Meme Hero BONK burst onto the scene two years ago, energising the Solana blockchain with its dog-themed appeal. While 2024 has been rocky, BONK remains a key player, trading at approximately $0.00003185. Its launch strategy—a massive airdrop to Solana users—created a loyal community that continues to drive liquidity across decentralised exchanges. BONK’s trajectory mirrors the volatility of meme coins, but its resilience is commendable. As Solana continues to evolve, BONK’s fate will likely depend on the blockchain’s broader adoption and technological advancements. For those who believe in Solana’s comeback, BONK is an intriguing option this December. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Underdog Making a Comeback WIF’s journey has been a rollercoaster. After peaking at $4.85 in March 2024, the token retraced significantly. Today, it trades at $1.87, but signs of recovery are sparking optimism. Despite setbacks, including a 15% dip in mid-2024 due to whale sell-offs, WIF’s community remains loyal. Its market capitalisation once soared above $4 billion, reflecting its potential to rebound. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about WIF’s future, especially as the new year could bring fresh momentum to Solana-based tokens. Why BTFD Stands Out The 1973 oil crisis reminds us that chaos often hides golden opportunities. Just as Warren Buffett capitalised on market dips back then, BTFD Coin’s presale gives modern investors a shot at replicating that success in crypto. With its presale structure, staking rewards, and community-driven ethos, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a blueprint for turning downturns into upswings. The Final Word December 2024 presents a prime opportunity for meme coin enthusiasts with BTFD Coin, Bonk (BONK), and Dogwifhat (WIF) taking centre stage. BTFD’s 50% festive bonus and record-breaking presale of $4.5 million raised to make it a must-grab for investors aiming for long-term gains. BONK remains a favourite for Solana supporters, showing resilience in a volatile market, while WIF teases a potential revival that has investors intrigued. With BTFD’s presale offering a chance at a 592.31% ROI, it’s clear why it’s the leader among the Top New Meme Coins to Join in December 2024. Don’t wait—join the BTFD Presale today and claim your BIG50 bonus before the window closes on January 5, 2025.

With the crypto world abuzz, investors are hunting for the next big opportunity in meme coins. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has made waves with its Solana launch but faces post-airdrop challenges, while Book of Meme (BOME) battles a Binance delisting. Say hello to BTFD Coin (BTFD), a meme coin primed to soar with its presale success and festive 50% bonus offer. The BTFD presale, which hit $4.5 million in funding, has reached Stage 12, offering a golden entry point for investors who know the value of buying the dip. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already live and staking rewards in full swing, BTFD is setting a new standard in the meme coin market. But what makes these coins so enticing? Let’s dive deeper into each project. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Bull Market Catalyst Imagine a world where every dip is an opportunity rather than a setback. That’s the ethos behind BTFD Coin, inspired by the legendary market crashes like 1973’s financial turmoil. With its rallying cry of “ Buy the Dip ,” BTFD offers a unique combination of community-driven innovation, strategic planning, and irresistible presale perks. The P2E game’s beta version is already live, offering players a sneak peek into what’s to come—though rewards are not yet available, the excitement is palpable. Beyond gaming, BTFD’s staking feature boasts an average APY of 90%, rewarding investors for their long-term commitment. The presale’s 12th stage has already sold over 59 billion coins, raising more than $4.5 million. Investors can purchase $BTFD at just $0.00013, and a whopping 50% bonus offer, with the special code BIG50. With a listing price of $0.0006, the potential ROI exceeds 592.31%. To put it into perspective, a $1,350 investment today could multiply to nearly $9,346.15 at the listing price. The presale ends on January 5, 2025, so time is of the essence. Want in? Here’s how: Visit the BTFD Presale Page. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter the code BIG50 and apply. Specify your purchase amount and confirm the transaction. Add to this an enticing referral program offering 10% rewards, and it’s clear that BTFD is more than just a meme coin—it’s a movement. Pudgy Penguins: A Solana-Based Success with Challenges Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) entered the Solana blockchain with high hopes and a community-centric vision. Its initial airdrop rewarded early supporters, distributing 88.88 billion tokens with 25.9% allocated to the Pudgy Penguins community. The excitement pushed PENGU’s price up by 500%, hitting an all-time high of $0.06845. However, post-airdrop sell-offs have dampened its momentum. The token’s price now sits at approximately $0.0273, a steep decline of over 50% from its peak. Despite this, Pudgy Penguins remain a force to reckon with. Its market capitalisation of $1.7 billion places it among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, and its NFT project continues to captivate collectors. Plans for multi-chain expansion to Ethereum and Abstract could reinvigorate PENGU’s growth. For now, though, volatility remains a concern, with investors cautiously optimistic about its long-term prospects. Book of Meme: Navigating Liquidity Concerns Book of Meme (BOME) has carved out its niche as a meme coin with a focus on community engagement. Trading at $0.0061, BOME boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $145 million and a market cap of $421 million. However, Binance’s recent decision to delist the BOME/BTC trading pair has raised questions about its liquidity and future stability. The delisting, effective December 27, 2024, comes at a critical juncture. While it’s a setback, BOME’s loyal community continues to rally behind the project, emphasising its potential for growth despite challenges. As the market adapts, BOME’s ability to weather volatility will determine its place in the meme coin ecosystem. Conclusion In today’s volatile crypto market, opportunities abound for those willing to take calculated risks. Based on our analysis, BTFD Coin stands out as the top pick among meme coin presales to buy today. Its festive BIG50 bonus, thriving community, and innovative features like the P2E game and staking rewards make it a compelling choice. Pudgy Penguins and Book of Meme also offer unique opportunities, albeit with challenges. For investors seeking the next big thing, BTFD’s presale is a golden chance to capitalise on the chaos. Don’t miss your opportunity—join the BTFD Coin presale now and turn the dip into your launchpad for success!

From the U.S. approval of spot bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds to the burgeoning number of companies pledging to buy the largest cryptocurrency for their treasuries, crypto has entered, more than ever before, the mainstream conversation. Bitcoin has increased almost 130% this year, breaking record highs on several occasions. It is currently hovering near the psychological threshold of $100,000. The ETFs approved in January have seen net inflows of $36 billion and amassed over 1 million BTC. In addition, the number of publicly traded companies saying they're adding bitcoin to their corporate treasury is accelerating. The trend, which started with MicroStrategy (MSTR) in 2020, recently attracted KULR Technology (KULR), a maker of energy storage products for the space and defense industries. The Houston, Texas-based company said it bought 217.18 BTC for $21 million and is allocating up to 90% of the surplus to cash to BTC. Now Bitwise Asset Management, which already has spot bitcoin and ether ETFs, has applied for an exchange-traded fund to track the shares of companies that hold at least 1,000 BTC in treasury. Other requirements for the fund, dubbed Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, are a market capitalization of at least $100 million, a minimum average daily liquidity of at least $1 million and a public free float of less than 10%, according to the Dec. 26 filing. A second Thursday filing was made by Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, a politician in the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The Bitcoin Bond ETF seeks exposure through derivative instruments such as MicroStrategy's convertible securities in an actively managed ETF. The bonds have been a massive success. The 0% coupon bond maturing in 2027 is priced at 150% above par and has outperformed bitcoin since inception. ""Since our inception, Strive has called out the long-term investment risks caused by the global fiat debt crisis, inflation, and geopolitical tensions,"" Strive CEO Matt Cole told CoinDesk. ""We strongly believe there is no better long-term investment to hedge against these risks than thoughtful exposure to bitcoin."" ""Strive's first of many planned bitcoin solutions will democratize access to bitcoin bonds, which are bonds issued by corporations to purchase bitcoin. We believe these bonds provide attractive risk-return exposure to bitcoin, yet they are not available to be purchased by most investors,"" he added.",Markets|Bitcoin|ETF|Bitwise,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-27 15:16:41

For the first time, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) is letting commercial banks and payment companies handle stablecoins and other cryptos backed by real-world assets. But if you’re a Bitcoin or Ether enthusiast, don’t get excited. Those are still banned, and the government isn’t budging on that. This step was announced on December 27 after a directive was issued the day before. This new law gives stablecoins a green light but comes with a truckload of conditions. Financial institutions have to play by the NBC’s rules. Cambodia’s messy history with crypto Cambodia has always been allergic to crypto. Before now, trading them was straight-up illegal. Officials blamed it on risks like money laundering, scams, and shady black-market dealings. These coins have been public enemy number one for years. But it’s not like they didn’t notice the global crypto boom. As crypto gained traction worldwide, the NBC decided it needed to catch up without losing control. Enter the prakas of December —a measured, tightly regulated approach to crypto adoption. The decentralized nature of cryptos makes them a nightmare for regulation, taxation, and tracking. Still, he admitted banks could rake in revenue through user fees if they jump into crypto. Back in 2020, the NBC launched Bakong, its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Bakong was meant to reduce the country’s dependence on the US dollar and give people a local, digital payment system. By late 2024, Bakong allegedly had 200,000 active users and had processed 1.4 million transactions worth $500 million. But this year alone, the government blocked access to 16 major crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, because they didn’t have proper licenses. And yet, Cambodia ranks in the top 20 countries globally for retail crypto use per capita. Around 70% of transactions happen through centralized exchanges, proving that Cambodians are finding ways to embrace crypto, even with all the red tape. Statista estimates Cambodia’s crypto market will generate $8 million in revenue by the end of 2024. However, growth is expected to slow down in 2025 as regulations tighten and competition from global players ramps up. The challenges of crypto in Cambodia It’s not all smooth sailing for Cambodia’s crypto experiment. The government’s strict rules come from a place of fear. The UN Office on Drugs & Crime has actually flagged Cambodia as a hotspot for crypto scams. There’s also a massive knowledge gap. The NBC has stressed the importance of public education about crypto risks, but that’s easier said than done. Without proper awareness, Cambodians continue to fall victim to scams. And then there’s the infrastructure problem. While Bakong set the stage for digital payments, it’s not enough. Platforms like Royal Group Exchange (RGX) are still in the early stages, operating under a regulatory sandbox set up by the Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia (SERC). The sandbox allows companies to test services under close government supervision, but scaling these efforts will take time, money, and trust. For now, the NBC seems content to stick with stablecoins.

However, this has not deterred analysts from sharing ultra-bullish targets for the coin. Popular chart analyst EGRAG Crypto eyes an explosive rally to $27 historic highs in this market cycle based on a key technical setup. Historical Pattern Hints At $27 XRP Price EGRAG Crypto noted in a Dec. 26 X post that XRP has crossed the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over a two-week timeframe, suggesting a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. When this happened in 2017, XRP saw a 50,000% price jump. If history repeats itself, the analyst projected that the coin could climb to $27, representing a 4,770% price increase. When compared to the 2017 mega upsurge, a pump to the $27 level would be just around 10% of the meteoric growth witnessed back then. EGRAG Crypto voiced confidence that the Ripple-promoted token would reach this price point, citing the coin’s stratospheric price action back in 2017. Notably, the XRP price has successfully held above the psychologically important $2 level despite the latest market catastrophe. The next resistance for XRP lies at $2.60, a decisive break above it would set the stage for a surge past its current lifetime high of $3.84 and beyond. XRP’s historic record fuels anticipation for a repeat of its previous achievements amid heightened adoption. Upcoming SEC Leadership Shakeup, Potential XRP ETFs To Boost XRP Price Industry commentators have been optimistic that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally settle with Ripple following Donald Trump’s victory against Kamala Harris in the November 2024 presidential elections. This could be a watershed moment, marking the conclusion of the multi-year-long courtroom showdown. Pundits and investors alike have high expectations for upcoming Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins. XRP has already gained over 300% since Trump’s electoral win , with experts anticipating an extended upsurge. Moreover, there’s been an increasing demand for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following the resounding success of similar products based on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Some popular asset managers such as Bitwise , Canary Capital , 21Shares , and WisdomTree have already filed paperwork with the SEC for an investment vehicle offering direct XRP exposure. The anticipated approval of XRP ETFs for listing on Wall Street could spark renewed interest, propelling the price of XRP to double digits. In October, Garlinghouse said he believes greenlighting of XRP ETFs is “inevitable.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 15:21:37

No one ever managed to come close. But the tables turned in 2022. For the first time ever, Solana ($SOL) has managed to beat both in multiple areas. $SOL experienced an all-time low in 2022 with the collapse of FTX. Since then its value grew by 2,000%. As per a Glassnode report , in the 727 days since the FTX collapse, $SOL outperformed both $BTC and $ETH on 344 days. Similarly, in that timeframe, $SOL has witnessed more capital inflow than both $BTC and $ETH. One of the biggest reasons behind this sudden growth is the increase in meme coin activity on the Solana blockchain. $SOL powers all these meme coin transactions. This means that demand for Solana-based meme coins pushes demand for $SOL, which took its value to an all-time high of $263 earlier this year. But $SOL Is Down 22% So Far. What Does This Mean? Despite outperforming both $BTC and $ETH, $SOL’s price has been on a consistent decline since early December. Today alone its price went down by 3.6%. One of the biggest reasons for that are the limitations of the Solana mainnet. It wasn’t ready to handle the sudden surge in traffic, which led to congestion and slower transactions. This is where Solaxy comes in – a new layer-2 scaling solution for Solana that addresses all the problems of the main network. Simply put, it aims to offload part of the transactions from Solana to reduce network congestion. Investors will also enjoy lower trading fees thanks to faster processing. Is Solaxy’s New Token Worth Investing In? Solaxy’s Layer-2 network also introduces a new token called $SOLX. The token is currently on presale and has already raised more than $6.2M. One $SOLX is currently available at $0.001582. However, the price will increase gradually before we’ll see the token on exchanges. This means there will be no lower entry point into Solaxy’s ecosystem than now. While there’s no way to guarantee gains in the crypto market, analysts expect $SOLX to explode at least 10x . Some industry experts go as far as to speculate that $SOLX might be the next 100x token owing to its early momentum. However, it’s a little too soon to say that with confidence. A Solaxy Full of Opportunities To join the $SOLX presale, visit the official Solaxy website, connect your wallet, and pay with $ETH, $BNB, or $USDT. You can also pay with a bank card, but the transaction fee might be higher. Remember, always do your own research before putting your hard-earned money in any meme coin. Diversify your portfolio (indexes like $MEMEX can help you in this) and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.",Altcoin News|Crypto News,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-27 15:24:47

Meanwhile, the current trend suggests the buyers have been facing extreme exhaustion at the moment, which suggests the yearly close may not be as bullish as expected. However, these three altcoins, AVAX, FTM, & ONDO, are expected to trigger a massive rise in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction 2025 The Avalanche price has been trading within a decisive phase after it faced a rejection from the highs above $140. Meanwhile, the bulls managed to hold the rally above the crucial support and as a result, the token has advanced towards the end of its consolidation. Now that the token has reached the final phase of 2025, a significant shift in the market trend could occur. The AVAX price failed to surpass the resistance of the decisive triangle but after a small retracement, the price has triggered a rebound. Besides, the weekly Gaussian channel has turned bullish after a small bearish trend. Therefore, the AVAX price could maintain an ascending consolidation and breach above the upper resistance.Mainly because the RSI has been trading within a recovery curve and is yet to reach the upper threshold. Therefore, the price is expected to rise high and reach levels above $160 to $170 during H1 2025. Ondo (ONDO) Price Prediction 2025 The Ondo price faced a significant upswing in the first few days of November, which has printed consecutive higher highs and lows. The latest rebound from the rising support of the expanding channel indicates the bulls are vigilant and hence are defending the support. However, the technicals do not offer a bullish confirmation. Therefore, this rebound could be another fake-out, trapping the bulls as the correction does not appear to have reached the end. The price has entered the pivotal support range between $1.44 and $1.5 and a rise above the upper range could trigger a decent upswing. Meanwhile, the technicals remain bearish as the RSI forms constant lower highs and lows and MACD displays a rise in the selling pressure. Therefore, th ONDO price is believed to break the current support zone and eventually test the immediate support at $1.28. A rebound may be expected if RSI reaches the oversold zone; otherwise, a drop to $1.077 could also be possible. However, a rebound from this range may attract fresh buying volume that may eventually help the price reclaim the lost levels and push the price to the pivotal resistance zone between $1.94 and $1.99. Fantom (FTM) Price Prediction 2025 The Fantom price is about to test the average bands of the rising parallel channel after facing rejection from the interim highs at $1.44. While the market participants may expect a rebound, the bears appear to be preparing for a wider correction. On the other hand, the token is about to undergo the very first Golden Cross in the weekly time frame. Hence, the token remains within a decisive phase as the price continues to face enough bearish pressure. The weekly MACD displays a drop in the buying pressure while the levels are about to undergo a bearish crossover. This indicates a potential pullback to the interim support just below $0.8 that may delay the Golden Cross for a while. After the selling volume exhausts, the price could trigger a rebound and march towards the upper resistance. However, a breakout from the channel could occur only if the bulls manage to mount enough pressure over the token; otherwise, the price may remain consolidated within a range for an extended price action.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|MARKET|TRADING|ONDO,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-27 15:28:43

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,200 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are due to explode over the coming weeks. According to Sherpa, one catalyst that will drive the altcoin rally is the fact that many of them have been capitulating for a long time. “Coins like [privacy-focused] Oasis (ROSE) chopped around for YEARS and are still consolidating. Hard to think these won’t fully send.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Sherpa further says that the layer-1 blockchain Tron ( TRX ) is another good example of an altcoin that underwent consolidation for years before it skyrocketed recently. “So I expect something extremely strong for the next run here for these shitcoins because of how long they consolidated for. Not saying they’ll necessarily all hit or go past former all-time highs, but let’s see.” The analyst also cites other reasons that fuel his bullish stance, such as Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dominance level and the macro-environment. “People call me bearish but I’m not bearish at all – I think that we’re going to have an incredible altcoin season in the coming months. This is due to several reasons (seasonality, Bitcoin dominance [at a] high, insane macro + government [environment], etc).” On when to potentially take profits, Sherpa says , “You don’t necessarily have to sell now; I don’t think it’s needed yet. We should have a great time in January/February. But if you mentally prepare yourself now, you will be more willing and able to sell later on, when you’re blinded by greed and insane gains.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, this move is into the company’s vision for censorship-resistant systems in view of an increasingly volatile geopolitical and economic environment. “The need for resilient technology to safeguard our freedoms has never been more important,” said Ardoino in a statement to the press. This is part of USDT plans to further diversify its product portfolio beyond stablecoins, ensuring relevance and leadership in a fast-changing financial world. Expansion of Avenues in Tokenized Assets Tether has been trying to discover new ways to increase its involvement in the digital finance ecosystem . For example, its Hadron platform lets businesses and governments tokenize real-world assets such as securities and stocks. Tether also funded a $45-million crude oil transaction with USDT and has offered a boron-backed token to the Turkish government. The company made headlines with a $775 million investment in Rumble, a video-sharing platform noted for its emphasis on free speech. Rumble has since embraced cryptocurrency by sanctioning up to $20 million for Bitcoin purchases, a move that underlines the platform’s alignment with USDT principles of decentralized innovation. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Stake and Political Implications In one major development, financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald acquired a 5% stake in Tether for $600 million. The sale could grant USDT even more political clout since Cantor CEO Howard Lutnick recently became U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary. Lutnick’s political sway may prove crucial as USDT continues to face regulatory scrutiny. US authorities have been investigating allegations that Tether’s USDT stablecoin was used in illicit activities, including terrorism financing. Despite these challenges, Tether’s leadership remains optimistic. Giancarlo Devasini, Tether’s largest shareholder, expressed confidence in Lutnick’s ability to address regulatory concerns effectively. Tether wants to be at the helm of blockchain innovation, venturing into tokenized assets and free-speech platforms to forge partnerships with influential entities. These bold moves have the potential to shape the course of the company against emerging competition and scrutiny.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|USDT,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-27 15:34:00

Tether (USDT) is the biggest stablecoin, and it is considered ideal for crypto transactions due to its value being pegged to the dollar. However, the same stablecoin could possibly trigger a crypto market crash. Will Tether Ban Result In Crypto Market Crash? Tether’s failure to adhere to Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations is putting the stablecoin in major trouble. According to MiCA standards, stablecoins like Tether require an e-money license to trade on crypto exchanges. However, USDT missed its timeline, making it prone to the Tether Ban in Europe, resulting in its delisting from many crypto exchanges on December 30, 2024. This Tether news could impact the crypto market for the worse due to this digital assets position in the market. It is the third biggest crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum and has a market capitalization of $139.28 Billion. Additionally, Tether is the most widely held asset which will be heavily impacted by this step. Notably, this delisting could create major liquidity issues, which could create crypto crash-like situations, especially with the investor’s sentiments already moving away from greed. This delisting will also impact the crypto’s USDT pair trades, crypto transactions, and crypto trade fees. Eventually, this could bring a liquidity drought and a crypto market crash. Most importantly, this will reduce its market dominance, which is slowly rebounding after hitting March support. However, the reduction could help in the Bitcoin price rally as there’s a negative correlation between the two. Tether Is Like A Ticking Bomb Besides the Tether news of the ban, financial analyst, Jason brought everyone’s attention to minting hold of the Tether. According to his recent X post, Jason has revealed the fact that Tether has not minted anything for over two weeks. More importantly, he has called the Tether the glue to the crypto market but also a ticking bomb that is going to explode with the Tether bans and exchange delisting. Interestingly, this is nothing new for the Tether, as it still dominates the market despite its ban in multiple jurisdictions, but criticism follows it. Justin Bons called Tether a $118B scam , whereas Jason Calcanis, a popular VC, called it the standard for the darkest transaction. He even questioned its functioning, as it has not passed any major firm’s audit. However, in contrast, the Tether CEO showed enthusiasm despite the crypto drama, posting, “Tether Fud = Rocket sticker.” Moreover, in Jacob’s Tickling Bomb post, he shared his insights as: – Jason has either the understanding of the world of a donkey trying to use a microwave to warm up some soup or just jealous that Tether is not owned by his buddies. What Tether Ban Means For Crypto Investors? The massive impact of the Tether Ban will be visible to European investors, which will be left out of the features of the biggest stablecoin of the crypto market. Moreover, the crypto exchanges could also face challenges and liquidity issues with this step. However, the rest of the world will see an impact, where a crypto market crash-like situation could arise with the delisting of USDT on December 30. Amid this Tether news, critics have also presented their views on the stablecoin, questioning its lack of audits and calling it a $118B scam. However, the Tether CEO has still shown enthusiasm, calling all the FUD the bullish signal for their token.

Ripple ( XRP ) price was trading at $2.2 after falling 25% from its highest point this year, meaning it remains in a bear market. One of the biggest XRP catalysts is the rising optimism that the SEC will approve a spot Ripple ETF in 2025. Companies like Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree have already submitted their XRP ETF proposals. There are rising odds that other companies like Fidelity, Blackrock, and Ark Invest will file their XRP ETFs because of its scale and their success in Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Blackrock has accumulated over $52 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and $3.54 billion in Ethereum ( ETH ) funds.

The hopes for a Ripple ETF rose after Donald Trump won the general election in November. He has already nominated Paul Atkins to be the next SEC chair , a move that will introduce major regulatory changes. Analysts expect a few major ETF approvals in 2024. The XRP price will likely do well as the XRP Ledger and the RLUSD stablecoin continue to gain market share. According to CoinMarketCap , the RLUSD has gained over $53 million in market cap a few weeks after launch. XRP price forecast XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Ripple price peaked at $2.90 in December and has retreated by 25% from its highest point this year. It has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that the uptrend is continuing. Most importantly, the XRP price is in a consolidation mode and is forming a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern, which can take a few days or weeks to form, comprises a vertical line, a flag pole, and a symmetrical triangle. It will be confirmed that the ripple’s pennant remains inside the two triangle sides. Therefore, the XRP token will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the next few weeks as ETF odds rise. If this happens, the next key level to watch will be at $2.90, the highest point this year, which is about 35% above the current level. A surge above that price will push it to $3 and potentially to $5.

One noteworthy project everyone is flocking to is Remittix (RTX) – a presale star that has gained the title “XLM Killer.” This is because of its unique strategy and great potential in the cross-border payments market. Many experts even foresee this rookie being the next 10x altcoin in 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Dips, but Analyst Makes a Bold Price Prediction Solana (SOL) is one of the best cryptos in the market. However, it has recently seen a slight price dip. According to CoinMarketCap , the price of Solana has fallen over 20% in the past 30 days. Its value moved between nearly $250 and around $190. However, crypto analyst The Moon Show remains optimistic for the future of Solana (SOL). In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin has retested a massive triangle on the weekly chart. He put a medium-term target of $330 as a Solana price prediction. The technicals for the Solana coin back up this claim. Currently, TradingView shows that this altcoin is valued above its 200-day EMA ($175) and has a momentum indicator of -25, which is in the buy zone. These indicators show that this altcoin could see a bullish upswing again. But while its price consolidates, many investors are looking at Remittix for fast returns instead. Remittix (RTX) Earns the “XLM Killer” Name in Ongoing Crypto ICO Event While Solana (SOL) is experiencing some turbulence right now, Remittix (RTX) is making a name for itself. It is positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of the cross-border payments market, which Mordor Intelligence predicts may be worth $295B by 2029. In fact, some investors look at Remittix as the XLM Killer as it could challenge its dominance and other traditional banking systems, too. To accomplish this, Remittix will launch a unique crypto-to-fiat network that will let traders instantly convert over 40 crypto coins into Fiat currencies, which are then sent to any bank account. Thanks to this aspect, Remittix is already rivaling Stripe or Wise, which do not offer this feature. Plus, these transactions will come with a flat fee, as there are no hidden costs. Those looking to support this project are now buying its native token, RTX. Currently, this altcoin costs only $0.0163, which is the starting price of its presale. But, as the presale advances, more price pumps will come. The next stage will cause a jump to $0.0167 – a 3% return for all those who buy it now. A Tier-1 CEX listing this crypto coin could also trigger a massive pump to $0.10. Therefore, investors consider RTX one of the altcoins to watch for fast returns. Can Remittix (RTX) Become the Next Big Thing Like Solana (SOL)? Although Solana (SOL) has become one of the top crypto coins that could rebound soon, experts claim Remittix (RTX) could be the next star in this space. Its groundbreaking technology will redefine the future of cross-border payments and its great growth potential could make early buyers very wealthy. Its smaller market cap also signals faster price growth with less money needed. Therefore, many experts consider RTX the next potential 10x altcoin in 2025.

38188391,https://finbold.com/?p=223502,1735314417,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Bitcoin price prediction for 2025,https://finbold.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-for-2025/,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw explosive momentum starting in early November. By December 4, the leading cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high — closing above $100,000 for the first time in history. However, in mid-December, the Federal Reserve announced that it would only make two rate cuts in 2025. Both the stock market and the cryptocurrency market saw an immediate pullback — on December 20, as much as $310 billion in value stored in digital assets was erased. Things have improved somewhat since then — BTC has not reclaimed the $100,000 mark as of press time, but it has retraced back to approximately $96,240. Over the course of the last 7 trading days, Bitcoin has seen prices increase by just 0.78% — with year-to-date (YTD) returns standing at 128.02%. BTC price weekly and YTD charts. Source: Finbold On the whole, cryptocurrency researchers and analysts remain bullish — but this recent macro-induced shock has brought a renewed wave of concern that the premier digital asset could see a steep correction before resuming its upward trajectory. Analysts have largely turned bearish on BTC — at least in the short term There’s no denying that an abundance of bearish signals are present — but the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin’s recent upswing are still in place. First, let’s deal with the negatives. Over 33,000 BTC, worth a grand total of roughly $3.23 billion , has been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges over the past week. Historically, such moves have preceded large-scale liquidations on the part of crypto whales — and while not definitive, this is yet another bearish signal. Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez recently compiled a shortlist of analyst forecasts — most of which are quite bearish, and predict a drop (albeit a short-term one) to prices between $60,000 and $70,000. #Bitcoin $BTC will CRASH to $60,000!!! At least, that's what some of the most renowned analysts are saying. Let's dive in 👇🧵 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 26, 2024 Noted cryptocurrency technical analyst RLinda outlined both a bullish and bearish case — per the analysis provided in a December 25 TradingView post , a consolidation above $99,000 would most likely see BTC prices surge to $104,000. BTC price chart with predictions. Source: RLinda on TradingView In contrast, if the charts on the shorter timeframes keep printing lower lows, the asset could once again plummet to the recent low of $92,000. Bullish signals for BTC are still present Even once we take into account that the ATH price could not hold, BTC has still outperformed 75% of the top 100 crypto assets in a 1-year period. The leading digital asset is currently trading above its 200-day simple moving average, indicating that the uptrend is still in play. At present, the level of support sits at roughly $92,143 — in contrast, a resistance level of $100,188 would have to be breached for a renewed rally. While moves to the downside like the ones seen in the past few weeks are worrying, outsized returns and increasing institutional adoption will most likely win out in the end. In essence, no new bearish catalysts specific to Bitcoin have sprung up — meaning that there is no particular reason to see recent price action as anything but a relatively expected reaction to macroeconomic factors.

Killing two birds with one stone, he contended that the immigration of only highly qualified foreign workers to the US could save Silicon Valley. Musk wrote on his social platform X, “The number of people who are super talented engineers and super motivated in the USA is far too low. ” Many people, especially native Americans, were not happy with his statement. To that end, he further explained, “Of course, my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans, and we do, as that is much easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process however, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.” “I'm extremely pro-immigrant. I believe we need a greatly expanded legal immigration system. We should let anyone in the country who is hardworking and honest and will be a contributor to the US.” — Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/N0PmKQUOFi — Dima Zeniuk (@DimaZeniuk) October 17, 2024 Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) partner Vivek Ramaswamy similarly argued there are too few competitive U.S.-born engineering candidates, suggesting it’s a cultural issue. D.O.G.E’s new initiative has calmed many immigrants down, as it seems that America is giving them a chance. However, many Americans’ employment is threatened. From anti-immigrant to pro-immigrant? Only for Silicon Valley Musk’s views come as some immigration hardliners have expressed concern about President-elect Trump’s choice of Indian-American venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan for an adviser position for AI in the new administration. Krishnan has previously pushed Musk, who is close to Trump and would chair the Department of Government Efficiency, to convince the president to lift the bar on green cards for highly talented individuals born in other countries. Source: X David Sacks, who Trump tapped as White House AI and cryptocurrency czar, defended Krishnan’s view in an X post. He said, “Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. In fact, he wants to make the program entirely merit-based.” Elon Musk replied to the conversation, asserting, “Makes sense.” However, Laura Loomer, a fervent Trump supporter, slammed Krishnan’s appointment. She claimed that he wanted to lift green card limitations for foreign students. She argued that foreigners would take jobs that should be given to American STEM students. She added, “It’s alarming to see the number of career leftists who are now being appointed to serve in Trump’s admin when they share views that are in direct opposition to Trump’s America First agenda.” Trump prepares to execute an ambitious and contentious immigration strategy. It includes mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and potentially naturalized citizens. This makes the discussion of Silicon Valley’s employment practices timely. Musk and Ramaswamy have both expressed their support for Trump’s immigration policies. Silicon Valley’s national security shift under Trump’s administration Eight years ago, nobody in Silicon Valley backed Donald Trump. However, Trump and his party appear to have made inroads in Silicon Valley in recent years. Several tech executives who had previously supported Democrats endorsed Trump’s presidential campaign this year. In addition to his number one supporter, Musk, many of Trump’s Silicon Valley nominees backed his campaign, demonstrating the president-elect’s willingness to reward loyalty in his new administration. Silicon Valley is rapidly going down upon Washington as tech leaders assume significant roles in President-elect Trump’s second term, both officially and unofficially. For status, David Sacks, a venture capitalist, was appointed by President Trump earlier this month to serve as the White House administrator of AI and crypto. This position is responsible for directing the administration’s policy on these two technologies. Also, Trump appointed Jacob Helberg, a senior consultant to Palantir Technologies’ CEO, as Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment. In addition, Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and close colleague of venture capitalist Peter Thiel, will become the administration’s deputy secretary of Health and Human Services. Trump is reportedly contemplating the appointment of Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, to the position of chief research and engineering officer at the Defense Department. Still, Trae Stephens, co-founder of Anduril, has been considered for a position at the Pentagon. Trump’s allies are now this consistent procession of Silicon Valley titans. This ensures the companies involved enjoy several advantages. For example, the US government will be hesitant to impose excessive restrictions on the development of AI. This is if it increasingly perceives its dominance in technologies as a national security issue of almost existential strategic importance. Indeed, under the new Trump administration, more deregulation is likely. However, there is reason to be concerned about the rising synergy between Silicon Valley elements and the national security apparatus. Also, the implications for future technological growth, tensions with China, and the intertwining of military and economic power. Silicon Valley’s rising securitization will have an impact on the types of breakthroughs that emerge from the technology sector. Technologies designed for the military, such as drones and surveillance tools, tend to make their way into civilian life. Potentially, it could introduce new, increasingly dangerous technology.

In the latest economic outlook report, economists predict that core inflation, a key measure closely watched by the Fed, could fall below its 2% target at some point in 2025. But this improvement in inflation is expected to coincide with an increase in the unemployment rate, which is projected to rise to 4.4% or higher by the end of 2025. With inflation falling and unemployment rising, the Fed could respond with aggressive rate cuts that exceed current market expectations. The report suggests the Fed could cut interest rates by more than the 35 basis points currently expected by U.S. money markets. The optimal federal funds rate could be as low as 3.3%, Paidenreiger’s analysis suggests, which would require at least four rate cuts in 2025. Related News: Terra (LUNA) Founder Do Kwon's Fate Finally Certain - Here's What Happens Next The Fed has already begun cutting interest rates, cutting its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point in each of its three meetings since September. But central bankers have signaled a slower pace of cuts going forward. According to the Fed’s latest economic projections, policymakers expect to cut interest rates by just three-quarters of a percentage point through 2024. The forecasts underscore the delicate balancing act the Fed faces as it navigates a cooling economy. While getting inflation under control remains a priority, rising unemployment poses a challenge for policymakers aiming to maintain economic stability. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents Lightchain AI smarter alternative for long-term growth Why XRP traders are switching to Lightchain AI Comparing XRP and Lightchain AI Smarter path forward Ripple’s XRP has long been a favorite for traders seeking exposure to fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. However, as the cryptocurrency market matures, investors are increasingly shifting focus to projects offering greater innovation, utility, and long-term growth potential. Lightchain AI, a blockchain platform merging artificial intelligence and decentralized technology, is quickly gaining traction as a smarter alternative for traders looking to build sustainable portfolios.

Its main points are help close to fast deals with low costs making it great for worldwide trades. Ripple’s links with banks and payment firms also gives trust to XRP’s system, while its place as a top coin makes sure of wide-knownness and big trading amounts But, XRP isn’t without some limits. Ongoing legal fights with the SEC brings about unclear rules, casting doubt on its long term future? Also, its use is mostly stuck to payments which limits it’s chance for growth in other spots. While efficient, XRP lacks the transformative features found in newer blockchain projects, leading to concerns about stagnant innovation. Despite its strengths in payment-focused use cases, these limitations have driven some traders to explore more versatile and unique options, such as Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI smarter alternative for long-term growth Lightchain AI is setting a new standard for long-term growth by blending blockchain and artificial intelligence into a versatile ecosystem. Unlike traditional crypto projects, LCAI offers practical utilities such as the meme coin Launchpad, which empowers creators to monetize and innovate securely.

However, warning signs suggest that XRP/USD could face a short-term correction, potentially erasing at least 25% of its recent gains. Descending Triangle Pattern Signals Potential Breakdown XRP’s recent losses coincide with its price movement within a descending triangle pattern, a bearish structure that often predicts further declines. This pattern is marked by lower highs forming a descending trendline, while $2.10 serves as horizontal support. A breakdown below this support level could lead to a deeper correction, with the potential downside target calculated by subtracting the triangle’s height from the breakdown point. Analysts predict XRP’s price could fall to approximately $1.64 in January 2025, representing a 25% drop from current levels. Whale Activity Suggests Distribution Sentiment On-chain data highlights bearish trends, with whale addresses showing signs of distribution. The supply held by addresses with over 1 million XRP tokens has decreased by 180 million since early December. Similarly, addresses holding 100,000 XRP have reduced their holdings by 170 million. This reduction aligns with XRP’s 26% price decline from its local high of $2.90. Large-scale selling by whales can increase token supply in circulation, exerting downward pressure on prices. Rising Reserves on Binance Indicate Bearish Sentiment XRP reserves on Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, have steadily increased since mid-December. This trend often signals bearish sentiment, as rising reserves typically precede price corrections. Combined with the descending triangle pattern and on-chain whale activity, XRP may face challenges in sustaining its bullish momentum. While the long-term outlook for XRP remains uncertain, traders should prepare for potential short-term volatility.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 15:53:00

Shibarium, its upcoming Layer-2 solution, aims to improve transaction speed and reduce fees, making the token more practical for everyday use. Additionally, ShibaSwap continues to expand its utility within the network.

Are you ready for $DOGE?” Dogecoin is following a familiar trajectory, mirroring its 2017 and 2021 movements, where sharp corrections led to explosive rallies. The recent TD Sequential indicator flashing a buy signal has bolstered optimism. Analysts speculate DOGE could rally by up to 5,000%, potentially reaching $18 if it replicates past performance. This Dogecoin prediction highlights the token’s enduring popularity and potential for exponential growth. As history suggests, DOGE remains a favorite for those anticipating the next market surge.

Dogecoin’s legacy faces a challenge as Lightchain AI emerges with smart utility and real-world solutions, capturing investors’ attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin legacy of popularity Lightchain AI innovation meets real-world utility Why investors can’t ignore Lightchain AI Lightchain AI’s roadmap to success Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the leader of memecoins, known for its community-driven charm and viral popularity. However, as the crypto market evolves, many investors are turning their attention to projects that offer real utility and long-term growth potential. Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale , a blockchain initiative that merges artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized technology. This presale has caught the eye of savvy investors, positioning Lightchain AI as a compelling alternative to Dogecoin. Here’s why this emerging project is generating so much buzz. Dogecoin legacy of popularity Dogecoin began as a fun test in money made online, using web trends to get big notice. Over time, it has made a loyal group and got wide attention, all due to its ease and cheap price. Dogecoin’s charm is in its community-based win, power͏ed by local help and popular pushes. Its small cost per token has turned it into an easy start for new backers, while famous people backing it and news stories have kept it seen by many. But, Dogecoin has many problems. Its main use as a payment token gives few real uses and its worth is very tied to how people feel about it making it weak to sharp changes. Additionally, unlike more recent projects, Dogecoin lacks technological advancements or a clear long-term roadmap, which has led to stagnant innovation. While Dogecoin continues to thrive on community enthusiasm, its limited functionality creates opportunities for alternatives like Lightchain AI to attract investor interest. Lightchain AI innovation meets real-world utility Lightchain AI (LCAI) is setting new benchmarks by seamlessly merging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to deliver real-world applications. Its ecosystem empowers industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain management with decentralized solutions tailored for efficiency and scalability. The platform’s Memecoin Launchpad offers a secure and AI-driven environment for creativity, enabling users to monetize ideas within the meme economy. Decentralized governance ensures that decisions are community-driven, fostering inclusivity and fairness. Lightchain AI’s robust infrastructure supports real-time applications, while its focus on sustainability positions it as a future-proof solution in the evolving blockchain landscape. With its versatile approach and strategic roadmap, LCAI demonstrates immense potential to transform industries, making it a standout project in the blockchain and AI sectors. Why investors can’t ignore Lightchain AI 1. Real-world applications Dogecoin’s utility as a payment token is limited, whereas Lightchain AI addresses challenges in industries like healthcare, logistics, and AI development. Its AIVM offers developers a platform to create AI-powered solutions, expanding its use cases far beyond the cryptocurrency market. 2. Sustainable growth Dogecoin’s unlimited supply creates inflationary pressure, limiting its ability to sustain value. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s deflationary tokenomics reduce supply over time, aligning incentives for long-term holders. 3. Early-stage opportunity With its presale price set at $0.003, Lightchain AI offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors. Early adoption could lead to exponential returns as the project gains traction and adoption. 4. Diversification beyond meme coins While Dogecoin is rooted in its meme coin status, Lightchain AI appeals to investors seeking utility and technological advancement. Its focus on solving real-world problems makes it a diversified addition to any portfolio.

Ecosystem growth: Partnerships with businesses and institutions to expand use cases and adoption.

New contender for crypto investors While Dogecoin remains a symbol of community-driven success, its limitations in utility make it less appealing for investors seeking long-term growth. Lightchain AI , with its focus on real-world applications, deflationary tokenomics, and groundbreaking technology, offers a forward-thinking alternative with immense potential for investors.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-27 16:13:00
