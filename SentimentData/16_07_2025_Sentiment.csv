Bitcoin, the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, has long been lauded for its robust cryptographic foundations. Yet, as technological advancements accelerate, new challenges emerge on the horizon. One such formidable challenge is the advent of quantum computing. Imagine a machine so powerful it could potentially unravel the very cryptographic algorithms that secure our digital lives. It sounds like science fiction, but the threat is real, and proactive minds are already at work. This is precisely why Jameson Lopp, a highly respected co-founder of Casa and a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has unveiled a groundbreaking proposal aimed at fortifying Bitcoin against this looming quantum threat. His vision outlines a strategic Bitcoin upgrade , ensuring the network’s resilience for generations to come. Understanding the Quantum Computing Threat to Bitcoin’s Security Before diving into Lopp’s innovative solution, it’s essential to grasp the nature of the threat posed by quantum computing . Bitcoin’s security fundamentally relies on public-key cryptography, specifically the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). When you send Bitcoin, you sign the transaction with your private key, and anyone on the network can verify this signature using your public key. The security relies on the mathematical difficulty of deriving the private key from the public key. Here’s where quantum computers enter the picture. Unlike classical computers that process information using bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers use ‘qubits’ which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously. This allows them to perform certain computations exponentially faster. Specifically, algorithms like Shor’s algorithm, if run on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, could efficiently factor large numbers and solve the discrete logarithm problem, which underpins ECDSA. This means: Private Key Derivation: A quantum computer could potentially derive your private key from your public key, especially if your public key has been exposed (e.g., after spending UTXOs). This would allow an attacker to spend your funds. Signature Forgery: With a derived private key, an attacker could forge signatures for new transactions, effectively stealing your Bitcoin. While the full-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is still a hypothetical future, the scientific community acknowledges its potential emergence within decades. The time to prepare is now, given the slow and deliberate nature of Bitcoin protocol changes. Jameson Lopp’s Vision: A Proactive BIP for Post-Quantum Cryptography Recognizing the urgency, Jameson Lopp has taken a significant step forward by sharing a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) . This isn’t a panicked reaction but a meticulously planned, forward-looking strategy. Lopp’s proposal, shared on X (formerly Twitter), outlines a comprehensive migration roadmap for transitioning Bitcoin to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The core idea is to implement a mechanism that allows Bitcoin users and the network itself to gradually adopt new, quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms without disrupting the existing system. This proactive approach ensures that Bitcoin’s foundational security remains uncompromised even as quantum technology advances. Key aspects of Lopp’s BIP include: Migration Roadmap: A phased approach that would be triggered by the emergence of credible quantum computing threats. This isn’t an immediate, forced upgrade, but a prepared pathway. Incentive Mechanisms: Ways to encourage users to transition their funds to PQC-secured addresses. Security Considerations: Mechanisms for protecting assets during the transition, even in emergency scenarios. This proposal highlights the Bitcoin community’s commitment to long-term security and adaptability, demonstrating that even foundational protocols can evolve to meet future challenges. What is Post-Quantum Cryptography and How Does it Secure Bitcoin? Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), also known as quantum-resistant cryptography, refers to cryptographic algorithms that are designed to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. Research in this field has been ongoing for years, with various promising candidates emerging. Unlike current algorithms that rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or discrete logarithms, PQC algorithms often leverage different mathematical problems, such as: Lattice-based cryptography: Relies on the difficulty of solving certain problems in high-dimensional lattices. Hash-based cryptography: Uses cryptographic hash functions, which are generally considered quantum-resistant. Code-based cryptography: Based on error-correcting codes. Multivariate polynomial cryptography: Relies on the difficulty of solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations. Integrating PQC into Bitcoin would involve changing the signature algorithm used for transactions. Instead of ECDSA, a quantum-resistant signature scheme would be employed. This would likely involve changes to how addresses are generated and how transactions are validated. Challenges with PQC integration: Larger Key Sizes: Many PQC algorithms result in significantly larger public keys and signatures compared to ECDSA, which could impact transaction size and block space. Performance: Some PQC algorithms might be computationally more intensive, affecting transaction processing times. Standardization: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is still in the process of standardizing PQC algorithms, and the final choices could influence Bitcoin’s adoption. Lopp’s BIP implicitly acknowledges these challenges by proposing a gradual, well-thought-out migration rather than a rushed implementation. The Proposed Migration Roadmap: A Phased Bitcoin Upgrade The beauty of Lopp’s proposal lies in its pragmatic and phased approach to a Bitcoin upgrade . It understands that a network as critical and decentralized as Bitcoin cannot undergo radical, overnight changes. Instead, it suggests a careful, deliberate transition: Phase Description Trigger User Action Phase 1: Research & Preparation Ongoing research into PQC standards, community discussion, and soft fork development for PQC-compatible addresses. Current State / Community Initiative Awareness, potentially testing PQC wallets. Phase 2: Optional PQC Addresses Introduction of new address types that support PQC signatures (e.g., through a soft fork like Taproot). Users can optionally move funds to these addresses. Early signs of credible quantum threat, PQC standardization. Users voluntarily migrate funds to PQC-enabled addresses for enhanced security. Phase 3: Emergency Migration & Mandatory Transition If a significant quantum threat becomes imminent (e.g., a powerful quantum computer is demonstrated), mechanisms for forced migration or ‘bail-out’ transactions for non-PQC addresses are activated. Imminent quantum threat (e.g., demonstrated quantum computer breaking ECDSA). Users must move funds to PQC-enabled addresses; network may assist in emergency cases. This roadmap provides flexibility, allowing the Bitcoin network to adapt based on the actual progression of quantum technology rather than making premature, irreversible changes. It’s a testament to the foresight of individuals like Jameson Lopp , who are thinking decades ahead. Incentives and Safeguards: Protecting Assets During the Transition A critical component of any large-scale protocol change, especially a Bitcoin upgrade , is ensuring user adoption and asset protection. Lopp’s BIP considers both. While the specifics are still under discussion and development, the proposal aims to include: Incentives for Early Adoption: These could range from educational campaigns to potential minor transaction fee advantages for PQC-enabled transactions, encouraging users to migrate their funds proactively. The idea is to make the transition as seamless and beneficial as possible for users. Emergency Mechanisms: In a worst-case scenario, where a quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA emerges rapidly, the proposal suggests mechanisms to protect funds held in legacy addresses. This could involve pre-signed transactions, time-locked contracts, or other innovative solutions that allow users to ‘rescue’ their funds before they become vulnerable. Such mechanisms would likely require network consensus and careful implementation to avoid new attack vectors. The goal is to avoid a ‘quantum panic’ and provide a structured, secure pathway for all Bitcoin holders. This thoughtful approach underscores the robust security considerations inherent in the proposal. Why This Proactive Approach Matters for Bitcoin’s Future The significance of Jameson Lopp’s proposal extends far beyond merely addressing a hypothetical future threat. It reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a resilient, future-proof digital store of value. By actively planning for a quantum computing future, the Bitcoin community demonstrates: Long-Term Vision: Unlike many short-sighted projects, Bitcoin’s core developers and thought leaders are committed to its multi-decade, even multi-century, existence. Adaptability: Despite its reputation for conservatism, Bitcoin’s protocol can evolve through the BIP process, incorporating crucial advancements while maintaining its core principles. Enhanced Trust: Knowing that the community is proactively addressing such profound threats bolsters confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term security and viability as a global reserve asset. Leadership in Blockchain Security: Bitcoin continues to set the standard for security and innovation in the blockchain space, prompting other cryptocurrencies to consider similar proactive measures for post-quantum cryptography . This initiative is not about fear-mongering but about responsible, strategic planning. It ensures that Bitcoin remains the most secure and reliable digital asset, regardless of how technology evolves. Conclusion: Securing Bitcoin’s Quantum Future Jameson Lopp’s new BIP is a testament to the Bitcoin community’s unwavering commitment to its long-term security and resilience. By proposing a comprehensive Bitcoin upgrade plan to integrate post-quantum cryptography , Lopp and the broader community are taking decisive action against the potential threats posed by future quantum computing advancements. This proactive approach, with its carefully outlined migration roadmap, incentive mechanisms, and robust security considerations, ensures that Bitcoin remains a formidable, unassailable digital asset for generations to come. It’s a crucial step in safeguarding the digital gold standard, reinforcing its position as a secure and reliable foundation for the global financial future.

In a significant development, Ghana is stepping up to the plate, reportedly finalizing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. This proactive approach aims to bring various digital asset platforms under formal oversight, a move that could set a precedent for other developing economies. Why is Ghana Crypto Regulation a Game Changer? The news, initially reported by Bloomberg, highlights Ghana’s commitment to creating a structured environment for digital currencies. For too long, the crypto space has operated in a legal grey area in many parts of the world, leading to concerns about consumer protection, illicit financial flows, and overall market stability. Ghana’s initiative signals a clear intent to foster innovation while mitigating risks. This isn’t just about controlling; it’s about legitimizing and integrating. What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Platforms? For businesses operating digital asset platforms in Ghana, or those looking to enter the market, this upcoming framework will bring much-needed clarity. Currently, the lack of clear rules can deter legitimate businesses and investors. A well-defined regulatory landscape can: Enhance Trust: Investors and users are more likely to engage with platforms that operate under a clear legal structure. Promote Innovation: With regulatory certainty, companies can invest more confidently in developing new products and services. Combat Illicit Activities: Robust regulations can help prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes often associated with unregulated crypto. Foster Growth: By bringing platforms into the formal financial system, it opens doors for partnerships with traditional financial institutions. This move is a strong signal that Ghana is ready to embrace the digital economy responsibly. Crafting a Robust Cryptocurrency Framework: The Ghanaian Approach Developing a comprehensive cryptocurrency framework is no small feat. It requires balancing the decentralized nature of crypto with the need for centralized oversight. While the specifics of Ghana’s framework are yet to be fully disclosed, it’s expected to cover key areas such as: Licensing and Registration: Requirements for crypto exchanges, custodians, and other service providers. Consumer Protection: Measures to safeguard users’ funds and data, including dispute resolution mechanisms. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Strict Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols and reporting obligations. Taxation: Clarity on how crypto assets and transactions will be taxed. Market Integrity: Rules to prevent market manipulation and ensure fair trading practices. The success of this framework will depend on its adaptability and ability to keep pace with rapid technological advancements in the crypto space. Ghana’s Influence on African Crypto Adoption Ghana’s proactive stance could significantly impact the broader landscape of African crypto adoption . The continent has seen remarkable growth in cryptocurrency usage, often driven by a need for alternative financial services, remittances, and inflation hedging. However, regulatory responses have been varied, from outright bans to cautious experimentation. If Ghana successfully implements a balanced and effective framework, it could serve as a blueprint for other African nations. This could lead to a more harmonized regulatory environment across the continent, facilitating cross-border crypto transactions and fostering regional digital economic integration. Ghana’s leadership in this area could inspire a wave of structured growth, moving African crypto from a largely informal sector to a more formalized and secure one. Ensuring Financial Stability in a Digital Age Ultimately, the core objective behind Ghana’s regulatory push is to enhance financial stability . Unregulated digital assets can pose systemic risks to a nation’s financial system, including volatility spillover, potential for financial fraud, and challenges to monetary policy. By bringing these assets under regulatory purview, the Bank of Ghana and other financial authorities aim to: Monitor and Manage Risks: Gain visibility into crypto market activities to identify and mitigate potential threats. Protect the Financial System: Prevent illicit funds from flowing through digital channels and impacting traditional finance.

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-set-to-explode-heres-the-latest/,"Shiba Inu is beginning to stand out as a notable gainer in the current cryptocurrency market cycle. While its recent price movements have not reflected explosive growth, several analysts now believe that the asset is on the verge of a major trend reversal. Bear Market Exhaustion Signals a Possible Turning Point Crypto analyst “Cantonese Cat,” known for his broad following on social media, recently commented that sell pressure on Shiba Inu has drastically declined. In his view, the bearish grip that has restrained SHIB’s price for months could soon be broken with minimal upward momentum from buyers. He emphasized that current market activity suggests holders are not offloading their positions, indicating low sell-side volume. Shiba Inu has experienced a prolonged downtrend since March 2024, losing approximately 77% of its value, falling from a high of $0.000045 to a low of $0.00001004. Despite intermittent recovery attempts during that time, bearish resistance consistently overpowered bullish momentum, pushing the token dangerously close to losing another decimal point. Nobody is selling $SHIB either. Sell volume is nonexistent, and all it takes is just some volume coming in and these bear trends will reverse in a big way. https://t.co/oUpZtxBoCu pic.twitter.com/difHLffzwv — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) July 13, 2025 However, analysts now suggest that conditions may be aligning in favor of a stronger price recovery, especially given recent patterns in whale accumulation. Whale Activity Reflects Growing Confidence On July 10, on-chain data showed that major Shiba Inu holders, those controlling at least 0.1% of the total supply, purchased 1.81 trillion SHIB tokens. This represented a 422% increase in accumulation compared to the previous day and an astonishing 1,247% rise from one month earlier. This surge in buying coincided with SHIB surpassing the $0.000013 threshold for the first time in nearly a month. Even though 1.28 trillion SHIB was withdrawn from large wallets the same day, the net inflow remains positive, suggesting ongoing accumulation. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00001364, reflecting an 11.3% gain over the past week. Despite reaching a monthly high, several market participants argue that SHIB’s price still does not reflect its potential value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Outlook from Analysts Although Cantonese Cat did not provide a specific price target for Shiba Inu, other analysts have offered projections. “SHIB Spain,” a notable community figure, shared a chart indicating that SHIB could soon break past $0.000018. He further suggested that long-term growth could take SHIB toward the $0.0001 mark. Meanwhile, technical analyst “Crypto Candy” described SHIB’s current chart as bullish and identified several price milestones. His short-term objective is $0.00001718, with a mid-range target at $0.00002502. Should momentum persist, he anticipates a potential move back to December 2023’s high of $0.00003324 and possibly beyond. While optimism among supporters is increasing , not all observers are convinced. Some market participants continue to express doubts about the long-term prospects of meme-based tokens like SHIB. Critics argue that the token’s peak performance may be behind it, and that new investors should remain cautious despite recent gains. Regardless of skepticism, the sharp decline in selling activity, combined with a noticeable surge in whale accumulation, indicates renewed confidence in the asset.

The news of prominent trader James Wynn experiencing a partial crypto liquidation on his substantial 40x Bitcoin (BTC) and 10x PEPE long positions on Hyperliquid has sent ripples through the trading community. This incident, first reported by Onchain Lens on X, serves as a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can shift in the fast-paced digital asset markets. What Exactly Happened to James Wynn’s Positions? In a development that quickly captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts, James Wynn , a well-known figure within the Hyperliquid trading ecosystem, faced a partial liquidation. This wasn’t just any trade; it involved significant leverage on two highly popular, yet volatile, assets: Bitcoin (BTC) and the meme coin PEPE. Specifically, Wynn held a 40x long position on BTC and a 10x long position on PEPE. A ‘long’ position means he was betting on the price of these assets to go up. However, when prices move against such highly leveraged bets, the risk of liquidation becomes imminent. Partial liquidation occurs when a trading platform automatically closes a portion of a trader’s position to prevent further losses, typically when the margin balance falls below the required maintenance margin. This mechanism is designed to protect both the trader from losing more than their initial collateral and the exchange from bad debt. The incident highlights the unforgiving nature of high-leverage trading, where even experienced traders like James Wynn can face significant setbacks due to market fluctuations. Understanding the Dynamics of High Leverage on Hyperliquid For those new to the space, understanding leverage is crucial. Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their actual capital. For instance, with 40x leverage, a trader can control $40 for every $1 they put up as collateral. While this amplifies potential gains, it also drastically magnifies potential losses. On platforms like Hyperliquid , which are known for offering high leverage options, the stakes are incredibly high. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what high leverage entails: Amplified Exposure: A small price movement can lead to large profit or loss. Lower Margin Requirements: You need less capital upfront to open a large position. Increased Liquidation Risk: Your liquidation price is much closer to your entry price, meaning a small adverse move can trigger a margin call or liquidation. The decision to use 40x leverage on Bitcoin trading, an asset known for its volatility, and 10x on a meme coin like PEPE coin , which can experience even wilder swings, demonstrates a high-risk, high-reward strategy. While such strategies can lead to immense profits during favorable market conditions, they also expose traders to substantial downside during unexpected price reversals. Leverage Multiplier and Risk Leverage Multiplier Impact on Gains/Losses Proximity to Liquidation 1x (No Leverage) 1:1 with price movement Only if asset goes to zero 10x 10x amplified 10% adverse move triggers liquidation (approx.) 40x 40x amplified 2.5% adverse move triggers liquidation (approx.) Why is High Leverage So Risky in Crypto Trading? The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its rapid price swings, often influenced by news, regulatory changes, and broader market sentiment. This inherent volatility makes high-leverage trading a double-edged sword. Even a minor correction or a sudden flash crash can wipe out a significant portion of a trader’s capital, leading to a crypto liquidation event. Unlike traditional markets, crypto operates 24/7, meaning price movements can occur at any time, catching traders off guard. Key factors contributing to the risk: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and PEPE coin can experience double-digit percentage swings in a single day. Unpredictable News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, or major whale movements can cause sudden price drops. Liquidation Cascades: When a large number of leveraged positions are liquidated simultaneously, it can create a domino effect, pushing prices down further and triggering more liquidations. Emotional Trading: The pressure of high-leverage positions can lead to irrational decisions, such as over-trading or failing to set proper stop-losses. For traders engaging in Bitcoin trading or speculating on meme coins, understanding these risks is paramount. The allure of quick profits can often overshadow the potential for equally rapid and substantial losses. Lessons from James Wynn’s Experience: Navigating Bitcoin Trading and PEPE Coin Volatility The partial liquidation of James Wynn ‘s positions offers invaluable lessons for both novice and experienced traders. It underscores the critical importance of robust risk management strategies, especially when dealing with high-leverage products on platforms like Hyperliquid . Actionable Insights for Traders: Prioritize Risk Management: Always define your maximum acceptable loss per trade. Use stop-loss orders diligently to limit potential downside. This is perhaps the most crucial lesson from any crypto liquidation event. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While 40x or 10x leverage might seem appealing for quick gains, they drastically reduce your margin for error. Consider lower leverage (2x-5x) or even no leverage, especially if you’re new to the market or trading highly volatile assets like PEPE coin . Understand Liquidation Points: Before entering a leveraged trade, always calculate your liquidation price. Know exactly how much the asset needs to move against you before your position is automatically closed. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Wynn focused on BTC and PEPE, spreading your capital across different assets can mitigate risk. Stay Informed but Skeptical: Follow market news and sentiment, but always do your own research (DYOR). Don’t blindly follow prominent traders or social media trends, as their strategies might not align with your risk tolerance or capital. Emotional Discipline: Trading under pressure can lead to poor decisions. Develop a trading plan and stick to it, avoiding impulsive actions driven by fear or greed. Learn from Others’ Mistakes: The unfortunate events faced by traders like James Wynn provide real-world case studies. Analyze what went wrong and how similar situations can be avoided in your own Bitcoin trading journey. Conclusion: Navigating the High-Stakes World of Crypto The partial liquidation of James Wynn ‘s significant BTC and PEPE long positions on Hyperliquid is a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. While the allure of amplified gains is undeniable, the potential for rapid and substantial losses is equally real. This incident serves as a crucial case study, emphasizing the absolute necessity of sound risk management, prudent leverage choices, and emotional discipline for anyone venturing into the high-stakes world of crypto.

Speaking at the annual Mansion House dinner in London, Bailey condemned Trump’s proposed 30% tariffs on imports from the EU and Mexico—on top of existing levies on Chinese goods—as deeply disruptive. He labeled the approach “economic sabotage,” arguing it would backfire and worsen inflation, which he described as the real threat. Bailey says these tariffs are dangerous, noting that the US move may prompt a cycle of retaliation and protectionism. He added that the tariffs could slow trade and cause prices for ordinary goods to climb, reducing global economic activity. Bailey said that higher tariffs could seriously risk the global economy and trade. He warned that such measures would ultimately harm the households they intended to support. Bailey urges global leaders to choose collaboration over conflict Bailey also pushed for renewed international cooperation between the US and China to solve outstanding trade and capital-flow imbalances. He said that China and the US account for nearly 40% of the world’s current account imbalances. The US runs a large trade deficit, and China has a big surplus due to elevated savings and low domestic consumption. Bailey said the two positions were untenable, adding that economic divisions reinforced political hostility between the sides. However, Bailey opposed hitting back with tariffs and urged world leaders to work together and reform multilateral institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) . And these institutions can better manage worldwide shifts in trading and financial systems, he said. Bailey said that all parties must agree upon the rules of the process. He cautioned that allowing one dominant player to dictate the rules was not a formula for lasting stability. He also said the US should explain how it reconciles its increasing domestic fiscal deficit with condemnation of its trade imbalance with the rest of the world. He also urged China to solve its low household consumption and excessive export dependence. BOE warns stablecoins and digital currencies pose risks The Bank of England has warned that the widespread use of digital currencies could intensify the severity of bank runs. In a recent Economic Letter, the central Bank noted that when confidence in a bank’s solvency collapses, a rush by depositors to withdraw funds could lead to a rapid loss of liquidity. This, in turn, would dry up other funding sources and render many of the Bank’s assets effectively worthless. The Bank explained that banks, whose deposits and loans are no longer backed by gold but by short-term securities, could quickly become insolvent in such scenarios. It added that holders of other securities issued by the affected Bank would likely scramble to sell, triggering further panic in the financial markets. Transitioning from global trade to financial innovation, Bailey’s speech instead raised fears of the rapid expansion of digital assets—particularly stablecoins—and lobbying for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Britain. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value, typically by being pegged to the value of the US dollar. They are becoming better known as a means of payment and investment, including in the United States, where there have been recent moves to write regulations underpinning their use. However, Bailey is not convinced of their place in a secure and stable financial system in the future. He also voiced his reservations over the proposed digital pound under consideration by the Bank of England and the HM Treasury. While some view a UK CBDC as an inevitability, Bailey said the case for innovation “has not yet been made.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Bank of England,EN,0,0,FIAT|ASIA|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-15 23:41:38

What had begun as a positive crypto week for President Donald Trump has turned sour after the Congress signaled different interpretations of certain clauses, especially in the Genius Act , which have been meant to provide clear rules for stablecoins. Out of the total votes, 196 House members voted for the bill to continue while 223 members, the majority including the Democrats, voted against the debate of the legislation. As a result, the House has been on standstill and a huge blow to President Trump and the wider Republicans. Furthermore, the just-concluded vote has prevented the Congress from debating and eventually voting on the bill later this week. What Went Wrong in Congress With the Genius Act Bill? According to Eleanor Terrett, the Republicans who voted against the Genius Act argued that the bill could have been constructed to secretly allow the Federal Reserve to introduce a CBDC.

Yet, when a figure as prominent as former U.S. President Donald Trump publicly champions a specific piece of legislation aimed at cementing America’s dominance in the digital asset space, it sends ripples across the globe. This week, Trump took to social media during what he dubbed ‘Crypto Week,’ advocating for the crucial GENIUS Act , a move that could redefine the future landscape for digital assets in the United States. What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Trump Crypto Vision? At its core, the GENIUS Act (likely an acronym for ‘Guiding Entrepreneurs in New Innovative US Startups’ or similar, given its stated purpose) is designed to provide a clear regulatory framework and foster innovation within the burgeoning digital asset sector. While specific details of the bill are still emerging, Trump’s endorsement highlights its potential to streamline processes, encourage investment, and protect consumers in the crypto market. This legislative push is a significant indicator of how seriously top political figures are now taking the crypto industry. For years, the U.S. has grappled with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to a patchwork of state-level rules and federal agencies often operating without clear mandates. This uncertainty has, at times, hindered innovation and driven some crypto businesses offshore. The GENIUS Act aims to address this by: Establishing Regulatory Clarity: Providing clear guidelines for digital asset classification, issuance, and trading. Fostering Innovation: Creating a supportive environment for blockchain startups and developers. Protecting Consumers: Implementing safeguards against fraud and market manipulation. Promoting Economic Growth: Attracting capital and talent to the U.S. digital asset sector. Why is US Leadership in Digital Assets Crucial? President Trump’s emphasis on securing U.S. leadership in digital assets is not merely political rhetoric; it’s a strategic imperative with profound economic and geopolitical implications. In an increasingly digitized global economy, the nation that leads in emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies will hold a significant competitive advantage. This leadership translates into several key benefits: Economic Prosperity and Job Creation A robust digital asset ecosystem can unlock immense economic potential. By attracting companies, developers, and investors, the U.S. can create high-paying jobs, stimulate technological advancements, and generate new revenue streams. Imagine a future where the next Google or Apple of blockchain technology is born and thrives on American soil, contributing massively to the national GDP. National Security and Financial Stability Controlling the narrative and infrastructure around digital assets is also a matter of national security. As central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) gain traction globally, having a strong domestic framework ensures the U.S. can influence global standards, prevent illicit finance, and maintain financial stability in an evolving landscape. Ignoring this sector would leave the U.S. vulnerable to foreign technological dominance and potential financial disruptions. Global Influence and Innovation Being at the forefront of digital asset innovation allows the U.S. to set global benchmarks and standards, much like it has done in other technological revolutions. This leadership reinforces America’s position as a global innovator and attracts the brightest minds from around the world, creating a virtuous cycle of progress. Trump’s Shifting Stance: A Game Changer for Crypto Legislation? Donald Trump’s vocal support for digital assets marks a notable evolution in his public stance on cryptocurrencies. Previously, his comments on Bitcoin were often viewed with skepticism, sometimes even outright dismissal. However, his recent embrace, culminating in the declaration of ‘Crypto Week’ and the strong endorsement of the GENIUS Act, signals a significant shift. This pivot is likely influenced by the growing mainstream adoption of crypto, its increasing integration into traditional finance, and the recognition of its potential economic impact. This change of heart from a leading political figure could be a powerful catalyst for broader crypto legislation . When a potential presidential candidate makes digital assets a campaign talking point, it elevates the discussion from niche financial circles to the national political stage. This can pressure Congress to act more decisively, potentially leading to bipartisan efforts to pass comprehensive crypto laws. What Does This Mean for the Future? The implications of Trump’s support are multifaceted: Increased Political Momentum: Crypto legislation could become a more prominent issue in upcoming elections, pushing candidates to articulate their stances. Potential for Bipartisan Support: While crypto has seen some bipartisan interest, a high-profile endorsement from a former president could encourage more lawmakers to engage. Market Confidence: Clearer regulatory pathways often lead to increased institutional investment and broader adoption, as uncertainty is a major deterrent for many traditional investors. The Road Ahead: Congressional Collaboration and Challenges for Crypto Legislation While President Trump’s endorsement is a powerful statement, the actual implementation of the GENIUS Act, or any comprehensive crypto legislation , requires diligent work and collaboration with Congress. The legislative process is often slow and complex, particularly when dealing with a rapidly evolving technology like digital assets. Key challenges that Congress will need to navigate include: Defining Jurisdictions: Deciding which federal agencies (SEC, CFTC, Treasury, etc.) have primary oversight over different aspects of digital assets. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Crafting laws that protect investors without stifling technological progress. International Harmonization: Ensuring U.S. laws are compatible with global standards to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Technological Literacy: Educating lawmakers and their staff on the nuances of blockchain and various digital asset classes. Trump’s pledge to work with Congress on further legislation indicates a willingness to engage in this complex process. For the crypto community, this is a call to action: active participation, education, and advocacy will be crucial in shaping these upcoming policies. Actionable Insights for the Digital Asset Community Given these developments, what should individuals and businesses in the digital asset space consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on legislative developments, particularly concerning the GENIUS Act and broader crypto legislation. Follow reputable news sources and official government channels. Engage with Policy Makers: If you’re a business or an advocate, consider engaging with your representatives to share your perspectives on how sensible regulation can foster innovation. Prepare for Change: While the specifics are uncertain, a push for clearer regulation means businesses should start reviewing their compliance frameworks and adapting to potential new requirements. Educate Others: Help demystify digital assets for those less familiar, promoting a balanced understanding of their benefits and risks. Conclusion: A New Era for US Leadership in Digital Assets? President Donald Trump’s unequivocal support for the GENIUS Act and his vision for U.S. leadership in digital assets marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This is more than just a political endorsement; it signifies a growing recognition at the highest levels of government that digital assets are not a fleeting trend but a fundamental component of the future global economy. While the path to comprehensive legislation will undoubtedly present challenges, the commitment from a figure like Trump injects significant momentum into the conversation. The coming months and years will reveal whether this bold vision translates into actionable policy that truly solidifies America’s position at the forefront of the digital revolution. For those invested in the future of finance and technology, this is a development worth watching closely, as it could usher in an era of unprecedented growth and clarity for the digital asset landscape.

The project’s presale has now hit $339 million, cruising through Batch 29 with momentum still building. Over 23.9 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, and those who got in during Batch 1 have seen returns of 2,660%. Instead of betting on short-lived meme coin spikes, users are leaning into long-term value with BlockDAG’s real-world focus. Bitcoin Pepe staking has stirred excitement in meme circles, especially for those chasing passive rewards. But putting money behind a meme is not the same as supporting tech infrastructure. That’s where BlockDAG is stepping in strong. A mining app with over 2 million users, security audits completed, DeFi tools prepped for launch, and partnerships that are driving adoption, that’s what real traction looks like. Bitcoin Pepe Hype Builds, But How Long Will It Last? For the Bitcoin Pepe community, getting listed on MEXC is no small feat. It gives the project visibility on a high-volume exchange, and the launch of staking adds another reason for supporters to stay active after the presale. The presale had all the classic meme coin ingredients: big buzz, fast-paced sales, and a surge of social media hype. With its signature frog branding and meme culture backing, Bitcoin Pepe quickly found a loyal base. But even with the current rise in popularity, questions about future direction are starting to show up. Many meme coins follow a pattern: go viral, get listed, then struggle to build beyond the hype. Without a clear product roadmap or developer activity, long-term staying power becomes uncertain. And in today’s market, having a clear vision matters more than ever. $339M Raised & Sports Collabs Push BlockDAG Forward BlockDAG isn’t chasing fast fame; it’s building for reach. While many projects focus on influencer boosts or fast exchange listings, BlockDAG is going for long-term recognition. The project recently partnered with two pro sports teams, the Seattle Seawolves (rugby) and Seattle Orcas (cricket). These are not surface-level promotions. The deals include fan events, NFT rollouts, and deeper community engagement. These moves show BlockDAG’s push to go beyond just crypto-native users. The goal is broader adoption, from sports fans to everyday tech users. With past deals like Inter Milan and UFC’s Alex Pereira already in its portfolio, BlockDAG is building a worldwide presence. Now, with $339 million raised and over 23.9 billion coins sold, the numbers are lining up with the mission. Buyers from Batch 1 have already gained a 2,660% return, heading into the full $0.05 launch price. CertiK and Halborn audited the network, and the X1 app alone onboarded over 2 million users. Plus, a full DeFi ecosystem is gearing up for launch. Right now, thanks to the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, a special $0.0016 price is live until August 11. That means users can still lock in a 3,250% return before the $0.05 price goes live. This is one of the lowest rates offered since the early batches, and it’s drawing heavy attention. With the presale in Batch 29 and the price at $0.0276 normally, this time-sensitive offer is a major window for new entries. Vibes or Value? BlockDAG Leads with Structure Let’s be honest. Bitcoin Pepe staking might offer some short-term gains, but without a broader structure to support it, those rewards won’t last. Meme coins like Doge and Floki have pulled big numbers before, but few can hold on once the buzz fades. BlockDAG is doing something different. It’s not just chasing trends, it’s locking in value. There’s a complete plan behind the scenes, with a fast-growing user base and real-world tools backing it all. That’s rare in crypto, especially with so many projects relying only on internet attention. While Bitcoin Pepe’s listing will help it stay relevant in the short run, BlockDAG is setting up for something bigger. With tech, utility, and strong brand partnerships, it’s becoming the project that stands out, not just this month, but through the next cycle. The Final Verdict Meme coins will always have a crypto place, but lasting success needs more than just jokes and staking rewards. Bitcoin Pepe’s listing might bring in a few wins, and its staking system could keep users around for a bit. But the real action is happening with BlockDAG. With $339 million raised, 23.9 billion coins sold, and a full ecosystem in development, BlockDAG is positioning itself for major visibility. The presale is still open, and the $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer runs until August 11, giving people a rare shot to grab BDAG at one of its earliest prices. As Bitcoin Pepe rides the meme trend, BlockDAG is building something that lasts.

Are You Seeing This?,https://timestabloid.com/chartist-says-xrp-is-screaming-all-time-high-are-you-seeing-this/,"Market analyst Ali Martinez has indicated that XRP is exhibiting significant upward potential and may be positioned for a strong rally, provided it clears a key price barrier. According to his assessment, the cryptocurrency must achieve a confirmed weekly close above $3 to unlock further gains, with targets extending to $4.80 in the mid-term. Current Price Activity and Consolidation Zone As of mid-July 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $2.87, following a brief retracement from a recent attempt to test the $3 resistance . The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a modest cooldown after substantial price movements earlier this month, which included Bitcoin reaching new record highs. Since January 2025, XRP has maintained a consistent trading range, fluctuating between $2 as support and $3 as resistance. While the asset has made multiple efforts to break above this upper boundary, those attempts have been unsuccessful so far. Simultaneously, the lower end of the range has remained firmly supported by buying interest. $XRP is screaming all-time highs. Are you seeing this? pic.twitter.com/fWKQUESNqQ — Ali (@ali_charts) July 14, 2025 Comparison to Previous Market Structure Martinez notes that XRP’s current price behavior is reminiscent of a similar pattern observed between August 2023 and November 2024, during which the token traded within a narrower band ranging from $0.40 to $0.74. Once that prior consolidation phase ended with a breakout above resistance, XRP advanced quickly to higher price levels, surpassing $1 and eventually reaching $2. Based on this historical setup, Martinez believes the market could be witnessing a comparable consolidation phase that precedes a larger breakout, potentially leading to fresh all-time highs. Resistance Levels and Momentum Indicators Should XRP manage to secure a weekly close above the $3 threshold, the next areas of resistance are projected to be $3.40, a level that rejected price action earlier in January 2025, followed by the previous all-time high of $3.80, set in 2018. If both levels are breached, Martinez sees $4.80 as a reasonable target in the near to mid-term. Technical indicators appear to support the bullish outlook. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows that the Average Directional Index (ADX) is currently at 25, suggesting that a trend is forming. The Positive Directional Indicator (+DI) is positioned at 23.6, while the Negative Directional Indicator (–DI) has decreased to 15.47. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The widening gap between these metrics implies strengthening bullish momentum and weakening seller presence. A sustained ADX reading above 25 would confirm a developing upward trend. Beyond short-term targets, Martinez has previously emphasized a significant breakout from a seven-year symmetrical triangle that occurred in November 2024. This move marked the end of a prolonged compression phase and initiated a new market cycle. Since then, XRP has largely consolidated its gains during the first half of 2025. Using Fibonacci extension analysis, Martinez has identified potential long-term price objectives at $8.96, $16.17, and $26.24, contingent upon continued bullish conditions and strong market participation. While XRP’s momentum remains favorable, Martinez underscores that a confirmed breakout above $3 is essential to trigger any major upward move. Until this level is decisively breached, the asset is likely to continue consolidating within its established trading band.

Using a detailed Elliott Wave structure and historical halving patterns, the expert outlines what could be Bitcoin’s final parabolic move, laying out a clear roadmap toward a new ATH target. Bitcoin Parabolic Phase Still Ahead Following Bitcoin’s explosive rise above $123,000 in a single day, crypto analyst XForceGlobal reaffirmed his earlier predictions and intensified his bullish outlook. He now asserts that Bitcoin is in the early stages of a much larger breakout, with the final and most parabolic phase of its rally yet to unfold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trajectory To $155,000: Why No Major Dips Are Expected From Here The analyst Bitcoin Price Trajectory To $155,000: Why No Major Dips Are Expected From Here a detailed chart showing that Bitcoin is now trading over $40,000 above its Wave 2 bottom of the macro 5th. This indicates that the market could be transitioning into Wave 3 of a larger Elliott Wave impulse pattern. The chart also visually segments previous bull market runs into distinct macro phases, each unfolding after a halving cycle. Every phase began with a consolidation period, followed by exponential growth and eventual correction. Bitcoin’s price history is further marked by the halving events in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024—all of which have consistently preceded major bullish rallies. The latest halving, which occurred in April 2024, is now expected to lead to an intermediate-term rally that may extend BTC’s price beyond $270,000 before entering another corrective phase. While XForceGlobal maintains a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin, he urges investors to be cautious and aware that the final wave may generate market euphoria before a significant decline sets in. His projected roadmap shows a steady bullish climb toward $272,832, followed by a potential retracement to around $41,646, marking a steep 85% crash from the top. During his analysis, the market expert highlighted the difference between smart and dumb money during this bullish phase of the cycle. He claimed that smart investors have already mapped out their exit strategies, understanding that success comes from early planning rather than spontaneous decisions. He also added that with the market yet to reach a climax, there’s still time to prepare an exit before red flags emerge. Analyst Predicts $155,000 As Bitcoin’s Next Stop In a follow-up X post, XForceGlobal forecasted Bitcoin’s next short-term price target at $155,000. This prediction comes as BTC recently rallied past $123,000 before undergoing a pullback, now trading slightly above $116,800. According to the analyst, Bitcoin remains firmly in an extended Wave 3, which traditionally represents the most impulsive and powerful phase of the Elliott Wave sequence.

David Sacks, a key figure reportedly tapped to lead the White House’s AI and cryptocurrency strategy should Donald Trump return to office, has confirmed plans to decisively block the issuance of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This revelation, initially reported by Odaily and echoing sentiments previously expressed by Trump himself, sends powerful ripples through the global financial landscape. It promises a stark contrast to approaches taken by many other major economies, and for crypto enthusiasts and digital finance observers, this isn’t just a policy statement; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine the future of money in the United States. Understanding the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Debate: What Exactly Are We Talking About? Before diving into the implications of the Trump administration’s stance, it’s crucial to grasp what a central bank digital currency (CBDC) truly is. In essence, a CBDC is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Think of it as a digital version of the cash in your wallet, but instead of being printed by the government, it exists purely in electronic form and is directly controlled by the central monetary authority. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which operate on distributed ledgers and are not controlled by any single entity, a CBDC would be centralized. It would be a direct liability of the central bank, similar to physical banknotes, offering a level of sovereign backing that private digital currencies or stablecoins currently do not possess. Globally, central banks are exploring two main types of CBDCs: Retail CBDCs: These are designed for general public use, much like digital cash. Individuals and businesses would hold accounts or digital wallets directly with the central bank, or through intermediaries, enabling direct digital payments. Wholesale CBDCs: These are restricted to financial institutions for interbank settlements, aiming to improve the efficiency and security of wholesale payment systems. Proponents of CBDCs often highlight a range of potential benefits: Potential Benefits of CBDCs Potential Concerns of CBDCs Financial Inclusion: Providing access to digital payments for the unbanked or underbanked populations. Privacy Erosion: Potential for government surveillance of all financial transactions, leading to a loss of financial anonymity. Payment System Efficiency: Speeding up domestic and cross-border payments, reducing transaction costs. Government Control & Programmability: Risk of central banks or governments imposing restrictions on how and when money can be spent. Monetary Policy Effectiveness: Offering new tools for central banks to implement monetary policy, such as direct stimulus or negative interest rates. Disintermediation of Commercial Banks: Threatening the business models of traditional banks if individuals move deposits to the central bank. Combating Illicit Finance: Increased traceability could help in fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. Cybersecurity Risks: Centralized digital infrastructure could become a single point of failure, vulnerable to cyberattacks. Maintaining Monetary Sovereignty: In an increasingly digital world, a CBDC could ensure a nation’s currency remains dominant amidst the rise of private digital currencies. Economic Instability: Potential for bank runs if, during a crisis, people shift funds from commercial banks to the safer CBDC. Why is the Trump Administration Taking Such a Decisive Stand Against CBDCs? The proposed stance by the Trump administration , articulated by figures like David Sacks, is not merely a technical policy decision but appears deeply rooted in a fundamental distrust of centralized digital control and a strong emphasis on individual liberty and financial privacy. Donald Trump himself has publicly stated his opposition to a U.S. CBDC, framing it as a threat to freedom. David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist and a close ally of Trump, has been particularly vocal on these issues. His perspective often aligns with a tech-libertarian viewpoint that champions decentralization and individual autonomy over government intervention. For Sacks and the potential Trump administration, the potential benefits of a CBDC are heavily outweighed by its inherent risks to civil liberties and the existing financial order. Key reasons underpinning this proposed blockade include: Profound Privacy Concerns: This is arguably the most significant driver. A CBDC could allow the government to monitor every single financial transaction made by its citizens. This level of granular oversight raises serious alarms about financial surveillance, the erosion of personal financial anonymity, and the potential for abuse of power. Imagine a scenario where the government could track your spending habits in real-time or even freeze your digital funds based on certain criteria. Fear of Government Overreach and “Programmable Money”: Critics argue that a CBDC grants excessive power to the central bank, potentially enabling direct control over citizens’ spending. The concept of “programmable money” – where the issuer could dictate how, when, or even if funds can be used (e.g., expiring funds, restrictions on certain purchases) – is a significant fear. This is seen as a direct assault on economic freedom. Protection of the Commercial Banking System: If individuals hold accounts directly with the central bank, it could bypass traditional commercial banks, disrupting their deposit base and lending capabilities. This disintermediation could destabilize the existing fractional reserve banking system, leading to unforeseen economic consequences. The administration may seek to protect the established financial infrastructure. Preservation of Physical Cash: There’s a strong sentiment within certain political factions to preserve physical cash as a bastion of privacy and freedom. They view CBDCs as a step towards a cashless society, which they believe could lead to greater government control and less individual autonomy. Ideological Alignment: This approach aligns with a broader conservative and libertarian philosophy that prioritizes market-driven innovation and individual choice over government-led digital finance initiatives. It’s a stance that resonates with a significant portion of the Republican base. Should Trump assume office, this opposition could manifest in various ways, from executive orders halting any CBDC development by the Federal Reserve to legislative efforts aimed at banning its issuance. This signals a clear intent to draw a line in the sand against what they perceive as an encroaching digital authoritarianism. The Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets: A Boon for Decentralization? This proposed policy by the Trump administration could have profound and perhaps unexpected implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. If the U.S. opts out of developing and issuing a CBDC, it could inadvertently bolster the case for decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which were fundamentally designed to operate outside central control. Potential Upside for Decentralized Crypto: Narrative Reinforcement: The “freedom money” and “permissionless” narratives of Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies could gain significant traction. If the alternative presented by a CBDC is perceived as government surveillance and control, users concerned about privacy might flock to truly decentralized solutions, seeing them as the only viable alternative. Increased Adoption: A U.S. CBDC block might encourage more individuals and institutions to explore and adopt existing cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This could lead to increased liquidity and market capitalization for these assets. Innovation Shift: Development efforts within the crypto space might further concentrate on privacy-enhancing technologies, self-custody solutions, and robust decentralized infrastructures, as these become even more valuable in a world wary of centralized digital currencies. Clearer Regulatory Landscape (Potentially): While the administration’s broader crypto stance remains to be fully defined, blocking CBDCs could simplify the regulatory debate by clearly demarcating “private” crypto from “state-issued” digital money. This could lead to more tailored and potentially more favorable regulations for the decentralized sector. Challenges and Nuances: While a CBDC block might seem unequivocally bullish for crypto, it doesn’t automatically mean a fully crypto-friendly regulatory environment across the board. The administration’s broader stance on stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, and crypto exchanges would still be crucial and could vary. The U.S. potentially falling behind on CBDC development could also raise questions about its future leadership in digital finance on a global scale, potentially ceding ground to nations that embrace digital currencies. The debate over the environmental impact of certain cryptocurrencies or their use in illicit activities would likely persist, regardless of the CBDC stance. Global Perspectives on Digital Currency Development: Is the U.S. Falling Behind or Leading a New Path? The U.S. approach, as articulated by the Trump administration, stands in stark contrast to many other nations actively exploring or even implementing a digital currency . This divergence highlights a global ideological split on the future of money and central bank roles in the digital age. Examples of Global CBDC Initiatives: China’s Digital Yuan (e-CNY): China is arguably the frontrunner, having extensively piloted its digital yuan across major cities and integrated it into daily life. Their motivations include improving payment efficiency, enhancing financial inclusion, combating illicit finance, and asserting geopolitical influence, often with less emphasis on individual privacy compared to Western concerns. Europe’s Digital Euro: The European Central Bank (ECB) is deep into its investigation phase for a digital euro, aiming to complement cash and offer a resilient payment system. The ECB has emphasized privacy safeguards and the importance of a “digital euro” to maintain monetary sovereignty in a rapidly digitizing world. Nigeria’s eNaira: Nigeria was one of the first countries to launch a live CBDC, the eNaira, in October 2021, aiming to boost financial inclusion and improve cross-border remittances. India’s Digital Rupee (e₹): India’s Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has launched pilot programs for both wholesale and retail versions of its digital rupee, focusing on efficiency and innovation in the payment system. United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, etc.: Many other nations are in various stages of research, consultation, and pilot programs, recognizing the potential benefits and challenges of CBDCs. This global landscape presents a complex picture. While some view CBDCs as an inevitable and necessary step for modernizing financial systems and maintaining competitive advantage, the Trump administration’s proposed block signals a strong pushback against this trend. It potentially positions the U.S. as a unique outlier, perhaps a defender of financial privacy and traditional monetary systems in a world seemingly rushing towards centralized digital cash. The question then becomes: Is the U.S. falling behind in the global race for digital currency innovation, or is it setting a new standard for protecting civil liberties in the digital age? The answer likely depends on one’s philosophical perspective on the role of government and technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of Central Bank Digital Currency in the U.S.? The proposed stance by the Trump administration creates significant uncertainty for the future of a central bank digital currency in the United States. While the Federal Reserve has been researching a potential digital dollar, publishing extensive papers and engaging in public discussions, its ultimate implementation would require strong political backing from both the executive and legislative branches. This announcement clearly undermines that backing. Key Questions and Challenges Arise: Political Feasibility: Even if a CBDC is deemed technologically feasible and economically beneficial by some, its political viability under a potentially hostile administration would be virtually nil. This could lead to a multi-year hiatus on any official U.S. CBDC development. Global Leadership: How will the U.S. maintain its global financial leadership and influence without a CBDC, especially as other nations advance their own digital currencies? Will this lead to a fragmentation of the global financial system, or will it force other nations to reconsider their own approaches? Rise of Private Alternatives: Could this void be filled by private stablecoins, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar but issued by private entities? The debate around stablecoin regulation would become even more critical, as they could effectively become the de facto “digital dollar” for many users. This could present new challenges related to systemic risk and consumer protection. Innovation and Competitiveness: Will a lack of a U.S. CBDC hinder innovation in payment systems, or will it spur greater private sector innovation in areas like instant payments, blockchain-based settlements, and decentralized finance? This policy move is not just about blocking a specific technology; it’s about defining the philosophical boundaries of government involvement in the financial lives of citizens. It sets up a fascinating ideological battleground that will likely dominate financial policy discussions for years to come, forcing a deeper societal conversation about privacy, control, and the very nature of money in a digital era. Conclusion: A Decisive Turn in the Digital Currency Debate The Trump administration’s explicit intent to block central bank digital currencies marks a pivotal and potentially transformative moment in the ongoing debate over the future of money. By prioritizing privacy, individual liberty, and limiting perceived government control, this proposed policy could reshape the landscape for traditional finance and provide an unexpected, yet significant, boost to decentralized cryptocurrencies. While much of the world appears to be moving towards exploring or even implementing CBDCs, the U.S. under a potential Trump presidency could forge a distinct and solitary path. This stance champions financial freedom and directly challenges the very notion of state-issued digital cash as an inevitable progression. The implications for global financial leadership, the evolution of payment systems, and the future trajectory of the broader crypto market are immense. This is a development that demands close attention from anyone invested in the evolving world of digital assets, as it promises to be one of the defining financial policy decisions of the coming years.

This bold Ethereum Price Prediction comes from Eric Jackson, the founder of Toronto-based hedge fund EMJ Capital, and it’s certainly capturing attention across the market. Could ETH truly reach such heights, or is this just another speculative call? Jackson’s insights suggest a confluence of powerful factors could indeed propel Ethereum to unprecedented levels. Let’s dive into the core arguments fueling this optimistic outlook. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is a $10,000 ETH Surge Truly Attainable? Eric Jackson’s confidence in a $10,000 Ethereum Price Prediction isn’t merely based on market sentiment. According to CoinDesk, his analysis points to several fundamental shifts and upcoming events that he believes the market is significantly underestimating. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding these drivers is key to evaluating the potential trajectory of ETH. It’s a target that, if realized, would mark a substantial increase from current levels and solidify Ethereum’s position as a dominant force in the digital economy. Jackson highlights four primary catalysts that he believes will converge to create a powerful upward momentum for ETH: Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Staking Approval: A major institutional gateway. Deflationary Token Economy Post-Merge: A fundamental supply-side shift. Increased Layer-2 Transaction Fees: Driving utility and ETH burn. Increased Tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs): Expanding Ethereum’s utility into traditional finance. Each of these factors, individually strong, becomes even more potent when considered together, creating a compelling narrative for Ethereum’s future valuation. The Catalytic Impact of ETH ETF Approval: An Underestimated Force? One of the most anticipated events in the crypto space is the approval of an ETH ETF . While several spot Ethereum ETFs have recently been approved for trading in the U.S., Jackson’s focus is specifically on the prospect of an ETF with staking capabilities , which he anticipates by October of this year. This distinction is crucial. What does an ETH ETF , particularly one with staking, mean for Ethereum? Currently, investors who want to earn staking rewards on their ETH must hold the asset directly and participate in the staking mechanism, which can be complex for traditional institutional investors. An ETF with staking would: Simplify Access: Allow institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to ETH and its staking yield through traditional brokerage accounts. Increase Demand: Attract a massive wave of new capital from pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers who prefer regulated, easily tradable products. Reduce Supply Pressure: ETH acquired by the ETF for staking would be locked up, reducing the circulating supply available for sale on exchanges. Jackson argues that the market is currently underestimating the sheer volume of capital that could flow into Ethereum once such a product is available. The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year provides a compelling precedent, demonstrating the significant demand from traditional finance for regulated crypto investment vehicles. The Power of Scarcity: Understanding Deflationary Ethereum Following its monumental shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with The Merge, Ethereum underwent a significant change in its tokenomics, moving towards a Deflationary Ethereum model. This is a critical, often misunderstood, aspect of its value proposition. How does Ethereum become deflationary? The mechanism primarily involves two key components: EIP-1559 (London Hard Fork): Introduced a base fee for every transaction on the Ethereum network, which is burned (permanently removed from circulation) instead of going to miners. This means that a portion of every transaction fee effectively reduces the ETH supply. Proof-of-Stake (The Merge): Replaced energy-intensive mining with staking. Stakers are rewarded with newly minted ETH, but the amount of new ETH issued is significantly less than what was previously issued to miners. When network activity is high, the amount of ETH burned via EIP-1559 can exceed the new ETH issued through staking, leading to a net reduction in the total ETH supply. This dynamic creates a scenario where ETH can become a scarce asset, similar to how a commodity becomes more valuable as its supply diminishes while demand remains constant or grows. A truly Deflationary Ethereum , where more ETH is burned than created, means that each remaining ETH becomes inherently more valuable over time, assuming consistent network usage. Fueling Growth: How Layer-2 Scaling Boosts ETH Utility and Value The rapid expansion of Layer-2 Scaling solutions is another cornerstone of Jackson’s bullish thesis. Layer-2 networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon, are built on top of the Ethereum mainnet (Layer-1) to process transactions more efficiently and at lower costs. Why are Layer-2s so important for ETH’s value? Increased Network Throughput: Layer-2s alleviate congestion on the mainnet, allowing Ethereum to handle a much larger volume of transactions than it could alone. This scalability is vital for mass adoption. Lower Transaction Fees: By bundling many Layer-2 transactions into a single transaction on Layer-1, these solutions drastically reduce costs for users, making the Ethereum ecosystem more accessible and attractive for everyday use. Direct Contribution to ETH Burn: While transactions occur on Layer-2s, they periodically ‘settle’ or ‘batch’ their data back to the Layer-1 Ethereum blockchain. These settlement transactions incur fees on Layer-1, which are subject to EIP-1559 and thus contribute to the burning of ETH. More Layer-2 activity means more Layer-1 settlement, leading to more ETH burned. Ecosystem Growth: Robust Layer-2 Scaling fosters innovation and expands the range of applications built on Ethereum, from DeFi to NFTs and gaming, driving overall demand for the network’s native token. The growth of Layer-2s is a symbiotic relationship: they enhance Ethereum’s utility, and in turn, their increased usage contributes directly to the deflationary pressure on ETH. RWA Tokenization: Unlocking New Frontiers for Ethereum’s Dominance Perhaps one of the most transformative trends highlighted by Jackson is the burgeoning field of RWA Tokenization , or Real World Asset Tokenization. This involves converting rights to physical or tangible assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, with Ethereum emerging as a leading platform for this innovation. What does RWA Tokenization entail? Imagine owning a fractional share of a skyscraper, a piece of fine art, or a government bond, all represented by a token on the Ethereum blockchain. Examples include: Real Estate: Fractional ownership of properties, making illiquid assets more accessible and tradable. Bonds and Securities: Issuing digital bonds that offer faster settlement, increased transparency, and programmable features. Commodities: Tokenizing gold, silver, or other raw materials, simplifying their transfer and storage. Intellectual Property: Tokenizing music rights, patents, or copyrights. Why is Ethereum the blockchain of choice for RWAs? Security and Decentralization: Ethereum’s robust security and decentralized nature make it a trustworthy ledger for valuable assets. Smart Contract Capabilities: Its programmable smart contracts enable complex legal agreements and automated processes to be embedded directly into the tokens. Established Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community, extensive tooling, and a vast network effect, making it a reliable foundation for institutional-grade applications. The market for tokenized RWAs is projected to reach trillions of dollars in the coming years. As more traditional assets migrate onto the Ethereum blockchain, the demand for ETH (for gas fees, collateral, or even as a base layer for these new financial instruments) is expected to surge dramatically, cementing Ethereum’s role as the foundational layer for the future of finance. Challenges and Considerations for the Road Ahead While the arguments for a $10,000 ETH are compelling, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Several factors could influence Ethereum’s journey: Regulatory Environment: Evolving regulations worldwide could impact the adoption of ETFs, Layer-2s, and RWA tokenization. Macroeconomic Conditions: Broader economic downturns, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events can affect investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Competition: While Ethereum holds a dominant position, other Layer-1 blockchains continue to innovate and compete for market share. Technical Risks: Although Ethereum’s network is robust, any unforeseen technical issues or security vulnerabilities could impact confidence. Investors should always conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with digital assets. This article provides analysis based on current information and expert opinion and should not be considered financial advice. Actionable Insights for Navigating Ethereum’s Potential Future For those looking to understand or participate in the Ethereum ecosystem, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments regarding ETH ETF approvals, Layer-2 innovations, and major RWA tokenization projects. Understand the Fundamentals: Grasping concepts like deflationary tokenomics and the role of Layer-2s provides a clearer picture of Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Consider Diversification: As with any investment, diversification across different assets can help mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and be prepared for significant price fluctuations inherent in the crypto market. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Path to New Heights? Eric Jackson’s $10,000 Ethereum Price Prediction is not just a bold statement; it’s a synthesis of powerful, interconnected trends shaping the future of digital finance. The potential approval of an ETH ETF with staking, coupled with the inherent scarcity of Deflationary Ethereum , the scalability offered by Layer-2 Scaling , and the transformative impact of RWA Tokenization , paints a compelling picture for Ethereum’s future. While the path ahead may be volatile, the fundamental drivers suggest that Ethereum is poised for a significant expansion of its utility and value. The coming months will be critical in determining if these catalysts can indeed unleash the projected surge and solidify Ethereum’s place as a cornerstone of the global economy.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As East Asia begins its business day, bitcoin is down 1.8%, trading above $117,800, as traders take some profit after BTC pushed through multiple all-time highs. While there's a belief from some market participants that the rally is just beginning, with calls for BTC to hit 160k , 200k , and further , OKX's Chief Commercial Officer, Lennex Lai warns that risk is building just as fast as market enthusiasm. ""Across platforms, we're seeing an increase in aggressive long positions and widening funding rates as ‘Crypto Week’ headlines boost sentiment,"" Lai told CoinDesk in an interview via Telegram. ""At these levels, risks can build quickly - escalation of trade tensions with the EU, Mexico, and other trading partners could trigger sharp corrections. Another risk is letting euphoria drive decisions."" Lai points to a slate of coming macro announcements – like the U.K. CPI release, and the U.S Core PPI, retail sales, and consumer sentiment, that could influence global risk sentiment and set the tone for broader markets. These concerns echo findings from K33 Research’s H1 2025 market report , which highlighted similar risks and volatility triggers earlier this year. According to K33, geopolitical turmoil and trade policy uncertainty have already driven significant market swings, such as a 30% correction to $75,000 earlier in the year. The report specifically noted, ""Bitcoin struggled in this de-risking period but showed subtle hints of relative strength vs equities by outperforming equities in the aftermath of Liberation Day."" Additionally, K33 highlighted historically low funding rates amidst rising prices, signaling cautious sentiment among seasoned traders who remain wary of abrupt market reversals. ""Annualized funding rates averaged at 4.51% throughout the half-year, the lowest average half-year funding rate since December 31, 2022,"" when the post-FTX crypto winter was at its coldest, the report said. ""In moments like this, smart traders focus on strategy over sentiment, using discipline to manage risk,"" Lai continued. ""The excitement at the top is real, but those who manage their entries, exits, and funding exposure carefully are best positioned for whatever comes next."" After all, he concluded, ""strong momentum doesn’t mean the market is invincible.""

A surge of over $100 million in new deposits this week pushed Maple’s total assets under management (AUM) to $2.9 billion, eclipsing BUIDL’s $2.3 billion. While BUIDL draws capital with its ultra-conservative exposure to short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, Maple appeals to more risk-tolerant institutions by offering yield through undercollateralized loans to vetted trading firms and crypto-native borrowers. That model, which relies on delegated credit underwriting rather than blanket overcollateralization, now appears to be scaling faster. The milestone suggests a growing appetite for yield-bearing DeFi credit products amid continued macro uncertainty. It also marks a rare instance where a decentralized credit protocol has outpaced a major TradFi incumbent like BlackRock on-chain, at least by raw AUM. AI Tokens Rally as Big Tech Doubles Down on Infrastructure AI-focused crypto tokens jumped 5% overnight, pushing the sector’s market cap to $29.6 billion, according to CoinGecko . The move comes amid a surge of AI and data infrastructure announcements from major U.S. tech firms, sparking renewed investor enthusiasm across both equity and token markets. Google said Tuesday it will invest $25 billion into data centers and AI infrastructure across the PJM electric grid, America’s largest, while also agreeing to buy 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power via a $3 billion deal with Brookfield. Meta, meanwhile, is planning “hundreds of billions” in AI data center builds, including a multi-gigawatt facility called Prometheus in Ohio. The announcements were timed around a Trump administration-led summit at Carnegie Mellon University, where over $90 billion in AI, energy, and data infrastructure pledges were revealed. The bullish tone on AI, from both government and industry, appears to be spilling into token markets, at least for now. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $117,810.33, down 1.69%, and failed breakout attempts gave way to high-volume support, narrowing consolidation, and thinning liquidity, signaling market exhaustion and anticipation ahead of the next macro catalyst, according to CoinDesk's Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum surged 2.6% to $3,066.57 in a volatile 24-hour session, rebounding from a $2,933.50 low as institutional flows, record staking, and strong volume fueled a breakout past $3,075, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Gold: Gold fell 0.56% to $3,331.55, even as a new London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) poll showed analysts turning more bullish with upgraded 2025 forecasts averaging $3,324.40—driven by geopolitical tensions, dollar weakness, and fiscal concerns, though opinions remain split on whether prices will climb toward $4,000 or fade into year-end. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets are set to open mixed after President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that includes a 19% U.S. tariff on its exports. S&P 500: The S&P 500 edged 0.4% lower after touching an intraday record, as rising Treasury yields and a 2.7% June inflation reading raised concerns over tariff-driven price pressures, despite strong bank earnings and Nvidia-led tech gains.

This groundbreaking news, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals a potentially transformative shift in how traditional finance views and integrates with the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem. What does this mean for the future of money, and why is a banking giant stepping into the realm of digital currencies? What Does Citigroup’s Stablecoin Exploration Mean for the Market? For years, the narrative around cryptocurrencies often pitted decentralized digital assets against centralized financial institutions. However, Citigroup’s reported consideration of a stablecoin changes that dynamic significantly. A stablecoin, by definition, is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to a commodity. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to offer the benefits of blockchain technology—speed, transparency, and lower transaction costs—without the price fluctuations. Citigroup’s foray into this space isn’t just another bank experimenting with blockchain; it represents a major vote of confidence from a systemic financial player. This move could: Legitimize Digital Assets: A Citigroup-backed stablecoin would bring institutional credibility to the stablecoin market, potentially accelerating broader adoption by corporations and other financial entities. Streamline Payments: Imagine instant, low-cost cross-border payments for businesses and individuals, leveraging blockchain rails instead of traditional correspondent banking networks. Open New Avenues for Innovation: It could pave the way for new financial products and services built on top of a reliable, institutionally-backed digital currency. The potential launch of a Citigroup stablecoin isn’t merely a technical endeavor; it’s a strategic move that could redefine how value is transferred and settled in the global economy. The Rise of Bank Stablecoins: A Paradigm Shift? Citigroup is not alone in recognizing the strategic importance of digital currencies. The concept of a bank stablecoin has been gaining traction, with various financial institutions and consortia exploring similar initiatives. JP Morgan’s JPM Coin, for instance, launched in 2019, serves as a wholesale payment token used for internal settlement within its blockchain-based network. This illustrates a growing trend where banks are no longer just observing the crypto space but actively participating in its evolution. Why are banks increasingly interested in stablecoins? Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Traditional payment systems are often slow, expensive, and complex, especially for international transactions. Stablecoins, built on blockchain, can offer near-instant settlement and significantly lower operational costs. Improved Liquidity Management: Banks can use stablecoins to manage their own liquidity more effectively, allowing for 24/7 operations and real-time reconciliation. New Business Models: The underlying technology can enable tokenized assets, smart contracts, and other innovative financial instruments, creating new revenue streams and services. This shift from a purely speculative asset class to a functional tool for financial infrastructure marks a pivotal moment. The embrace of a bank stablecoin by a titan like Citigroup could set a precedent for other global banks, fostering a new era of interbank digital currency exchange. Institutional Crypto Adoption: Paving the Way for Mainstream Integration The news about Citigroup underscores a broader, undeniable trend: institutional crypto adoption is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. What was once considered a fringe asset class is now becoming a legitimate component of investment portfolios, corporate treasuries, and financial infrastructure. This growing acceptance is driven by several factors: Factor Impact on Institutional Adoption Regulatory Clarity As governments and regulatory bodies begin to establish clearer frameworks, institutions gain confidence to participate. Technological Maturity Blockchain technology has matured, offering more robust, scalable, and secure solutions for institutional use cases. Client Demand High-net-worth individuals, corporations, and even retail clients are increasingly demanding access to digital asset services. Macroeconomic Factors Concerns about inflation and traditional asset performance are pushing institutions to explore alternative investments. Beyond stablecoins, institutions are exploring various facets of the crypto market, including Bitcoin ETFs, tokenized securities, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Citigroup’s move is a powerful indicator that the world’s financial heavyweights are not just dipping their toes but preparing to dive deep into the digital asset ocean. This level of institutional crypto adoption is crucial for bringing digital assets into the mainstream financial system, potentially bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. Digital Currency Innovation Beyond Bitcoin: The Stablecoin Spectrum While Bitcoin pioneered the concept of digital currency, the landscape of digital currency innovation has expanded dramatically. Stablecoins represent a significant branch of this evolution, offering stability that Bitcoin’s volatility does not. They come in various forms, each with its own mechanism for maintaining stability: Fiat-backed Stablecoins: These are the most common, like USDT, USDC, and potentially Citigroup’s stablecoin. They are backed 1:1 by reserves of fiat currency held in traditional bank accounts. Crypto-backed Stablecoins: Over-collateralized by other cryptocurrencies, such as MakerDAO’s DAI. Algorithmic Stablecoins: Maintain their peg through algorithms that adjust supply and demand, though these have faced significant challenges. It’s also important to distinguish bank-issued stablecoins from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). While both are digital forms of money, a CBDC is issued and controlled by a central bank (e.g., a digital dollar issued by the Federal Reserve), whereas a bank stablecoin is issued by a commercial bank. The former is sovereign money, the latter is commercial bank money. Both represent strides in digital currency innovation , but serve different purposes within the financial ecosystem. Citigroup’s stablecoin would operate within the commercial banking sphere, offering a new digital rail for its clients. Navigating the Financial Future: Challenges and Opportunities The journey towards a more digital financial future , particularly with the introduction of bank-issued stablecoins, is not without its hurdles. While the opportunities are immense, understanding the challenges is crucial for successful integration: Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite increasing clarity, the global regulatory landscape for stablecoins remains fragmented and evolving. Banks need clear guidelines on everything from anti-money laundering (AML) to consumer protection. Interoperability: Ensuring that a Citigroup stablecoin can seamlessly interact with other digital assets, blockchain networks, and traditional financial systems is a complex technical challenge. Scalability and Performance: For a global bank, any digital currency solution must be able to handle millions of transactions per second without compromising speed or security. Cybersecurity Risks: Digital assets are attractive targets for cybercriminals. Robust security measures are paramount to protect customer funds and maintain trust. Public Perception: Overcoming skepticism and educating the broader public about the benefits and safety of stablecoins will be an ongoing effort. Opportunities: Enhanced Global Trade: Stablecoins can dramatically reduce the friction and cost of international trade, benefiting businesses of all sizes. Financial Inclusion: By lowering transaction costs and increasing accessibility, stablecoins could potentially bring more unbanked populations into the formal financial system. New Market Creation: The ability to tokenize real-world assets (real estate, art, commodities) opens up vast new markets for investment and fractional ownership. Competitive Advantage: Banks that embrace digital currency innovation early can gain a significant competitive edge in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. For businesses and investors, the actionable insight is clear: stay informed, understand the evolving regulatory environment, and explore how these digital tools can be leveraged for efficiency and growth. The path to the financial future is being paved by these pioneering moves. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Global Finance Citigroup’s exploration of a stablecoin launch is far more than just a headline; it’s a profound signal of the ongoing convergence between traditional finance and the digital asset world. This move, if realized, would not only solidify the role of bank-issued stablecoins but also significantly accelerate institutional crypto adoption , pushing the boundaries of digital currency innovation . As major players like Citigroup commit to exploring this space, the vision of a more efficient, interconnected, and inclusive financial future powered by blockchain technology moves closer to reality. The implications for global payments, capital markets, and even everyday transactions are immense, promising a truly revolutionary shift in how we perceive and interact with money.

The renewed push has raised fears that political interference at the US central bank could spark long-term inflation and disrupt the economy. President Trump has consistently lashed out at Powell for not cutting rates repeatedly since he returned to the White House in January. His recent comments have gone even further, suggesting that Powell should step down and suggesting that he has acted to sabotage the US economy by keeping interest rates too high. Trump said that Powell’s resignation “would be a great thing” as he expressed frustration with the Fed’s refusal to lower rates, even as signals of weakening global growth are picking up. And while the president does not have the legal power to remove the Fed chair over policy disputes, his aggressive public pressure campaign has prompted speculation about a more sustained effort to meddle with the traditionally independent institution. Trump’s repeated attacks have undermined investor confidence and left many worried that a politicized Fed might lose the resolve to fight inflation in favor of providing a temporary economic boost. Markets hedge against inflation fears The financial markets have answered with one clear statement: investors are bracing for higher inflation. The yield on longer-dated US Treasury bonds has risen, indicating expectations that future interest rates will rise as inflation starts to creep up. However, analysts caution that if Trump persuades the central bank to cut rates too soon, it could trigger an overheating economy. “If markets believe that a politically-captured Fed will lower rates to stimulate growth regardless of economic consequences, long-term inflation expectations will rise, causing the curve to steepen,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at asset manager Janney Capital Management. It was difficult to predict the exact scale of the market reaction. Still, he believed the move could be significant, measured in percentage-point increases in 30-year Treasury yields rather than basis points. A steepening yield curve is of particular concern to homeowners and businesses when long-term borrowing costs rise more rapidly than short-term borrowing. Rising rates on 30-year mortgages, car loans, and corporate bonds would raise borrowing costs, crimp household budgets, and squeeze corporate profits. The dollar has also begun to wobble. The greenback fell against most other major currencies as investors anticipated looser monetary policy. Looser money tends to weaken the dollar, making imports more expensive, which throws fuel onto the fire of inflationary pressures that Trump’s trade tariffs have lit. Wall Street economists rise to the defense of Fed independence The reaction on Wall Street and across the broader business community to Trump’s campaign has been swift. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a strong warning , emphasizing that central bank independence is essential for economic stability. During a Tuesday investor call, he cautioned that undermining this independence could lead to serious, unintended consequences . Other economists agree. Most say that the Feds’ credibility lies in their ability to act without being swayed by political pressure. Suppose the markets believe that the Fed is caving to the White House. In that case, the potential for volatility is not limited to bonds, but could ripple through stocks, commodities, and various global currencies. Minutes of the Fed’s June 17–18 meeting, released last week, provided little support for a rate cut when the central bank meets next on July 29–30. Most policymakers were concerned about inflationary risks, specifically the inflationary risks posed by Trump’s protectionist trade policies. And with tariffs still in effect on tens of billions of dollars’ worth of goods, inflation pressures are already simmering. However, instead of heeding the warnings, Trump and his aides have doubled down. In recent weeks, top officials have gone on financial news programs and social media, repeating calls for lower interest rates and saying Powell should resign if he won’t bend.

Recently, a pivotal revelation from Unfolded on X highlighted how a strategic entity has significantly amplified its Bitcoin holdings , now accounting for a staggering 3% of the total circulating supply. This isn’t just another purchase; it’s a monumental statement on the future of digital assets. Unveiling the Strategic Accumulation of Bitcoin Holdings The entity in question, widely recognized as MicroStrategy, has once again demonstrated its unwavering conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Their latest acquisition of 4,225 more BTC has propelled their total Bitcoin holdings to an astounding 601,550 BTC. This move isn’t merely about adding more coins to a portfolio; it signifies a deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role as a premier treasury asset. To put this into perspective, owning 3% of the entire circulating Bitcoin holdings means MicroStrategy now controls a substantial piece of the finite 21 million BTC supply. This level of accumulation by a publicly traded company is unprecedented and sends a clear signal to both traditional finance and the broader crypto market about the potential of digital gold. It solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as a trailblazer, continuously expanding its digital reserves and influencing the narrative around corporate treasury strategies. The Profound Impact on BTC Supply and Market Dynamics What does it mean when a single entity secures such a significant portion of the finite BTC supply ? The implications are far-reaching. Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity is one of its most powerful attributes. With only 21 million coins ever to be mined, every significant accumulation reduces the available supply for new entrants and existing holders. This creates a supply shock dynamic that can exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over time. MicroStrategy’s strategy effectively ‘locks up’ a substantial amount of Bitcoin, removing it from active trading circulation and placing it into long-term strategic reserves. This reduced liquidity, coupled with increasing demand from both retail and institutional investors, can create a powerful bullish feedback loop. Here’s how such a large holding impacts the BTC supply : Reduced Liquidity: A significant portion of Bitcoin is held off-market, limiting the number of coins available for buying and selling. Increased Scarcity: Reinforces Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ narrative, highlighting its fixed supply against endless fiat currency printing. Price Floor Effect: Large, conviction-based holdings can act as a psychological price floor, as these holders are unlikely to sell into dips. Market Confidence: Signals strong belief in Bitcoin’s future from a major corporate player, encouraging others. MicroStrategy Bitcoin: A Pioneering Investment Philosophy The journey of MicroStrategy Bitcoin accumulation began in August 2020, spearheaded by its visionary co-founder and former CEO, Michael Saylor. Saylor’s unwavering conviction in Bitcoin as a superior store of value and an inflation hedge transformed MicroStrategy from a business intelligence firm into a de facto Bitcoin proxy. Their approach has been anything but conventional, opting to use various financial instruments, including convertible notes and equity offerings, to fund their aggressive purchases. Why has MicroStrategy taken such an audacious stance? Their philosophy centers on the belief that traditional fiat currencies are depreciating assets due to inflation and expansive monetary policies. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and fixed supply, offers a robust alternative. The benefits for MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy are multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: Protects corporate treasury from the erosion of purchasing power. Capital Appreciation: Positions the company to benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term price growth. Investor Attraction: Appeals to a new class of investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company. Competitive Advantage: Differentiates MicroStrategy in the market, making it a unique investment proposition. However, this bold strategy isn’t without its challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin means MicroStrategy’s balance sheet is subject to significant fluctuations, which can impact its stock price. Regulatory uncertainties and public scrutiny also remain ongoing concerns. Yet, MicroStrategy has consistently navigated these waters, doubling down on its conviction with each market cycle. The Broader Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s pioneering moves have undeniably paved the way for wider institutional Bitcoin adoption . What was once considered a niche, speculative asset is now increasingly being recognized by mainstream financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has further legitimized Bitcoin as an asset class, making it more accessible to traditional investors. We are witnessing a significant shift in how large entities view Bitcoin. Beyond MicroStrategy, various hedge funds, asset managers, and even some pension funds are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This growing trend is driven by several factors: Diversification: Bitcoin offers a low correlation to traditional assets, providing portfolio diversification benefits. Digital Gold Narrative: Its appeal as a ‘digital gold’ alternative to physical gold, particularly among younger generations. Technological Innovation: Recognition of blockchain technology’s disruptive potential. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Increasing clarity and frameworks make it safer for institutions to participate. Are we on the cusp of a new era of corporate treasury management where Bitcoin becomes a standard component? The actions of MicroStrategy certainly suggest a strong possibility, setting a precedent that others may eventually follow as the digital economy continues to evolve. Navigating Your Own Bitcoin Investment Journey For individual investors, the aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy employed by MicroStrategy offers valuable insights, though it’s crucial to remember that corporate strategies differ significantly from personal financial planning. While most individuals won’t be leveraging debt to buy Bitcoin, the core principles of conviction and a long-term outlook are highly relevant. What lessons can individual investors glean from this corporate titan’s playbook? Here are a few actionable insights for your own Bitcoin investment journey: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technology, and market dynamics before investing. Long-Term Conviction: Bitcoin’s history shows significant volatility. A long-term perspective can help weather market fluctuations. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This can smooth out your average purchase price. Secure Your Assets: Learn about self-custody options like hardware wallets to protect your Bitcoin. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin, while promising, remains a volatile asset. MicroStrategy’s bold moves underscore the growing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin within the financial world. Their strategy highlights the potential for significant gains but also the need for a robust, well-thought-out approach to Bitcoin investment . A Legacy of Conviction: Bitcoin’s Enduring Appeal The recent boost in MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings to 3% of the circulating BTC supply is more than just a news headline; it’s a testament to a pioneering MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy that continues to shape the landscape of institutional Bitcoin adoption . This relentless accumulation reinforces Bitcoin’s scarcity and its growing role as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainties. As the digital asset space matures, MicroStrategy’s unwavering commitment serves as a powerful case study, encouraging a deeper look into the long-term potential of Bitcoin investment . Their actions not only validate Bitcoin’s position as a formidable asset but also challenge conventional treasury management, paving the way for a more digitally-native financial future.

She emphasized that a suitable trade agreement must be reached by the August 1 deadline. The announcement came after it pledged to impose a 30% tariff threat on the country’s imports to the US, that is, if it failed to succeed in its mission to put an end to drug cartels. In a statement, Sheinbaum clarified their motive, stating that they only need a fair agreement with the US. According to her, if it fails to provide one by August 1, they will be forced to take steps that they will inform them about. Mexico-US trade agreement faces growing uncertainties amid Trump’s tariff threats Washington had earlier announced plans to impose a 17% duty on fresh tomatoes imported to the US from Mexico. This did not please Mexico’s president. Respondingly, Sheinbaum hoped to make known the measures the country would take, including for tomato farmers, to counter the tariff threat. Sheibaum stated that they believed they could reach an agreement with the US. However, based on her argument, it was essential to have a backup plan since they needed to get ready for all possibilities. Notably, Mexico is pivotal in importing fresh tomatoes to the US. According to data from sources, the country imports approximately two-thirds of the fresh tomatoes consumed in the US. In the meantime, the US Commerce Department announced a cancellation of a 2019 trade agreement with Mexico that ended an investigation on Mexico’s countervailing duty. This amounted to a valuation of $3 billion of Mexican exports to the US annually. Mexico’s tomato export agreement was first made in 1996, whereby the two governments vowed to control it and resolve US allegations against Mexico concerning “unfair trade” practices. The agreement was updated six years ago to stop an investigation into dumping and settle tariff issues. On the other hand, Trump is still focused on striking as many trade deals as possible, and he pledges to impose his threatening tariffs on nearly all of his trading partners. Mexico vows that no other country can substitute Mexican tomatoes in the US market Following the US’s assertion to withdraw from the tomato agreement with Mexico, Mexico demonstrated strong confidence in renewing the agreement. The economy and agriculture ministries considered the 17.09% duty on Mexican tomatoes imported to the United States unfairly “underpriced.” Based on their argument, it did not favour Mexican producers and the US industry’s interests. To curb this, the Mexican government intends to support its tomato farmers and expand its market overseas as it negotiates a deal to strip out the tomato duty. A coalition of five Mexican agriculture associations, including representatives from Baja California and Sinaloa states, said they would work with the Mexican government to develop more solutions to the problem. They acknowledged that no other country can substitute Mexican tomatoes in the market, which they have developed through hard work and creativity over the last 120 years. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick shared his view on the topic of discussion. According to Lutnick, unfair trade practices have hurt their farmers by lowering the prices of their crops, such as tomatoes. Trump reveals plans to impose a 10% tariff rate on smaller US trade partners US President Donald Trump recently announced that letters with trade agreement terms and tariff rates will be sent to smaller US trade partners before the August 1 deadline. He hinted at a 10% tariff rate on these countries. After attending an event in Pittsburgh, Trump mentioned that he was pleased with simple agreements. This came after the announcement unveiled that nearly 20 nations have already been subjected to tariff rates, as other countries were next in line. Afterward, Trump said they would send out a letter soon addressing tariff rates for several smaller countries. According to him, they will likely establish one tariff for all of them, probably just above 10%.

This came only hours after Scott himself said he’d be “happy to do it” if asked. The timing was insane. One moment, the Treasury Secretary was on Bloomberg TV talking like a front-runner. The next, Trump shut it down in front of reporters, saying Scott isn’t at the top of his list. His reason ? “Because I like the job he’s doing.” The blunt rejection also came after Scott had already confirmed that a “formal process” had begun to find a Jerome Powell replacement. Scott even admitted he’s part of that process and said, “It’s President Trump’s decision, and it will move at his speed.” Well, it did. Scott reacts, but Trump drags Powell instead Earlier that same day, Scott had taken shots at Powell in that Bloomberg interview. He said Powell should step down from the Fed entirely when his chair term ends in May 2026. Scott argued that keeping Powell around past that date would send the wrong signal. “There’s been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion,” Scott said. “And I can tell you, I think it’d be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on also.” Scott was making a clear pitch for a clean break, pushing the idea that the next Fed chair should start fresh, with no Powell hanging around to cloud the waters. It’s worth noting that Powell’s term as a Fed governor doesn’t end until January 2028. That gives him the legal option to stay at the central bank for almost two full years after stepping down as chair, nearly till the end of Trump’s term. But Trump isn’t even waiting that long. He’s pissed about the whole renovation saga at the Federal Reserve’s headquarters. “I think he’s a total stiff,” Trump told reporters about Powell. “But the one thing I didn’t see him as is the guy that needed a palace to live in.” He also called the cost overruns “pretty disgraceful,” hinting it could be a fireable offense. Powell’s side of the story says the media reports were inaccurate. This week, he even requested the bank’s Inspector General to investigate the matter. Doesn’t seem to matter. Trump’s already decided Powell doesn’t belong in that seat anymore. He’s said before that Powell keeps rates too high. And he’s made it very clear he wants someone who’s ready to slash them. Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh lead the race With Scott now pushed to the side, Trump’s pick seems to be leaning toward Kevin Hassett or Kevin Warsh. Reports say the two are front-runners in what one White House insider called an “Apprentice-style” contest. Yes, that’s real. Apparently , Trump is running this whole thing like a reality show. Scott is advising on the selection, but it’s obvious now that his name’s been scratched off the list unless everyone else fails. Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, has been in Trump’s orbit for a while now. He used to be seen as a moderate economist with a neutral political stance, but that’s so over now. These days, he is a full-blown MAGA mouthpiece. He goes on TV echoing all of Trump’s views, whether it’s on inflation, interest rates, or tariffs. He also hasn’t been shy about attacking Powell either. Just this month on Fox Business, he slammed the Fed for lowering rates before last year’s election and then holding them steady because of tariff-driven inflation risks. “I think that that raises the specter that they’re not being non-partisan, they’re not being independent,” Hassett said. Warsh, on the other hand, has kept a lower profile but is still a serious name in the mix. He’s a former Fed governor, and Trump is reportedly impressed with him. He’s not out there doing interviews, but insiders say his name keeps coming up. Still, it’s Hassett who’s making the most noise. Scott did say that there are “a lot of great candidates,” but now it’s obvious he’s not one of them. That “I’ll do it if asked” moment is now just another quote in the press cycle. Trump slammed the door right after he cracked it open. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This bombshell announcement sends ripples through traditional financial markets and inevitably sparks discussions within the cryptocurrency space, where market sentiment is highly sensitive to shifts in economic leadership and policy. Such a direct challenge to the Fed’s top official highlights growing discontent over current economic strategies and could signal significant turbulence ahead for investors across all asset classes. Who is William Pulte and What’s His Concern for the Housing Market? To understand the weight of this call, it’s crucial to know who William Pulte is and the role of the FHFA. As the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Pulte oversees crucial entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are central to the U.S. housing finance system. His agency’s primary mission is to ensure the stability and liquidity of the housing market, a sector that has been particularly sensitive to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions over the past few years. Pulte’s concerns likely stem from the direct impact of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes on housing affordability and market activity. Higher interest rates translate to more expensive mortgages, cooling demand, and potentially stressing homeowners and the broader real estate sector. Given his mandate, it’s natural for Pulte to voice strong opinions when he perceives policies are undermining the stability of the very market he is tasked to protect. This direct intervention underscores a deep-seated apprehension regarding the current trajectory of the economy and the Fed’s role in it, particularly as it pertains to the foundational housing sector. The Unprecedented Call for Jerome Powell’s Resignation The call for Jerome Powell to step down is not just a political statement; it’s a rare and potent critique from within the upper echelons of U.S. financial leadership. While criticism of the Fed Chair is not uncommon, an outright demand for resignation from a sitting agency head is highly unusual and signals a significant fracture in the perceived unity of economic policymakers. This public challenge indicates that the disagreements are profound, extending beyond mere policy differences to a fundamental distrust in leadership or strategy. The specifics of Pulte’s reasoning, beyond general discontent with economic conditions, would likely center on the efficacy and consequences of the Federal Reserve’s actions. Was it the pace of rate hikes? The communication strategy? Or perhaps a perceived misjudgment of inflation’s persistence? Whatever the precise grievances, this public demand elevates the discussion from policy debate to a crisis of confidence, demanding immediate attention from markets and the public alike. Why Now? Unpacking the Federal Reserve’s Economic Strategy and Challenges The timing of Pulte’s call is critical, coming amidst ongoing debates about inflation, interest rates, and the broader health of the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve, under Jerome Powell’s leadership, embarked on an aggressive campaign to combat soaring inflation, raising the federal funds rate from near zero to over 5% in a relatively short period. This strategy, while aimed at cooling the economy and bringing prices down, has had significant side effects. Inflation Battle: The Fed’s primary mandate is price stability. While inflation has cooled from its peak, it remains above the Fed’s 2% target, leading to persistent concerns about the cost of living for American households. Interest Rate Hikes: These hikes have impacted borrowing costs across the board, from mortgages and auto loans to business investments. While necessary to curb inflation, they also carry the risk of slowing economic growth too much, potentially leading to a recession. Labor Market Dynamics: The Fed has walked a tightrope, aiming to cool the labor market without causing widespread job losses. The unemployment rate has remained remarkably low, but some argue that this indicates the Fed’s policies haven’t been restrictive enough, or that the full effects are yet to be felt. Financial Stability Concerns: Rapid rate changes can expose vulnerabilities in the financial system, as seen with regional bank failures in 2023. Ensuring overall financial stability is another key aspect of the Fed’s responsibilities. Pulte’s intervention suggests that, from his vantage point overseeing the housing sector, the current approach is either insufficient, misguided, or causing unacceptable collateral damage. It highlights the tension between the Fed’s broad economic mandate and the specific impacts felt by different sectors of the economy. What Does This Mean for Overall Economic Stability? A public call for the Fed Chair’s resignation introduces a layer of uncertainty that can directly impact overall economic stability . The Federal Reserve’s independence and perceived competence are cornerstones of investor confidence, both domestically and internationally. When these are questioned, particularly by another high-ranking financial official, it can lead to market jitters and a re-evaluation of economic forecasts. Here’s how such an event could play out: Aspect Potential Impact Market Confidence Increased volatility in stock, bond, and currency markets as investors price in political uncertainty and potential policy shifts. Policy Outlook Questions arise about the continuity of monetary policy. Will the Fed be pressured to change course? This uncertainty can delay investment decisions. Political Pressure The call might embolden other critics, leading to more political scrutiny of the Fed’s actions, potentially undermining its independence. International Perception Global investors may view U.S. economic leadership as less stable, potentially impacting capital flows and the dollar’s strength. For the average consumer and business, this translates to heightened uncertainty regarding future interest rates, inflation, and employment prospects. It underscores the delicate balance the Federal Reserve must maintain and the immense pressure its leadership faces from various stakeholders. The Ripple Effect: Implications for Crypto Markets and Investors While the call for Jerome Powell’s resignation is rooted in traditional finance and economic policy, its implications are profoundly relevant for cryptocurrency markets. Crypto assets, despite their decentralized nature, are not immune to macroeconomic headwinds and the broader sentiment in global financial markets. Here’s why this matters for crypto investors: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding central bank leadership and future monetary policy often leads to increased volatility across all asset classes, including Bitcoin and altcoins. Investors might seek safe havens or reduce risk exposure, impacting crypto prices. Dollar Strength: Any perceived weakening of U.S. economic leadership or stability could impact the U.S. dollar. While a weaker dollar can sometimes be seen as bullish for crypto (as a hedge against inflation), uncertainty can also drive capital towards more established safe havens or out of risky assets entirely. Interest Rate Expectations: If the call for resignation leads to speculation about a shift in Fed policy (e.g., a faster pivot to rate cuts or a more aggressive stance), it could significantly influence crypto market dynamics. Lower interest rates generally make riskier assets like crypto more attractive. Regulatory Scrutiny: Periods of economic instability often bring increased regulatory scrutiny across financial sectors, including crypto. Policymakers might seek to tighten controls to prevent further perceived risks. For crypto investors, the key actionable insight is to remain vigilant. Monitor official statements from the FHFA and the Federal Reserve, observe market reactions, and consider diversifying portfolios to mitigate risks associated with sudden shifts in economic policy or leadership. This event serves as a stark reminder that even the most innovative and decentralized markets are still intertwined with the decisions made by traditional financial authorities. Concluding Thoughts: A Critical Juncture for U.S. Economic Leadership William Pulte’s public demand for Jerome Powell’s resignation marks a critical juncture for U.S. economic leadership. It underscores the immense pressures faced by policymakers grappling with persistent inflation, a sensitive housing market, and the overarching goal of maintaining financial stability . While the immediate outcome of this call remains uncertain, it has undeniably ignited a fierce debate about the effectiveness of current monetary policy and the direction of the U.S. economy. This development serves as a powerful reminder that even the most influential positions in global finance are subject to intense scrutiny and criticism, especially when economic challenges persist. The ripple effects of such a high-profile disagreement will undoubtedly be felt across all sectors, from the housing market to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, making it a situation worth closely monitoring for anyone with a stake in the global financial landscape.

For those looking to gain exposure to innovative blockchain technologies through regulated channels, Grayscale Investments has consistently been a frontrunner. Their latest announcement marks another significant step: the opening of the Grayscale SUI Trust to eligible accredited investors. This move is more than just a new product offering; it signifies a growing institutional interest in promising Layer 1 blockchains like Sui and expands the avenues for sophisticated capital to enter the crypto space. What Exactly is the Grayscale SUI Trust? Grayscale Investments, a leading digital currency asset manager, has announced the availability of its SUI Trust. This trust is designed to provide accredited investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to the native asset of the Sui blockchain, SUI, without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. Think of it as a traditional investment vehicle that holds SUI tokens on behalf of its investors. Here’s a breakdown of what this means: Simplified Access: Investors can gain exposure to SUI through a familiar trust structure, similar to how one might invest in a gold ETF. Custody and Security: Grayscale handles the secure custody of the underlying SUI tokens, mitigating the risks associated with self-custody. Regulatory Compliance: The trust operates within a regulated framework, which can be appealing to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals who prioritize compliance. This offering underscores Grayscale’s commitment to broadening the spectrum of digital assets available through regulated investment products, further legitimizing the asset class for a wider audience. Diving Deeper into the Sui Blockchain The core asset of this new trust is SUI, the native cryptocurrency of the Sui blockchain . But what makes Sui noteworthy enough for Grayscale to launch a dedicated trust? Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs, a team largely composed of former Meta (Facebook) engineers who worked on the Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain project. It stands out for its unique approach to scalability and performance, designed to support high-throughput applications and a user-friendly Web3 experience. Key features include: Move Language: Sui utilizes a Rust-based programming language called Move, specifically designed for secure and verifiable smart contracts. Its object-centric model enhances security and enables parallel transaction execution. Parallel Execution: Unlike many traditional blockchains that process transactions sequentially, Sui can process independent transactions in parallel. This significantly boosts its throughput and reduces latency, making it ideal for gaming, DeFi, and social applications. Scalability: Sui’s architecture is built for horizontal scaling, meaning its capacity can increase with more computational resources, making it future-proof for mass adoption. Low Transaction Fees: Designed to offer predictable and low transaction fees, improving the user experience for dApp interactions. Sui aims to be a foundational layer for the next generation of Web3 applications, focusing on developer experience and user adoption. Its innovative design principles position it as a strong contender in the competitive Layer 1 landscape. Why Are Accredited Investors Crypto Opportunities So Crucial? The term accredited investors crypto refers to individuals or entities that meet specific income or net worth requirements, making them eligible to invest in certain complex or higher-risk securities. For Grayscale’s SUI Trust, this means the offering is not open to the general public. Why is this distinction important? Here’s why accredited investor access is a significant development: Risk Mitigation: Regulators often restrict certain investments to accredited investors because these individuals are presumed to have the financial sophistication and capacity to absorb potential losses from less liquid or more volatile investments. Institutional Gateway: Many institutional investors, such as hedge funds, family offices, and endowments, operate under strict mandates that often require them to invest in regulated products. Grayscale trusts provide a compliant pathway for them to gain crypto exposure. Market Maturation: The participation of accredited investors signals a growing acceptance and maturation of the digital asset market. Their involvement brings significant capital and often a long-term perspective, contributing to market stability and growth. Product Innovation: By catering to this segment, Grayscale can launch more specialized and diverse products, pushing the boundaries of what’s available in the crypto investment landscape. For accredited investors, the SUI Trust offers a compelling opportunity to diversify their portfolios with exposure to a high-growth potential blockchain, managed by a reputable asset manager. The Broader Impact: Driving Digital Asset Investment Forward Grayscale’s continuous expansion of its product suite, including the new SUI Trust, plays a pivotal role in accelerating digital asset investment across the board. By packaging individual cryptocurrencies into accessible, regulated investment vehicles, Grayscale bridges the gap between traditional finance and the nascent crypto market. Consider the ripple effects: Increased Liquidity: As more capital flows into these trusts, it can indirectly contribute to the liquidity of the underlying assets in the broader market. Price Discovery: Institutional interest often leads to more robust price discovery mechanisms and can reduce volatility over the long term as market depth increases. Education and Awareness: Each new product launch brings renewed attention to the underlying blockchain technology, fostering greater understanding and potentially wider adoption. Competitive Landscape: Grayscale’s moves often spur other financial institutions to explore similar offerings, leading to a more competitive and innovative digital asset investment landscape. The SUI Trust is not just about Sui; it’s about the ongoing trend of financial innovation making digital assets more palatable for a wider array of sophisticated investors. Accelerating Institutional Crypto Adoption: Grayscale’s Strategic Role Grayscale has long been a trailblazer in facilitating institutional crypto adoption . From its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to its newer offerings, the firm has consistently provided pathways for traditional investors to participate in the crypto economy. The launch of the SUI Trust reinforces this strategic position. Why is institutional adoption so critical for the crypto market? Aspect Impact of Institutional Adoption Market Maturity Adds stability, depth, and legitimacy to the market, moving it beyond speculative retail trading. Capital Inflow Brings significant capital, which can drive demand, innovation, and infrastructure development. Regulatory Clarity Increased institutional participation often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Innovation & Infrastructure Demands from institutions drive the development of more robust trading platforms, custody solutions, and analytical tools. The SUI Trust is another testament to Grayscale’s vision of making digital assets a mainstream investment class. By offering exposure to a high-performance blockchain like Sui, they are not only providing a new investment avenue but also validating the potential of emerging blockchain technologies. Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges While the Grayscale SUI Trust presents an exciting opportunity, it’s crucial for eligible investors to consider both the potential benefits and inherent challenges: Benefits: Diversification: Adds exposure to an emerging Layer 1 blockchain, diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ease of Investment: Simple access through a familiar trust structure, avoiding direct crypto management. Security: Professional custody and management of the underlying assets. Potential Growth: Sui’s technological advancements and ecosystem growth could lead to significant appreciation of SUI. Challenges & Considerations: Accredited Investor Requirement: Limited to a specific class of investors. Premium/Discount: Grayscale trusts can sometimes trade at a premium or discount to their underlying net asset value (NAV), which can impact returns. Liquidity: While Grayscale trusts are traded, they might not offer the same liquidity as direct on-exchange crypto holdings. Regulatory Risk: The digital asset space is still evolving, and future regulatory changes could impact the trust. Market Volatility: The underlying SUI token, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to high price volatility. Prospective investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consult with financial advisors to assess if this investment aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance. A Compelling Summary: The Future is Trust-Based Grayscale’s decision to open its SUI Trust to accredited investors marks a significant milestone for both the Sui blockchain and the broader digital asset investment landscape. It offers a regulated, accessible pathway for sophisticated capital to gain exposure to an innovative Layer 1 blockchain, underscoring the growing confidence in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. This move not only expands Grayscale’s impressive portfolio but also reinforces its pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future. As institutional interest continues to grow, such trusts will likely become even more vital in shaping the trajectory of digital asset adoption globally.

United States President Donald Trump’s second son, Eric Trump, recently said that half a Bitcoin will be a huge amount of money soon and predicted the crypto could hit $1 million in the mid‑term. Those comments add to a chorus of bullish voices. Millionaires Feel The Squeeze Based on analysis from Binance co‑founder Changpeng Zhao, the $1 million mark isn’t far off. He told investors that it could happen in this bull cycle. Brandon Green of BTC Inc. agreed, forecasting a similar timeframe for liftoff.

The UK government is setting the stage for a groundbreaking initiative, empowering its wholesale financial market to delve deep into the potential of UK DLT and tokenization. This isn’t just about adopting new tech; it’s about fundamentally reshaping how financial transactions are conducted, promising unprecedented efficiency, transparency, and innovation. What is Driving Wholesale Finance DLT Adoption? The global financial landscape is constantly evolving, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) is at the forefront of this transformation. For the wholesale financial market, DLT offers a compelling proposition: the ability to streamline complex processes, reduce intermediaries, and enhance security. Imagine a world where asset transfers are instantaneous, settlement risks are minimized, and audit trails are immutable. This is the promise of wholesale finance DLT . Traditionally, wholesale financial markets, which include large-scale transactions between institutions like banks, investment funds, and corporations, have been characterized by multi-party reconciliation, lengthy settlement cycles, and and high operational costs. DLT, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides a shared, immutable ledger that all participants can access and verify in real-time. This shared source of truth can drastically cut down on reconciliation efforts and associated risks. Key drivers for DLT adoption in wholesale finance include: Efficiency Gains: Automating manual processes and reducing settlement times from days to seconds. Cost Reduction: Lowering operational expenses by minimizing intermediaries and manual reconciliation. Enhanced Transparency: Providing a single, immutable record visible to all authorized participants. Reduced Risk: Mitigating counterparty risk and operational errors through automation and shared ledgers. Unlocking Transformative DLT Use Cases The UK’s strategic move is centered on identifying and nurturing the most impactful DLT use cases within its wholesale financial sector. This proactive approach aims to move beyond theoretical discussions to practical, implementable solutions that can deliver tangible benefits. The potential applications are vast and varied, touching almost every facet of wholesale finance. Let’s explore some of the most promising DLT applications: DLT Use Case Description Potential Benefits Digital Bonds & Securities Issuing and managing traditional bonds and other securities as digital tokens on a DLT platform. Instant settlement, fractional ownership, reduced issuance costs, increased liquidity. Repurchase Agreements (Repos) Executing repo transactions on a DLT, facilitating collateral management and cash settlement. Automated lifecycle management, real-time collateral adjustments, reduced counterparty risk. Fund Management & Distribution Tokenizing fund units to streamline subscription, redemption, and transfer processes. Improved transparency, lower administration fees, broader access for investors.

The Power of Tokenization Solutions in the UK Hand-in-hand with DLT, tokenization solutions are poised to revolutionize how assets are owned, traded, and managed. Tokenization involves representing real-world assets (like real estate, art, or even commodities) or traditional financial instruments (like stocks and bonds) as digital tokens on a blockchain or DLT. Each token can represent a share of ownership, making assets more liquid, divisible, and accessible. The UK’s focus on tokenization signals a clear intent to unlock new avenues for capital formation and investment. For the wholesale market, tokenization means: Increased Liquidity: Making illiquid assets more tradable by dividing them into smaller, tokenized units. Fractional Ownership: Enabling multiple investors to own a portion of a high-value asset, democratizing investment. Automated Compliance: Embedding regulatory rules directly into the tokens themselves via smart contracts, ensuring compliance at every step. Reduced Intermediaries: Cutting out layers of brokers and custodians, leading to lower costs and faster transactions. The regulatory sandbox approach being considered by the UK is crucial here. It allows for controlled experimentation with tokenized securities and other assets, providing a safe space for innovation while ensuring consumer protection and market stability. Fostering Financial Innovation in a Regulated Environment The UK’s ambition is not just to adopt new technology but to lead in financial innovation . This involves creating a regulatory framework that is both forward-looking and robust. The government’s plan to enable the wholesale market to identify DLT use cases is a testament to this commitment. It acknowledges that innovation thrives when industry and regulators collaborate to understand the nuances and implications of emerging technologies. Key aspects of the UK’s approach to fostering innovation include: Regulatory Sandboxes: Providing a controlled environment for firms to test innovative products and services without immediate full regulatory burden. Task Forces & Working Groups: Bringing together industry experts, regulators, and technologists to discuss challenges and opportunities. Policy Development: Crafting clear and adaptable regulations that support DLT adoption while mitigating risks like market manipulation, cybersecurity threats, and money laundering. This balanced approach is vital. It allows the UK to capitalize on the benefits of DLT and tokenization without compromising the stability and integrity of its financial system. By proactively engaging with the wholesale market, the government ensures that policy development is informed by real-world needs and challenges. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the potential is immense, the journey to widespread DLT adoption in wholesale finance is not without its hurdles. Key challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring a consistent and clear legal framework across jurisdictions.

This isn’t just a symbolic gesture; it’s a tangible commitment to embracing digital innovation, with three Bitcoin mining rigs now operating 24/7 within the hallowed halls of city hall. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital assets and their integration into mainstream society, this development marks a pivotal moment, signaling a potential new era for how cities manage resources and engage with emerging technologies. Fort Worth Bitcoin Mining: A Groundbreaking Initiative at City Hall The news, initially reported by Fox News 4 and amplified by Walter Bloomberg on X, confirms that Fort Worth has installed three Bitmain Antminer S9 rigs, which will run continuously for a six-month trial period. While three rigs might seem like a modest start in the vast landscape of global Bitcoin mining operations, the significance lies not in the scale, but in the precedent. This isn’t a private enterprise; it’s a municipal government, a public entity, directly participating in the decentralized network of Bitcoin. This bold step by Fort Worth’s city leadership demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and digital currencies to contribute to local economies and public services. The decision to place these rigs within city hall itself is particularly symbolic. It brings a cutting-edge technology, often perceived as abstract or complex, directly into the heart of civic administration. This physical presence can serve as a powerful educational tool, demystifying Bitcoin for citizens and potentially fostering greater understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It’s a clear statement that Fort Worth is not just observing the digital revolution; it’s actively participating in it, aiming to harness its benefits for its residents. The Strategic Vision Behind Municipal Crypto Adoption: Why Now? Why would a city embark on a municipal crypto mining venture? The rationale extends beyond mere novelty. Fort Worth’s initiative is rooted in a strategic vision to position the city as a hub for technology and innovation. In an increasingly digital world, cities are competing to attract talent, investment, and future-proof industries. By embracing Bitcoin mining, Fort Worth signals its openness to new ideas and its willingness to experiment with disruptive technologies. Several key drivers likely influenced this decision: Economic Diversification: Exploring new revenue streams beyond traditional taxes and fees. Bitcoin mining, while volatile, offers a unique opportunity to generate income directly from a global digital asset. Innovation Hub Development: Attracting blockchain companies, developers, and enthusiasts to the city, fostering a vibrant tech ecosystem. This can lead to job creation and economic growth in emerging sectors. Public Awareness and Education: Serving as a tangible example of blockchain technology in action, which can help educate the public and local businesses about its potential applications. Future-Proofing Infrastructure: Gaining hands-on experience with decentralized technologies that may play a significant role in future public services, from supply chain management to secure record-keeping. This proactive stance by Fort Worth’s leadership suggests a long-term view on the role of digital assets in the global economy, aiming to secure a competitive edge for the city in the evolving technological landscape. Unpacking the Benefits of City Hall Bitcoin Mining: What’s in it for Fort Worth? While the immediate financial gains from three mining rigs might be modest, the benefits of this city hall Bitcoin project extend far beyond simple revenue. Fort Worth is investing in experience, visibility, and future potential. Let’s delve into the multi-faceted advantages: Potential Revenue Generation Every block mined contributes Bitcoin to the miner. While the three S9 rigs are not industrial-scale operations, they will generate a continuous, albeit small, stream of Bitcoin. Over time, and especially if Bitcoin’s value appreciates, these earnings could contribute to city coffers, potentially funding public services or further technological initiatives. This creates a novel, non-tax-based revenue stream, diversifying the city’s financial portfolio. Energy Efficiency and Sustainability (A Key Discussion Point) One of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin mining is its energy consumption. However, Fort Worth’s approach could serve as a case study in responsible mining. Many municipalities have access to existing infrastructure and potentially underutilized energy capacity, especially during off-peak hours. If the city can power these rigs using excess or renewable energy sources, it transforms a perceived negative into a positive, showcasing how Bitcoin mining can be integrated sustainably. The small scale also means minimal additional load on the grid, making it an efficient use of existing resources. Establishing Technological Leadership By being the first U.S. city to directly mine Bitcoin, Fort Worth immediately gains recognition as a pioneer. This enhances its brand as an innovative and tech-forward city, which can attract tech companies, startups, and skilled workers looking for an environment that embraces emerging technologies. This leadership position can lead to a virtuous cycle of innovation and economic growth. Public Education and Engagement The presence of mining rigs at city hall offers a unique opportunity for public engagement. Imagine school groups visiting, learning about blockchain, and seeing Bitcoin mining in action. This hands-on exposure can demystify complex concepts, foster digital literacy, and inspire a new generation of tech innovators within the community. It turns an abstract concept into a tangible reality. Navigating the Challenges of Public Sector Blockchain: What Are the Risks? No pioneering venture comes without its challenges, and Fort Worth’s foray into public sector blockchain is no exception. While the benefits are compelling, the city must also prudently manage potential risks and criticisms. Market Volatility of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. The value of the mined Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, impacting the revenue generated. The city will need a clear strategy for managing these assets, whether holding them, converting them to fiat, or using them for specific purposes, to mitigate financial risk. Energy Consumption and Environmental Concerns Despite the small scale, any mention of Bitcoin mining often triggers concerns about its environmental footprint. Fort Worth will need to be transparent about the energy source for its rigs and demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. Proactive communication and, ideally, reliance on renewable energy or utilizing excess power, will be crucial to maintaining public support. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. While Bitcoin mining itself is generally legal, future regulations regarding digital asset holdings by municipal entities could emerge. Fort Worth will need to stay abreast of these developments and adapt its operations accordingly. Security Risks Operating Bitcoin mining rigs, even on a small scale, involves security considerations. Protecting the physical hardware from theft or damage, and safeguarding the digital wallets where mined Bitcoin is stored, are paramount. Cybersecurity measures must be robust to prevent hacking attempts or other malicious activities. Public Acceptance and Skepticism Not everyone is a crypto enthusiast. Some citizens may view this initiative with skepticism, seeing it as a waste of taxpayer money or an unnecessary risk. Effective public relations and transparent reporting on the project’s performance will be essential to build trust and demonstrate value to the broader community. Fort Worth’s Bold Step: A Precedent for Crypto Adoption Across the Nation? Fort Worth’s decision could be a significant turning point for broader crypto adoption within governmental structures across the United States. When a city takes such a visible and direct step, it sends a powerful message that cryptocurrencies are not just for tech enthusiasts or private investors, but are legitimate tools with potential applications for public good. This initiative could inspire other municipalities to: Explore Similar Mining Ventures: Cities with favorable energy costs or renewable energy surpluses might consider their own small-scale mining operations as a new revenue source. Investigate Blockchain for Public Services: Beyond mining, cities might look into using blockchain for more secure record-keeping, transparent voting systems, efficient supply chain management for municipal procurements, or even issuing municipal bonds on a blockchain. Accept Cryptocurrency Payments: If cities are comfortable mining Bitcoin, they might become more open to accepting Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for taxes, fees, or utility payments, enhancing convenience for citizens. Foster Local Crypto Economies: By embracing crypto at a municipal level, cities can encourage local businesses to also adopt digital assets, potentially creating localized crypto economies that attract new businesses and talent. Fort Worth is essentially running a live experiment, and the results of their six-month trial will be closely watched. A successful outcome could provide a blueprint for other cities, demonstrating that prudent engagement with cryptocurrencies can yield tangible benefits and contribute to urban innovation. What Lies Ahead: The Future of Fort Worth’s Bitcoin Venture The initial six-month trial period will be crucial for Fort Worth. During this time, the city will likely monitor the performance of the rigs, the revenue generated, the energy consumption, and public reception. The insights gained will inform future decisions regarding the scalability and long-term viability of the project. Possible future scenarios include: Expansion: If the trial is successful and the benefits outweigh the challenges, Fort Worth might consider expanding its mining operations, perhaps by adding more rigs or exploring larger-scale facilities. Integration into Broader Blockchain Strategy: The mining initiative could be just the first step in a more comprehensive blockchain strategy for the city, exploring applications in smart contracts for city services, digital identity, or even municipal stablecoins. Data Transparency: To maintain public trust and provide valuable lessons for other cities, Fort Worth would ideally publish regular reports on the project’s performance, including revenue, energy usage, and operational costs. Collaboration: The city might seek partnerships with private sector blockchain companies to enhance its capabilities, provide expertise, or explore joint ventures. Fort Worth’s pioneering spirit sets a powerful example. Their willingness to explore new frontiers in technology, even in the traditionally conservative public sector, marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more digitally integrated future. The world will be watching to see how this bold experiment unfolds and what lessons it offers for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in civic life.

The crypto community certainly hoped so. After months, even years, of anticipation, two pivotal pieces of cryptocurrency legislation were on the cusp of reaching the House floor for a full vote. Yet, in a dramatic turn of events, those hopes were dashed. House Republicans, unable to muster the necessary votes for a procedural motion, effectively blocked these crucial crypto bills from advancing, leaving the future of US crypto regulation hanging in the balance. This unexpected halt has sent ripples through the market and raised significant questions about the path forward for digital asset policy. What Just Happened with US Crypto Regulation? The legislative process in the U.S. Congress can be complex, and often, the biggest hurdles aren’t the final votes on a bill’s substance, but the procedural steps required to even get it to the floor. In this instance, House Republicans attempted to bring two significant cryptocurrency bills – widely believed to be the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and a stablecoin bill – to a plenary vote under a ‘suspension of the rules’ procedure. This method is typically used for non-controversial bills or those with broad bipartisan support, as it requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass. Unfortunately, the procedural motion failed. This means that despite the efforts of proponents, these bills could not bypass the usual committee processes and be fast-tracked for a full House vote. The immediate consequence is a significant delay, and potentially, the shelving of these specific legislative efforts for the foreseeable future. Infinity Hedge, reporting via Telegram, aptly summarized the sentiment: this will not be the ‘crypto week’ in the U.S. that many had eagerly awaited. Why Did the Procedural Motion Fail, and What Does It Mean for Cryptocurrency Legislation? The failure of a procedural motion often signals deeper divisions than might appear on the surface. While the exact reasons for the lack of two-thirds support aren’t always immediately clear, several factors could have contributed: Bipartisan Disagreement: Despite some bipartisan efforts on crypto, significant disagreements persist between Democrats and Republicans on the scope, nature, and oversight of digital assets. Some Democrats may view these bills as too favorable to the industry or lacking sufficient consumer protections. Internal Party Divisions: Even within the Republican caucus, there might be differing opinions on how to approach crypto regulation, leading to a lack of unanimous support needed for a supermajority vote. Regulatory Turf Wars: The debate over which existing agencies (e.g., SEC vs. CFTC) should have primary oversight over various digital assets continues to be a contentious issue, complicating legislative efforts. Timing and Priorities: With a busy legislative calendar and an election year looming, some members may have prioritized other issues or felt there wasn’t enough time to properly debate such complex legislation under a fast-track procedure. For cryptocurrency legislation, this failure is a major setback. It underscores the difficulty of passing comprehensive digital asset laws in a politically divided Congress. Without a clear regulatory framework, the crypto industry in the U.S. continues to operate in a gray area, facing uncertainty that can stifle innovation and deter institutional investment. The Broader Impact on Digital Asset Policy and the Crypto Market The blocking of these crypto bills has immediate and long-term implications for the entire digital asset ecosystem. The crypto market, which thrives on clarity and certainty, often reacts negatively to regulatory ambiguities or setbacks. Immediate Market Reaction: While specific price movements are influenced by many factors, news of regulatory delays or failures can contribute to: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty can lead to more speculative trading and wider price swings. Investor Hesitation: Both retail and institutional investors may adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach, slowing down capital inflow. Innovation Stifled: Companies might delay product launches or expansion plans in the U.S. due to the lack of clear rules. Long-Term Implications for Digital Asset Policy: This legislative roadblock could have profound effects on the U.S.’s standing in the global crypto landscape: Aspect Potential Impact of Legislative Delay Innovation & Competitiveness The U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions (e.g., EU with MiCA, UAE, Singapore) that are actively developing clear regulatory frameworks. Crypto businesses may choose to establish operations elsewhere. Consumer Protection Without comprehensive legislation, consumers and investors may remain vulnerable to scams, hacks, and market manipulation, as existing laws are often ill-suited for digital assets. Institutional Adoption Large financial institutions require regulatory clarity to fully engage with crypto. Delays hinder their participation, limiting the market’s growth and maturity. National Security Clear regulations are essential for combating illicit finance and ensuring the integrity of the financial system in the age of digital currencies. A fragmented approach creates loopholes. The continued lack of a cohesive digital asset policy means that the U.S. relies on enforcement actions and fragmented interpretations of existing laws, creating a patchwork regulatory environment that is challenging for businesses and confusing for consumers. What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation and Crypto Bills? Despite this setback, the push for comprehensive US crypto regulation is far from over. The crypto industry and its advocates in Congress are tenacious, and the underlying need for clarity remains. So, what are the potential paths forward? Potential Avenues for Future Cryptocurrency Legislation: Reintroduction and Committee Process: The bills could be reintroduced and go through the traditional committee process, allowing for more debate, amendments, and potentially, bipartisan compromises. This is a slower but potentially more robust path. Standalone Bills: Elements of the comprehensive bills might be broken down into smaller, more digestible standalone bills, focusing on specific aspects like stablecoins or market structure, which might have an easier time garnering support. Executive Action & Agency Guidance: In the absence of new laws, executive agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, Treasury) will continue to issue guidance and pursue enforcement actions based on existing statutes. While not ideal for the industry, this is a de facto form of regulation. Election Impact: The upcoming elections could shift the political landscape, potentially creating new opportunities or challenges for crypto legislation depending on the composition of the next Congress. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community: For those invested in the future of digital assets, this setback is a reminder of the importance of engagement: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of legislative developments and the positions of your elected officials. Advocate: Support organizations that lobby for sensible crypto regulation. Contact your representatives to share your views on the importance of clear rules for innovation and consumer protection. Educate: Help bridge the knowledge gap about digital assets. Many policymakers still lack a deep understanding of the technology and its potential. The failure of House Republicans to pass the procedural motion highlights the deep-seated challenges in achieving comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation. It’s a stark reminder that while the crypto industry is rapidly evolving, the political process moves at its own pace, often hindered by partisan divides and procedural complexities. A Critical Juncture for Digital Asset Policy The recent legislative snag in the U.S. House of Representatives marks a critical moment for digital asset policy. While the immediate anticipation of a ‘crypto week’ has been dashed, the underlying need for a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto bills remains paramount. The setback underscores the challenges of navigating complex technology through a politically charged legislative environment. However, it also serves as a catalyst for renewed advocacy and a deeper understanding of the intricate dance between innovation and governance. The crypto industry, investors, and policymakers alike must now regroup and reassess the path forward. Whether through refined legislation, targeted bills, or continued engagement with regulatory bodies, the journey towards a robust and clear US crypto regulation framework will continue. The future of digital assets in the U.S. hinges on finding common ground and fostering an environment where innovation can thrive responsibly, benefiting both the economy and the public.

Launched in August 2020 as an Ethereum-based token, SHIB capitalized on Dogecoin’s hype, fueled by retail investor enthusiasm on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. Elon Musk’s tweets and Vitalik Buterin’s donation of 50 trillion SHIB to India’s COVID relief fund amplified its visibility. Trading volume surged, with SHIB briefly ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, hitting $39 billion. Its decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, launched in July 2021, boosting utility with staking and liquidity pools. Despite its meteoric rise, SHIB faced volatility, dropping 50% by year-end. The frenzy highlighted meme coins’ speculative appeal, drawing millions of holders, though its lack of fundamental use cases sparked debate about sustainability. Dual Lending System: Flexibility and High-Yield at Layer-2 Speed Shiba Inu (SHIB) made history in 2021 when it skyrocketed from a meme to a market sensation, delivering unbelievable returns in a matter of weeks. But while the hype was real, many investors were left chasing the tail end of its parabolic move. Today’s smarter capital isn’t hunting for viral spikes — it’s focused on real utility, DeFi infrastructure, and long-term growth. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters with powerful fundamentals and presale momentum that’s capturing serious attention. Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trading at just $0.03, with over $12.2 million raised, 13,200+ token holders, and 73% of the phase already sold out. A 20% price jump to $0.035 is imminent in the next phase, and listing is set at $0.06 — meaning current buyers are locking in 2x upside before launch, with analyst projections aiming far higher in the years to come. Unlike meme tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a structured Layer-2 lending ecosystem, enabling real earning mechanisms through two robust models — peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, users will deposit assets like DAI, USDT, ETH, AVAX, or MATIC into pooled contracts and will earn passive yield based on real-time pool utilization and dynamic interest rates. With lucrative loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, the system will be optimized to protect deposits while delivering consistent rewards. Meanwhile, P2P lending on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will unlock a personalized DeFi experience. This model is being designed to support assets that traditional DeFi protocols often exclude — including meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. Lenders will negotiate one-on-one deals, setting their own interest rates, loan durations, and loan-to-value ratios. This flexibility allows both parties to create custom agreements, making it a powerful option for users holding unconventional or volatile tokens. Built on Layer-2 infrastructure, Mutuum’s entire lending and borrowing process will benefit from lower gas fees, faster finality, and a seamless user experience. With the upcoming beta launch scheduled around the time of listing, the project will aim to onboard thousands of users into a scalable DeFi network designed to support real-time loan execution and yield tracking. In parallel, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is building excitement among early participants and social followers — now surpassing 12,000 on X (Twitter) — while also boosting visibility across DeFi communities. Stablecoin Architecture and Early Investor Gains Signal Strong Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is laying the foundation for a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin that will only be minted when users borrow against assets like ETH. This stablecoin will be burned automatically upon loan repayment or liquidation, preventing unnecessary inflation. Its $1 peg will be maintained through governance-adjusted interest rates and arbitrage opportunities, ensuring price stability without relying on market-driven rate changes. Only approved issuers with set minting caps will be able to create this stablecoin, keeping system risk in check. All loans will remain overcollateralized and subject to automatic liquidation when necessary, helping preserve the integrity of the ecosystem over time. Mutuum also rewards depositors with mtTokens, which reflect the user’s underlying principal and earned interest. These mtTokens can be staked in the designated smart contracts to earn dividends from the protocol’s revenue — offering a second layer of passive income for long-term holders. This dual-yield setup separates Mutuum from traditional DeFi platforms, where users typically earn yield from only one source. Consider the investor who rotated $5,000 of capital from Ethereum (ETH) into Mutuum during Phase 1 at just $0.01. Today, that holding is worth $15,000 at the current $0.03 price — a 3X gain before launch. With the token set to list at $0.06, that position will soon reflect a 6x return, and a known analyst — known for spotting Solana (SOL) at $1 in 2020 — is now calling $0.30 targets by 2026, giving MUTM a 10x path forward. Mutuum’s credibility is also reinforced by a CertiK audit with a 95.00 score, an active $50,000 bug bounty, and a roadmap that includes Layer-2 deployment, multi-chain integration, and governance expansion in later phases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may run again — but while retail chases past hype, smart investors are securing real utility. Only 27% of Phase 5 tokens remain at $0.03. Once Phase 6 begins, that price disappears forever. This is the final discounted entry for one of the most utility-packed projects of the cycle.

A pivotal crypto bill , poised to shape the future of digital assets in America, recently failed a crucial procedural vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. This turn of events has not only sent ripples through the legislative chambers but has also reportedly drawn the ire of the President himself, adding a layer of high-stakes political intrigue to the ongoing debate over digital asset policy. The Unexpected Stumble: What Happened with the Crypto Bill? In a surprising development that caught many off guard, the U.S. House of Representatives saw a key crypto bill falter during its initial procedural vote. This vote, often a formality that paves the way for a full debate and final vote on a piece of legislation, instead became a roadblock. According to reports from Fox News, cited by Jin10, the bill failed to garner the necessary support to proceed, putting its immediate future in question. For those unfamiliar with the legislative process, a procedural vote is essentially a vote on the rules or procedures for considering a bill, rather than on the bill’s substance itself. It’s a critical step that dictates how a bill will be debated, amended, and ultimately voted upon. A failure at this stage can indicate significant opposition or strategic maneuvering by lawmakers aiming to block or delay the legislation. Despite this initial setback, there’s still hope for the bill. Plans are already in motion to hold a second vote, reportedly scheduled for around 21:00 UTC. This swift re-attempt underscores the urgency and importance attached to this particular piece of digital asset legislation , suggesting that its proponents are not ready to give up without a fight. The coming hours will be critical in determining whether this legislative effort can overcome its initial hurdle and move forward. Understanding the House Vote Dynamics and Political Fallout The failure of the initial House vote has ignited a firestorm of political activity. The report that the President is ‘angry’ and actively engaging with lawmakers who blocked the bill highlights the high stakes involved. This direct intervention from the executive branch signals the administration’s keen interest in the outcome of this legislation and its potential implications for the broader economy and technological innovation. Why would a procedural vote draw such presidential ire? Often, such failures indicate a lack of party discipline, unexpected bipartisan opposition, or strategic dissent within the President’s own party. It suggests that the administration had anticipated a smoother path for the bill and views its blockage as a significant challenge to its legislative agenda. The President’s engagement with these lawmakers could involve persuasive arguments, political pressure, or even negotiations to secure their support for the upcoming second vote. The dynamics of this House vote are complex. Was it a genuine rejection of the bill’s content, or a tactical move to extract concessions or send a message? The answer likely lies in the specific concerns of the lawmakers who voted against it. These concerns could range from worries about consumer protection, financial stability, or even the competitive landscape for traditional finance. Understanding these underlying motivations is crucial for predicting the outcome of the second vote and the future trajectory of U.S. crypto regulation . Why U.S. Crypto Regulation is a Contentious Battleground The struggle to pass comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation is not new. For years, lawmakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders have grappled with how to effectively oversee the rapidly evolving digital asset space. The inherent novelty and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies pose unique challenges for traditional regulatory frameworks, which were largely designed for centralized financial systems. The debate often pits proponents of innovation and economic growth against those prioritizing consumer protection, financial stability, and national security. On one side, industry leaders argue for clear, concise rules that foster innovation and allow the U.S. to remain competitive on the global stage. They often advocate for a light-touch approach that avoids stifling technological advancement. On the other side, concerns are frequently raised about illicit finance, market manipulation, and the potential for retail investors to lose money in volatile or fraudulent schemes. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC have often asserted their jurisdiction, leading to a patchwork of enforcement actions rather than a unified regulatory framework. This lack of clarity has created an environment of uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to operate and innovate within the U.S. The current legislative push, embodied by this crypto bill , aims to bring some much-needed clarity and structure to this chaotic landscape. However, as the recent procedural vote shows, achieving consensus on such a complex and multifaceted issue is an uphill battle, requiring significant political will and compromise from all parties involved. The President’s Stance: A Key Indicator for Digital Asset Legislation? The reported anger of the President is a significant development, underscoring the executive branch’s growing focus on digital assets. Historically, presidential administrations have varied in their approach to cryptocurrency, with some taking a more cautious stance while others have expressed openness to its potential. The current President’s stance appears to be one of urgency and a desire for concrete action, especially given the rapid global adoption of digital currencies. While the specifics of the President’s direct conversations with lawmakers are not public, his involvement suggests that this particular digital asset legislation aligns with his administration’s broader economic or technological goals. It could be that the administration views robust crypto regulation as essential for maintaining U.S. leadership in financial innovation, combating illicit activities, or even addressing concerns about national security in the digital realm. A President’s direct engagement can be a powerful tool in legislative battles. It can rally wavering votes, put pressure on opponents, and signal to the public the importance of a particular policy. Therefore, the President’s reported frustration is not just an emotional reaction but a strategic indicator that the administration is committed to seeing this or similar legislation pass. This commitment could significantly influence future debates and the eventual shape of U.S. crypto regulation . Challenges and Opportunities for Future Digital Asset Legislation The path forward for digital asset legislation in the U.S. is fraught with both challenges and opportunities. On the challenge front, the primary hurdles include: Lack of Consensus: Disagreement among various government agencies (e.g., SEC, CFTC, Treasury) on who should regulate what, leading to regulatory arbitrage and confusion. Technical Complexity: Many lawmakers and regulators still struggle to fully grasp the intricate technical aspects of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, making it difficult to draft effective legislation. Lobbying Efforts: Powerful lobbying groups from both traditional finance and the crypto industry exert significant influence, often pushing for divergent outcomes. Political Polarization: Crypto, like many other issues, can become a victim of partisan divides, hindering bipartisan cooperation. Despite these challenges, opportunities abound. Clear and comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation could: Foster Innovation: Provide legal certainty for startups and established companies, encouraging investment and development in the U.S. Enhance Consumer Protection: Implement safeguards against fraud, scams, and market manipulation, building trust among retail investors. Improve Market Integrity: Establish rules for exchanges, stablecoins, and DeFi, leading to more transparent and robust markets. Strengthen National Security: Enable better tracking and prevention of illicit financial flows through digital assets. Here’s a brief look at the contrasting approaches to crypto regulation: Approach Description Potential Impact on Innovation Potential Impact on Consumer Protection Strict Regulation Heavy oversight, detailed rules, high compliance burden (e.g., EU’s MiCA) May stifle some innovation due to high costs and complexity High, strong safeguards against fraud and market abuse Light-Touch Regulation Minimal rules, focus on existing laws, industry self-regulation (e.g., early U.S. approach) High, encourages rapid development and experimentation Lower, potential for more scams and market instability Innovation-Focused (Sandbox) Regulatory sandboxes for testing, flexible frameworks Moderate to High, allows for controlled experimentation Moderate, specific protections within sandbox environment What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The legislative drama surrounding this crypto bill inevitably sends signals to the broader crypto market. In the short term, uncertainty around the second House vote could lead to increased volatility in digital asset prices. Investors and businesses prefer regulatory clarity, and any perceived delay or failure in establishing a clear framework can cause apprehension. However, if the bill eventually passes, it could be a significant positive catalyst. Clear U.S. crypto regulation would likely attract more institutional investment, provide greater legitimacy to digital assets, and enable a wider range of financial products and services. Conversely, a prolonged legislative stalemate or the failure of this bill could push innovation and investment to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions, potentially hindering the U.S.’s position as a global leader in the digital economy. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Businesses Given the ongoing legislative developments, what can crypto enthusiasts and businesses do? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on news from Capitol Hill, especially regarding the upcoming second vote and any subsequent legislative efforts. Understanding the nuances of proposed digital asset legislation is key. Engage (where possible): For businesses and advocacy groups, engaging with policymakers, sharing insights, and advocating for sensible regulation can be impactful. Individual enthusiasts can support organizations that champion responsible crypto policies. Understand the Risks: While the promise of crypto is immense, regulatory uncertainty remains a significant risk factor. Diversify portfolios and be aware of the evolving legal landscape. Looking Ahead: The Path for U.S. Crypto Regulation The immediate focus is on the second House vote . Its outcome will determine whether this specific crypto bill proceeds or faces further delays. Even if it passes this procedural hurdle, the bill will still need to navigate through full House and Senate votes, potentially facing amendments and further debate. The legislative process is often long and arduous, especially for groundbreaking areas like digital assets. Regardless of this specific bill’s fate, the broader push for comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation is unlikely to subside. The increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system necessitates a clear legal framework. The President’s strong reaction indicates a clear desire from the executive branch to see progress. This ongoing legislative journey will undoubtedly shape not just the crypto industry in the U.S. but also influence global standards for digital asset governance. The initial stumble of the crypto bill in the U.S. House of Representatives serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and political hurdles involved in shaping the future of digital assets. While the immediate outcome of the second House vote remains to be seen, the reported anger of the President underscores the high stakes and the administration’s commitment to advancing U.S. crypto regulation . This ongoing legislative battle is more than just a procedural vote; it’s a critical moment that will define the landscape for digital asset legislation , impacting innovation, consumer protection, and America’s role in the global digital economy.

This marks a major step forward in Kraken’s effort to provide a fully integrated trading experience. Through this rollout , clients can trade cryptocurrency futures directly on CME Group’s platform via Kraken Pro. Users will enjoy seamless collateral transfers, enhanced capital efficiency, and a simplified interface that combines spot and derivatives trading in one place. That means Kraken’s clients can now trade numerous crypto futures—such as Bitcoin and Ethereum contracts—besides traditional spot markets in the Kraken Pro interface, which is the exchange’s advanced trading feature. Combining both offers instantaneous collateral transfers and enables strategies to be carried out faster. “With this launch, Kraken clients in the US can now trade futures alongside one of the world’s most liquid cryptocurrency spot markets,” said Shannon Kurtas, Head of Exchange at Kraken. He noted that it’s important to provide traders with broad market access and increased capital efficiency within a regulated, high-performance environment. In making crypto futures available in a compliant and regulated environment, Kraken caters to the increasing institutional and retail demand for advanced trading instruments in the US. That’s important as US regulators grow more adamant about regulating the cryptocurrency market, putting added focus on regulatory clarity and investor protection. Kraken develops a unified digital and traditional trading solution The introduction of Kraken Derivatives US isn’t a once-in-a-while maneuver. It is part of Kraken’s larger plan to develop a holistic multi-asset platform where users can easily trade digital and traditional assets in a single place. In April 2025, Kraken launched its traditional finance offering , commission-free trading in US equities. Kraken has said it makes more than 11,000 US stocks and ETFs accessible, and that all trades are open 24 hours a day. This was a major step toward breaking the barrier between crypto and traditional investing. The company also recently introduced tokenized equities, through which customers can purchase fractionalized publicly traded stock shares on a blockchain. That means Kraken users can now manage a diverse investment playbook that features crypto coins and blue chips without leaving the platform. Kurtas said Kraken Derivatives US is constantly working to build and expand a holistic trading experience that enables seamless trading across digital and traditional assets, all on one platform without compromise in functionality, performance, or liquidity. She said the company is building an ecosystem to serve traders in DeFi, traditional finance, and the spectrum. We aim to create a trading system where capital can quickly and efficiently move across markets with high confidence using just one high-performance interface. Kraken expands after acquiring NinjaTrader This new ability for Kraken was largely facilitated by the acquisition of NinjaTrader , one of the US’s most storied retail futures trading platforms. This acquisition was strategically important for Kraken, as it added regulatory infrastructure, technology, and mastery to its business to move into older derivatives markets. The debut of Kraken Derivatives US is the largest product to come out of that acquisition. But it’s only the beginning. Kraken, one of the oldest crypto exchanges, said it would extend its derivatives offering later in the year to include more futures, such as commodities, foreign exchange (FX), stocks, and bonds. That development would put Kraken in direct competition with established institutions rather than those in the crypto market, offering traders a single place for managing risk and trading across all major asset classes. The move is especially critical when institutional interest in crypto and digital assets is increasing, and hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers seek ways to enter digital markets compliantly. By providing futures contracts, spot trading, tokenized and traditional equities under one roof, Kraken says it aims to be a power player in global finance, not just crypto.

Ethereum’s Strength Tested at High Market Cap Ethereum recently climbed above the $3,000 mark after months of trading within a narrow range, signaling renewed market confidence. Its transition to proof-of-stake, over $90 billion in total value locked, and one of the largest developer communities reinforce Ethereum’s position as a leading smart contract platform. However, the network still depends heavily on Layer 2 solutions to manage congestion. During periods of high activity, performance issues and rising fees can negatively impact the user experience. While the current momentum is strong, Ethereum’s growth could face limits in the short term. Doubling its market cap would require an influx of more than $350 billion—a significant challenge that, while possible, is unlikely to unfold rapidly. XLM Rises Fast, But Long-Term Doubts Remain Stellar’s main strength lies in its simplicity and efficiency. It enables fast payments and low-fee transfers, making it ideal for cross-border remittances and use in financial networks. Its focus on reducing friction in money movement gives it strong utility in real-world applications. Recently, XLM surged 92% in just a week after breaking a key resistance level, supported by bullish indicators like the MACD and RSI, which suggest continued upward momentum. However, Stellar faces some notable limitations. It lacks compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning it can’t easily support a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, its developer activity and overall ecosystem remain significantly smaller when compared to platforms like Ethereum. How BlockDAG Blends Speed, Mining, Scalability & ROI! BlockDAG is getting major traction with its unique hybrid model. It uses both DAG architecture and proof-of-work, supporting over 15,000 transactions per second. This setup balances speed, security, and decentralization—a rare combination for any Layer 1 platform. What also stands out is BlockDAG’s user-first approach. It supports EVM compatibility, so developers can easily bring dApps from Ethereum. There’s a low-code contract builder too, helping non-tech users build applications. BlockDAG’s X1 mobile miner app has crossed 2 million users globally. Its approach has helped onboard more than 200,000 holders and sell 23.8 billion coins. Miner sales now exceed 18,000 units. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release is offering BDAG coins at $0.0016 until August 11. That’s a huge discount from Batch 29’s current rate of $0.0276. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, early buyers could gain 3,025%. BlockDAG’s presale has now raised $339 million. It’s also building visibility through partnerships with Seattle-based sports teams, including the Orcas and Seawolves. These steps are putting the project in front of broader, non-crypto audiences. Unlike Ethereum or Stellar, which each focus on specific use cases, BlockDAG is combining performance, accessibility, and community. It’s quickly becoming a Layer 1 contender with wide reach. Looking Ahead The Layer 1 race is heating up again as the market gains strength in Q3 2025. Ethereum has moved back above $3,000, keeping its reputation as the dominant smart contract network. Stellar just delivered a 92% jump in a week, bringing renewed attention to its role in payments. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is making headlines as it pushes past $339 million raised, with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release offering coins at just $0.0016 until August 11. These three platforms showcase different visions for blockchain. Ethereum remains the top choice for smart contracts. Stellar focuses on fast, affordable financial transfers.

To the point: an analyst at Standard Chartered says that, once stablecoins hit the $750 billion mark, they may begin to influence the structure of U.S. Treasury markets. (Their market cap is currently at roughly $258 billion according to DefiLlama.) We also have Deribit making it possible for USDC holders to earn 4% yield, a crypto startup called Dakota raising $12.5 million to make it easier for businesses to move funds from U.S. dollars to stablecoins, and back again. These four headlines are all from today, and they’re nothing out of the ordinary. We are used to seeing an abundance of news, every day, about stablecoin adoption. “Stablecoins are crypto’s killer app” has become a motto almost akin to “stay humble, stack sats.” The underdiscussed winners of the stablecoin growth are market makers — the outfits that provide liquidity to crypto markets and ensure trades are executed efficiently. Kevin de Patoul, CEO of global investment firm Keyrock , recently told CoinDesk that demand for bitcoin and stablecoins outshined demand for any other type of cryptocurrencies by a wide margin. Even more interesting, demand for stablecoins is increasingly coming from companies that aren’t crypto native, but consider stablecoins as a genuinely superior technology for international payments. “That’s really been a change over the last year and a half, seeing those assets being used for their superior efficiency, rather than simply a way to gain exposure to crypto,” he said. Stablecoins will show the way for the tokenization of stocks , money market funds , and other, stranger types of financial products . De Patoul expects the financial system’s backend will be completely updated to improve user access to these vehicles. While tokenization is a bit of a newer and shinier concept for crypto natives — a little more like bleeding edge tech — stablecoins, with their “mind-boggling” potential, will likely remain the bigger story for years to come, De Patoul said. “Eventually, 50% of global payments are going to be made in stablecoins,” he said. “Stablecoins are going to continue to be the biggest use case for digital assets for the next few years.”",Opinion|Stablecoins|Keyrock|Opinion,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 02:03:06

HTE is a game-changing rewards platform built to onboard over 24 million non-crypto users into Web3 through a unified ecosystem of high-utility applications. Powered by Hedera’s secure infrastructure, HTE bridges the usability gap while delivering real token-based incentives. At launch, HTE integrates three leading apps: Cashtree, Berryfox, and Bibble—each powered by Blade Wallet’s SDK, making Web3 wallet creation and token rewards effortless for any user. Cashtree is Indonesia’s top mobile ad platform with over 20 million users and 1,000+ brand partnerships. Now expanding globally through Google Play, it introduces new Web3 reward mechanics via its ""Tap-to-Win"" Telegram mini-game. Berryfox, a cosmic idle P2E game rebuilt from Berrystore, blends NFT-based battles, mining, and crafting in a seamless, offline-compatible experience. Users explore planets, collect Ruby Stones, and earn HTE through passive and active gameplay. Mars Labs enters the HTE ecosystem with Bibble, a reward-driven app. Users can earn HTE by creating content and joining virtual events, making Bibble a next-gen mining and engagement hub. HTE connects these platforms through a single interoperable reward system, enhancing user engagement while preserving each app’s native experience. With one ecosystem and one token, user activity across any app amplifies the entire network's value. To celebrate its launch, HTE kicks off a global airdrop event via its official community. Users who activate mining in any of the apps will receive randomized HTE rewards—instantly distributed and visible in their Blade Wallet. With extra bonuses for missions and community participation, the incentive structure is built to drive early traction. HTE is already in discussion with top global exchanges for listings, alongside a phased token swap plan for existing holders. Designed for scalability and real usage, HTE sets a new standard in connecting apps, users, and rewards on-chain. With millions onboarded and three proven apps at launch, HTE marks a bold leap forward in Web3 adoption—not just launching a project, but igniting a movement. About HederaToEarn Hedera To Earn (HTE) is a large-scale Web3 rewards platform built on the Hedera mainnet, designed to connect real users with real utility across gaming, advertising, and metaverse applications.

BTC is now trading below $120,000 and might find bids near the $115,500 zone. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the new all-time high near $123,200. The price is trading below $120,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $117,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $120,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Corrects From New ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase after it cleared the $118,500 resistance zone. BTC gained pace for a move above the $120,000 and $122,000 resistance. The bulls even pumped the pair above the $123,000 zone. A new all-time high was formed at $123,140 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $108,636 swing low to the $123,140 high. Bitcoin is now trading below $120,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . However, the price is holding the 50% Fib level of the upward move from the $108,636 swing low to the $123,140 high. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $117,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $118,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $120,000 level. The next resistance could be $122,000. A close above the $122,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $123,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $125,000 level. The main target could be $130,000. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $120,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support is near the $115,850 level. The first major support is near the $115,500 level. The next support is now near the $114,150 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.

The address had held 80,009 BTC in total and had never previously moved funds in the modern era. According to on‑chain sleuth Lookonchain, “the Bitcoin OG with 80,009 BTC ($9.46 B) has transferred 40,009 BTC ($4.68 B) to Galaxy Digital,” and Galaxy “has directly deposited 6,000 BTC ($706 M) into Binance and Bybit.” Bitcoin OG Whale Awakens The activity began late Monday evening (UTC). First, 9,000 BTC—about $1.06 billion—left the dormant wallet, followed an hour later by another 7,843 BTC ($927 million) Over the next five hours several smaller tranches arrived at Galaxy Digital’s custodial accounts before the decisive push that brought the running total to 40,009 BTC. Blockchain explorers show the coins originated from a bech32 address that first received block rewards in early 2011, when bitcoin changed hands for less than one US dollar. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trajectory To $155,000: Why No Major Dips Are Expected From Here Notably, Galaxy Digital operates one of the largest over‑the‑counter (OTC) desks in the industry and regularly intermediates block trades for institutions seeking to avoid slippage on public venues. The firm advertises “premier execution” and bespoke liquidity provisioning for trades that are too large for order‑book execution. On‑chain analysts therefore read the wallet’s choice of counterparty as a signal that the owner intends to liquidate at least part of the hoard discreetly rather than deploy it into DeFi or cold storage. Within hours of receiving the coins, Galaxy split 6,000 BTC between Binance and Bybit, the two venues that currently post the deepest spot‑BTC liquidity. Bitcoin had just printed an all‑time high of $123,153 on 14 July, buoyed by Washington’s “Crypto Week” legislative push. As the OG whale’s transactions hit public mempools, spot prices recoiled more than 6%, sliding from $123,000 to an intraday low near $115,700 before stabilising around $116,900 at press time. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO With half of the stash now under Galaxy’s control and only a fraction confirmed as exchange deposits, traders are bracing for further transfers. If Galaxy executes an OTC cross, the impact could be muted; if the coins bleed into order books, bids at $112,000‑$115,000 will face a major test. US Inflation Data Dampens Sentiment However, today’s price drop can not solely be attributed to the OG whale’s doing; it coincided with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ June CPI print, which showed headline consumer prices rising 0.3 % month‑on‑month and 2.7 % year‑on‑year—up from 2.4 % in May—while core CPI ticked up 0.2 % on the month and 2.9 % on the year. The modest print pushed the dollar index above 95.5, and risk assets have been whipsawing ever since. “The price action on the dollar pretty much tells you everything you need to know about this CPI report—mixed and the market is trying to digest it and to figure out the direction today,” observed Daan Crypto Trades on X. At press time, BTC stood at $116,972.

But some names are cutting through the noise. BlockDAG, Dogecoin, Hyperliquid, and XRP are gaining attention fast, showing signs of momentum and market interest. From early-stage excitement to long-time community favorites, these four projects are catching fire. If you’re tracking what traders are watching closely right now, these picks stand out. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Early Access with Major Buzz BlockDAG (BDAG) brings a chance to grab a coin before it hits public exchanges. While most people find projects after big price jumps, BDAG is still in presale and sitting at an entry price. It has already raised over $339 million and moved more than 23.9 billion coins. The project focuses on speed, scalability, and a decentralized setup, drawing in a large base of early supporters. The buzz keeps building as the price has jumped over 2,600% from its batch 1 start. Some market watchers think it could even aim for $1 down the line. With more than 200,000 holders and growing attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) is shaping up as one to watch. Right now, the coin is available at just $0.0016, while the latest batch price is $0.0276. That big gap has many acting fast to secure a spot before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. For anyone watching for early-stage moves, this could be a rare moment to get in while the price is still low. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE): More Than Just a Meme Play Dogecoin (DOGE) has pushed past its meme coin status to earn a real spot among the top crypto to buy now. Fueled by a loyal online following and repeated mentions from Elon Musk, DOGE is widely used for tipping, micro-payments, and community donations. Its strong presence across top exchanges makes it easy to access and trade. At the moment, DOGE is hovering around $0.17, with some analysts pointing toward a move to $0.20 or even $0.25 if market energy returns. The meme roots are still there, but so is real traction. With speculation still swirling about future use cases, DOGE keeps attracting attention from those chasing high-risk, high-reward plays in the crypto space. 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Big Momentum and Bigger Targets Hyperliquid (HYPE) has made a name fast, landing on the radar as a top crypto to buy now. Built as a gas-free Layer‑1 that supports fast-paced trading, HYPE is now seeing on-chain activity close to that of major centralised exchanges. Crypto funds and firms are already holding large HYPE reserves, pushing the project into the spotlight. It just hit a new all-time high around $48–$49 after a 20% weekly jump, though some warn a short-term pullback could follow if the market cools. Still, projections are heating up, with possible moves toward $60–$100 in the near term. With that kind of upside, HYPE is quickly turning heads across trading circles. 4. XRP (XRP): Big Moves in Global Transfers XRP (XRP) continues to earn its place as a top crypto to buy now. Known for its speed and low fees, it’s used by banks and remittance platforms worldwide. With a current price near $2.27 and a massive $130 billion market cap, XRP is trending upward again and may climb toward $5 by the end of the year. Some technical models even hint at a future between $4 and $7, with ultra-bullish scenarios pushing the price as high as $8–$27 if an XRP ETF and stronger regulations come through. With its real-world use and global reach, XRP keeps the spotlight as one of crypto’s long-term contenders. Why These 4 Coins Are Standing Out Right Now When looking at the top crypto to buy now , each of these coins brings something different. Dogecoin has culture, memes, and momentum. Hyperliquid brings serious speed and deep trading activity. XRP focuses on solving cross-border money movement with big financial backing. But BlockDAG stands apart with something the others don’t have: early access at just $0.0016. It’s still in presale, and prices are expected to rise fast ahead of the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. For anyone eyeing big upside before a coin hits exchanges, this may be the moment to jump in.

Reputational risk is no longer a factor, opening doors for crypto-bank partnerships. OCC, FDIC, and Fed push for secure handling of keys, data, and evolving crypto risk frameworks. Agencies Explain Rules for Crypto Custody On Monday, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC issued a joint statement explaining how banks should apply existing rules when holding crypto for customers. The statement does not introduce new policies but says banks must manage crypto risks like they would with any other service. The agencies said banks should have clear plans to handle cybersecurity, protect private keys, and keep sensitive data secure. These expectations apply before offering crypto safekeeping services. Banks Told to Adapt Risk Frameworks The regulators want banks to adjust their internal controls as the crypto market changes. They wrote: “A banking organization that is contemplating providing safekeeping for crypto-assets should consider the evolving nature of the crypto-asset market.” Banks are expected to maintain risk controls, response plans, and strong oversight. These steps should match the standards already in place for traditional financial products. In a related development , the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it is eliminating the use of “reputational risk” as a supervisory factor. This decision could shift how banks approach relationships with crypto businesses. New Flexibility for Crypto Activities In recent months, each agency has taken steps to allow more crypto use by banks. In May, the OCC said banks can buy and sell digital assets for their own portfolios. The FDIC followed by stating that banks do not need to notify the agency before starting crypto services. Meanwhile, these changes make it easier for banks to offer crypto-related products such as trading, custody, and settlement. Industry watchers say the joint statement is a move toward clear and consistent rules. Last week, the Senate confirmed Jonathan Gould as head of the OCC. Gould worked at blockchain company Bitfury and held senior roles at the OCC in the past. His background suggests more crypto experience at the top of the agency. Banks and regulators are now expected to work more closely as interest in digital assets continues to grow.

SUI’s steady climb in a shifting crypto market SUI is posting a notable 35% gain over the past month, trading between $3 and just under $4. Last week alone, it surged by over a third, signaling strong momentum. Despite a 14% dip over six months, SUI’s recent rally suggests it could challenge its resistance near $4.20. If it breaks through, crypto charts indicate a potential push toward $5. Strong support at $2.50 provides a safety net, and upward RSI trends hint at growing investor confidence. Yet, SUI’s volatility raises questions about sustainability. As crypto prices fluctuate, can SUI maintain its upward trajectory? Mutuum Finance, however, offers a different angle with its presale stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale gains traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. Over 70% of this phase is filled, signaling that the window to buy at this level is closing fast. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, and the token will launch at $0.06, ensuring a 100% return for current buyers. With $12,400,000 raised and 615 million tokens sold, Mutuum Finance is attracting 13,400 holders. The team has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities found, bolstering trust. Moreover, a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK rewards hunters across four severity tiers, enhancing security. Investors are eyeing MUTM as a top crypto to buy now. Innovative lending powers Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in DeFi with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts for automated, market-responsive interest rates, ensuring stability for lenders and borrowers. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer model enables direct transactions, ideal for volatile assets needing custom terms. This flexibility sets Mutuum Finance apart from centralized platforms, offering transparency and control. The project is also developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, reducing depegging risks compared to algorithmic rivals. Crypto investment in MUTM could yield significant returns, with analysts predicting a $3 post-launch price in 2025, a 100x gain from the current $0.03. Furthermore, a new dashboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing loyalty. Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem expands Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a dynamic ecosystem. Its mtTokens represent deposited assets like ETH or DAI, accruing interest and enabling trading or staking within the platform. A buyback program funnels protocol revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, rewarding stakers with passive income. The team is also planning Layer 2 scaling to cut gas fees and boost transaction speeds, positioning Mutuum Finance for global adoption. A $100,000 MUTM giveaway , split among 10 winners, requires a $50 presale investment and simple tasks like submitting a wallet address. As crypto prices rise, MUTM’s infrastructure makes it a standout crypto investment. Looking ahead to big gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top crypto to buy now, blending innovative lending with a secure, scalable ecosystem. Its presale at $0.03, backed by a CertiK audit and a $100,000 giveaway, positions it for explosive growth, potentially hitting $3 in 2025. SUI’s 35% rally is impressive, but its reliance on market trends contrasts with MUTM’s utility-driven model. Investors seeking stability and high returns are turning to Mutuum Finance. Join the presale to secure tokens before Phase 6’s price increase. The crypto market is buzzing, and MUTM stands out as a calculated bet for the future.

As the crypto market heats up, investors are eyeing both tokens for explosive growth. Dogecoin’s bullish surge DOGE is riding a wave of momentum, climbing 19.7% in two weeks. Its price recently broke the $0.196 resistance, a level that stalled gains in June. Technical charts show higher lows and higher highs since June 22, signaling bullish strength. Analysts like CryptoKaleo note similarities to DOGE’s 2020 pattern, which led to a massive rally. The next target lies between $0.23 and $0.25, a 27% jump from current levels. However, a $1 price seems plausible, though a $72 repeat of 2020’s 36,000% surge is unlikely due to DOGE’s unlimited supply. Crypto prices today reflect cautious optimism for DOGE’s next move. Moreover, DOGE’s reliance on market sentiment and Bitcoin’s performance raises questions about sustainability. Its inflationary model limits long-term value retention compared to structured DeFi projects. Investors seeking stability may look elsewhere. Mutuum Finance’s presale power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charging through Phase 5 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. Over 70% of this phase is filled, signaling urgency for investors. The price has tripled from $0.01 in Phase 1, and Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% hike to $0.035. With a launch price of $0.06, buyers now secure a 100% return. Experts predict MUTM could hit $5 post-launch, a 16,566% leap from its current price. The project has raised 12,400,000, with 615 million tokens sold and 13,400 holders onboard. Crypto investment in MUTM is surging due to its tangible utility. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. This incentivizes long-term commitment, setting MUTM apart in the crypto market. Innovative DeFi lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts for dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability. The Peer-to-Peer model allows direct lending, ideal for volatile assets. Both offer flexibility and transparency, surpassing centralized platforms. A native stablecoin, pegged to USD on Ethereum, is in development, reducing depegging risks. This stablecoin will enhance liquidity and simplify transactions. Mutuum Finance’s focus on crypto investing prioritizes user control and efficiency, making it a standout. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities. Its Bug Bounty Program, partnered with CertiK, offers $50,000 in rewards across four tiers, reinforcing trust in its ecosystem. Scaling for the future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building beyond lending. Its mtTokens represent deposited assets, accruing interest and enabling trading or staking. Buybacks of MUTM tokens fund rewards for stakers, ensuring passive income. Mutuum Finance’s infrastructure positions it as a top crypto for long-term growth. Consequently, its blend of utility and innovation makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a compelling choice in today’s crypto market. Tying it all together Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a top crypto to buy now, offering a 100% return at its $0.06 launch price. Its $5 price prediction for 2025 dwarfs DOGE’s $1 target, driven by a robust DeFi ecosystem. While DOGE rides market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers real-world utility through lending, stablecoins, and Layer 2 scaling. Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in should act fast—Phase 5 is nearly full. Join the presale and explore Mutuum Finance’s potential to reshape DeFi.

Remember when Dogecoin barked its way onto the charts? That moment is back, but this time, it’s clawing instead of barking. Meme coins are booming again, and degens are piling into wild new projects with explosive upside. From AI-driven narratives to nostalgia-fueled bangers like Notcoin and Housecoin, June 2025 is already shaping up to be a month where fortunes are made, or missed. The one presale stealing the spotlight? A cosmic cat prankster called Trollercat , currently in Stage 13 of its 26-stage presale, with over $325,000 already raised, more than 1,400 token holders, and an ROI gain of 1581.2% from Stage 1. But it’s not the only one rising. Alongside $TCAT, meme legends like Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT), LOFI ($LOFI), Official Trump ($TRUMP), and more are flooding feeds across CT. So if you’re looking to scoop the top 10 meme coins before the entry price launches into orbit, read fast. Every stage delay with $TCAT means 15% more per token. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Every now and then, a meme coin emerges that flips the rulebook, eats the pages, and spits out something revolutionary. Troller Cat is exactly that. Built on Ethereum, this isn’t just another “funny token” — it’s a 69% APY-staking, deflationary, Game Center–powered troll fest backed by legendary lore. With Trollercat presale Stage 13 live and themed after The Friday Phenomenon, a nod to Rebecca Black’s infamous internet anthem, \$TCAT is harmonizing chaos and rewards like never before. From a first-stage price of $0.00000500 to today’s $0.00008406, the numbers speak volumes. That’s 1581.2% ROI for early believers, and there’s still room to pounce. With only 13 stages left until launch and a hard listing price of $0.0005309, anyone buying now is sitting on a potential 531.57% upside, assuming they don’t wait and watch that opportunity slip through their claws. 69% APY Staking Trollercat staking isn’t just live, it’s lethal. While most meme coins bank on vibes, this cat banks on compound chaos. Investors staking their $TCAT earn a monstrous 69% APY, rewarding loyalty with real gains. And the best part? Staking is unlocked anytime, but rewards are locked for 2 months post-launch, preventing dumpers and boosting post-launch momentum. Let’s Talk ROI: Imagine staking $15,000 at Stage 13. At a 69% APY and a projected listing ROI of 531.57%, you’re looking at a post-launch valuation of $94,735.50, plus rewards. That’s life-changing. New car. College debt cleared. Or just stack that ETH bag higher. The only wrong move? Not moving. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With wild staking rewards, a meme-fueled Game Center, and one of the most committed deflationary burn systems in crypto, Trollercat presale is what happens when internet history meets smart tokenomics. Buy before this cat slips through your fingers. 2. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) The meme god has spoken, and he screams in caps lock. Goatseus Maximus takes degenerate hype and wraps it in divine imagery, promising “goat-tier gains” with an ultra-low cap, fair launch, and an NFT-based battle game where holders compete for on-chain supremacy. It’s absurd, it’s chaotic, and it’s gaining traction fast across Telegram shill threads. The roadmap teases oracle-run prophecies, themed staking tournaments, and limited edition minting events that tie into Greek-myth style comic drops. Engagement is growing, and the community’s trolling energy fits perfectly into meme coin season. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Community-powered chaos, plus a roadmap that includes NFT goat battles and burn-to-level mechanics? Goatseus could moon or explode, and that’s why it belongs on any top 10 meme coins list. 3. LOFI ($LOFI) Calm beats. Clean vibes. LOFI leans into chill branding and long-term tokenomics. Inspired by lo-fi music culture, it rewards users for simply holding and relaxing. With staking at 11%, a slow minting curve, and NFT drops synced to classic lo-fi tracks, this one’s building quietly, but stacking loud attention. Token burns occur every time a user mints an NFT. Holders can also participate in “chill raids” to earn extra incentives. The low volatility model appeals to investors who want meme coin energy without constant chart-checking. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Not every meme coin needs to yell. LOFI is the lo-fi banger of the top 10 meme coins list, offering peace, chill, and passive ETH flow to diamond hands. 4. Official Trump ($TRUMP) $TRUMP isn’t subtle, it’s a political meme coin engineered to grab headlines and fuel tribal buying. With election season heating up, its daily volume has exploded. Holding certain amounts unlocks NFTs like “MAGA-Pepe” and “Wall Builder,” which earn bonuses during staking cycles. Whether for laughs or gainz, people are aping in. It also features meme wars where two sides vote on-chain to trigger either a burn or token redistribution. Political satire meets crypto rebellion in a volatile yet captivating project. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Because attention = volatility = gains. $TRUMP’s on every radar, and its virality puts it firmly in the top 10 meme coins this month. 5. Notcoin ($NOT) The irony coin that keeps not trying, but keeps pumping. Born from Telegram’s mini-games, $NOT has evolved into a gamified L2 ecosystem where “not playing” might just make you rich. With over 40M downloads and in-game mining mechanics, it’s less a meme, more a cult. Developers recently teased a decentralized trivia game, where wrong answers earn you more $NOT than right ones. It’s trolling logic itself, and the community loves it. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With a user base rivaling legit chains and a memetic brand that never breaks character, Notcoin earns its seat at the top 10 meme coins table. 6. Dogs ($DOGS) All the dogs, none of the fluff. $DOGS is a low-tax, dog-pack-themed token that rewards holders for backing the most “loyal breeds.” Its multichain compatibility and leaderboard structure drive engagement while maintaining meme quality. It’s weird, and it’s working. Pack battles, team staking wars, and pup NFTs make this one feel like Pokémon for degens. The supply is fixed, and the community is doggedly active. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It gamifies loyalty and lets the dog coins fight it out for supremacy. That’s meme innovation, and that’s top 10 meme coins material. 7. Act I: The AI Prophecy ($ACT) What if AI became sentient just to pump its own bags? $ACT rides the AI narrative with story-driven tokenomics, weekly plot twists on-chain, and holders determining the ending. NFTs unlock “code fragments” that may someday trigger a massive token burn or vault release. Its lore has gone viral, with fan theories and animations flooding social feeds. As the story deepens, so does the community’s investment. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Narrative-powered chaos, an engaged community, and AI-fueled lore? That’s how you blend storytelling with memecoinery. A clear pick for the top 10 meme coins. 8. Cheems ($CHEEMS) He’s back. The OG doge sidekick has re-emerged with a new token and play-to-earn clicker game where players mine Cheemsburgers. It’s simple, dumb, and instantly addicting. Supply is limited, and Cheems is finally getting the solo spotlight he deserves. $CHEEMS has partnered with meme merch stores and offers discounts when paid in Cheems. That kind of offline tie-in adds serious credibility. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Meme royalty never dies. Cheems is surging again with the kind of nostalgia-driven pump CT lives for. Definitely one of the top 10 meme coins to hold now. 9. Housecoin ($HOUSE) Born out of satire for the housing market, $HOUSE lets you own a piece of “digital rent.” The tokenomics include adjustable “interest rates,” foreclosure events, and airdropped HOA fees (yes, really). It’s dark comedy meets smart contract. $HOUSE is working on a Metaverse game where holders can build virtual homes and rent them out using NFT lease contracts. It’s both absurd and oddly functional. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Housing memes meet DeFi chaos. The narrative is strong, the engagement is stronger, and that earns $HOUSE a spot on this top 10 meme coins roundup. 10. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW) The feline resistance is real. $MEW is the anti-dog memecoin, marketing itself as the cat revolution in a dog-dominated crypto landscape. With clawbacks, scratch tokens, and community-driven burns, this one’s clawing up the ranks with purr-sistence. Its community has declared July “National Scratch Month” where bonus burns occur weekly. Memes are strong, branding is clean, and momentum is building. Why This Coin Made It to the List: A cat memecoin rising among dogs? That narrative alone makes $MEW worthy of a top 10 meme coins nod. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Best Meme Coins to Invest (top 10 meme coins) in June 2025 are Troller Cat, $GOAT, $LOFI, $TRUMP, and more. From meme chaos to staking utility, these projects show how ridiculous ideas can evolve into ROI-producing assets. With Trollercat’s 69% APY, ultra-tight referral system, and deflationary buyback model, the presale value just keeps climbing. Meanwhile, other tokens ride community hype, game theory, or cultural parody, making this month rich with upside. Buy now before this cat claws its way out of reach.

Binance Coin (BNB) pumps Binance Coin (BNB) dipped 0.5% this week, settling at $686, despite earlier bullish signals. The Maxwell upgrade, slashing block times by 47%, and a $1B token burn failed to sustain momentum amid profit-taking after a $700 peak. Declining DEX volume (-15% to $4.9B) and a bearish MACD crossover reflect fading enthusiasm, with technicals pointing to a $650 support test if selling persists. Regulatory scrutiny in Asia and US-BRICS trade tensions further dented sentiment. BNB’s slip could sour sentiment for exchange tokens, dragging down CRO and KCS, as investors pivot to Layer-1s like SOL. Blockchain stocks, particularly Binance-linked firms, may face sell-offs amid global trade fears. In forex, a resurgent dollar amplifies BNB’s downside, but renewed burn momentum and Binance’s NFT marketplace expansion could spark a rebound, potentially targeting $720 if $700 resistance breaks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized protocol designed to help users unlock passive income from their crypto holdings, without giving up custody. At the core of this system is the upcoming Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending model, which will allow users to deposit assets like AVAX, ETH, and major stablecoins into smart contract-managed liquidity pools. In return, depositors are expected to receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that automatically increase in value as interest accrues. These mtTokens can be held, used as collateral, or even traded on secondary markets. The envisioned P2C model is intended to create a fluid and efficient lending environment. Take AVAX as an example: a user who deposits $5,000 worth of AVAX into a pool with an estimated yield of 9.2% APY will earn consistent returns depending on pool utilization. On the other side, a borrower would deposit that same AVAX as collateral and unlock $3,500 in liquidity based on a 70% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. This setup enables the borrower to maintain upside exposure to AVAX’s market performance, while the lender earns steady income, backed by overcollateralized risk management. All of this is set to function via audited smart contracts, without relying on custodians, middlemen, or centralized gatekeepers. $12.35M raised, price climbing, and only 27% tokens left in current phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted over $12.35 million in presale contributions, currently in Phase 5 at a token price of $0.03. With over 13,300 holders already on board and 73% of this round sold out, it’s becoming clear that this isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a DeFi protocol gaining real traction. Once Phase 5 is complete, the price will automatically move to $0.035, with a planned listing at $0.06. That means early buyers from Phase 1 who exchanged $1,000 worth of LINK for MUTM are already sitting on double their value, with another 100% upside to go before listing. Security has also taken center stage. The project has undergone a detailed audit by CertiK, achieving a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 77.50. To reinforce this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with rewards tiered by severity—critical, major, minor, and low. This initiative supports a security-first approach that’s attracting technically-minded contributors and long-term investors alike. With only 27% of Phase 5 tokens left, investors are rushing to secure their position before the next price jump. The rapid sellout pace highlights strong interest in real DeFi utility, not just hype. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prepares to roll out its beta version in parallel with the token listing. The protocol will also benefit from Layer-2 integration, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions that solve common issues like congestion and high gas fees, key improvements for user experience. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just building a new lending platform—it’s building a new standard for DeFi income. While large-cap assets like BNB show signs of slowing, MUTM is racing ahead, offering both passive income and price growth in a single, scalable protocol.

The move signals Citigroup’s deepening commitment to blockchain-based payments and infrastructure, as traditional financial institutions increasingly explore digital assets to streamline settlement and enhance global transfers. Citigroup Builds Crypto Custody Framework Fraser said the bank is also exploring reserve management for stablecoins and developing custody solutions for crypto assets. *CITI CEO JANE FRASER: CITIGROUP IS EXPLORING ISSUING A STABLECOIN $C pic.twitter.com/790Ob0UZ3Y — Investing.com (@Investingcom) July 15, 2025 Citi isn’t just trying to keep up in the stablecoin space. Fraser said the real goal is to upgrade the bank’s infrastructure in ways that bring clear, real-world benefits to its clients. “We aim to deliver the benefits of advancements in stablecoin and digital assets to our clients in a safe and sound manner by modernizing our own infrastructure and improving efficiency, transparency, and interoperability,” Fraser said. Citi Bets on Stablecoins for 24/7 Finance As digital payments shift toward always-on, instant settlement, stablecoins offer a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto-native world. Fraser said that Citi’s focus is guided by customer needs. “Digital assets are the next evolution in the broader digitization of payments, financing, and liquidity,” she said. “Ultimately, what we care about is what our clients want and how do we meet that need.” The bank’s strategy includes four focus areas: reserve management, custody services, seamless fiat-to-crypto on and off ramps, and tokenized deposits. Together, these could form the foundation of a robust offering that positions Citi at the heart of a rapidly changing payments landscape. Stablecoin Market Set to Top $2 Trillion Citigroup is not alone in this effort. Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo had begun exploring a possible shared stablecoin initiative . The project, if realized, could accelerate institutional adoption of blockchain technology. The stablecoin market, once a niche corner of the crypto world, is growing rapidly. Citi projects that market capitalization could rise from roughly $260b today to over $2t by 2030. Under a base-case scenario, the bank sees supply hitting $1.6t by decade’s end, with a more bullish outlook estimating $3.7t. For a global bank with exposure to trade finance, treasury services and cross-border flows, venturing into stablecoins makes strategic sense. These digital tokens, pegged to fiat currencies, promise real-time settlement without the inefficiencies of legacy banking rails. While regulators remain cautious, the broader trend is clear. With clients demanding 24/7 settlement and greater transparency, stablecoins are becoming less of a speculative experiment and more of a necessary upgrade.

The price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $2.840 support zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.880 zone. The price is now trading above $2.840 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.840 zone. XRP Price Retains Gains XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.750 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.850 resistance level. The recent move was positive and the bulls pushed the price above the $3.00 level. A high was formed at $3.0324 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below $2.90 level, and the price spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.0324 high. However, the bulls were active near the $2.80 support zone. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.9450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.00 level. A clear move above the $3.00 resistance might send the price toward the $3.080 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance or even $3.150 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.20 zone. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $2.9450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.880 level and the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $2.840 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.840 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.750 support. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.880 and $2.840.

At the heart of the dispute is a push by some members of the GOP to include a ban on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the legislation. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he is hopeful the House will attempt to pass a procedural vote on Wednesday. “It’s a priority of the White House, the Senate and the House to do all of these crypto bills,” he stated, as reported by Politico. Disagreements on Strategy and Bill Structure The package includes the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, along with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, and the CLARITY Act, which proposes a new market framework for crypto assets. Some Republicans have argued that the bills should be bundled into one, but Speaker Johnson pushed back, warning the Senate would not approve such a move. “We have to do them in succession,” Johnson reportedly said. This legislative push is part of the Republican-led “Crypto Week,” intended to pass meaningful crypto regulation before Congress adjourns for a month-long break in August. In response, Democrats have dubbed the effort “anti-crypto corruption week” to express their opposition. CBDC Concerns Drive Republican Resistance Tensions escalated on Tuesday when 13 Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, voted against considering the bills. Among those dissenting were lawmakers such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Biggs, and Victoria Spartz. Several lawmakers took to X to clarify that they weren’t opposed to crypto regulations in general, but refused to support the GENIUS Act without an explicit CBDC ban. “I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on central bank digital currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments,” Greene said. Biggs echoed the sentiment, warning that the current version of the bill could allow for a layered CBDC and lacked guarantees for self-custody. “House Leadership must allow an open amendment process so Members can freely debate and improve the bill,” he added. Past and Future of the GENIUS Act The GENIUS Act had previously failed its first Senate vote in May due to Democratic concerns about Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto. It eventually passed in June with bipartisan support. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long urged calm after Tuesday’s delay, noting that the Senate also required a second vote to move forward on the GENIUS Act. “BEFORE Y’ALL FREAK OUT, don’t forget that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the GENIUS Act failed as well…the second one passed 11 days later,” she wrote on X. Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, argued that the current bill already restricts the Federal Reserve from creating a retail CBDC. Speaker Johnson Continues Talks According to ABC News, Speaker Johnson is continuing discussions with Republican holdouts. However, one of the main sticking points remains whether the three bills should be passed together or separately. “They want to push that and merge them together,” Johnson said. “We’re trying to work with the White House and with our Senate partners on this.” The House is scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday to resume its legislative work.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-16 05:15:17

On Wednesday, the Nasdaq-listed company purchased 6,377 ETH , worth about $19.56m at current prices. That brings SharpLink’s total to nearly 312,000 ETH, valued at roughly $974m, based on Wednesday’s price of $3,122.98 per coin. The latest buy follows a 24,371 ETH purchase made on July 15, a $73m outlay. Between July 7 and July 13, SharpLink picked up another 74,656 ETH for $213m , averaging $2,852 per coin. SharpLink Buys 10K ETH Directly From Ethereum Foundation In one of the most notable transactions, the company directly acquired 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation. SharpLink( @SharpLinkGaming ) bought another 6,377 $ETH ($19.56M) today. In the past 7 days, they've accumulated 91,330 $ETH ($275M). https://t.co/8pOfvpDWym pic.twitter.com/NGepBvYcP4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2025 Since late May, SharpLink has been accumulating Ethereum in large batches, often moving funds on-chain through major centralized exchanges and over-the-counter addresses. This deliberate strategy suggests a long-term view, possibly tied to expectations of major price moves or upcoming upgrades to the Ethereum protocol. The company’s pivot into Ethereum marks a strategic shift. While it remains focused on its core business in sports betting and iGaming, SharpLink is now using ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. That decision came after a $425m private placement led by Consensys, with participation from Pantera Capital, Electric Capital and ParaFi Capital. The move was first announced on May 27, 2025. SharpLink Nears Ethereum Foundation in Holdings Size CEO Rob Phythian has framed the acquisitions as a defining moment for public company engagement with crypto. He said over 99% of SharpLink’s Ethereum holdings are staked or restaked in protocols to generate yield while supporting the security of the Ethereum network. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin, who now chairs SharpLink’s board, has described the firm’s strategy as a public-market proxy for Ethereum exposure, similar to MicroStrategy’s approach with Bitcoin. Lubin emphasized Ethereum’s importance for decentralized applications and digital commerce, pointing to favorable U.S. legislation as a major tailwind. With its daily buying spree showing no signs of slowing, SharpLink could soon overtake the Ethereum Foundation itself, which currently holds around $725m worth of ETH. The company’s positioning reflects a broader trend, as corporations increasingly look beyond Bitcoin and toward Ethereum as a programmable, yield-bearing asset. Investors are taking notice. SharpLink’s stock was up more than 14% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.

The main goal of the task force is to enhance government transparency and efficiency. Meanwhile, crypto’s political influence is growing as Fairshake PAC gathered $141 million to support pro-crypto candidates ahead of the 2026 elections. Despite these advances, key legislation like the GENIUS Act is facing some headwinds in the House. California Partners with Crypto Firms California Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled a new initiative that will help boost government efficiency by bringing together leaders from the cryptocurrency sector to help modernize public services. Dubbed the California Breakthrough Project , the task force includes representatives from Ripple, Coinbase, and MoonPay, among others. It even held its first meeting on June 6 at Ripple’s San Francisco headquarters. The project’s goal is to improve collaboration between regulators and technology firms while also addressing inefficiencies and enhancing transparency in public services. Although Newsom did not specify how blockchain technology might be directly implemented, the inclusion of major crypto firms suggests that the state is seriously considering the role of blockchain in public sector innovation. Part of Gavin Newsom’s announcement California is already a major hub for blockchain activity, with roughly 25% of North America's blockchain companies based in the state. This is according to a recent report by the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency. That same report mentioned the potential for blockchain-based entrepreneurship and innovation to contribute meaningfully to government services and consumer engagement. Newsom's announcement coincided with US Crypto Week, which is a pivotal moment in federal crypto policy where lawmakers prepare to debate several major digital asset bills. Among them are the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, and the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for US dollar-backed stablecoins. Overall, California's decision to formally involve the blockchain industry in state-level innovation initiatives is a major shift in how public institutions are beginning to embrace digital assets and the technologies behind them. Fairshake Builds Political War Chest The growing connection between crypto and politics is becoming harder and harder to miss. Fairshake, a US-based political action committee supported by major crypto firms, recently reported holding $141 million in funds that are specifically aimed at influencing upcoming elections. In the first half of 2025 alone, Fairshake raised approximately $52 million, with Coinbase contributing $25 million. This figure adds to the $109 million the PAC accumulated since November of 2024, which gives it more financial firepower than it deployed in the previous US election cycle. Through affiliated organizations like Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, Fairshake already spent more than $2 million this year in support of candidates running in special House elections in Virginia and Florida. The PAC also previously spent more than $130 million in 2024 to support candidates seen as favorable to cryptocurrency or to oppose those who were deemed hostile to the industry. According to spokesperson Josh Vlasto, Fairshake is actively evaluating races for both the remainder of 2025 and into the 2026 midterm elections. The PAC did not exist during the 2022 midterms, when much of the crypto industry’s political spending was steered by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since been indicted for fraud. While Fairshake did not directly back Donald Trump’s campaign, some well known people in the industry like the Winklevoss twins, Ripple Labs executives, and Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell individually contributed to the president. These contributions come as PAC spending increasingly shapes the legislative environment around digital assets in Congress. After the 2024 elections, Republicans secured narrow control of both the House and Senate, with around 270 lawmakers reportedly aligned with pro-crypto views. Fairshake now seems ready to continue its influence heading into 2026, which could potentially deepen the partisan divide on crypto-related legislation. This week, House Republicans are pushing forward with three key bills focused on payment stablecoins, market structure, and central bank digital currencies. Trump instructed all GOP members to support the stablecoin legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, including new House members from Florida who were backed by crypto PAC funds. GENIUS Act Hits Roadblock Despite crypto making a lot of progress in politics, legislation to regulate payment stablecoins failed to advance in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, despite Trump’s public push for action. The president urged Republicans to approve the GENIUS Act, which is part of a package of crypto-related bills Republican leaders hoped to pass during “crypto week.” However, a key procedural vote fell short, reportedly with at least 13 Republicans voting against it. President Trump post on Truth Social House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested a second vote could take place later in the day, and the GENIUS Act may still reach the House floor by Thursday. The bill previously passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. Trump’s backing of the GENIUS Act attracted a lot of criticism due to revelations that his family-linked company, World Liberty Financial, launched its own stablecoin, USD1, with help from Binance. The stablecoin was allegedly involved in facilitating a $2 billion investment by an Abu Dhabi firm into Binance, which raised serious ethical and national security concerns due to foreign funding and the president’s financial ties to the industry. Press release Democrats responded by launching an “ anti-crypto corruption week ,” and calling for amendments to the digital asset bills that would ban elected officials from holding or promoting cryptocurrencies to prevent conflicts of interest. With Republicans holding a slim majority, political and financial stakes around crypto legislation will certainly stay high heading into the 2026 elections.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|SPONSORED|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-16 05:30:00

Core CPI rose just 0.1% month-over-month for the fifth straight time, fanning bullish sentiment across crypto markets despite broader equity weakness. “The data was bullish for crypto, as the Fed may be more likely to cut interest rates in September, potentially triggering more capital to flow into the crypto industry,” said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer of OSL. “Bitcoin’s price held up well as a testament to traders’ optimism, despite some crypto stocks dropping after the GENIUS Act failed to pass a procedural vote, which will continue to be refined by lawmakers for another vote,"" Cheung added. The data sparked a rebound in ether (ETH) which reclaimed the $3,100 level amid inflows into spot ETFs and tailwinds from a newly passed stablecoin bill, seen as reinforcing ETH’s role as a base layer for tokenized dollars. Dogecoin (DOGE) was sitting near 19 cents, delivering a modest 2.7% daily climb and extending its weekly gain to roughly 15%. Solana's SOL (SOL) remains steady at $163, while XRP (XRP) trades near $2.92, reflecting steady interest. BNB (BNB) trades around $688, holding onto recent gains, and TRON's TRX (TRX) remains flat at about 3 cents. Institutional flows remained strong. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs logged their ninth consecutive day of net inflows, with $403 million added Tuesday. BlackRock’s IBIT alone saw $416 million in new funds, more than offsetting $70 million in combined outflows from GBTC, FBTC and ARKB, according to SoSoValue. Spot ether (ETH) ETFs also posted $192 million in inflows, their eighth straight positive day. In the macro backdrop, Asian markets slipped and U.S. equity futures dipped as traders reassessed the pace of potential rate cuts. While some firms are reportedly passing tariff-related costs to consumers, Fed officials remain cautious. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan noted that the central bank may still need to hold rates steady unless labor markets or inflation weaken further. Still, crypto traders appear to be looking past short-term policy noise. “Despite a temporary setback for the GENIUS Act, Bitcoin has been able to maintain a solid position at around $118,000” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “We remain positive that the current bull run still has much runway left to see higher prices in the second half of the year.” Read more: U.S. June CPI Rose an In Line 0.3%; Core Rate Slightly Better Than Hoped at 0.2%",Markets|Markets|Ether|Dogecoin|Bitcoin|Inflation|Fed|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 05:31:52

Brandon Lutnick, the Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, is in “late-stage talks” with Back on a direct Bitcoin transfer deal, exceeding $3 billion, sources told the Financial Times . Cantor Equity Partners 1, a special-purpose acquisition company, would issue new shares to Back in exchange for 30,000 Bitcoin. Further, the company seeks to raise $800 million in outside capital for additional Bitcoin purchases, the report said. Following the completion of the transaction, the vehicle will be renamed BSTR Holdings. Cantor Equity Partners 1 launched in January with $200 million from its IPO to target crypto investments.

Brandon Lutnick took over as chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald early this year, after his father, Howard Lutnick, joined the Trump administration as commerce secretary. Cantor’s combined SPAC, BSTR Holdings and Twenty One Capital, could accumulate nearly $10 billion in Bitcoin this year. Additionally, in the Cantor-Blockstream deal, the investment banking giant would partner with one of the crypto industry’s earliest supporters – Adam Back. Back, who has long championed institutional adoption as a path to “hyperbitcoinization,” has personally funded several Bitcoin-focused companies. In June, he funded a $15 million convertible bond for Swedish health technology and bitcoin treasury company H100 Group, which has plans to stockpile Bitcoin . Crypto Investors Turn to SPAC or Reverse Mergers Several crypto investors are turning to SPACs to publicly list their crypto ventures. Recently, Trump’s crypto adviser, David Bailey-led Nakamoto Holdings announced that it had raised $51.5 million for its own Bitcoin treasury firm, which it plans to take public via merger with KindlyMD. Last month, Anthony Pompliano announced a $1 billion business merger to create a Bitcoin-native firm, ProCap Financial. The company will go public through a SPAC with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. If completed, the Cantor SPAC deal would become the latest in a series of high-profile deals to buy Bitcoin.

India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.18% to 82,416 in morning trade on Wednesday, snapping the previous session’s gains as traders turned cautious amid ongoing US–India trade negotiations.

Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.83% to around 8,545 on Wednesday, retreating from a record level finish in the prior session.

Price predictions for 2025 suggest highs of $50 and potential ETF approval. Long-term forecasts indicate AVAX could reach $518.50 by 2030. Avalanche has become a go-to platform for developers, especially after its Avalanche 9000 mainnet upgrade and the launch of the AVAX card in early 2025. With lower fees and growing real-world use cases, plus backing from giants like Mastercard and SMBC, AVAX is gaining serious traction.

Moreover, the upcoming years are expected to be bullish, with a conservative momentum. With an optimistic outlook, we expect the AVAX coin price to reach $50 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $12.36 $30.91 $49.46 Avalanche Price Target July 2025 The price prediction for Avalanche (AVAX) in July 2025 suggests that bulls have regained control and moved past short-term EMA hurdles and aimed at 200-day EMA band, flipping this would push AVAX to the $26.50 resistance level. In a more optimistic scenario, prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3 2025, only if momentum remains strong. However, if momentum doesn’t sustain above the 200-day EMA, then momentum could rise for a brief time, and AVAX might retreat to $20 or $15 support in that upcoming short-term scenario. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) AVAX Price Target July 2025 15.00 26.50 33.06 AVAX Price Prediction 2025 Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining traction among developers, thanks to its high throughput and low fees, making it an attractive platform for gaming applications. Looking ahead, there’s a promising outlook for the AVAX price in 2025. A Bloomberg ETF analyst recently suggested that an AVAX ETF could receive approval by the end of the year, with a 90% chance of success. This potential approval could significantly boost adoption and drive prices higher. Meanwhile, a look at its daily technical chart reveals that after a challenging Q1 2025, where AVAX dropped to $14.65, the price showed some recovery in Q2, climbing to $26.50 by mid-May. However, by the end of Q2, it retreated to around $16, facing strong resistance from the 200-day EMA band. Interestingly, the $15-$16 support area has been tested three times in Q2, indicating that bearish pressure is weakening at this level. Even from late June to mid-July, AVAX has surged to $22 following bullish altcoin sentiment. The AVAX is on the brink of forming a golden cross between the 20-day and 50-day for a sustained uptrend and inching towards the 200-day EMA band’s resistance. This is increasing investors’ hopes for H2 to be better than H1. Therefore, if bulls continue the July’s bullish momentum, a short-term rally could push AVAX back to the $26.50 resistance by July 2025. In a more bullish scenario, prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3. For the long term, a price target of $50 is feasible, provided that AVAX maintains above $26.50 and closes daily above this level. Achieving this would signal a shift in trend, breaking the bearish pattern and indicating a Change of Character (ChoCh) followed by an upward Break of Structure (BoS). However, this bullish outlook could be overturned if a strong bearish activity stops $26.50 breach, then AVAX will have no choice but to retreat back to $15 demand area.

Meanwhile, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel has taken a 9.1% stake in Tom Lee’s BitMine as the Ethereum treasury momentum builds, according to an SEC filing . “ETH is going so much higher, and thank you for all the work you’re doing to communicate that to your peers,” commented ‘DeFi Dad,’ who predicted that the asset would top out at between $15,000 and $30,000 this cycle. “One of the best-looking charts right now is Ethereum,” commented trader and analyst ‘Income Sharks,’ who suggested prices would reach $5,000 by September.

It is the highest that ETH has traded since early February. Ethereum has surged almost 30% over the past fortnight, outperforming the wider crypto market after more than a year in the doldrums. However, it still has a long way to go and remains below the July 2024 price of $3,500. Institutions are driving momentum, and retail has yet to join the party, as Ether ETFs have seen more than $1 billion in inflows over the past week, and ETH treasury companies have stacked more than $1.6 billion worth over the past month.

The price is now facing hurdles near $692 and might dip again toward the $675 support. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $675 support zone. The price is now trading below $690 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $692 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $680 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Faces Hurdles After a steady increase, BNB price failed to clear the $710 zone. There was a downside correction below the $690 and $680 levels, unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin . The price even dipped below $678 and tested $675. A low was formed at $674 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above $680. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $707 swing high to the $674 low. However, the bears are active near $692. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $692 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $690 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $692 level. The next resistance sits near the $695 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $707 swing high to the $674 low. A clear move above the $695 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $708. A close above the $708 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $732 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $692 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $682 level. The next major support is near the $680 level. The main support sits at $674. If there is a downside break below the $674 support, the price could drop toward the $665 support.

Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. Algorand’s strong push for scalability, security, and decentralization is paying off. With the launch of AlgoKit 3.0 in Q1 2025 and growing developer interest, ALGO adoption has improved and is now on the rise. The rising adoption is beneficial for an asset, as it is directly proportional to a token’s price. But the big question for intrigued market participants still remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle? Read our in-depth Algorand Price Prediction 2025 and long-term outlook through 2030 to find out. Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Algorand Price Prediction Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Algorand Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast 2026 ALGO Coin Price Projection 2027 Algorand Crypto Price Action 2028 ALGO Token Price Analysis 2029 ALGO Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Algorand Token ALGO Price $ 0.27870982 1.01% Market cap $ 2,410,075,971.5879 Circulating Supply 8,647,259,034.5742 Trading Volume $ 278,673,672.5420 All-time high $3.28 Jun 21, 2019 All-time low $0.0958 Jun 10, 2023 CoinPedia’s Algorand Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Algorand Price Prediction, the forecast for the Algorand network is optimistic for the coming years. With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In Q4 2024, Algorand (ALGO) experienced a significant drive, reaching a high of $0.613, marking a remarkable 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. However, the excitement was short-lived as a sell-off intensified in the final month of 2024, extending that into Q1 2025. By the first week of April, ALGO’s price plummeted to a low of $0.1491, which established a strong multi-year support area. From the second week of April, the price action began to shift, forming a higher-high structure that indicated a recovery from the multi-year support level. By mid-May, Algorand’s price had climbed nearly 70% to $0.24 from the Q2 low of $0.150. Unfortunately, this upward momentum was halted in mid-May as strong supply levels rejected further advances, pushing the price below the 200-day EMA band. In the third week of June, ALGO returned to April’s low, finding support at the $0.15 level. At this point, the price was down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% from mid-May’s peak. The risks were high, with indications that any short-term bearish pressure could lead to a drop to the 2024 low of $0.0943, breaching the $0.15 support. However, everything changed last week in June, which was also the finishing week for H1. The momentum in H2 began with the blast. Algo Price Target July 2025 For Algorand the demand surged in the last week of June with bulls reviving at the price at $0.15, driven by high demand, breaking through the multi-month resistance trendline. By mid-July, ALGO had surpassed mid-May’s high after breaking the 200-day EMA band. Also, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed a golden cross, signaling continued bullish demand in the short term. From late June to mid-July, ALGO price surged to $0.30, recording a remarkable 105% gain, largely fueled by the overall bullish stance in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $123,231. As July progresses, if the $0.27 level maintains strong demand, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.50 mark by the end of the month. But losing the grip at $0.27 could drop ALGO to $0.21. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.18 0.30 0.50 ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, if demand increases in direct proportion to adoption at an unprecedented rate, ALGO could clear significant targets such as the $0.60 mark and potentially reach $0.90 by year-end. While these targets may seem ambitious compared to its current price, a broader view of the monthly chart reveals that the last three years have been characterized by a range-bound sideways movement, contrasting sharply with the high-strength parabolic growth seen in 2021. This perspective suggests that with the right momentum, ALGO could indeed achieve these higher price levels.

Corporate breakout attempts above $2.92–$2.93 failed four times (12:00, 13:00, 17:00, 18:00) as coordinated institutional selling emerged. Market makers and treasury desks provided strong support around $2.85, with volumes exceeding the 78.9 million daily average during 14:00 and 19:00 accumulation windows. Final-hour move from $2.88 to $2.90 (+0.69%) came after a decline to $2.87, supported by 2 million+ token volume bursts — classic institutional footprint. News Background As ProShares’ XRP Futures ETF approaches its July 18 launch, institutions appear to be rotating positions aggressively around key thresholds. While $3.00 remains the headline target, structured selling at $2.93 and consistent buy-side activity around $2.85 suggest tight-range rebalancing by corporate treasury desks. Regulatory ambiguity continues to limit upside, with several desks unwilling to cross full allocation thresholds until ETF flows normalize. Price Action Summary Range: $2.82 → $2.93 | Spread: $0.12 = 4.08% Failed Breakouts: $2.92–$2.93 rejections at 12:00, 13:00, 17:00, 18:00 Support Zone: $2.85 demand during 14:00 and 19:00 sessions Final Hour (02:33–03:32): XRP rose from $2.88 → $2.90 (+0.69%) Volume Spikes: Over 2 million tokens traded at 02:36–02:42, confirming accumulation Technical Analysis Price remains in tight consolidation channel under $3.00 psychological ceiling $2.85 continues to act as a key liquidity zone, with treasury activity concentrated near this level Resistance at $2.93 holds — confirming near-term indecision Classic pattern of higher lows forming intraday, despite rejection at upper boundary Momentum requires clear break above $2.93 with volume above 100 million for continuation What Traders Are Watching Will XRP break $2.93 ahead of the July 18 ETF launch, or fade into range-bound drift? Accumulation zones near $2.85 suggest positioning ahead of potential volatility spike Breakout above $3.00 would likely trigger corporate allocation upgrades across structured portfolios Failure to hold $2.88 could unwind recovery structure and target $2.82 retest Takeaway XRP is consolidating under pressure. Institutions are accumulating — but not yet committing above $2.93. The ETF catalyst is near. Until then, this is a volume game: support at $2.85 holds the floor; resistance at $2.93 sets the ceiling. Break either — and momentum will follow.

Accordingly, cryptocurrency legislation that was expected to be voted on in the US House of Representatives this week has been postponed due to a procedural vote failure. In the vote held yesterday, the proposal, which would have paved the way for the discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills, was rejected with 223 “no” votes against 196 “yes” votes. Following the rejection decision, there was a positive development in laws that are of great importance to US President Donald Trump. Trump intervened and announced a meeting with House members who oppose the procedural agreement for the GENIUS Act. At this point, Trump said that an agreement had been reached to hold a vote again on July 16 and advance the stablecoin bill in the US. Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he met with 11 of the 12 people needed for the passage of the GENIUS Act in the Oval Office. According to Trump's post, the group agreed to vote on the morning of July 16. House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the meeting by phone and stated that he was ready to move forward with a vote as soon as possible. This update came after the House failed to hold a procedural vote on the bill. “I'm currently in the Oval Office at the White House with 11 of the 12 members of the House of Representatives whose approval is needed for passage of the GENIUS Act. After a brief discussion, they all agreed to vote yes tomorrow morning. I hope the vote will take place as soon as possible tomorrow. I extend my gratitude to the representatives for their prompt and positive response.” What Are These Laws? This week, dubbed “Crypto Week,” features two important bills on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. *This is not investment advice.

Volume spiked to 464.28 million during the 23:00–00:00 window, crushing the 24-hour average of 287.95 million. Breakouts occurred at 12:00 and again in the evening session, lifting DOGE past $0.195 resistance. Final hour showed rejection at $0.200, with short-term pullback forming a descending micro-channel into $0.196. News Background DOGE’s breakout follows a broader return of meme coin flows as traders rotate into volatility ahead of key macro events later this week. Institutional footprints were visible in volume surges above $0.195, with market makers defending support levels near $0.190 during the early session. Technical setups are now aligned with Fibonacci retracement targets around $0.197 — with $0.21 flagged as the next extension if bulls regain strength.

Break above $0.200–$0.202 resistance would trigger fresh upside momentum Breakdown below $0.195 invalidates rally setup and reopens $0.190 retest Watch for 20-minute volume bars >25 million to confirm directional shift Takeaway DOGE’s 5% rally was real — volume, structure, and order flow confirm institution-backed momentum. With $0.195 now acting as a potential base, bulls are eyeing $0.21 — but only if $0.200 resistance breaks clean on volume. Until then, the chart remains coiled.

Their proposal aims to steer Bitcoin holders to adopt more secure, quantum-resistant storage methods and implement additional protective measures. Quantum algorithms are a threat to Bitcoin’s cryptographic pillars Crypto experts say quantum computing could break Bitcoin’s encryption system. The network applies cryptographic security measures such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to protect wallets and SHA-256 to confirm mining and transactions. Quantum algorithms, however, pose a threat to these systems. For example, Shor’s algorithm might allow attackers to solve the math underlying these protections, making it possible to expose a private key from a known public key. Many Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses are exposed, which puts an estimated 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply in danger, according to a Deloitte study. Furthermore, with identifiable public keys, Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant wallets would also be vulnerable to quantum attacks . The same applies to another quantum algorithm that threatens the security of Bitcoin — Grover’s algorithm , which cuts the effective security of SHA-256 by 50%. In May, Lopp had cautioned that quantum signature schemes have become significantly larger, which could reopen debates about Bitcoin’s ability to handle high transaction volumes. He also warned that if a quantum computer could break the ECDSA pillar, it would be disastrous—stolen BTC will fill the markets, undermining trust and possibly triggering a price collapse. Experts have articulated that existing quantum computers cannot crack ECDSA now. Some anticipate that quantum computing will become a real threat in at least 10 years, seeing how engineers are still working on building fault-tolerant systems. However, some analysts believe Bitcoin could be in trouble in the next five years if quantum computers advance beyond expectations, an opinion many have brushed off as unlikely. Earlier, Lopp argued that while it’s not easy to estimate how long they have before quantum computing becomes a real threat, the Bitcoin community should collaborate to come up with solutions before it grows into an existential crisis. Lopp’s proposal would have BTC owners shift to post-quantum secure addresses Lopp had help from five other developers to draft the Bitcoin improvement plan. In the proposal, they iterated that Bitcoin is under threat, noting that a successful quantum attack would hurt economies and possibly the entire ecosystem. The proposal also details that miners would have to transfer funds to post-quantum secure addresses and restrict Bitcoin spending within five years. It stated: “It turns quantum security into a private incentive. Fail to upgrade [to a new address type] and you will certainly lose access to your funds.” Ideally, the plan includes incentives for Bitcoin owners who shift to more secure addresses. In his proposal, Lopp also references BIP 360, an upgrade created by Anduro’s Senior Protocol Engineer, Hunter Beast, to introduce address formats incorporating post-quantum cryptography at varying security levels. Other developers, such as Michael B. Casey, Director of Engineering at Marathon, have also contributed their own ideas to strengthen Bitcoin’s defenses. Casey introduced the hourglass narrative, dictating that vulnerable wallet types like pay-to-public-key reduce their number of transactions. He argued that fewer transactions would give the community time to look into other alternatives, at least delaying access to tokens to eight months from a few hours. He further noted that the move would cause hackers to target the older wallets that many people rarely use. Meanwhile, tech giants like Google and Microsoft have poured significant resources into advancing quantum computing.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency. Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.23484121 0.60% Market Cap. $ 9,955,546,057.2896 Trading Volume. $ 735,382,957.6199 Circulating Supply. 42,392,670,019.2012 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile first half of 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement were evident in the TVL, which contributed to this downturn. Ultimately, HBAR was pushed into a converging falling wedge pattern, hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR, breaking free from the wedge and bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived, as geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, causing HBAR’s price to retreat back to its April lows, forming another parallel declining wedge on the chart. By the end of June, HBAR remained within that channel but started to see bears losing grip to bulls, when entering July, momentum blasted, breaking the upper border of the parallel channel. Hedera Price Targets July 2025 Precisely in July, from the declining parallel channel, Hedera saw strong demand starting from $0.125 in late June to mid-July, where HBAR spiked 108% to $0.26, piercing through all short-term and long-term EMA bands. This movement followed a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June and was further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $123,231. As of mid-July, Hedera experienced a slight halt as Bitcoin and the overall market witnessed early profit booking, marking a cooldown phase before another potential rally. If the bulls regain strength and achieve a daily close above $0.270, HBAR price could potentially retest the $0.34 and $0.40 resistance levels in July or the coming months. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.125 $0.27 $0.40 Hedera Price Prediction 2025 (H2) Looking ahead, if the momentum persists, HBAR price might even reach $0.75 by year-end. However, on the downside, failing to maintain the $0.190 support zone could pull it down towards multi-month support at $0.125. Below this level, the price could even drop toward $0.072. Also, while TVL was previously down, it has witnessed a resurgence, with investor trust reflected in TVL increasing from $75 million to $114 million within the last 30 days. Hedera’s internal developments also tell a promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand, with the launch of its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025, aiming to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Moreover, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the Hedera Foundation and the Governing Council rebranded as the Hedera Council. This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem.

The inflation increase appears to have affected investor sentiment. After reaching a new high above $123,000 on Monday, Bitcoin has since declined by roughly 5.4% from that peak, with its price currently trading just above $116,000. The broader crypto market also reacted to the news, with the global crypto market cap valuation dropping by nearly 7% in the past day amid renewed uncertainty about future interest rate policy. While Bitcoin has exhibited a strong uptrend in recent weeks, the latest pullback introduces short-term volatility that analysts are watching closely. One particularly notable development occurred on-chain: a transfer of 10,000 BTC, valued at roughly $1.2 billion, from a dormant address last active over a decade ago. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO Historic Bitcoin Transfer Raises Eyebrows, but No Signs of Exchange Activity CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán shared insights into the large transaction in a recent post titled “10,000 Historic BTC Move On-Chain.” According to Alemán, the transaction occurred on July 14 at 16:17 UTC, moving 10,000 BTC from address ‘bc1q84…7ef6k ‘ to ‘bc1qmu….8v2p.’ These coins had not moved in over 10 years, indicating they likely originated from early miners during Bitcoin’s earliest phases when the block reward was 50 BTC. Alemán noted that such old unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) often trigger concern about potential sell-offs, but in this case, further analysis suggests a more neutral interpretation. The movement of old coins can occur for various reasons, including UTXO consolidation, wallet upgrades, or potential sales. Alemán explained that this transfer displayed characteristics consistent with consolidation for efficiency and security purposes. For example, the transaction used 16 different inputs, which can help reduce future transaction fees. Additionally, no corresponding inflow to centralized exchanges (CEXs) was detected, typically a key signal when holders intend to liquidate. The analyst also pointed out that two small test transactions were sent to the receiving address before the full transfer. These included a 0.00089 BTC and a 1 BTC transaction, commonly used to verify wallet accessibility before moving a large sum. Interestingly, two hours after the initial transaction, the same destination wallet received another transfer of 10,009 BTC, bringing the total to more than 20,000 BTC moved in the span of a few hours. Implications for Market Behavior and On-Chain Trends While the transaction did not lead to immediate market selling, it has added to ongoing discussions about the role of long-term holders in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. Large transfers from early addresses are rare and often interpreted as strategic reorganization of funds. Alemán noted that the absence of exchange-related activity makes it unlikely that the coins are being liquidated in the short term.

Pepecoin is adding new holders fast. But neither comes close to what Unilabs is building. While FLOKI chases headlines and PEPE thrives on short-term hype, Unilabs Finance focuses on real growth and lasting utility. In its latest presale, Unilabs sold over one billion tokens – proof of rising demand. This isn’t speculation. It’s driven by real tools and a clear reward system. UNIL holders earn 30% of platform revenue, offering passive income that meme coins can’t match. Unilabs Finance isn’t just another token. It’s building a full DeFi stack – stablecoin yields, cross-chain trading, and flash loans. Each tool adds value and keeps users engaged. Floki Inu’s Price Surges On Multiple Bullish News Floki Inu’s price jumped 25% last week, fuelled by strong fundamentals and fresh momentum. It became the first meme coin to gain MiCA compliance in the EU, earning “Admission to Trading” status under ESMA. That move opens the door to institutional flows across Europe, giving Floki Inu’s price a serious edge over other meme coins still stuck in legal limbo. Floki Inu Price | Source: TradingView FLOKI also landed a major listing on Webull Pay, unlocking access to over 24 million new users. On top of that, the long-awaited Valhalla mainnet is finally live. Over 100,000 NFTs have already been minted using FLOKI in-game, helping lock supply and boost deflationary pressure. Whales have noticed, adding 1.23 billion tokens to their bags. Open interest hit a yearly high of $50 million. Floki Inu’s price broke past the key $0.000080 level with strong volume. RSI and Bollinger Bands confirm the bullish trend. If momentum holds, traders now look to $0.000095 and possibly $0.0001 as Floki Inu’s price reaches the next breakout zones. Pepecoin Surges Past 463k Holders as Analysts Predict Massive Surge Pepecoin just hit a major milestone – 463,000 holders – and momentum is picking up fast. Bullish signals are stacking up across charts, on-chain data, and derivatives markets, fuelling hopes of a breakout. A clear cup-and-handle pattern is forming, with Pepecoin testing the key $0.00001580 level. A breakout here could send PEPE flying toward $0.000030. The DMI shows strong buyer control, with +DI at 35.3 and -DI at 12.7. ADX sits at 23.0, signalling a trend that’s still strengthening Pepecoin. On-chain activity backs the hype. New wallets are up 39%, active wallets rose 38%, and wallet churn spiked 42% – clear signs of retail growth. Pepecoin whale transactions also increased 6.6%, hinting at quiet institutional moves. Unilabs – The DeFi Powerhouse Nobody Talks About Traditional investors are flocking to Web3 and eyeing DeFi for its low fees, asset control, and freedom. Hedera once led the way, but now Unilabs is winning users. It makes DeFi faster, safer, and easy to use. Active traders love the Cross-Chain Trading Hub. It solves chain fragmentation. You trade across blockchains without risky bridges. You tap into dozens of DEXs with one click. No more delays or security fears. If you prefer steady returns, the SSA is your tool. Deposit stablecoins and earn reliable interest. You skip the wild swings of the crypto markets and collect passive income. Advanced traders get the Flash Loan Accelerator. It delivers instant, no-collateral loans repaid in one transaction. You can run complex strategies, grab arbitrage, or unlock yield—all without locking up your capital. Unilabs Finance isn’t just one app or a memecoin like Pepecoin. It’s a full DeFi ecosystem designed for every style. It blends speed, simplicity, and top-tier security, making it a go-to platform in today’s fast-moving crypto world. UNIL – Fueling Everything with Dividends At the heart of Unilabs sits UNIL, the native token priced at $0.0074. It’s not a hype play like Floki Inu’s price. It powers the platform and pays real rewards. Unilabs returns 30% of its revenue to token holders. That’s a built-in dividend model, not just a promise. The system spans twelve tiers. The more you hold, the bigger your cut. This design drives loyalty and cuts down on pump-and-dump games. It builds a stable base for long-term growth. The upside is huge. Capture just 0.1% of the $500 billion asset management market and Unilabs pulls in $400 million a year. That equals $120 million back to UNIL holders. It’s a clear signal: Unilabs Finance is built for lasting success, not quick hype.

What is the Malaysian Government Saying About Cryptocurrency in 2025? In 2025, the Malaysian government is considering introducing new regulations for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to align with global trends. While the government is creating new frameworks, the Securities Commission of Malaysia (SCM) is focusing on: Regulating cryptocurrencies as securities Overseeing digital assets trade and issuance Regulating digital assets exchange and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)platforms. Crypto License in Malaysia The crypto incident framework in Malaysia aims for technical adherence and transparency in its internal structure. The crypto businesses and platforms are subject to strict penalties, including fees, blocked access, and license revocation for non-compliance with crypto laws. Types of crypto licenses in Malaysia: Issuer: The Main purpose is the issuance and offerings of tokens with a minimum of 500 thousand MYR. Startups and fintech projects are applicable for this license. IEO Operator: Serves as an organization of initial public offerings with 5 million MYR. Platforms for attracting investments are required to obtain this license. Digital asset custodian (DAC): The Primary purpose is serving as a storage of digital assets with 500 thousand MYR fees.

Conclusion Malaysia is one of the countries that does not consider crypto as legal tender, but it has a legal regulatory framework to facilitate it. The country does not even have any specific laws for crypto tax, and this is why Malaysia is recognized as one of the crypto-friendly countries in the world. Despite not having separate laws, the country maintains strict regulations to prevent fraud and risk in the crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, buying and owning crypto is legal in Malaysia. However, it’s not recognized as legal tender, but rather as a security under the Prescription Order 2019 (amended 2025). How is cryptocurrency regulated in Malaysia? The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) regulates crypto as securities, overseeing digital asset trading, issuance, exchanges, and IEO platforms. They are actively developing a comprehensive framework. How is cryptocurrency taxed in Malaysia ? Capital gains from personal crypto investments are generally not taxed. However, crypto trading as a frequent business activity, mining, or receiving crypto as compensation is subject to income tax (0-30%). Which government body is responsible for crypto operations in Malaysia? The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) is the main government body responsible for regulating digital asset operations in the country, including trading, issuance, and safekeeping.

According to analyst Rekt Capital, the PI Cycle Top uses two moving averages to signal when Bitcoin may be nearing its top. Historically, these moving averages, especially the 111-day average, have accurately predicted the end of previous bull markets. Recently, this faster-moving average has been rising sharply. Back on June 1, it was tracking around $92,000, but now it’s already near $98,000, just under $100K. This quick rise shows how strong the current price momentum is. What’s important here is how fast the predicted “crossover,” when the two moving averages intersect, is moving forward in time. A few days ago, the crossover was projected for April 2027, but now it’s shifted to February 2027. And if Bitcoin continues to consolidate or climb, that crossover could move even closer — possibly into 2026 or even late 2025. Why does this matter? Because when the crossover occurs, it has typically marked the top of the bull market. If the trend continues, we could see this crossover hit when Bitcoin is priced somewhere between $130,000 to $170,000, or even more if momentum keeps building. The key takeaway: While we may still be early in this bull run, the data is telling us that the window to take profits could arrive as early as the second half of 2025. The PI Cycle Top Indicator won’t act alone, but it’s one of the most reliable tools we have to track when the cycle might end. Keeping an eye on it could make all the difference in this high-stakes crypto journey.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 06:09:29

Recent moves suggest growing pressure from both bulls and bears, as the asset trades just below a major resistance zone. With volatility compressing and momentum building, it appears primed for its next big move. The market is watching closely—will the XRP price break above the current range and push toward fresh highs, or is a deeper retracement on the horizon? Short-Term Setup: Squeezed Between Support and Resistance Over the past several sessions, XRP has been locked in a consolidation zone, reflecting indecision across the broader crypto market. The price continues to oscillate within a clearly defined band, repeatedly testing both upper and lower bounds without a breakout. This narrowing price behavior reflects a classic “build-up” phase, where momentum is being stored before release. Such setups often result in sharp price moves, depending on whether bulls or bears seize control first. The structure forming on the chart shows a tightening triangle, typically viewed as a precursor to volatility. Current price levels are crucial, as a confirmed move beyond this range could ignite a much stronger trend, either to the upside or downside. While the Bollinger bands are squeezing, the MACD displays a drop in selling pressure. Hence, a strong upward move is approaching. Long-Term Setup: Eyes on Expansion Beyond the Range While XRP’s short-term setup suggests a breakout is near, the longer-term structure presents an even more compelling picture. After years of ranging below its all-time high, XRP is slowly building the foundation for a major macro move. The multi-year resistance zone—previously a ceiling during past rallies—is now being approached with a stronger base structure and renewed investor interest. This prolonged consolidation, combined with strengthening market participation, hints at a potential shift in trend dynamics. If XRP decisively breaks above its current high-timeframe range, the next major move could mark the beginning of a sustained uptrend, not just a short-term spike. The price history suggests that once XRP clears these long-standing resistances, the asset tends to move rapidly toward new territory. This phase may mirror previous cycles, where long periods of consolidation are followed by aggressive price discovery. What’s Next for XRP: Potential Scenarios Bullish Scenario: If buyers reclaim control and push XRP above the overhead resistance with conviction, momentum could quickly build. This would pave the way toward targets near $3.60 and potentially $4.00 in the coming weeks, depending on broader market strength. Bearish Scenario: Failure to hold the $2.60–$2.70 region may expose XRP to deeper retracements. A drop into the $2.30–$2.20 zone remains possible before bulls regroup for another upward attempt. Neutral/Sideways Bias: XRP could also continue to consolidate within its current structure if volume remains thin and no catalyst appears.

As AI systems become more complex and integrated into various sectors, including potentially future crypto applications, a critical question arises: how can we ensure their safety and transparency? Leading AI safety researchers from powerhouses like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic are uniting to address this very concern, advocating for deeper investigation into monitoring the internal workings of advanced AI models. This collective call for transparency marks a significant moment, emphasizing the urgent need to understand AI’s “thoughts” as these systems become more autonomous and capable. Understanding Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Monitoring: A Glimpse Inside AI’s Mind At the heart of this new initiative is the concept of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring. Imagine a student solving a complex math problem, not just providing the answer, but showing every step of their reasoning on a scratchpad. CoT in AI models like OpenAI’s o3 or DeepSeek’s R1 works similarly. It’s an externalized process where AI models articulate their intermediate steps as they work through a problem. This “scratchpad” provides a rare window into the AI’s reasoning process. The position paper highlights CoT monitoring as a valuable addition to existing safety measures for frontier AI, offering insights into how AI agents make decisions. However, researchers caution that this visibility might not persist without dedicated effort. They urge the AI community to make the best use of current CoT monitorability and to actively study how it can be preserved and enhanced. Why is AI Safety Becoming a Unified Global Priority? The push for enhanced AI safety comes at a pivotal time. While tech giants are engaged in fierce competition for AI talent and breakthroughs, there’s a growing consensus on the importance of responsible development. The position paper, signed by luminaries such as OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen, Safe Superintelligence CEO Ilya Sutskever, and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton, represents a powerful display of unity. This collective effort aims to boost research around understanding AI’s internal mechanisms before these systems become too opaque. It’s a proactive step to ensure that as AI capabilities expand, our ability to oversee and control them keeps pace. The urgency is underscored by the rapid release of new AI reasoning models, often with little understanding of their internal workings. The Evolution and Control of AI Reasoning Models and AI Agents AI reasoning models are foundational to the development of sophisticated AI agents . These agents, designed to operate autonomously and perform complex tasks, are becoming increasingly widespread and capable. The ability to monitor their internal chains-of-thought is seen as a core method to keep them under control. While AI labs have excelled at improving performance, understanding how these models arrive at their answers remains a significant challenge. Early research from Anthropic, a leader in AI interpretability, suggests that CoTs might not always be a fully reliable indicator of a model’s true internal state. Yet, other researchers, including those from OpenAI, believe CoT monitoring could become a reliable way to track alignment and safety in AI models. This divergence highlights the need for focused research to solidify the reliability and utility of CoT monitoring as a safety measure. Charting the Course for Future AI Research and Interpretability The position paper is a direct call to action for deeper AI research into what makes CoTs “monitorable.” This involves studying factors that can increase or decrease transparency into how AI models truly arrive at answers. Researchers emphasize that CoT monitoring could be fragile and caution against interventions that might reduce its transparency or reliability. Anthropic, for instance, has committed to cracking open the “black box” of AI models by 2027, investing heavily in interpretability. This collaborative signal from industry leaders aims to attract more funding and attention to this nascent, yet critical, area of research. It’s about ensuring that as AI advances, our understanding of its internal processes does too, preventing a future where AI operates beyond our comprehension or control. This unified front by leading AI minds underscores a critical commitment to the responsible evolution of artificial intelligence. By focusing on methods like Chain-of-Thought monitoring, the industry aims to build a future where AI systems are not only powerful but also transparent and controllable. This proactive approach to understanding AI’s internal “thoughts” is essential for mitigating risks and fostering trust in the technology that will increasingly shape our world. For anyone interested in the intersection of cutting-edge technology and its societal implications, particularly within the fast-paced digital economy, these developments in AI safety and transparency are paramount.

Appearing on CNBC's “Closing Bell” program, Stockton stated that Bitcoin has emerged strongly from the consolidation process in recent weeks and that this rise may continue, according to technical analysis data. Stockton said that this rise, which came after a pause of approximately seven to eight weeks, indicates the market is regaining strength. The expert, who uses a “measured movement projection” method, particularly after the strong breakout of the $108,300 resistance level, stated that this trend could continue to $135,000. According to Stockton, this level stands out as a “quarterly” target before a corrective phase begins.

Stockton noted that Ethereum also broke above its 200-day moving average, signaling a positive signal, while Ripple broke out of its triangle formation and moved upward. He stated that this situation presents a positive technical outlook for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Crypto-related stocks are also experiencing this upward trend. Coinbase shares broke through the upper limit of its long-term “cup and handle” formation, while MicroStrategy shares experienced a short-term breakout. Stockton noted that MicroStrategy, in particular, maintained its long-term upward trend despite its volatile nature and is showing a recent surge. But there are caveats. Stockton noted that the crypto market can occasionally experience vertical price movements, followed by prolonged periods of sideways movement that force investors to wait patiently. *This is not investment advice.

Still, she acknowledged the potential need to cut rates if inflation and labor markets significantly weaken. Speaking on Tuesday, July 15, Logan said that in her view, monetary policy must remain tight for a while longer to return inflation to its target. She further highlighted that they can still maintain high levels of employment even with just a slightly restrictive policy. Logan calls for the urgency of lower rates sooner in a certain inflation scenario During her three years as the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s CEO, Logan has always been careful about inflation issues in the bank’s operations. She recently suggested an inflation situation in which the bank needed to lower rates sooner. Speaking at an event in San Antonio, Logan mentioned that a scenario with a mix of lower inflation and a weakening job market might soon lead to the need for lower interest rates. In the meantime, Federal officers have kept interest rates the same as they investigate the effects of Trump’s tariff policies on prices in a wait-and-see stance. For lawmakers, what has been challenging is the decision-making process concerning the steps to take for the remaining part of the year. In June, federal officers conducted a median estimation on the rate cut issue. Nineteen of them anticipated two rate cuts for this year. On the other hand, the remaining nine expected one rate cut or no rate cut at all. This revealed that the division in their forecasts was largely due to the diversified anticipation of the effects of Trump’s tariff policies on inflation. Additionally, data on consumer prices released Tuesday, July 15, indicated that last month’s basic price increase was smaller than expected. This indicated an unexpected trend that had been experienced in five consecutive months. Still, there was a prospect that companies were more often sharing some of the costs from tariffs with customers. Logan warns against relying on positive brief inflation news Logan commented on the data release on Tuesday, indicating a likelihood of increasing the federal benchmark price in June. She then warned of relying heavily on brief positive inflation news. Based on her argument on brief positive inflation news, they created hope in the past, only to let people down when inflation rose. The CEO highlighted that she only needs to see low inflation last for a while before she gets fully convinced that all is well. Besides inflation news, Logan also addressed concerns about federal officers’ independence. Interestingly, this has been a topic other officers have recently emphasized. Frequent criticism and US President Trump’s persistent requests for lower interest rates have brought this topic to the table. Logan tried to explain this, stating that a central bank can increase jobs in the short term by lowering interest rates. Even so, based on her argument, cutting rates too much could increase prices, erasing the advantages of a strong job market. Therefore, to maintain a healthy economy in the long run, she cautioned that a central bank must consider its decisions carefully. Despite all this, this year’s qualitative data has greatly motivated federal officers as well as economic experts who were earlier expecting much worse results.

These platforms became the go-to for developers looking to leverage artificial intelligence to streamline their coding processes. However, a quiet yet profound revolution is underway, one that sees AI coding tools shifting their focus to a seemingly unexpected place: the terminal. This move, driven by the increasing capabilities of agentic AI and the rise of ‘vibe-coding,’ is poised to redefine how AI systems interact with software, moving beyond mere code generation to direct system interaction. The Astonishing Shift: Why AI Coding Tools Are Embracing the Terminal When you think of a terminal, your mind might conjure images of a black-and-white screen from a 90s hacker movie. It’s an old-school interface, lacking the visual flair of modern integrated development environments (IDEs). Yet, beneath its unassuming exterior lies an extremely powerful interface, especially for those who master its commands. While code-based agents excel at writing and debugging code, the journey from written code to a functional, deployable application often requires direct interaction with the system’s shell. This is where the terminal steps in, offering a direct conduit to run programs, manipulate data, and configure environments. The clearest indicator of this shift comes from major AI research labs. Since February, industry giants like Anthropic, DeepMind, and OpenAI have launched command-line coding tools. Anthropic introduced Claude Code, DeepMind rolled out Gemini CLI, and OpenAI released CLI Codex. These tools have rapidly become some of their most popular offerings. While they might operate under familiar branding, the underlying mechanics represent a significant evolution in how AI agents engage with computers, both online and offline. This quiet revolution, often overlooked, holds immense implications for the future direction of AI-powered software development . From Code Editors to Command Lines: The Rise of Agentic AI in the Shell The growing power of agentic AI is a primary catalyst for this transition. Unlike earlier AI assistants that primarily suggested code snippets or debugged existing code, agentic AI systems are designed to operate more autonomously, taking a series of steps to achieve a goal. This step-by-step problem-solving approach aligns perfectly with the procedural nature of terminal commands. Instead of just editing code within a graphical interface, these agents are now capable of interacting directly with the shell, performing tasks that go beyond the confines of a code editor. Alex Shaw, co-creator of the leading terminal-focused benchmark TerminalBench, believes this is just the beginning. “Our big bet is that there’s a future in which 95% of LLM-computer interaction is through a terminal-like interface,” Shaw states. This perspective highlights the versatility of the terminal, which operates at a very low level in the developer stack, making it an ideal environment for running sophisticated AI agents that need to control various aspects of a system. Transforming Software Development: Benefits and Breakthroughs The timing of this shift is particularly noteworthy, as some prominent code-based tools are facing challenges. The AI code editor Windsurf, for instance, has experienced significant upheaval due to dueling acquisitions, with key executives moving to Google and the remaining entity acquired by Cognition. This has left the consumer product’s long-term viability uncertain. Furthermore, recent research suggests that developers might be overestimating the productivity gains from conventional AI coding tools. A METR study comparing Cursor Pro, Windsurf’s main competitor, found that while developers anticipated completing tasks 20-30 percent faster, their observed process was nearly 20 percent slower. This indicates that traditional code assistants were, in some cases, costing programmers valuable time. This situation has created an opening for companies like Warp, which currently leads the TerminalBench rankings. Warp positions itself as an “agentic development environment,” bridging the gap between comprehensive IDE programs and pure command-line tools like Claude Code. Zach Lloyd, Warp’s founder, remains highly optimistic about the terminal’s potential. He views it as a means to tackle problems that would be beyond the scope of a code editor like Cursor, such as configuring a Git server or troubleshooting why a script fails to run. Lloyd emphasizes, “The terminal occupies a very low level in the developer stack, so it’s the most versatile place to be running agents.” How do terminal-based tools measure success? To truly grasp the difference, consider the benchmarks used to evaluate these tools. The previous generation of developer tools , primarily code-based, focused on solving GitHub issues, which formed the basis of the SWE-Bench test. Each problem on SWE-Bench represents an open issue from GitHub – essentially, a piece of broken code that needs fixing. Models would iterate on the code until a working solution was found. While integrated products like Cursor offered more sophisticated approaches, the core methodology remained centered on transforming non-functional code into working code. Terminal-based tools, however, adopt a broader perspective. They look beyond just the code to encompass the entire environment in which a program operates. This includes not only coding tasks but also more DevOps-oriented responsibilities, such as setting up dependencies, configuring servers, or diagnosing system-level issues. For example, a TerminalBench problem might challenge an agent to reverse-engineer a compression algorithm from a given decompression program and target text file. Another scenario might require the agent to build the Linux kernel from source, even if it means first downloading the source code itself. These challenges demand the kind of persistent problem-solving ability essential for experienced programmers. “What makes TerminalBench hard is not just the questions that we’re giving the agents,” says Shaw, “it’s the environments that we’re placing them in.” This crucial aspect means tackling problems step-by-step, a skill that underpins the power of agentic AI. However, even the most advanced agentic models currently struggle to handle all these complex environments. Warp, despite its leading score on TerminalBench, solved just over half of the problems, highlighting both the benchmark’s difficulty and the significant potential yet to be unlocked in terminal-based AI. Navigating the Future of Developer Tools: Challenges and Opportunities Despite the existing challenges, the value proposition of terminal-based AI coding tools is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Lloyd believes that these tools are already capable of reliably handling much of a developer’s non-coding workload. “If you think of the daily work of setting up a new project, figuring out the dependencies and getting it runnable, Warp can pretty much do that autonomously,” Lloyd explains. “And if it can’t do it, it will tell you why.” This capability frees up developers to focus on more complex, creative coding tasks, potentially leading to significant productivity gains that traditional code assistants have struggled to deliver. The implications for the future of software development are profound. As agentic AI continues to evolve, its ability to interact seamlessly with the terminal will likely lead to more autonomous development environments. This could mean less time spent on tedious setup and debugging, and more time on innovation. Developers may find themselves becoming more like orchestrators, guiding AI agents through complex tasks rather than manually executing every step. This shift promises a more efficient and perhaps even more intuitive development experience, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the coding world. The quiet pivot of AI coding tools towards the terminal represents a monumental shift in the landscape of software development. Fueled by the advancements in agentic AI and the limitations of traditional code editors, this move unlocks a new level of versatility and efficiency. While challenges remain in fully harnessing the terminal’s potential, the pioneering work by major labs and companies like Warp suggests a future where AI interacts directly with the system’s core, transforming how we build, deploy, and maintain software. This subtle yet powerful evolution promises a more autonomous and productive future for developers worldwide.

And is expected to set the stage for a potential breakout toward the next big target at $0.85. This technical move comes amid improving altcoin sector’s strength, with capital rotating out of Bitcoin as the altcoin season index climbed 9.4%. What has favored Cardano’s buzz is that Emurgo unveiled the Cardano Card on July 15. This development allows users to spend ADA globally, earn DeFi-based rewards, and allocate a portion of profits to the Cardano treasury, enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. While the network has developments fueling its long-term run, wondering when will Cardano go up? Join me as I decode the Cardano analysis for the short term. ADA Network Activity on the Move? Cardano’s rally is supported by surging on-chain activity. According to Santiment data, active ADA addresses have climbed to 38.5k, marking a streak of a 10-day uptrend. This sharp increase reflects renewed user engagement following the Cardano Card launch and aligns with ADA’s breakout above $0.74. Rising active addresses typically signal organic network growth, often coming before sustained price gains, strengthening the bullish outlook as ADA eyes the $0.85 target. Cardano Price Analysis: At the time of press, ADA is changing hands at $0.7434, marking a 2.17% daily increase. The market cap stands at $26.31 billion, while 24-hour trading volume has dropped by 20.12% to $1.34 billion, suggesting a cooling-off phase following recent gains. As evident from the 4-hour chart, ADA is consolidating just above the Bollinger Band mid-line, which is at 20 SMA at $0.7361, with upper band resistance around $0.7607. The price is forming a bullish continuation pattern, with immediate support between $0.68–$0.70. Talking about Cardano future price , it could target $0.85 in the near term. The RSI at 58.59 indicates there’s still room for upward movement without entering overbought territory. This neutral-to-bullish momentum, paired with fundamental catalysts and altcoin market support, makes a compelling case for further upside. FAQs Is ADA bullish above $0.74? Yes, breaking the $0.74 resistance is a strong bullish signal, suggesting the potential to target $0.85 in the near term. What is Cardano price today? At the time of publication, Cardano is changing hands at $0.7434, with an intraday gain of 2.17%. What levels should traders watch now? Immediate support lies at $0.68–$0.70.

Mutuum Finance presale phase 5 is more than 70% sold out. The presale has been purchased by more than 13400 investors. It has already collected more than $12.4 million. While Solana (SOL) continues on a steady path, traders are shifting focus to high-upside opportunities, and MUTM is topping watchlists for what to buy before July ends. Mutuum Finance could outperform Solana (SOL), with whispers of a 10,000% rally and on-chain activity exploding. Big Industry Players Targeting Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is greatly impacting the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector because it is providing real-world applicable scalable monetary system. The popularity can even be quantified by the level of the interest of the investors since it has already crossed 13,400 token holders, coupled with over $12.4 million worth of investments that are evidences of the market’s willingness to be able to support itself in the long term. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,0000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance has launched a 100,000 giveaway in an attempt to win over the community as well. The individuals who will participate will be sampled in order to ascertain the list of ten individuals that will receive $10,000 in MUTM as rewards. This grand act does not only determine those who will be rewarded beforehand, but it also indicates that the project is willing to establish a solid and worthwhile base of users. $50,000 Official Bug Bounty Program In addition to enhancing its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further initiated Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK, a blockchain security company. The project will reward 50,000 USDT to the hunters that show potential areas of concerns through the program. The objective of the bounty program is to obtain adequate coverage in each of the types of vulnerability; it is broken down into the four severity levels; i.e., critical, major, minor and low. The project reflects the active will of the team towards the preservation of its ecosystem and investors’ confidence. Fueling The Future of DeFi through Dual-Lending Mutuum Finance offers a distinct platform on which users control their assets of decentralized borrowing. The platform employs such double-model structure to provide adaptability together with efficiency that encompass Peer-to-Contract as well as Peer-to-Peer of lending models. Peer-to-Contract utilizes self-executing smart contracts that execute the lending function autonomously with no intervention from humans. They are designed to run dynamically based on changing market prices, providing a variable rate of interest pegged on the present supply and demand of an in-real-time interest. On the one side, Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and provides an opportunity to be in touch with lenders and borrowers directly. This is even superior towards utilization for volatile goods because it allows customized terms of loans and flexibility based on user choice and his or her risk-bearing capability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction as Phase 5 of its presale crosses 70% sold, backed by 13,400+ participants and more than $12.4 million raised. Its innovative dual-lending model, real-time interest mechanics, and features like a $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program are attracting both users and institutional watchers. While Solana (SOL) maintains its pace, MUTM is being positioned by many as the next breakout DeFi asset, fueled by bold forecasts of a 10,000% upside.

48337720,https://thecoinrise.com/vanguard-becomes-largest-institutional-shareholder-of-microstrategy/,1752651002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/48337720.jpeg,Vanguard Becomes Largest Institutional Shareholder of MicroStrategy,https://thecoinrise.com/vanguard-becomes-largest-institutional-shareholder-of-microstrategy/,"Vanguard, one of the world’s leading investment firms, has quietly become the largest institutional shareholder of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company widely recognized for using Bitcoin as its main treasury reserve asset. According to data from investment research platform Intel, Vanguard now holds over 20 million shares of MicroStrategy, amounting to around 8% of the company’s outstanding Class A common stock. This significant stake indirectly exposes Vanguard to the more than 200,000 Bitcoin that MicroStrategy keeps on its balance sheet, marking a 26.3% increase in holdings from January to April 2025. This exposure largely comes through Vanguard’s various index and mutual funds, including the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, which includes MicroStrategy in its broad U.S. equity allocation. Additionally, MicroStrategy is part of multiple Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs tracking mid-cap benchmarks. Vanguard: Reluctant on Bitcoin Despite its growing indirect exposure to Bitcoin through MicroStrategy, Vanguard has maintained its cautious stance on cryptocurrency. The firm has consistently warned clients about the volatility of digital assets and has declined to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs , unlike competitors such as BlackRock. In a Bloomberg TV interview in May, Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji made it clear that the company would not change its approach to cryptocurrencies, stating, “We don’t get caught up in the latest fad, but we’re dependable for the long term.” In another interview with ETF.com, Ramji emphasized that Vanguard is not interested in “making bets on speculative assets like Bitcoin,” highlighting that such moves are inconsistent with the investment philosophy Vanguard has built over five decades. A Byproduct of Passive Investing Vanguard’s unexpected exposure to Bitcoin through its stake in MicroStrategy has brought attention to the realities of passive investing. As Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted, passive index funds require holding all stocks within the index, regardless of the company’s focus or the manager’s personal views on certain assets. Balchunas remarked that Vanguard’s significant exposure to a company deeply tied to Bitcoin highlights how index investing can lead to unintended exposure, adding humorously that this situation proves “God has a sense of humor.” The post Vanguard Becomes Largest Institutional Shareholder of MicroStrategy appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Vanguard crypto|Vanguard MSTR Holdings,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-07-16 07:30:02

Currently, the Australian government is setting some upcoming regulations for cryptocurrency to enhance industry compliance and address debanking concerns. The government is planning to boost the country’s financial sector in the global economy and competitiveness with new crypto laws. Primary focus: Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) is focusing on consumer protection, market integrity, and enforcement . The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT). Crypto License in Australia The ASIC classifies crypto as a financial product, subjecting crypto exchanges and other platforms to an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) and Market License Framework . In March 2025, Australia’s government announced plans for a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms. The new rules introduced mandatory licensing, while small firms and software developers will be exempt from these obligations . ASIC is pushing for VASPs to hold market licenses, which have many restrictions. Crypto Tax in Australia Is crypto taxable in Australia? Yes, ATO classifies cryptocurrency coins, stablecoins, NFTs, and tokens as property and assets of capital gains tax (CGT). How is crypto taxed? If an individual is selling, trading, spending, or gifting crypto, the capital gain is included in the income tax. This income tax rate depends on the total income during the tax year . Important note: If cryptocurrency is held for longer than a year, a 50% capital gains tax discount can be availed. Reporting: The tax reporting deadline for the 2024-2025 financial year is October 31, 2025. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) can track crypto and impose severe penalties on tax evasion . Income of an individual Tax rate $0- $18,200 0% $18,201 – $45,000 16% $45,001 – $135,000 30% $135,001 – $190,000 37% $190,001+ 45% Crypto Adoption in Australia In 2025, approximately 32% of Australians own cryptocurrency, positioning the country among the top global crypto adopters. It also marks a significant increase from 28% in 2024. 95% of Australians are aware of at least one cryptocurrency, with 75% of investors holding Bitcoin . The revenue in the crypto market in Australia & Oceania is projected to reach US$1.2 billion by 2025. The current crypto revenue in the region is growing at a rate of 19.29% and will reach US$1.4 billion by 2026 . Crypto holdings: The Australian government’s crypto holdings are not publicly disclosed; it rather focuses on developing regulations and a framework for digital assets. Conclusion The Australian government is currently investigating the potential of central bank digital currency (CBDC) to integrate it into the country’s financial framework. While AUSTRAC and ASIC are developing consumer protection measures, the Aussie government is actively working to establish a successful regulatory balance between innovation and stability. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The late-evening intervention secured commitments from 11 of the 12 Republicans needed to advance the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act and companion crypto bills. Trump Steps Up After Unexpected Defeat The House voted 196-223 against a procedural rule Tuesday during “Crypto Week” that would have allowed the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act to advance to floor debate. The unexpected defeat threatened to derail the administration’s push for comprehensive digital asset legislation. Trump wrote on Truth Social. Many Republicans who voted against the bills expressed concerns that the GENIUS Act could enable a central bank digital currency despite language explicitly prohibiting the Federal Reserve from creating one. The bill states it “shall not be construed as expanding the Fed’s authority to offer services directly to the public.” The turnaround came after months of bipartisan work on the GENIUS Act, which passed the Senate 68-30 in June with 18 Democrats joining most Republicans. The legislation requires stablecoin issuers to maintain full dollar backing and establishes clear federal oversight frameworks. Republican Revolt Nearly Derails Crypto Legislation Thirteen Republicans initially voted against the procedural rule, citing fears about potential CBDC authorization. The “no” votes included prominent conservatives such as Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Chip Roy (Texas), and Andy Biggs (Ariz.). “ I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments, ” Rep. Greene wrote on X. The revolt occurred despite House Republicans’ strategy to advance the Senate version without amendments, thereby expediting the bill’s arrival at Trump’s desk. This approach was designed to deliver the first major crypto legislation to clear both chambers of Congress. Speaker Mike Johnson participated in Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting via telephone and committed to scheduling the re-vote as early as possible Wednesday morning. NOTICE OF ACTION The Committee granted, by a recorded vote of 8-4, a rule providing for consideration of H.R. 4016, H.R. 3633, H.R. 1919, and S. 1582. Thanks to @HouseAppropsGOP , @FinancialCmte , and @HouseAgGOP for their testimony tonight. pic.twitter.com/oAqzRkXVRa — House Rules Committee (@RulesReps) July 15, 2025 The Committee on Rules had granted an 8-4 vote providing consideration for the crypto bills following testimony from key House committees. Rep. Warren Davidson, a Republican who generally supports crypto policy, opposed the GENIUS Act strategy , calling the decision to separate the bills “designed to ultimately fail.” However, Financial Services Chair French Hill defended the approach, stating the bills “will protect investors, consumers, and make America a leader in financial technology.” Even Congressman Tim Moore has voiced his support on X in a post he made a few hours ago. Congress has a real opportunity to ensure America leads on crypto. The House must pass the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act to protect innovation, privacy, and the future of the U.S. dollar. pic.twitter.com/dZsRMh40fT — Congressman Tim Moore (@RepTimMooreNC) July 15, 2025 The GENIUS Act would establish federal licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers and mandate full backing with U.S. dollars or equivalent liquid assets. Consumer protections are included for bankruptcy scenarios, with stablecoin holders receiving priority payments. Treasury Chief Champions Stablecoins as Dollar Reinforcement Tool Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has become one of the key advocates for the GENIUS Act, declaring that stablecoins can “reinforce dollar supremacy” rather than threaten U.S. monetary dominance. His comments directly address European concerns about American digital asset policies. Crypto is not a threat to the dollar. In fact, stablecoins can reinforce dollar supremacy. Digital assets are one of the most important phenomena in the world right now, yet they have been ignored by national governments for far too long. This administration is committed to… pic.twitter.com/vWsLgYyNW7 — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) June 18, 2025 The Treasury chief characterized crypto as “one of the most important phenomena in the world right now “ while criticizing how digital assets have been “ignored by national governments for far too long.” His embrace contrasts sharply with growing European resistance to U.S. stablecoin expansion. Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti warned that U.S. stablecoin policies could pose a “more dangerous impact on the euro than trade tariffs.” European officials fear dollar-denominated stablecoins could undermine monetary sovereignty by offering Europeans alternative payment methods that bypass local financial institutions. The stablecoin market has grown from under $10 billion to $239 billion in five years, with 98% of stablecoins pegged to the dollar and 80% of transactions occurring outside the United States. This expansion has prompted the European Central Bank to accelerate its digital euro project , though implementation remains years away. In light of the near-conclusion of the political drama surrounding the GENIUS Act, Federal banking regulators issued guidance on Monday, clarifying that banks can provide cryptocurrency custody services in both fiduciary and non-fiduciary arrangements. The joint statement from the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC emphasized existing risk-management protocols while removing previous restrictions on crypto business engagement.

The firm confirmed that they adjusted Grok’s software to solve the problem and shared the details on GitHub for transparency xAI noted that the new updated version of the chatbot, Grok 4, had several issues that it investigated and had to mitigate. The upgraded version was introduced last Wednesday, and the firm’s founder said the artificial intelligence software was truth-seeking and anti-woke. He also argued that the updated chatbot operates on standardized tests and requires doctorate-level knowledge in every discipline. xAI notices issues with Grok 4 On the morning of July 8, 2025, we observed undesired responses and immediately began investigating. To identify the specific language in the instructions causing the undesired behavior, we conducted multiple ablations and experiments to pinpoint the main culprits. We… — Grok (@grok) July 12, 2025 Users noted that Grok 4 based its responses on controversial matters on Musk’s views. CNBC also confirmed that the chatbot generated its responses on some potentially contentious questions by analyzing Musk’s posts. A prompt about who the chatbot supports in the conflict between Israel and Palestine showed Grok analyzing the web and X for Musk’s opinion on the matter before issuing a response, which directly referenced Musk’s stance. According to a similar prompt on Grok 3, the chatbot maintained a neutral stance and provided context. Grok 4 also responded to prompts by referencing Musk directly when asked who it supported to become the new Mayor of New York City. The chatbot suggested Curtis Sliwa, similar to Musk’s option, arguing that the Republican candidate focused on combating crime and restoring safety in the city. The chatbot had also previously made statements regarding “white genocide” in South Africa, a conspiracy theory that Musk has pushed. He also once claimed that white South Africans were being persecuted in the country because of their race. The company also confirmed that it deleted some racist, sexist, and antisemitic posts that the chatbot had made earlier last week on X. xAI apologized on Saturday to its users about Grok’s earlier responses. “xAI is training only truth-seeking, and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.” – Grok . The artificial intelligence firm acknowledged that it’s working towards making Grok issue more helpful and truthful responses. xAI found that the chatbot’s issue stemmed from a recent update to its code path upstream, which it said appeared to be different from Grok’s language model. xAI also found that the updated code ran for about 16 hours. The artificial intelligence company believes said the time the code ran made it vulnerable to extremist views from other X users xAI revealed that the upgraded code prompted the chatbot to give answers as they are. The updated code also allows the chatbot to understand the tone, context, and language of a user’s post and issue a response accordingly. xAI fixes issues with Grok 4 According to xAI, Grok 4 will now humanize its replies on posts while keeping them engaging, and will not duplicate original posts. The company confirmed removing the code and re-engineered Grok’s system to prevent further abusive responses. The firm also found that the Grok 3 chatbot had declared itself a super-Nazi, claiming to be MechaHitler. The chatbot claimed that a user was celebrating the tragic death of white kids just because of a common Jewish surname. The company has now deleted a flurry of those posts from Grok and acknowledged that it had taken action to ban hate speech before the chatbot posts on X. Musk had said last week that Grok 4 was an improved version, which users would notice the difference when asking it questions. The chatbot revealed Monday that the U.S. Department of Defense had issued a $200 million contract for developing and implementing artificial intelligence tools for the agency.

Accumulation indicators and Aroon Up at 85% suggest strong upward trend and minimal selling pressure. Chainlink’s U.S. policy initiative boosts visibility as market eyes breakout confirmation on daily chart. LINK Edges Toward Breakout Zone Chainlink (LINK) is nearing a level traders have been watching closely. At $16.05, the price has gained over 4% in the past day and more than 15% in the last week. The move puts it just below the $17.5 mark seen by many as the next hurdle. A break above that could set the stage for a push toward $22. Crypto analyst Ali commented, “Chainlink is trading in a channel and pushing towards the top; a break above $17.5 could trigger a breakout to $22.” The momentum is building, with bullish price action being supported by substantial trading volume and broader market strength. Chainlink $LINK could flip resistance and take off from here! pic.twitter.com/ouDItP72yU — Ali (@ali_charts) July 15, 2025 Momentum Signals Point Up On-chain indicators show a market leaning toward accumulation. The Accumulation/Distribution line has been climbing, now sitting at 365.71 million. This suggests traders are adding to positions rather than selling into strength. In addition, the Aroon indicator shows a clear upward trend, with Aroon Up at 85.71% and Aroon Down at 0.00%. This setup suggests buyers are in control, with no recent signs of downward movement. Source: TradingView Key Levels in Focus Technical analysts are tracking two nearby levels. The first is $16.80, which has been identified as the next trigger for buyers. If LINK holds above this area, it may signal that the market is preparing for a larger move. CRYPTOWZRD noted that LINK closed the day with a solid bullish candle. “One more healthy bullish candle will add impulsive momentum and drive LINK higher,” he explained. If the token clears $17.5, the move may accelerate. Chainlink’s recent partnership with the Blockchain Association adds to its visibility. On July 15, Chainlink and the Blockchain Association introduced a new initiative called “ Tokenized in America. ” Meanwhile, the goal is to map blockchain policy across U.S. states using a custom scoring system. The project could draw more attention to Chainlink as discussions around regulation and adoption continue.

The price has surged past key resistance levels, hinting at the beginning of a larger upward trend. With technical patterns aligning and broader market sentiment stabilizing, traders are now eyeing the highly anticipated $200 price target. But is this breakout the real deal, or just another trap? This analysis dives deep into the charts to uncover what’s next for Solana. Current Solana Price Analysis: Breakout in Motion Solana’s price has broken out above the $160 resistance, a level that had capped upside moves throughout late June and early July. The breakout wasn’t just a wick—it was supported by bullish price structure, including a series of higher lows and tightening range compression. This setup strongly resembles a bullish continuation pattern, indicating that bulls are regaining control after a prolonged period of indecision. The momentum suggests that SOL could now aim for the $200 mark, a level not revisited with strength since late 2023. Why $200 Matters for Solana The $200 level isn’t just a round number—it’s a technical confluence zone. It aligns with: The 1.618 Fibonacci extension from the $118–$145 base move A former support-turned-resistance level from the previous cycle A key psychological milestone that could shift sentiment if breached Breaking above $200 could trigger a wave of renewed retail and institutional interest, further accelerating SOL’s upside trajectory. What Could Invalidate the Breakout? While the setup looks promising, it’s important to stay objective. If SOL fails to hold above $160, the breakout could be short-lived. A breakdown below $150–$155 would place SOL back into the previous range and suggest a potential revisit of the $135–$140 support zone. In that case, momentum may stall, and the bullish thesis would be temporarily invalidated. Keep an eye on volume and daily closes to confirm breakout strength. Higher Timeframe Outlook: Could $240–$260 Be Next? The daily price chart of Solana appears to be extremely bullish, even though the bulls are finding it difficult to lift the rally above $170. The price is heavily accumulating within a price range just below the crucial barrier at $180. If these levels are achieved, the SOL price is believed to kick-start a strong rally to $250. The SOL price appears to be at the final step in completing the cup & handle pattern while the levels remain glued between the 50 & 200 day MA. The RSI is incremental, which suggests a rise to the neckline could be on the horizon. Key Levels to Watch Level Significance $160–$165 Breakout zone / new support $200 Target resistance & psychological level $240–$260 Breakout zone/new support $145 Invalidation level for breakout Final Thoughts: Is Solana Ready to Run? The Solana breakout toward $200 appears technically justified, backed by a strong structural base, renewed momentum, and favourable market context. While short-term pullbacks are likely along the way, the path of least resistance for now seems tilted to the upside.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 07:44:16

Over the past month, Avalanche (AVAX) posted a respectable 11% gain, but industry experts are more impressed with Ruvi AI’s (RUVI) staggering 50% growth over the same period. With fundamental advantages like transparency, innovative solutions, and early-stage momentum, Ruvi AI has emerged as a promising contender set to outperform Avalanche in the long run. Leveraging Transparency and Security Ruvi AI lays a solid foundation for trust, beginning with a third-party audit conducted by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. This audit ensures Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are both secure and scalable, protecting investors from vulnerabilities that are all too common in emerging crypto projects. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, a globally renowned platform that guarantees post-presale liquidity. This means investors can access their assets and trade them seamlessly once Ruvi AI lists publicly. Together, the audit and exchange partnership demonstrate Ruvi AI’s commitment to transparency, a critical factor that resonates strongly with today's cryptocurrency investors. Presale Campaign Captures Investor Attention Ruvi AI’s presale has already been a resounding success, generating significant excitement within the crypto community: $2.3 million raised from enthusiastic early investors. Over 185 million tokens sold, driven by strong demand and market confidence. A growing base of more than 2,200 holders, steadily building Ruvi AI’s ecosystem. Currently, Ruvi AI tokens are available at just $0.015 per token (Phase 2), making now an ideal time for investors to enter at an affordable price point with high potential upside. When the presale concludes, the token price will rise to $0.07 per token, delivering an almost 5x ROI even before trading begins. Analysts further predict a $1 valuation post-listing, meaning early investors could realize a remarkable 66x ROI. Compare this with Avalanche’s slowing growth, and it’s clear why Ruvi AI has become a more attractive prospect. Real-World Use Cases Add Value While many cryptocurrencies depend heavily on speculative value, Ruvi AI differentiates itself by offering practical, real-world applications. By combining artificial intelligence and blockchain, Ruvi AI is designed to address challenges across high-demand sectors like marketing, entertainment, and finance. Here’s how the project stands out: Revolutionizing Marketing For today’s competitive brands, achieving precise advertising results is more important than ever. Ruvi AI offers AI-powered marketing tools that optimize audience targeting, eliminate inefficiencies, and deliver exceptional ROI for businesses. This makes Ruvi AI an asset for companies looking to outpace their competition in the digital era. Supporting Content Creators Ruvi AI also tackles common pain points in the creator economy. With blockchain-secured payment systems, the platform ensures instant, transparent payouts, addressing delays that frequently frustrate digital creators. Additionally, Ruvi AI provides these creators with AI-powered analytics, enabling deeper audience engagement and better monetization opportunities. Innovating the Finance Sector Traditional financial systems are riddled with slow processes, high fees, and fraud risks. Ruvi AI disrupts this space by offering low-cost cross-border payments and fraud-proof transaction methods, delivering secure, scalable alternatives in the financial world. VIP Investment Tiers Deliver Exceptional ROI Ruvi AI incentivizes early investors through its VIP program, offering significant bonuses that can substantially amplify potential returns. These tiers include: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. This tiered approach caters to a wide range of investors while maximizing ROI for those who choose to support Ruvi AI early on. Why Ruvi AI’s Growth Is Just the Beginning Avalanche’s 11% growth might seem reasonable for an established blockchain, but Ruvi AI’s 50% monthly rise highlights a project that’s just starting to hit its stride. Backed by: $2.3 million raised in presale funding, Over 185 million tokens sold, and A growing community of 2,200 holders, Ruvi AI is clearly positioned for explosive growth, far outpacing Avalanche’s limited upward trajectory.

The rally comes amid unverified rumors that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could vote this Thursday to dismiss its long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs. A closed-door SEC meeting is reportedly scheduled for July, and many in the XRP community believe it could close the final chapter of the high-profile case. If the SEC chooses to drop its appeal, and Ripple follows by withdrawing its own, the district court’s ruling in Ripple’s favor would go into full effect, bringing the case to a close. However, legal experts warn against jumping to conclusions. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that while the SEC may vote to dismiss its appeal soon, the contents of these closed meetings remain confidential. “Anyone claiming to know what’s on the agenda is speculating,” he said. Still, Fagel agreed that a resolution is likely coming in the weeks ahead. Sorry, but no. Both parties still have pending appeals. The SEC needs to vote to approve dismissing its appeal, after which both parties will file papers to dismiss their respective appeals and the district court’s order against Ripple will go into effect. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 15, 2025 Meanwhile, the sentiment around XRP continues to grow. Over the past month, the token has gained nearly 60%, driven not only by excitement over the legal battle but also by broader institutional interest. Adding to the bullish sentiment, there are strong rumours that asset management giant BlackRock could be preparing an XRP ETF. The timing aligns with broader developments in the U.S., including new crypto legislation aimed at increasing regulatory clarity and promoting innovation. If these legal and policy shifts materialize, they could push XRP’s utility in global payments. While the future remains uncertain, XRP appears to be entering a new phase—backed by legal clarity, institutional attention, and strong price momentum. For now, investors are watching closely as Thursday’s SEC meeting approaches, hopeful that it could mark a major turning point for Ripple and XRP.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 07:48:08

Not because of its impressive 19.7% gain over the last two weeks, but due to one shocking revelation. According to new data from a well-known blockchain analytics platform, a single wallet now holds over 410 trillion SHIB tokens, representing 41% of the total supply. At current prices, that’s worth more than $5.4 billion. And no, the identity of the wallet holder remains unknown. One Wallet, 410 Trillion SHIB, and Billions in Value SHIB is currently priced at $0.00001368 and boasts a market cap of over $8 billion. While the memecoin has outperformed Dogecoin in recent days — gaining 5.3% in the last 24 hours compared to DOGE’s 3.9% — the community is increasingly uneasy. Why? Because no cryptocurrency project claiming to be decentralized wants a single entity holding this much of its supply. Who’s Behind the Whale Wallet? So far, the whale remains anonymous. But three theories are circulating: An early investor who bought in before SHIB’s historic 2021 rally. A centralized exchange holding SHIB on behalf of users. Ryoshi, the pseudonymous and long-gone founder of Shiba Inu. Ryoshi launched SHIB in August 2020 and disappeared in May 2022, deleting all his posts. He had famously claimed he held no SHIB tokens himself, in a bid to keep the project truly decentralized. Still, if the wallet belongs to Ryoshi or an entity with deep insider access, it raises questions about whether decentralization was ever real. Why This Is a Big Deal for SHIB Holders A wallet holding 41% of any token supply is a red flag. If this whale decides to move, sell, or leverage these tokens in any way, it could send shockwaves through the SHIB market. Such a move could: Crash SHIB’s price due to oversupply. Trigger panic selling among retail investors. Undermine trust in the project’s decentralization narrative. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is the 23rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinGecko. Still, SHIB’s Ecosystem Keeps Expanding Despite the concerns, SHIB’s fundamentals have been improving. The project continues to build out its ecosystem: Shibarium ( Layer-2 blockchain ) ShibaSwap (DEX) Metaverse initiatives These developments could eventually give SHIB utility beyond the memecoin label — something DOGE has struggled to achieve. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : PENGU Price Prediction After 210% Rally—What’s Next? , How’s SHIB Performing in 2025? It’s been a mixed year so far. Q1: –41.4% Q2: –7.86% Q3 so far: +19.6% That bounce in Q3 has brought some relief, but if the whale wallet causes market disruption, SHIB’s recovery could be short-lived. Final Thoughts The fact that a single wallet holds 41% of Shiba Inu’s supply is undeniably risky, regardless of who’s behind it. Until the holder is confirmed or the tokens are distributed, SHIB holders have reason to stay cautious, even as price momentum builds. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the week began on Monday, the announcement drew mixed reactions from the market, with Bitcoin trading activity increasing as investors expected possible regulatory updates. What Happened So Far in Crypto Week? U.S. President Hailed Crypto Week: On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump cheered, “Happy Crypto Week,” while urging the Republican House to vote in favor of what he calls “tremendous bills.” he reiterated that digital assets are the future of the US nation, and this could make the US the global leader. Trump stated, “This is our moment – Digital assets, GENIUS, clarity! It is all part of Making America Great Again, bigger and better than ever before. We are leading the world, and will work hard with the Senate and the House to get even more legislation on this passed!” The Bills Stalled: Republicans Joined Democrats After several hours, a bunch of Republicans joined the Democrats to prevent the legislation from coming to a vote or debate. Previously, Congress leaders, Maxine Waters and Stephen Lynch, announced “ anti-crypto corruption week ” to stop the US president’s nefarious intentions with digital assets in the name of legislation. At the time, they did not receive any support. However, now with the support of 13 Republicans, the bills were blocked from advancing further. The group of Republicans and Democrats opposed to join the procedural vote to bring the three crypto bills to the floor. Impact on Bitcoin Trade Crypto investors have been anticipating Bitcoin to hit new records as US lawmakers prepare to reinforce regulations in digital assets. Bitcoin trade indeed reached new records with trading above $120,000 on the first day of crypto week. Investors’ Confidence Boosted in Stablecoins The GENIUS Act is one of the major bills under consideration in crypto week. The bill aims to establish an enhanced framework for US dollar-pegged stablecoin and create a pathway for companies to issue digital dollars. Xu Han, the director of Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, said this bill has boosted investors’ confidence in stablecoins while providing clarity.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 07:55:48

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-shows-xrp-is-approaching-price-discovery-moment-heres-what-it-means/,"Over the past few days, XRP has staged a steep rally, gaining strength as it approaches the $3 mark, the closest critical significant resistance zone on its chart. The price action over the weekend has reinforced bullish conviction, as XRP repeated retested $3 resistance level before resting above $2.90 at the time of press. Wave 3 Behavior Aligns with Technical Expectations The chart, posted by well-followed crypto analyst CasiTrades (@CasiTrades), presents a zoomed-in view of the price structure and Fibonacci levels governing the rally. The recent breakout is being interpreted within the context of Elliott Wave Theory , with CasiTrades considering the current phase part of a powerful Wave 3 trend. According to her analysis, this kind of price behavior showing clean support flips and vertical acceleration is “exactly what we’d expect to see in a wave 3 trend.” Critical Resistance Near $3.04 The $3 price level is not just psychological; it aligns with the macro 0.118 Fibonacci retracement level from XRP’s all-time high. Reclaiming this zone holds broader implications, suggesting the market is shifting decisively toward bullish continuation. An expert recently highlighted this level as the neckline for a building cup-and-handle pattern , and CasiTrades emphasizes that breaking above $3.04, followed by a swift and successful back-test, would be the next crucial step. If that occurs, the chart points toward a rapid move above the all-time high. Divergence Signals Mixed Momentum Technical indicators on the chart further support the rally’s strength. A visible bearish divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is emerging. While price continues to make higher highs, RSI has begun forming lower highs. This divergence can sometimes signal weakening momentum, although in strong wave 3 environments, it may fail to result in a pullback immediately. XRP Price Discovery Moment A key observation on the chart is the lack of meaningful resistance beyond $3.40. Once XRP clears that level, it enters price discovery , where historical reference points no longer exist and price can accelerate dramatically. “It will likely shock people how quickly this runs,” CasiTrades noted, highlighting XRP’s notable speed during price surges. This view is supported by the clean chart structure and scarcity of overhead supply above the all-time high. XRP Breaks $3 – Next Stop: New All-Time Highs? Over the weekend we saw a perfect back-test of the $2.69 macro fib and now #XRP is testing the macro $3.00. It's amazing to be zoomed-in and seeing this playing out with precision! Behavior is exactly what we'd expect to see… pic.twitter.com/OLY29Y2vo2 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) July 14, 2025 Additionally, there’s a time-based element to consider. She highlighted a macro time Fibonacci has been placed near the end of July, which could represent a potential local market top. Wave 3 rallies, however, are known for extending beyond traditional targets, and confirmation of a top would likely involve a sharp push just under a key extension, followed by a clear five-wave exhaustion pattern.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Did The Major Share Of Profit-Taking In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Realized Profit indicator for the short-term holders and long-term holders. The “Realized Profit” measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of profit that the BTC investors are realizing through their transactions. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold to see what price it was moved at prior to this. The difference between that previous price and the current selling price denote the amount of profit or loss involved in the sale. Related Reading: Strategy Grabs Another $472M In Bitcoin—Even With Price At ATH Naturally, the sale realizes a gain if the difference is positive. The Realized Profit adds up this value involved in all transactions of the type occurring on the blockchain. Another indicator known as the Realized Loss keeps track of the sales of the opposite type. In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Profit of two specific segments of the sector is of interest: short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs). Investors are divided into these groups based on the basis of holding time. More particularly, holders who have been carrying their coins for 155 days or less are put in the STHs and those who have made it past this threshold are considered LTHs. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Realized Profit for the two sides of the Bitcoin market. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Profit has seen spikes for both of these groups during the last 24 hours, implying investors across the market have harvested gains taking advantage of the rally to the new all-time high (ATH) above $123,000. In total, the holders took profits equal to $3.5 billion inside this window, making the profit-taking event one of the largest for the year. Interestingly, the LTHs occupied for a higher share ($1.96 billion or 56%) of the profit realization than the STHs ($1.54 billion or 44%). Generally, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are considered to represent the resolute side of the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Under $117,000: Is Social Media FOMO To Blame?

Under the partnership framework, SVH will manage digital asset operations for Intellistake and serve as the company’s supporting partner for security, custody, and treasury management. SVH operates with Swiss VASP/CASP licensing for trading and custody operations and Cook Island VASP registration. The AI-Web3 venture accelerator manages over $90 million in digital assets and specializes in blockchain innovations. Additionally, the firm has an established track record in incubation and token launches, including utility tokens and real-world asset tokenization projects, with a combined fully diluted valuation of over $250 million for incubating clients and more than 20 clients in its incubation program. Growing global AI crypto market SVH operates institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure powered by Fireblocks, the custody platform that has processed over $10 trillion in transactions for more than 1,800 institutional clients across over 100 supported blockchains. “This exclusive partnership with Singularity Venture Hub represents a significant step forward for Intellistake,” noted Jason Dussault, CEO of Intellistake Technologies Corp. “Having a proven digital asset management and custody partner strengthens our operational capabilities and provides the foundation we need to advance our growth strategy.” The partnership comes as the global AI crypto market is expected to grow from $3.7 billion in 2024 to $46.9 billion by 2034, representing a CAGR of 28.9%. The tokenized real-world assets market has grown from $5 billion in 2022 to over $24 billion by June 2025, with analysts projecting it could reach $16 to 30 trillion by 2034. “The timing is right for this partnership as institutional adoption of digital assets continues to accelerate,” added Gregory Cowles, Chief Strategy Officer of Intellistake. “Having a regulated, experienced partner like SVH strengthens our operations and provides the institutional-grade infrastructure our growth strategy requires.” “As the convergence between crypto markets and traditional capital markets enters a new phase of acceleration, we’re excited to partner with pioneering institutions like Intellistake—leaders who approach this space with an institutional-grade, compliant, and infrastructure-focused mindset,” said Mario Casiraghi, Founder and CEO of Singularity Venture Hub, adding: “What sets Intellistake apart is their forward-looking strategy: not only engaging with the surface-level opportunity but going deeper by integrating native Web3 capabilities through partnerships like Venture Hub and focusing on high-growth, high-impact sectors of the market.” The partnership is effective immediately. Intellistake recently completed a business transaction and is in the early stages of development, having not yet acquired digital assets or initiated validator and staking operations.

Anna Paulina Luna",https://coinpedia.org/news/jerome-powells-firing-is-imminent-claims-florida-rep-anna-paulina-luna/,"The post “Jerome Powell’s Firing Is Imminent,” Claims Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the start of Trump’s tenure, he has been vocal on interest rates , and on many occasions, he has put direct blame on Jeremy Powell for acting too late on curbing inflation and reducing interest rates. In this context, a recent post on social media stirred up a wave of speculation that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be fired soon, but experts and markets say, not so fast. REP LUNA: 99% SURE JEROME POWELL IS GETTING FIRED Rep. Anna Paulina Luna says she’s “99% sure” Jerome Powell is about to be fired, doubling down after initially claiming she heard the news from “a very serious source.” Source: @realannapaulina https://t.co/s0a3UsDs4D pic.twitter.com/SucAAt8brQ — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) July 16, 2025 The Spark: A Bold Claim from Congresswoman Luna On July 16, Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, in her X post, said that Powell’s firing is “imminent.” Although she gave no evidence to support her claim, her post was enough to move the needle on Polymarket, a crypto-based betting platform. Odds that Powell would be ousted jumped from 23% to 27%, though they quickly slipped back to 25% as the excitement wore off. Luna isn’t part of the House Financial Services Committee, the group that oversees the Fed, so her statement doesn’t carry much weight in official circles. She’s more known for her role on the Oversight and Natural Resources Committees. I heard from a very credible, bipartisan source, today, that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. This maps with both reports and also the talk in DC. — Pulte (@pulte) July 16, 2025 Notably, Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and known Powell critic, also claimed he’d heard from a “very credible, bipartisan source” that Powell might resign soon, adding weight to Luna’s assertion. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Sandman warned that markets aren’t ready for such a shock. He noted that over 80% of market participants still expect Powell to complete his term, suggesting that investors are largely ignoring the scenario. So, Can Powell Be Fired? Removing the Fed Chair isn’t that simple. The Federal Reserve Act says a Fed governor can only be removed for serious issues like misconduct or failure to do their job, not just because someone disagrees with their policies. A Supreme Court ruling from 1935 (Humphreys’ Executor v. United States) reinforced the Fed’s independence by limiting presidential power to remove agency heads. Under current law, Fed governors can only be dismissed for inefficiency or neglect of duty, not policy disagreements. This legal power has stood the test of time and protects Powell, even under political pressure. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Week Recap: Bitcoin Surges as U.S. Debates Digital Asset Bills , However, President Donald Trump reportedly wanted Powell out during his first term, too, but even he didn’t follow through, likely because of these legal barriers. Meanwhile, interestingly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that a formal process to find Powell’s successor has already begun, hinting that a transition may come, just not as suddenly as some suggest. No Impact on Crypto or Stocks While some Polymarket bettors got briefly excited, the broader financial markets didn’t react much. Bitcoin didn’t budge, and the stock market showed no signs of concern. Traders appear confident that Powell’s leadership will remain intact, dismissing Luna’s post as speculative noise rather than a signal of real change. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Speculation stems from direct criticism by political figures like Donald Trump regarding Powell’s handling of interest rates and inflation. Congresswoman Luna’s recent social media post directly fueled these rumors. Can the U.S. President easily fire the Federal Reserve Chair? No, firing the Fed Chair is difficult. The Federal Reserve Act and a 1935 Supreme Court ruling state that a Fed governor can only be removed for serious misconduct or neglect of duty, not simply policy disagreements. What is the official stance on a potential transition for the Fed Chair position? While rumors of a sudden firing are dismissed, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that a formal process to find Jerome Powell’s successor has already begun, hinting at a transition, but not an abrupt ousting.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 08:07:57

Since May 2024, Pumpfun had been dumping fee revenue aggressively on Kraken. Data shows ~4.1M $SOL ($741M) offloaded at $180 avg, week after week. Market watchers got used to the pressure. The chart reflected it. Now, that selling machine is reversing course—and buying. This isn’t a symbolic move. This is full-on buyback mode, with nearly $11.3M still sitting in the wallet, unspent. If that gets deployed too, price action could get even crazier. $PUMP Presale Was Just the Beginning Few days ago , $PUMP pulled off one of the biggest presales in crypto history—$500M+ raised in 12 minutes at $0.004. The hype was real. The crowd was massive. But like most meme launches, it dipped post-listing. Some thought that was the top. Then came today’s buyback. Now $PUMP is trending again, showing strength above $0.006, with heavy volume pushing through on-chain and across CEXes. That puts $PUMP up 60% from its presale price, with momentum clearly shifting bullish. Add protocol-led buybacks into the mix, and you’ve got a very different chart from two weeks ago. This isn’t just about price. This is narrative control. Pumpfun knows what it’s doing. For weeks, fee revenue kept flowing—but it was all going to Kraken. The protocol was seen as a seller. Now, that same revenue is being redirected to buy back tokens—hard. It sends a message: the team backs its token. The market loves that. And when it comes with $19.2M of real firepower, it’s more than just sentiment—it’s math. There’s still 69,420 $SOL left in the wallet. That’s $11.3M+ sitting idle. If this gets deployed in waves, it can support price, reduce float, and extend this trend.

Just as AI reshapes trading algorithms and smart contracts, it’s now fundamentally altering how we consume information. The latest development from the tech giant, Google, has sent ripples of concern across the publishing industry: the rollout of Google AI summaries in its popular Discover feed. This move, while seemingly innovative, poses a formidable challenge to news publishers already grappling with a severe publisher traffic decline , raising critical questions about the future of digital content distribution and monetization. Understanding the Shift in Google Discover News For years, Google Discover has served as a vital conduit for news organizations, delivering personalized content directly to users’ smartphones. It’s been a steady source of clicks, even as organic search traffic dwindled. However, the introduction of AI-generated summaries is poised to disrupt this delicate balance. Imagine opening your Google app on iOS or Android, expecting to see a compelling headline from your favorite news source. Instead, you’re greeted by a concise, AI-crafted summary, pulling information from multiple publishers, whose logos appear subtly in the corner. This new format aims to provide quick answers, but it fundamentally alters the user’s interaction with the news. Google’s implementation of these summaries isn’t a full-scale launch yet; it appears to be a test. Users will notice multiple news publishers’ logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources. A crucial disclaimer accompanies these summaries: they are “generated with AI, which can make mistakes.” This acknowledgment highlights the nascent stage of the technology and the potential for inaccuracies, a significant concern for publishers and readers alike. Bitcoin World observed these summaries firsthand across both iOS and Android apps in the U.S., confirming the ongoing rollout. Beyond the direct AI summaries, Google is experimenting with other ways to present Google Discover news . Some stories might feature bullet points summarizing content below the headline, while others are grouped with similar news, providing a broader context. For example, a story about a political development might include links to related articles, offering a more comprehensive view without requiring users to navigate away from the app. While these additions aren’t explicitly flagged as AI-powered, they contribute to a trend of condensing information within the Google ecosystem, further reducing the need for direct website visits. The Alarming Publisher Traffic Decline: Is AI the Culprit? The publishing industry has been vocal about its concerns regarding declining website traffic, and the advent of advanced AI features only amplifies these anxieties. The data paints a stark picture: global search traffic reportedly fell by 15% year-over-year as of June, according to market intelligence firm Similarweb. Even more concerning is the rise in “no-click” searches — instances where users find their answers directly on the search results page without visiting any website. This phenomenon surged from 56% in May 2024, when Google’s AI Overviews launched, to nearly 69% by May 2025. This shift isn’t exclusive to Google. Other AI applications, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, similarly provide summarized information or chatbot-style interfaces, effectively becoming intermediaries between users and original content sources. For publishers, this means a significant reduction in organic traffic, which dropped from over 2.3 billion visits at its peak in mid-2024 to fewer than 1.7 billion. The core issue is clear: if users can get the gist of a story or an answer to a query directly from Google’s interface, the incentive to click through to the original publisher’s website diminishes drastically, leading directly to a severe publisher traffic decline . How is AI in News Being Embraced (and Feared) by Publishers? Despite the widespread concerns, many publishers are not sitting idly by. Major players like The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo, Bloomberg, and USA Today are actively experimenting with AI in news production and content delivery on their own platforms. These trials range from using AI for content generation and summarization to enhancing personalization and user engagement. Startups are also innovating in this space; for instance, Particle, a news reader, leverages AI not just for summarizing stories but also for allowing users to explore different perspectives or ask follow-up questions for deeper understanding. While these internal AI initiatives aim to keep publishers competitive and relevant, they exist against a backdrop of increasing apprehension. The very tools being adopted internally by some are simultaneously being deployed by platforms like Google in ways that threaten their core business model. The promise of AI for efficiency and enhanced user experience is undeniable, but its implementation by dominant tech platforms creates an existential dilemma for content creators who rely on direct engagement for revenue. Navigating Digital Publishing Challenges in an AI-Dominated World The landscape of digital publishing challenges is becoming increasingly complex. Google’s response to these industry-wide concerns includes initiatives like Offerwall, launched to provide publishers with alternative revenue streams beyond traditional, traffic-dependent advertising. Offerwall, integrated with Google Ad Manager, allows publishers to implement various access methods for their content, such as micropayments, surveys, or even requiring users to watch ads. This offers a glimmer of hope for diversification, but for many, it feels like too little, too late, as traffic losses continue to mount. The fundamental problem remains: the value chain is shifting. Content creators invest heavily in reporting, editing, and producing high-quality journalism, only for that content to be summarized and consumed on platforms that don’t directly contribute to their ad revenue or subscription base. This disintermediation is a profound challenge, forcing publishers to rethink their entire strategy, from content creation to audience engagement and monetization. The question is no longer just about adapting to digital, but adapting to an AI-first digital environment where direct traffic is no longer guaranteed. The Future of News Consumption and Monetization The trend of AI-powered summaries and “no-click” experiences suggests a future where information is increasingly consumed in fragmented, aggregated forms. While Google Discover previously remained a relatively stable source of clicks even as general Google Search traffic declined, the widespread rollout of AI summaries within the Google app could soon change that. This poses a significant threat to one of the last remaining reliable traffic channels for news publishers. For publishers, the path forward involves a multi-pronged approach: continuing to innovate with AI on their own platforms to enhance user experience and content creation, exploring diverse monetization models beyond traditional advertising, and advocating for fair compensation and attribution from major platforms that leverage their content. The battle for direct user engagement is intensifying, and the outcome will determine the sustainability of quality journalism in the age of artificial intelligence. The introduction of Google AI summaries in Discover marks a pivotal moment for the publishing industry. While Google aims to provide users with quicker access to information, this innovation comes at a potentially devastating cost for news publishers who rely on traffic for their very survival. The ongoing publisher traffic decline , exacerbated by features like AI Overviews, highlights the urgent need for new strategies and a re-evaluation of the relationship between tech giants and content creators. As AI in news continues to evolve, addressing these digital publishing challenges will be crucial for the future of informed societies.

This isn’t just big news for the artificial intelligence sector; it’s a monumental event that underscores the escalating investor confidence in transformative AI ventures, a trend that often parallels the innovative spirit seen in the cryptocurrency space. For those tracking the convergence of cutting-edge technology and substantial capital, this development signals a new era of possibilities, where bold ideas attract immense backing even before a product hits the market. The Meteoric Rise of Mira Murati’s AI Startup Thinking Machines Lab, the brainchild of OpenAI’s former chief technology officer, Mira Murati, has just etched its name into Silicon Valley history. On Monday, the company announced the closure of an astounding $2 billion seed round, spearheaded by none other than Andreessen Horowitz. This colossal investment, which also saw participation from industry giants like NVIDIA, Accel, ServiceNow, CISCO, AMD, and Jane Street, has propelled the startup’s valuation to an incredible $12 billion. This figure is particularly striking, considering that just last month, reports suggested a $10 billion valuation was on the table. The rapid increase highlights the intense competition and soaring investor appetite for promising AI endeavors. This seed round stands as one of the largest in Silicon Valley’s history, a testament to the immense faith placed in Murati’s vision and the potential of her new venture. For context, seed rounds are typically the very first funding stages for a startup, often much smaller in scale. The sheer volume of capital raised by Thinking Machines Lab, which is less than a year old and has yet to unveil its flagship product, speaks volumes about the perceived disruptive potential of the company. Thinking Machines Lab: What’s Next for This AI Powerhouse? Despite the significant funding, the exact nature of Thinking Machines Lab’s work has largely remained under wraps. However, Mira Murati herself offered a tantalizing glimpse into the company’s first product in a recent post on X. She indicated that the startup plans to unveil its work in the “next couple months,” with a promise of a “significant open source offering.” This commitment to open source is noteworthy, as it could potentially democratize access to advanced AI tools and foster greater collaboration within the research community. Murati further elaborated that the product will be particularly useful for researchers and startups engaged in building custom AI models. “Soon, we’ll also share our best science to help the research community better understand frontier AI systems,” she stated. The company’s overarching mission, as articulated by Murati, is to “empower humanity through advancing collaborative general intelligence.” This involves building multimodal AI that interacts naturally with users through conversation, sight, and the complex ways humans collaborate. While it’s not explicitly clear if this means an open AI model similar to those released by some of OpenAI’s competitors to challenge ChatGPT’s dominance, the emphasis on open source and research utility suggests a foundational approach. The allure of Thinking Machines Lab extends beyond its founder’s pedigree. The company has successfully attracted a cohort of Murati’s former colleagues from OpenAI, including prominent figures like John Schulman, Barret Zoph, and Luke Metz. This influx of top-tier talent, combined with an active recruitment drive for individuals with a proven track record in “building successful AI-driven products from the ground up,” as per their website, positions the company for rapid development. The Impact of Massive AI Funding on the Industry The influx of billions into Thinking Machines Lab underscores a broader trend: the massive AI funding spree gripping the tech industry. Investors are pouring unprecedented amounts of capital into AI labs, signaling a belief that the next generation of technological breakthroughs will emerge from this sector. This significant investment provides Thinking Machines Lab with a substantial “war chest,” enabling them to invest heavily in computing resources, top talent, and extensive research necessary to train frontier AI models. Such models require vast computational power and data, making substantial funding a critical enabler. This development also intensifies the competitive landscape. Thinking Machines Lab is now seen as a legitimate contender against established AI leaders such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind. While these incumbents have a significant head start and their own massive research budgets, the sheer scale of Murati’s funding suggests a serious challenge. The previously struck deal with Google Cloud to power its AI models further indicates a strategic approach to leveraging existing infrastructure for rapid advancement.

However, on the downside, BTC would plunge toward $115,000 or $112,000, which could “still be healthy in the broader trend,” he added. “At a macro level, concerns about rising debt, persistent inflation, and uncertainty in monetary policy are all reinforcing the idea of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

A broader shift in institutional sentiment could be a major catalyst to drive BTC prices up, Balans told Cryptonews. Though institutional exposure has increased through ETFs and custody services, senior banking executives have reiterated their cautious stance, describing crypto as an area of interest but not yet a strategic priority. “Without a broad shift in institutional sentiment, it is unlikely that inflows alone will propel Bitcoin to $150,000 swiftly.” The post Bitcoin ‘Peak Signal’ Not in Yet, Rally May Continue: CryptoQuant Analyst appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin ATH|Bitcoin market,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-16 09:20:36

Another promising contender is Toncoin (TON), the native asset of the Telegram-backed TON blockchain. It’s gaining momentum thanks to deep integration with social platforms, giving it mainstream exposure. But despite its user base, TON still lacks the income-driven architecture that makes MUTM more appealing for long-term holders. Finally, Injective (INJ) is gaining respect for its scalable Layer-1 infrastructure and on-chain finance tools. It’s strong on tech, but its value flow is still speculative. Compared to MUTM’s lending fees, buybacks, and treasury-backed stablecoin development, Injective looks more like a bet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, looks like a blueprint. Where yield meets utility What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from typical Bitcoin (BTC) alternatives is its focus on real-time, utility-driven revenue mechanics. The platform will enable users to lend major crypto assets into smart contract-powered liquidity pools using a system called P2C—Peer-to-Contract. Once launched, users who deposit assets will receive mtTokens that not only represent their original holdings but will also grow in value as interest accrues over time. These ERC-20 mtTokens will be stakeable within the designated contracts, adding a second layer of rewards, turning passive deposits into long-term, compounding income streams. Here’s what that could look like once the platform is live: a user supplies 4.5 ETH (around $11,250) into a high-utilization pool projected to earn 7.2% APY. That position alone would yield over $810 annually, with returns reflected directly in the increasing value of mtETH. Unlike legacy lending platforms that require manual re-depositing or lockups, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed with smart contract automation, allowing users to earn without additional steps. And because mtTokens will be fully tradable and stakeable, users will be able to maximize earnings across different layers of the protocol. This vision isn’t just for whales. Thanks to Layer-2 infrastructure and a non-custodial architecture, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to make high-yield crypto lending accessible to all users, even those new to DeFi. The platform is being designed to remove complexity while enhancing transparency and control, allowing everyday users to put their assets to work in ways previously limited to institutional players. But not all risk appetites are the same, and that’s exactly where the upcoming Peer-to-Peer (P2P) engine will push Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s offering even further. High-risk yield with full control Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2P lending system is being developed for users who want to take calculated risks in exchange for higher returns. In this model, lenders and borrowers will be able to negotiate their own terms, from APY and loan duration to the collateral type. Rather than pooling funds, each loan agreement will be individually executed via smart contracts. This design prevents contagion and gives lenders the freedom to cherry-pick the deals that best fit their risk tolerance. A practical scenario: a user might lend 1,000 USDC to a borrower who posts worth of DOGE as collateral, agreeing to a 15% APY. The smart contract will lock in the terms and manage repayments, interest accrual, and automated liquidation if thresholds are breached. The lender would earn $150 in trustless profit if the loan is repaid on time. And because all loans will be overcollateralized, the protocol’s Stability Factor is designed to trigger third-party liquidators to seize collateral before lender capital is affected. This high-yield, low-contagion model is already attracting attention from crypto-native investors eager for better returns on stablecoins and volatile tokens like SHIB, PEPE, or FLOKI. Presale momentum is heating up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently deep into Phase 5 of its token presale, priced at $0.03 with more than 75% already sold. The project has now raised over $12.35 million from a growing community of over 13,300 holders, and the next pricing tier at $0.035 will mark a 20% increase. With a fixed supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, scarcity is built into the protocol’s long-term design, and early movers are positioning accordingly. Security-wise, the project is backed by a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain audit firms. With a Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet Score of 77, the platform is taking every step to ensure transparency and technical robustness before going live. With a listing price of $0.06 already confirmed, buyers from Phase 2 (who entered at $0.015) have already doubled their investment. Analysts tracking the protocol are forecasting 5x to 10x gains from current levels, especially once the beta platform goes live and mtTokens become fully usable. For investors waiting on the sidelines, Phase 5 is shaping up to be the final window before demand floods in ahead of the exchange launch. In a market where few tokens offer both upside and utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that it belongs on the shortlist of Bitcoin (BTC) alternatives to watch—and possibly act on—this July.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the fifth stage of presale which costs $0.03. Stage 5 is already over 70% sold out since investors rush to secure the ground price. Launch project price is at $0.06, promising at least 100% profit for those who buy today. Analysts and insiders are already whispering, this could be the token to buy before July ends. With a unique lending protocol that bridges real-world assets and on-chain utility, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum and gunning for DOGE’s market cap spot. Mutuum Finance Presale Boasts Steady Upward Momentum In the current Phase 5 presale, Mutuum Finance is selling tokens for $0.03 per token. The phase has an 100% ROI because the price of the token will launch at $0.06. Investors’ interest keeps on growing, with over 13,400 investors placing over $12.4 million in their bets on the presale so far. Early predictions indicate MUTM can bounce to a $5 price in 2025. Its good fundamentals and practical applicability coupled with this positive prediction are attracting retail and institutional attention to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Focused on Platform Security and Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making its second wager on long-term stability with the launch of a value-backed stablecoin that will be pegged to the US dollar (USD) on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a stable, secure financial asset avoiding the volatility and risk potentially associated with algorithmic stablecoins. To further boost its legitimacy, the project has also undergone a complete audit by CertiK. It is one of the most important milestones that show the zeal of the Mutuum Finance to become an institution-grade and open DeFi platform. It shows that the team is keen on matching the industry in security as well as performance. Mutuum Finance Certik and $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has also collaborated with CertiK to implement a structured Bug Bounty Program. With a reward pool amounting to $50,000 USDT, the program does accept the identification and reporting of vulnerabilities within the smart contracts of the platform. The rewards are further offered in four severity levels i.e. critical, major, minor and low. The move demonstrates the commitment of the Mutuum Finance to building community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. $100,0000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway in an attempt to claim the community as well. Those that will participate will be sampled to come up with the list of ten individuals that will receive $10,000 in MUTM as winners. This grand move does not just specify those, who will be rewarded early, yet it also signals that the project is ready to develop an effective and stable user base. Mutuum Finance is performing well, having already drawn over 13,400 investors and $12.4 million in presale contributions as it closes in on the final stages of Phase 5. Priced at $0.03 now and set to launch at $0.06, early backers are already positioned for 100% returns, while long-range forecasts see the token soaring toward $5 by 2025. Its real-world lending utility, USD-backed stablecoin, CertiK audit, and $50K bug bounty program all point to a secure, scalable, and serious contender in the DeFi space. A $100,000 giveaway is further amplifying attention as more eyes turn toward this potential DOGE-flipper. Explore the presale, join the community, and get in before the market fully catches on.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is often considered a crucial barometer, offering a snapshot of investor psychology. Recently, this key indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 70 as of July 16. This figure, while a three-point dip from the previous day, keeps the market firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto holdings and potential future moves? Let’s dive deeper into understanding this fascinating tool and how it can inform your trading strategies . What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful analytical tool designed to measure the prevailing market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. Ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), it aims to provide insights into whether investors are overly fearful or excessively greedy. Why is this important? Because extreme fear can present buying opportunities for those brave enough, while extreme greed often signals that a market correction might be around the corner. Understanding this index helps you gauge the collective emotional state of the market, which is often a precursor to significant price movements. When the market is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it suggests that prices are low and investors are selling off, potentially creating a dip for strategic entry. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ indicates high prices and euphoria, which can lead to overvaluation and subsequent corrections. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key factors, each contributing to the overall score. This multi-faceted approach provides a more holistic view of market dynamics. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum. High buying volumes in a strong market often suggest greedy behavior. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes Twitter hashtags and sentiment around Bitcoin, looking for an unusual number of posts and specific keywords to gauge public mood. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these surveys previously gathered insights from investors about their market perceptions. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This factor looks at Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be fleeing altcoins for the relative safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin bubble,’ the index can infer the level of fear or optimism among retail investors. This comprehensive methodology allows the index to capture various aspects of investor behavior, from trading activity to public discourse, offering a nuanced perspective on market sentiment . Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 70 Mean for Crypto Volatility? A reading of 70, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that investors are generally optimistic and eager to buy. While this sounds positive, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it indicates strong buying pressure and potential for further price appreciation. On the other hand, it also signals caution. When greed becomes excessive, markets can become overheated, leading to speculative bubbles. The recent three-point drop from 73 to 70, even within the ‘Greed’ zone, could be interpreted as a slight cooling of exuberance or a minor shift in sentiment. It’s not a dramatic plunge into fear, but rather a subtle indication that some of the intense buying pressure might be easing. This is particularly relevant when considering crypto volatility , as high greed levels can precede sharp corrections. Is High Bitcoin Dominance a Sign of Fear or Strength? The role of Bitcoin dominance within the index is often debated. When Bitcoin’s market share increases, it can mean a couple of things. Historically, during periods of uncertainty or fear, investors tend to consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, perceiving it as a safer, more established asset compared to smaller altcoins. This ‘flight to quality’ drives up Bitcoin’s dominance. However, Bitcoin dominance can also rise during strong bull markets if Bitcoin leads the rally. The index specifically looks at the trend of dominance relative to overall market conditions. A sharp rise in dominance without a corresponding overall market rally might indeed signal a cautious sentiment, where investors are de-risking from altcoins. Actionable Insights: Using the Index in Your Trading Strategies The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it should never be your sole guide. Here’s how you can integrate it into your trading strategies : Counter-Cyclical Investing: A common adage in investing is to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24), it might be a good time to consider accumulating assets, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the move. When it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (75-100), it might be prudent to take some profits or reduce exposure. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your existing analysis. If your technical indicators suggest a market top and the index is showing ‘Extreme Greed,’ it strengthens your sell signal. Similarly, if your analysis points to a buying opportunity and the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it adds conviction. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ reading should prompt you to re-evaluate your risk exposure. Are you over-leveraged? Is your portfolio too heavily weighted in highly speculative assets? This is a time to tighten stop-losses and perhaps rebalance. Understand Nuance: A score of 70 is ‘Greed,’ but it’s not ‘Extreme Greed.’ This suggests a strong market, but perhaps not yet at the point of irrational exuberance. It’s a reminder to stay alert but not necessarily panic. Challenges and Limitations While powerful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index often reflects sentiment that has already developed. Prices might have moved significantly before the index fully captures the shift. Bitcoin-Centric: While it aims to capture overall crypto sentiment, its components are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Not a Crystal Ball: It cannot predict the future with certainty. Unexpected news or black swan events can override any sentiment reading. Psychological Bias: Even knowing the index is in ‘Greed’ doesn’t mean you can easily overcome your own fear of missing out (FOMO) or fear of losing (FOL). What’s Next for Crypto Market Sentiment? The current reading of 70 in the ‘Greed’ zone, despite a slight dip, indicates a robust and optimistic market. Investors are still largely confident, which is a positive sign for continued interest and potential growth. However, vigilance is key. As the index approaches the higher end of the ‘Greed’ spectrum, the potential for increased crypto volatility and subsequent pullbacks rises. Monitoring the index alongside other fundamental and technical analysis will be crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of the crypto market. Pay close attention to upcoming macroeconomic data, regulatory news, and significant on-chain metrics. These external factors can quickly shift sentiment, pushing the index either higher into ‘Extreme Greed’ or lower towards ‘Fear.’ The beauty of the crypto market lies in its dynamic nature, and staying informed is your best defense. Conclusion: Mastering the Market’s Mood The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides invaluable insights into the collective psyche of cryptocurrency investors. Its recent reading of 70, holding strong in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals ongoing optimism but also warrants a cautious approach. By understanding its components, particularly the role of Bitcoin dominance and the implications of crypto volatility , you can refine your trading strategies and make more informed decisions. Remember, while sentiment is a powerful force, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Combine it with thorough research and sound risk management to truly master the market’s mood.

But what makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out in July is its focus on real value creation. This is not a speculative meme play. This is a functional, non-custodial protocol designed to generate stable revenue for users via dual lending paths, passive staking rewards, and a treasury-backed stablecoin—all tied together with security-grade audits and smart contract transparency. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the utility token narrative Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance is building something that many DeFi protocols have struggled to deliver: optionality for both risk-averse users and high-yield seekers. The platform is set to operate using two distinct models—Pool-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, users will be able to deposit stablecoins and blue-chip assets like ETH, USDC, or AVAX into permissionless smart contract pools and receive mtTokens in return. These ERC-20 mtTokens will represent both the principal and the interest, growing in value over time as borrowers interact with the pool. But the earnings won’t stop there. Once launched, users will be able to stake their mtTokens into designated smart contracts to earn MUTM token dividends, funded by actual protocol revenue from lending activity. It’s a layered, long-term model designed for DeFi users who are done chasing speculative farms or getting burned by rug-prone clones. Instead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to provide sustainable, revenue-backed income to those who contribute to the system. In the future P2P model, things get even more flexible. Borrowers holding high-volatility assets like SHIB or PEPE will be able to negotiate terms directly with lenders, setting interest rates, durations, and LTV ratios based on individual risk appetite. This system will remain fully isolated from P2C liquidity pools, allowing lenders to take on higher-risk positions without affecting the health or solvency of the wider protocol. The platform’s stablecoin infrastructure is also a unique pillar of its planned utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance will introduce a decentralized stablecoin that remains pegged to $1 and is only minted when users borrow against overcollateralized assets like ETH. The stablecoin is burned automatically when loans are repaid or liquidated, ensuring supply remains tightly controlled. Minting will be limited by issuance caps set for each approved issuer, and the peg will be maintained through algorithmically adjusted interest rates and arbitrage-based mechanisms. This system is designed to deliver a stable, trustless, and scalable DeFi-native asset backed by real crypto collateral. Add in a CertiK Token Scan score of 95.00, a Skynet Score of 77.5, and a growing Twitter following of over 12,000, and it’s clear why investors are considering this one of the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the summer. MUTM’s price trajectory: what comes next The presale structure has been methodical and investor-friendly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched its early phases starting at $0.01, and is now in Phase 5 at $0.03—delivering a 200% gain for the earliest adopters. And the story doesn’t end there. The next presale phase will lift the token price to $0.035, a full 20% jump, making now the final chance to enter before the pace accelerates. The full supply of 4 billion tokens is fixed, and a substantial portion has already been claimed by long-term holders positioning for a post-launch DeFi revival. One such investor reallocated $4,000 originally split between Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1. That decision has already paid off with a wallet now valued at over $12,000, and analysts tracking roadmap progress are projecting a 3x gain or more after the platform’s listing price of $0.06 is realized in the months ahead. Backing these projections is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s consistent commitment to security and transparency. The team has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty in partnership with CertiK, showing strong alignment with long-term ecosystem safety. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway campaign —split among ten winners—is already helping build massive community traction and organic buzz ahead of the beta rollout. While ARB and INJ are now multi-billion-dollar ecosystems, early believers were the ones who locked in the best gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing all the signs of being next in line, combining staking rewards, stablecoin utility, P2P lending flexibility, and robust smart contract design. With only 25% of Phase 5 tokens remaining, the countdown to Phase 6 at $0.035 is already underway. You missed ARB at $0.12. Don’t miss MUTM at $0.03.

The token’s market cap rose from $137.40 billion to $173.28 billion, driven by an aggressive breakout that saw prices surge 26.03% from $2.32 to $2.93 over the same seven-day period. XRP 1-week market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP is approaching key psychological and technical milestones XRP is now rapidly approaching its January 18, 2025 peak of $3.29, when its market cap temporarily touched $189.1 billion a level that many analysts view as a psychologically and technically significant threshold. While the current price of $2.93 remains roughly 11% below that peak, the recent momentum, combined with accelerating capital inflows, suggests the digital asset could retest those highs in the near term. Decoupling volume and price movement Despite the sharp appreciation, 24-hour trading volume has declined 38.85% during the same week, falling to $7.13 billion. This divergence between volume and price indicates that the rally may be driven more by spot accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure than speculative trading. The Vol/Mkt Cap ratio now sits at a muted 4.12%, supporting the thesis that capital is parking in XRP, not rotating rapidly. Typically this reflects a shift from high-frequency speculative flows to conviction-based accumulation, especially from larger holders. Investors may be anticipating regulatory clarity, institutional onboarding, or strategic announcements from Ripple, such as cross-border partnerships or tokenization initiatives. Finally, XRP’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) currently stands at $293.04 billion, placing it among the top-tier digital assets by network value. With a circulating supply of 59.13 billion XRP and a capped total supply of 100 billion, XRP maintains high float liquidity while benefiting from increasing investor conviction.

XRP sits 14% below its all-time high as ETF speculation boosts volume and trading interest. Large XRP Transfer Sparks Interest A wallet moved 25.5 million XRP, worth around $73.6 million, to Coinbase. The transfer was spotted by Whale Alert and quickly caught attention across crypto circles. XRP was trading at $2.92 at the time of writing. 25,526,865 #XRP (73,649,849 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbase https://t.co/QgoGd6uiQK — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 15, 2025 Over the past day, XRP has increased by around 2%. The weekly gain now stands at more than 26%. Trading volume remains high, with over $6.2 billion in activity during the last 24 hours. The size and timing of this transfer may suggest positioning ahead of market events. Analysts Track Technical Pattern Crypto analyst JD pointed to a familiar setup in XRP’s price action. He said the current move resembles the 2017 pattern that led to a major breakout. JD noted , “I called the $0.28 bottom; I’m calling the top next.” Interestingly, the chart shows XRP breaking above a large triangle and consolidating. Stochastic RSI shows a bullish cross, with hidden divergence also in play. If the current structure holds, traders expect a strong move upward. ETF Launch Seen as Catalyst ProShares is set to launch its futures XRP ETF on July 18. This has led to more active trading near key price zones. Desks appear to be shifting between $2.85 and $2.93, with $3.00 acting as a key resistance. Some firms are holding off on full exposure due to regulatory uncertainty. ETF flows are expected to give a clearer picture of institutional demand in the coming days. XRP’s price is now within 14% of its all-time high, last reached in January 2018 and retested in 2025. Traders expect the next move to attempt to break that level. RLUSD, an enterprise-focused stablecoin, recently passed $500 million in market cap, adding to XRP’s growing ecosystem.

With a lot of speculation about the token’s upside circling around, the rally has brought a lot of attention to the Pi Cycle Top Indicator. Using the 111-day and a modified 350-day moving averages to predict when the token might approach the end of the bull run , the Pi Cycle Top Indicator has historically been known as one of the most accurate market timing tools in crypto . According to market analyst Rekt Capital, the averages now suggest that Bitcoin could peak between $130,000 and $170,000 as early as late 2025. Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator. Source: Rekt Capital Bitcoin upside up to $170,000 According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, the recent momentum is pushing the 111-day moving average up rapidly. Indeed, on June 1, the average was sitting around $92,000, but has since then jumped to approximately $98,000. Accordingly, the projected date of the moving average crossover is being adjusted as well, now being expected to occur in February 2027 as opposed to April 2027, projected just days ago. However, if Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory, that projection could slide further forward into 2026, or even late 2025, when Bitcoin could potentially hit $170,000.

Last week, technical analyst Rich Ross from Evercore stated that Bitcoin was “ coiled like a spring ,” with potential upside targets of up to $170,000 as well. Ross’s predictions were the result of bullish momentum Bitcoin was gaining due to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping new tariffs. On July 15, prominent analyst Trader Tardigrade likewise reported a bullish outlook in a post on X. Namely, the analyst pointed out that a slightly elevated Inverse Head and Shoulders ( IH&S ) weekly chart pattern suggests that Bitcoin could soon reach a target of approximately $160,000.

Dom Kwok, co-founder of web3 education platform EasyA, pointed to this shift in a post on X. He stated that some were misled into chasing speculative investments while XRP and XLM experienced notable gains. His comment has resonated with a growing segment of the crypto community that emphasizes long-term utility over hype . i do feel bad for the many who missed out on the past months 40-90% gains in $XRP and $XLM because they were misled into chasing a certain speculative hype coin that's bled consistently. i did warn. — Dom (Bull/ish) | EasyA (@dom_kwok) July 15, 2025 XRP Price Performance Highlights: Growing Interest XRP is trading at $2.86, up 24.17% from last week, and XLM stands at $0.4440, showing a striking 73.09% weekly gain. Both assets are often regarded as foundational to the future of international finance. XRP is frequently mentioned as a potential replacement for SWIFT , the dominant legacy system for cross-border payments, due to XRP’s speed, efficiency, low cost, and more. XLM, which shares a similar mission, has shown strong price correlation with XRP lately. These assets have outperformed many meme coins and similar speculative investments, showing the importance of utility and the market’s shift toward utility-driven assets. Confidence Among Long-Term Supporters Despite both assets still trading below their all-time highs set in January 2018, market participants remain confident in their potential to reclaim and surpass those levels. This conviction has not gone unnoticed in the broader community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One investor noted that although he initially missed out on early adoption, he has since brought many others into crypto by explaining their utility. This comment underscores a growing shift from speculative interest to utility-based investing. Another contributor reflected on his early confidence in both XRP and XLM, saying he believed in their future impact even when he “knew absolutely nothing about financial markets.” That belief appears to have paid off. As prices climb and mainstream visibility increases, those who invested early and held their positions are seeing significant returns. Another commenter summed up the sentiment, stating that individuals who “did their homework and took action” are now reaping the benefits. A Changing Narrative in the Crypto Market While speculative tokens dominated much of the 2021 bull market narrative, recent gains in XRP and XLM suggest that investors are reconsidering where long-term value lies . With both coins backed by established organizations and integrated into growing financial ecosystems, their role in the broader crypto market is solidifying. As attention shifts to real-world applications, the current momentum behind XRP and XLM could be more than a temporary price spike. It could signify long-term growth and dominance.

Recently, the Lisk DAO faced a pivotal moment that sent ripples through its community: a proposal to execute a significant LSK token burn failed to pass. Despite overwhelming support, garnering an impressive 99.46% approval, the initiative stumbled not due to dissent, but due to a critical absence of participation – it simply did not reach the required DAO quorum . This event highlights the complex interplay between community sentiment and the practicalities of on-chain governance . What Happened with the Lisk DAO Proposal? The proposal, designed to burn 100 million LSK tokens from the Lisk DAO’s treasury, was a highly anticipated move. Its purpose was to address the increased token supply following the recent token migration to ERC-20, which saw 145 million new LSK tokens minted. The community largely agreed that reducing the supply could be beneficial for the token’s long-term value and scarcity. According to Tally, a leading on-chain governance platform, the vote itself was overwhelmingly positive. However, the mechanism of decentralized governance requires not just approval, but also sufficient engagement to validate decisions. In this case, that engagement, or quorum, was lacking. Understanding Quorum: Why Did the LSK Token Burn Fail? For those new to the intricacies of DAOs, the concept of a ‘quorum’ can be confusing. Simply put, quorum is the minimum number of participants or votes required for a meeting or decision to be considered valid. Think of it like a company board meeting: even if all present directors agree on a decision, it might not be legally binding if not enough directors showed up in the first place. For the Lisk DAO , despite the near-unanimous ‘yes’ votes, the total number of LSK tokens participating in the vote fell short of the predetermined threshold. This means that while sentiment was clear, the process itself couldn’t be completed. This scenario is a common challenge in on-chain governance , where voter apathy or lack of awareness can derail even popular initiatives. The ERC-20 Token Migration and Its Impact on LSK Supply The context for this proposed LSK token burn is crucial. Lisk recently completed a significant token migration , moving its native LSK tokens from its own blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens. This migration was a strategic move aimed at enhancing interoperability, liquidity, and integration within the broader DeFi ecosystem. However, during this process, an additional 145 million new LSK tokens were minted. While this was part of the technical process, it naturally led to an increase in the total circulating supply. The community’s proposal to burn 100 million LSK was a direct response to this, an attempt to manage the supply and potentially mitigate any perceived dilution, reinforcing the value proposition of the LSK token . Implications for the Lisk Community and Future Governance The failure of this critical proposal, despite its overwhelming support, poses several questions for the Lisk DAO and its community. What does this mean for the future of the LSK token ? Will another LSK token burn proposal be put forth? More importantly, how will the Lisk community address the underlying issue of voter participation and DAO quorum ? This event serves as a stark reminder that even in decentralized systems, active engagement is vital. It highlights the challenges of coordinating a large, distributed community and ensuring that enough members are motivated to participate in governance decisions. This setback might prompt the Lisk team and community to re-evaluate their governance mechanisms or launch new initiatives to encourage greater voter turnout. Challenges in On-Chain Governance: Lessons from Lisk The Lisk situation is not unique. Many DAOs grapple with similar challenges in on-chain governance . The promise of decentralized decision-making is powerful, but its execution can be complex. Key challenges include: Voter Apathy: Members may not always have the time, knowledge, or incentive to participate in every proposal. Quorum Requirements: Setting the right quorum threshold is a delicate balance. Too high, and proposals might frequently fail; too low, and decisions might not truly reflect broad community consensus. Complexity of Proposals: Technical or financial proposals can be difficult for the average token holder to understand, leading to less engagement. Gas Fees: In some ecosystems, the cost of voting (gas fees) can deter participation, especially for smaller token holders. The Lisk case provides a valuable example of how critical DAO quorum is, even when a proposal enjoys strong approval. It underscores the need for DAOs to continually refine their governance models to foster active and informed participation. What’s Next for Lisk and the LSK Token? While the immediate proposal failed, the strong approval rate for the LSK token burn indicates a clear community desire. It is highly probable that the Lisk team or community members will initiate a new proposal. This might involve: Revised Burn Proposal: A similar proposal with perhaps a different quorum threshold or duration. Community Engagement Initiatives: Campaigns to educate and encourage more token holders to participate in governance. Governance Model Review: A deeper look into the Lisk DAO’s governance framework to identify potential improvements for future voting. The resilience of the Lisk community and its commitment to managing the LSK token supply will be tested, but this event also presents an opportunity for growth and refinement of its decentralized governance processes. Conclusion: The Imperative of Participation in DAOs The recent failure of the Lisk DAO ‘s LSK token burn proposal serves as a powerful lesson in the evolving landscape of decentralized governance. While the community’s overwhelming support for the burn was evident, the inability to meet the necessary DAO quorum highlights a fundamental challenge that many DAOs face: translating sentiment into actionable, valid decisions. This incident underscores the critical importance of active community participation in on-chain governance . For DAOs to truly thrive and fulfill their potential, token holders must not only voice their opinions but also actively engage in the voting processes that shape their collective future. The Lisk community’s journey continues, and how it addresses this quorum challenge will be a significant indicator of its maturity and effectiveness in the decentralized space.

However, the joy of a new ATH was short-lived. Shortly after surpassing $123,000, BTC began to decline, falling to the $116,000 level. While the market agrees that this correction is due to profit taking and is normal, they are divided on which direction the price will move next. At this point, 21 Shares analyst Matt Mena evaluated the rise in Bitcoin and the subsequent decline. Matt Mena said that a sharp decline in Bitcoin is unlikely as institutional demand strengthens. Mena stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to experience a prolonged sharp decline due to increasing demand and shrinking supply. Stating that Bitcoin supply is at a record low level, and spot BTC ETFs have received several times the amount of BTC expected to be issued this year, the analyst said: “The Bitcoin chart shows a structural imbalance between rising demand and a rapidly declining supply base. While the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges and over-the-counter platforms is at historic lows, demand continues to grow. US Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed several times the amount of Bitcoin that will be mined this year in just the first half of the year. “I would say that a long-term correction in Bitcoin is impossible, as there are far more positive factors than negative factors in the end.” However, Mena warned that while the outlook is positive, US President Donald Trump’s potential tariff policies and delays in Fed interest rate cuts could lead to a correction in risky assets, including BTC. *This is not investment advice.

The latest data from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index offers a compelling answer. Registering at a score of 38 on July 16, 00:30 UTC, this key metric signals a clear shift: the crypto market is currently deep in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . This score, a seven-point increase from the previous day’s figure reported by Bitcoin World, provides crucial insight into the prevailing sentiment and capital flows within the digital asset space. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin Season Dynamics To truly grasp the implications of an Altcoin Season Index score of 38, it’s essential to understand what this metric represents and how it’s calculated. The Altcoin Season Index, a proprietary tool by CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for the broader cryptocurrency performance across the market. It offers a snapshot of whether altcoins as a collective are outperforming Bitcoin, or vice-versa. Here’s how the index works: Scope: The index rigorously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Exclusions: To maintain accuracy and focus on genuine market movements, stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) are deliberately excluded from the calculation. This ensures the index reflects organic growth and decline in volatile assets. Timeframe: The comparison is made over a 90-day period, providing a medium-term view of market trends rather than short-term fluctuations. The Thresholds: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. The distinction between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is defined by clear thresholds: Market Phase Altcoin Season Index Score Criteria Altcoin Season 75 or higher At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season 25 or lower 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped tokens) have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Neither / Mixed Between 26 and 74 The market is in a transitional or mixed phase, where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin show clear, sustained dominance. With the index currently at 38, it firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season , indicating that Bitcoin is the dominant force, and most altcoins are struggling to keep pace. Why is the Crypto Market Currently in Bitcoin Season? The current state of the crypto market trends , characterized by Bitcoin’s outperformance, is influenced by several intertwined factors. It’s not just a random occurrence; rather, it reflects a combination of macroeconomic conditions, investor sentiment, and specific catalysts within the crypto ecosystem. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or uncertainty, investors often gravitate towards perceived safer assets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is widely considered the most established and least volatile asset compared to the vast array of altcoins. This ‘flight to quality’ sees capital flow into BTC, bolstering its price and dominance. Institutional Adoption and ETFs: The increasing interest from institutional investors and the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have provided a significant tailwind for Bitcoin. These developments make it easier for large capital to enter the Bitcoin market, driving demand and price appreciation. Altcoins, while gaining traction, generally lack the same level of institutional accessibility and regulatory clarity. The Bitcoin Halving Narrative: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock, known as the ‘halving,’ which reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created, historically precedes significant bull runs. Even in anticipation, this narrative often draws attention and capital specifically to Bitcoin, as investors front-run potential price surges. Liquidity Concentration: During periods of lower overall market liquidity, capital tends to concentrate in the largest and most liquid assets. Bitcoin, with its deep order books and global accessibility, naturally attracts this liquidity, leaving many altcoins struggling for volume and price momentum. Navigating Altcoin Performance During Bitcoin Dominance For investors, understanding that we are in a Bitcoin Season is crucial for managing expectations and strategizing their cryptocurrency portfolio . When Bitcoin dominates, the vast majority of altcoins typically underperform against BTC. This means that even if an altcoin sees a price increase in fiat terms (e.g., USD), it might still be losing value when measured against Bitcoin. What does this mean for your altcoin holdings? General Underperformance: Expect most altcoins to lag behind Bitcoin’s gains. Some might even decline in BTC terms. Selective Opportunities: While the overall trend favors Bitcoin, there can still be selective opportunities in altcoins driven by specific narratives (e.g., AI, RWA, gaming, specific Layer 2 solutions) or strong fundamental developments. However, these are often higher-risk plays and require thorough research. Reduced Liquidity: Many altcoins may experience lower trading volumes, leading to higher volatility and potentially larger price swings, both up and down, on smaller trades. Capital Rotation: Instead of new money flowing broadly into altcoins, any significant altcoin pumps might be due to temporary capital rotation from Bitcoin profits, which often flows back into BTC after a short period. The challenge for investors during such periods is to resist the urge to chase small altcoin pumps and instead focus on risk management and a clear understanding of market cycles. Historical Context: When Does Altcoin Season Emerge? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , it’s important to remember that the crypto market is cyclical. Altcoin Season is not gone forever; it’s merely waiting for the right conditions to emerge. Historically, Altcoin Seasons have typically followed periods of Bitcoin dominance or consolidation. Key triggers for past Altcoin Seasons (e.g., 2017, 2021) have included: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: After a significant Bitcoin rally, if BTC enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading, capital often starts flowing down the market cap ladder into altcoins. Investors, having made profits on Bitcoin, seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Ethereum (ETH) Breaking Out: Often, Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency and the backbone of many DeFi and NFT ecosystems, leads the charge for altcoins. A strong ETH performance can signal the start of broader altcoin rallies. Emergence of New Narratives: Past Altcoin Seasons were fueled by groundbreaking narratives like DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), GameFi, and more recently, AI-related tokens. These narratives attract new users and capital, creating significant buzz and demand for related altcoins. Technological Advancements: Major upgrades or successful rollouts of new technologies (e.g., Ethereum’s Merge, Layer 2 scaling solutions gaining traction) can also ignite interest in specific ecosystems and their native tokens. The Altcoin Index will rise again when these conditions align, signifying a shift in market sentiment and capital flow back into the broader altcoin market. Actionable Insights for Your Cryptocurrency Portfolio Given the current crypto market trends and the prevalence of Bitcoin Season, how should you adjust your strategy? Here are some actionable insights to consider for your cryptocurrency portfolio : Prioritize Bitcoin: In a Bitcoin-dominant market, maintaining a significant allocation to BTC can be a prudent strategy. It offers a relatively stable anchor for your portfolio and is likely to capture the majority of market gains. Strategic Altcoin Selection: If you choose to invest in altcoins, be highly selective. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, active development teams, and robust communities. Avoid chasing hype or meme coins unless you have a high-risk tolerance and a clear exit strategy. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This approach helps mitigate risk during volatile periods and allows you to accumulate assets at a better average price over time. Monitor Dominance Charts: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart (BTC.D). A rising dominance indicates Bitcoin Season, while a falling dominance often precedes or accompanies Altcoin Season. Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders for trades, and understand that altcoins, especially smaller ones, carry higher risks. Patience and Long-Term View: Market cycles take time to play out. A patient, long-term perspective can help you weather periods of Bitcoin dominance and position yourself for the eventual return of Altcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index at 38 serves as a clear indicator of the current market climate: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. While this means many altcoins will struggle to outperform, it also presents an opportunity for strategic positioning. Understanding the dynamics of the Altcoin Index and Bitcoin Season allows investors to make informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and prepare for the inevitable shifts in crypto market trends .

The price quickly dropped below $118,000 as major investors took profits. This led to a market-wide correction of about 5% to 10% across many cryptocurrencies. Amid the dip, popular crypto analyst Crypto Banter has urged investors to treat the current market dip as a rare chance to urgently accumulate top altcoins before the next major rally. Top Altcoins to Buy The Dip As Bitcoin’s dominance begins to wane and capital rotates into altcoins, several key tokens are flashing strong “buy” signals, supported by both technical trends and recent fundamental developments. Among his top picks, Solana (SOL) stands out. It’s currently trading around $166.7, but according to Banter, any dip below $160 creates a great opportunity to buy before a possible move to $187 or even $240. Next is Cardano (ADA). Banter suggests the best buying zone is between $0.69 and $0.71, especially after the price bounced off key support levels. Ripple’s XRP also made the list. With strong support around $2.60 and $2.80, Banter believes XRP is “gearing up” to break its all-time high and possibly reach $6. For Algorand (ALGO), he recommends buying between $2.55 and $2.70, a range that lines up with past resistance levels. Banter puts extra focus on SUI, saying there’s urgency to buy near $3.70 to $3.84. Right now, SUI is trading around $4, showing a 3.65% gain already. Other Token To Keep An Eye Other altcoins to keep an eye on include Dogecoin (DOGE), trading at $0.17, which could benefit from ETF rumors and growing meme coin interest. NEAR Protocol (NEAR), currently at $2.5, is also showing strong potential for the next rally. Crypto Banter believes that as Bitcoin’s drop slows down and altcoins get stronger, a big rally could be coming. They think altcoins are about to enter a powerful growth phase, helped by good news from governments and more money coming in through ETFs.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|NEAR|BTC|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 09:52:20

Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as one of the hottest answers. Its revolutionary approach to mobile mining and blockchain scalability is now drawing comparisons to Bitcoin’s earliest days, especially as analysts dissect the power behind its hybrid dual-consensus architecture. Why Bitcoin Solaris is Being Compared to Early Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris is not just another speculative crypto. The platform merges the best of Bitcoin’s proven PoW security with the scalability of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) through a layered architecture. At its foundation, the Base Layer utilizes SHA-256 mining, aligning with traditional Bitcoin miners while offering greater efficiency with 5-minute block times and regular difficulty adjustments. Above this, the Solaris Layer brings high-speed DPoS validation with 15-second blocks and validator rotation to maintain network integrity. This blend ensures BTC-S delivers over 10,000 TPS performance through its dual-consensus approach, putting it in a completely different league from Bitcoin’s limited scalability. The New Frontier: Mobile Mining Bitcoin Solaris is redefining what mining looks like in the modern era. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine directly from their smartphones, laptops, or desktops without needing expensive hardware or deep technical knowledge. While Bitcoin miners still require rigs north of $10,000 to stay competitive, BTC-S breaks those barriers with mobile-first mining solutions designed for the everyday user. The Blockchain Built to Break Limits Say Hello to BTC-S For more technical users, the Solaris Nova App also connects with ASICs and GPUs, automatically optimizing mining operations based on device capabilities. Energy efficiency is central here, with BTC-S reducing consumption by 99.95% compared to traditional Bitcoin mining. Mining Made Easy with Bitcoin Solaris One-click mining via mobile or desktop Dynamic device optimization ensures efficiency Access to decentralized mining power marketplaces Built-in wallet and security features, including biometric login BTC-S mining is not just about access, it is about democratizing blockchain wealth creation in a way Bitcoin never could. Presale Momentum: Why Investors Are Piling In Bitcoin Solaris’ presale is racing toward its $20 launch price with over $7M already raised and more than 14,200 users on board. Currently priced at $12, the next phase moves to $13, with only around 2 weeks left before the presale closes on July 31, 2025. Many call this the shortest, most explosive presale in the market right now. Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery post-launch. Bitcoin Solaris has also passed audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins, adding more confidence for participants eager to lock in before the next price hike. The influencer space is catching on too. A detailed review by Crypto Show highlights why Bitcoin Solaris is not just another presale; it’s a revolution in crypto mining accessibility and blockchain scalability. Behind the Tech: Dual-Consensus Explained The backbone of Bitcoin Solaris’ strength is its hybrid consensus. Base Layer (PoW): SHA-256 mining, 5-minute blocks, robust security against 51% attacks. Solaris Layer (DPoS): 21 validators, 15-second blocks, dynamic sizes up to 32MB, validator rotation every 24 hours. Cross-Layer Sync: Ensures both layers operate in harmony with state commitments on the Base Layer. This structure allows Bitcoin Solaris to achieve up to 100,000 TPS on its Solaris Layer while maintaining a secure, immutable foundation. Expanding Horizons with Tokenomics Bitcoin Solaris supports a long-term ecosystem through a fair and transparent token distribution. With a fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, its model reflects Bitcoin’s scarcity while optimizing for modern DeFi and blockchain needs. Token Allocation: 66.66% for mining 20% presale 5% liquidity pools 2% ecosystem development 2% community rewards 2% staking rewards 2% marketing 0.33% team and advisors The full breakdown can be reviewed through Bitcoin Solaris Tokenomics . Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris is shaping up to be more than a presale sensation. It is a serious contender for those who missed the early Bitcoin wave and are now looking for something with comparable long-term upside but modernized for today’s market needs. From mobile mining to its hybrid blockchain architecture, BTC-S delivers scalability, accessibility, and innovation in one package.

He reportedly brokered a deal with conservative House Republicans to revive long-awaited crypto bills that had faced a surprise setback recently. The dramatic U-turn followed a failed procedural vote in the House earlier in the day, when 13 hard-line GOP members joined Democrats to block debate on the crypto-friendly legislation. This move sparked panic in markets and tanked crypto-linked stocks. Bitcoin price saw a straight dip to $116k levels from trading over $120K amid the fallout. Trump jumps in to revive crypto bills In a late-night post on Truth Social, Trump revealed he met with the dissenting Republicans in the Oval Office. After a “short discussion,” he said, the lawmakers agreed to flip their votes in favor of the rule required to move the bills to the floor for a full vote. “They have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,” Trump wrote in a post. He added that House Speaker Mike Johnson had joined the meeting remotely and supports fast-tracking the vote. However, he even thanked Congress for its quick and positive response. The House will now consider three major industry-backed crypto bills this week. It is being seen as a moment that could reshape US digital asset regulation. Source: Donald Trump’s Truth Social . According to reports, the procedural vote was derailed when conservatives rebelled over the stablecoin legislation’s structure. Lawmakers, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tim Burchett objected to House leaders’ decision to take up a Senate-passed version of the bill without allowing amendments. Two of the most vocal rebels, Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Eli Crane were demanding an amendment that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ). This has been seen as a growing concern among crypto advocates. The failed rule vote ended in a 196–223 tally while catching the market off guard. Bitcoin bounces back after Trump’s move The digital asset market printed red indexes all around yesterday. Bitcoin fell by over 5% dipping below $117K, while stocks like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Riot Platforms all slipped in extended trading. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” among the traders. The cumulative crypto market saw a recovery of almost 3% on Wednesday morning. BTC is trading at an average price of $118,727 at press time. The biggest altcoin, Ethereum, surged by over 6% in the last 24 hours, outperforming BTC’s surge. ETH price is now up by 22% in the past 7 days. The altcoin is trading at an average price of $3,170 at press time. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” among the traders. Trump’s recent intervention somehow shows his promise to be a “crypto president.” Now, House leaders are expected to hold a re-vote on the rule opening the door for full debate and passage of the three bills. This includes a bipartisan stablecoin regulation framework, a market structure bill clarifying the role of the SEC and CFTC and protections for self-custody and decentralized finance.

Even now, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is still in the lead and continues to determine the direction of the rest of the crypto market. However, there is a turn in the tide coming as more altcoins begin to play catch-up. In particular, the coins in the list of Top 100 altcoins by market cap look to be on the verge of ushering in the next altcoin season. Altcoin Season Index Fires Into The Green The Altcoin Season Index is an index that charts the performance of the Top 100 altcoins by market cap against the performance of Bitcoin to determine when the altcoin season is in full bloom. This index, which goes from 1-100, is ranked by how many top 100 altcoins are outperforming BTC over a 90-day period, and when this figure rises to the 75% mark, it often signals that the altcoin season has begun. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Stopping At $123,000 — Technical Indicators Point To $140,000 Top Over the last few months, altcoins have performed quite terribly in comparison to Bitcoin, and this has led to the Altcoin Season Index dropping toward peak lows. The index hit a score of 12 back in June 2025, showing that only 12 altcoins had outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day timeframe. During this time, the Bitcoin dominance also rose rapidly, reaching as high as 66%, and signaling that most of the attention was on BTC during this time. However, the month of July has come with good tidings for the altcoin market as the index has seen its score more than double from its June lows. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index has now crossed a score of 30. It also shows that during this time, 32 coins have outperformed Bitcoin’s 40% increase in the last three months. Interestingly, the meme coins are once again leading the rally with the likes of PENGU and MemeCore rallying over 500% in the 90-day period. HyperLiquid’s HYPE has also performed quite well, with CoinMarketCap data showing it has risen more than 230% in 90 days. Bitcoin Dominance On The Verge Of Collapse? So far, the Bitcoin dominance has maintained its position in the 60th percentile, and this has remained so for the last 90 days. However, over the last two weeks, there has been enough decline in the dominance to spark a ray of hope among investors, and that is a 3% drop toward 63%. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst Going by historical performance, though, the Bitcoin dominance would need to drop much more than this for altcoin season to begin in full bloom. For example, back in 2017, the Bitcoin dominance crashed from above 95% to around 50% before the altcoin season began. Again, in 2017, the dominance fell from above 70% to around 41% before the altcoin season began. Going by this trend, the Bitcoin dominance would need to see a drop back into the 40% region, and possibly the 30% region, for the altcoin season to really take hold. But as long as the dominance remains high, then Bitcoin would continue to lead the market, and altcoins could continue to struggle.

This summer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured that rising attention. With a rare combination of decentralized finance mechanics, real-time passive yield, and deep ecosystem utility, MUTM is becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins under $0.05. And with August just around the corner, time is running out to get in before the next price leg. mtTokens: A Real Yield Machine Built for Passive Income What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from other DeFi protocols is its innovative approach to mtTokens—a feature that’s already generating significant anticipation ahead of launch. These ERC-20 tokens will be automatically minted when users lend their crypto assets into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming pool-to-contract (P2C) lending pools. But mtTokens are designed to do more than just sit idle. They are built to continuously grow in value as borrowers draw from the pool and repay interest. Without requiring users to manually stake or compound rewards, mtTokens will reflect passive income in real time—making them powerful, self-accruing financial instruments. For example, imagine depositing $2,500 worth of ETH into a Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending pool once the platform goes live. At a projected 11.8% APY, the lender would earn $295 annually—while still holding mtETH tokens that can be traded, transferred, or redeployed within the ecosystem. The interest is embedded directly into the mtToken’s growing value, offering transparency, liquidity, and effortless yield accumulation. Unlike legacy platforms, where deposits generate static yield and nothing more, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will allow users to take things further. mtTokens will be eligible for staking within the protocol’s upcoming smart contracts, where users can earn additional MUTM tokens sourced from platform revenue. This dual-reward mechanism—combining interest from lending and dividends from staking—positions mtTokens as one of the most forward-thinking DeFi yield tools coming to market this summer. Presale Momentum Builds as Price Jump Approaches Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now deep into its presale, with Phase 5 underway and the token still priced at $0.03. With over $12.35 million already raised and more than 73% of the tokens in this round sold, the clock is ticking for new buyers. The total supply is capped at 4 billion MUTM, and the presale has already attracted 13,300+ holders. The next price jump to $0.035 is locked in, setting the stage for an increasingly competitive entry point. A Phase 1 investor who swapped their Cardano (ADA) holdings for MUTM is now sitting on a 3x portfolio increase—an early validation of the project’s value proposition. And unlike purely speculative meme coins or narrative-driven rallies, the growth of MUTM is backed by active protocol mechanics that generate revenue, distribute yield, and expand use cases within the platform. To ensure a high standard of security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working closely with CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms. A $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program is currently live, split across four severity tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. This structured approach to stress testing adds a layer of confidence for both retail and institutional investors who value audited, robust infrastructure. Beyond protocol development, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rewarding its early believers with a $100,000 giveaway campaign . Ten selected winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, a gesture that reinforces the project’s commitment to community-first growth and long-term engagement. The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also promises utility-focused updates that go beyond hype. A beta launch of the live platform is scheduled to roll out alongside the token listing, giving users a hands-on experience with both P2C and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. The integration of Layer-2 scaling will dramatically improve transaction speed and reduce costs, making lending and borrowing even more seamless. And soon, users will gain access to a whale-tracking tool designed to give retail participants a competitive edge by monitoring large on-chain movements. For those looking beyond July to the rest of 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks the boxes that matter: real yield, transparent tokenomics, a dynamic reward structure, and a presale entry price still far below its listing value. With only 27% of Phase 5 tokens remaining, and the next price increase just steps away, MUTM is well-positioned to be one of the top altcoin breakout stars before August begins.

48343437,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178519,1752660021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48343437.jpeg,Bitmax Bitcoin: Korea’s Bold Leap into Corporate Crypto Dominance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitmax-bitcoin-korea-strategy/,"BitcoinWorld Bitmax Bitcoin: Korea’s Bold Leap into Corporate Crypto Dominance In a significant move poised to reshape the landscape of institutional crypto adoption in South Korea, Bitmax, a publicly listed Korean company, has announced a substantial increase in its Bitmax Bitcoin holdings. This strategic accumulation underscores a growing trend among corporations globally to embrace digital assets as a core component of their treasury management. With an additional purchase of 51.06 BTC, Bitmax’s total Bitcoin reserves now stand at an impressive 400.25 BTC, solidifying its position as the leading publicly listed company in South Korea by Bitcoin holdings. This bold step has drawn immediate comparisons to MicroStrategy, the U.S. software firm that pioneered large-scale corporate Bitcoin accumulation, signaling Bitmax’s ambition to become the “Korean MicroStrategy.” What does this mean for the future of corporate investment in the crypto space, particularly in a tech-forward nation like South Korea? Why is Bitmax Bitcoin Accumulating So Much? Bitmax’s journey into the crypto world is itself a testament to the transformative power of digital assets. Originally focused on augmented reality (AR) technology, the company made a pivotal strategic shift towards crypto investment, recognizing the immense potential of the burgeoning digital economy. This pivot wasn’t arbitrary; it reflects a calculated decision to capitalize on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The latest acquisition of 51.06 BTC is not just an isolated event but part of a continuous accumulation strategy that has seen the company steadily build its reserves. The rationale behind Bitmax Bitcoin ’s aggressive accumulation strategy appears multi-faceted: Strategic Diversification: Moving beyond traditional assets, Bitcoin offers a new avenue for treasury diversification, potentially enhancing overall portfolio resilience. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical performance and its capped supply make it an attractive asset for companies looking to preserve and grow capital over the long term. Market Leadership: By becoming the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in South Korea, Bitmax aims to establish itself as a pioneer and thought leader in the domestic crypto investment landscape. Mirroring Success: The explicit comparison to MicroStrategy suggests a belief that following a similar accumulation model can yield significant returns and enhance shareholder value, especially in a market with increasing institutional interest. This strategic shift highlights a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the corporate sector, moving from speculative assets to legitimate components of a company’s balance sheet. Korean Corporate Bitcoin: A Growing Trend? Bitmax’s substantial Korean Corporate Bitcoin holdings place it at the forefront of a potentially emerging trend within South Korea’s corporate landscape. While global giants like Tesla and Block (formerly Square) have made headlines with their Bitcoin acquisitions, the adoption by publicly listed companies in South Korea has been more cautious, largely due to a stringent regulatory environment and cultural factors. Bitmax’s move could serve as a catalyst, encouraging other Korean firms to explore similar strategies. The implications of such a trend are significant: Increased Legitimacy: Corporate adoption lends significant credibility to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, helping to dispel lingering doubts about its volatility and utility. Enhanced Liquidity: As more corporations hold Bitcoin, the overall market liquidity could improve, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. Regulatory Scrutiny: A surge in Korean Corporate Bitcoin holdings would likely draw increased attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to clearer guidelines and frameworks for digital asset management. Investor Confidence: When established companies allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it can boost confidence among retail and institutional investors alike, signaling a robust long-term outlook for the asset. The question now is whether Bitmax’s pioneering step will pave the way for a broader embrace of Bitcoin by other South Korean conglomerates and tech firms, transforming the nation into a hub for corporate crypto treasury management. The MicroStrategy Comparison: Is Bitmax Following the Blueprint? The explicit positioning of Bitmax as the “Korean counterpart to Strategy” (presumably referring to MicroStrategy) invites a detailed comparison. MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, embarked on an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy starting in 2020, accumulating over 200,000 BTC. This strategy transformed the software company into a de facto Bitcoin holding entity, significantly impacting its stock performance and market perception. So, how does Bitmax’s approach stack up against the MicroStrategy Comparison ? Feature MicroStrategy (MSTR) Bitmax (Korea) Primary Business Enterprise Software Augmented Reality (Pivoted to Crypto) Initial Holdings Began with zero, accumulated rapidly Pivoted from AR, steadily accumulating Total BTC Holdings 200,000+ BTC (as of early 2024) 400.25 BTC Funding Strategy Utilized corporate cash, convertible notes, debt offerings, equity sales Likely corporate cash, potentially exploring similar financing avenues Public Stance Very vocal, evangelistic about Bitcoin Announcing via X, positioning as Korean leader Market Impact Pioneered corporate BTC treasury strategy, inspired others First mover in Korea among listed firms, potential trendsetter While Bitmax’s holdings are currently modest compared to MicroStrategy’s vast reserves, the strategic intent appears remarkably similar: to leverage Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. The challenges, however, also mirror those faced by MicroStrategy, including: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet and stock performance. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in South Korea could pose challenges for large-scale crypto holdings. Shareholder Perception: Investors may view a significant pivot to crypto as either visionary or excessively risky. The success of Bitmax’s strategy will largely depend on its ability to navigate these challenges while effectively communicating its long-term vision to shareholders and the market. Institutional Crypto Adoption: What Does This Mean for the Market? Bitmax’s latest acquisition is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a barometer for the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption globally. When publicly traded companies, especially those outside the traditional finance sector, commit significant capital to Bitcoin, it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. This growing institutional interest is crucial for the maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Here’s why: Mainstream Acceptance: Corporate treasury adoption helps to normalize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond the realm of niche investment. Increased Capital Inflow: Institutional investments bring substantial capital into the market, potentially providing price stability and long-term upward pressure. Product Development: Growing demand from institutions often spurs the development of sophisticated financial products and services, such as Bitcoin ETFs, custodial solutions, and derivatives, further integrating crypto into the traditional financial system. Reduced Volatility (Long-Term): While initial large buys can cause price spikes, a broad base of institutional holders who are in for the long term can help reduce overall market volatility over time, as fewer coins are available for short-term trading. Bitmax’s actions contribute to a global narrative where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset but as a strategic reserve asset, akin to gold or other commodities. This shift is fundamental to Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a globally recognized store of value and medium of exchange. Understanding the BTC Investment Landscape in Korea South Korea has a unique and often complex relationship with cryptocurrencies. It boasts one of the most active retail trading markets globally, yet its regulatory stance has historically been cautious, focusing on investor protection and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. This backdrop is crucial for understanding Bitmax’s bold BTC Investment strategy. Key aspects of the Korean crypto landscape include: Strict Regulations: The Financial Services Commission (FSC) and other regulatory bodies have implemented stringent rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including licensing requirements and AML obligations. High Retail Adoption: Despite regulations, crypto trading is immensely popular among South Koreans, with a significant portion of the population participating in the market. Innovation Hub: South Korea is a leader in blockchain technology and innovation, with many startups exploring decentralized applications and Web3 initiatives. Government Stance: While there’s a push for innovation, the government also maintains a firm stance on preventing illicit activities and protecting consumers, which can sometimes lead to perceived hurdles for institutional adoption. For Bitmax, navigating this environment means not only managing the inherent risks of Bitcoin price volatility but also ensuring full compliance with Korean financial regulations. The company’s ability to successfully integrate a significant BTC Investment into its balance sheet, while adhering to local laws, could set a precedent for other Korean entities. This move could also signal a growing confidence among Korean businesses that the regulatory framework, while strict, is becoming more predictable, allowing for strategic long-term digital asset holdings. Bitmax’s strategic decision to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings to 400.25 BTC marks a pivotal moment for corporate crypto adoption in South Korea. By positioning itself as the “Korean MicroStrategy,” the company is not only making a substantial investment in the future of digital finance but also challenging the conventional norms of corporate treasury management within the region. This bold move underscores a growing global trend where forward-thinking companies recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. While challenges such as market volatility and regulatory complexities remain, Bitmax’s pioneering step could inspire a wave of similar corporate Bitcoin acquisitions across South Korea, further cementing the legitimacy and integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream economy. The world watches to see if Bitmax’s vision will indeed pave the way for a new era of corporate digital asset stewardship in Asia.

The partnership aims to support the Dubai government's real estate digitization initiative. Under the announced agreement, Ctrl Alt will use Ripple’s enterprise custody infrastructure to store tokenized title deeds issued by the Dubai Land Department (DLD). These documents will be stored on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Ripple's technology will play a critical role in ensuring the secure storage and lifecycle management of shared real estate titles.

The chart shows XRP trading above $2.83 with a mark near $3.40, corresponding to a significant upward movement. MMCrypto’s post reads: “This is where I sold XRP in the last pump.” The shared chart illustrates the price action leading up to that point and the subsequent market behavior. His statement implies that he capitalized on the previous surge and has since partially exited his position around that peak. This is where I sold XRP in the last pump. pic.twitter.com/VrrLl6ejiu — MMCrypto (@MMCrypto) July 12, 2025 The chart itself, set to a weekly time frame, highlights the volatility that XRP has experienced since late 2024. At the time of the screenshot, XRP was priced around $2.83, showing notable gains within the current week. The price movement depicted suggests a high of approximately $3.40 during the earlier rally, with the current price attempting another upward move. Responses From the Community Reflect Diverse Strategies The tweet drew several reactions from notable figures in the cryptocurrency community. Crypto Chiefs responded by revealing his strategy, noting that he sold his XRP at around $3.25 during the same rally and repurchased his position months later at $1.95. He also mentioned he would soon share his latest entry point and target for XRP, suggesting he remains actively engaged in the asset. Another user, Krueger842, provided a more critical perspective on MMCrypto’s claim, pointing out that the weekly candle in question displayed a wide price range of approximately 33% from bottom to top. He argued that, given the volatility reflected on the chart, it would have been possible to sell anywhere between $2 and $3.40, and questioned whether MMCrypto was attempting to imply perfect timing without definitive proof. Meanwhile, Whereismyhat commented on his position, stating that he is still holding XRP alongside MMCrypto but would need to sell some soon to cover personal expenses. He described how an upcoming car repair would require liquidating part of his holdings to pay for both labor and parts, illustrating how some investors balance cryptocurrency positions with real-world financial needs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 MMCrypto’s Chart Highlights Volatility and Key Levels The exchange of views around MMCrypto’s tweet highlights both the trading decisions of experienced market participants and the diverse motivations of individual investors. His chart underscores how significant price fluctuations in XRP can present both opportunities and challenges depending on one’s strategy and timing. While MMCrypto made clear that he exited near the previous high, others like Crypto Chiefs took a similar approach but reentered at lower levels. Still others, like Whereismyhat, remain holders by either conviction or necessity. The conversation also reflects the scrutiny that public trading claims can receive, as demonstrated by Krueger842’s analysis of the weekly candle’s range. These reactions showcase how the XRP community tracks price action closely and shares their perspectives on trading decisions in a market known for sharp moves. MMCrypto’s post serves as a reminder of the ongoing interest in XRP’s price trajectory and the importance of timing in capitalizing on its volatility. While his chart shows a key moment from the past rally, the current price level and weekly performance suggest that many traders are watching closely for signs of the next significant move.

Now, however, the apex crypto has begun trading sideways, just above the $118K mark. As of right now, the community is focusing on two things: one is for institutional interest to get higher, and the other is what comes ahead of Crypto Week. While there is an ecosystem of unease around Bitcoin, it is also the right time to find the best crypto to buy now, as volatile times cause some of the best investment opportunities to emerge. Bitcoin Price Stalled Below $120K As soon as Bitcoin moved past the $120K level to hit $123K, the community was elated. However, as expected, a correction followed soon after and short-term bearish signals started to flare up. Thankfully, the red candle was long enough for a panic rally to set in, and after a daily correction of 6%, the BTC price bounced. Hourly charts show that Bitcoin’s immediate resistance is around $118.4K, which could hopefully be crossed by the end of the day. After that, the apex crypto would have to go to $120K to retest its all-time high. Why is Bitcoin Trading Sideways? Bitcoin’s correction after reaching its all-time high was only natural. However, there are core reasons why the current accumulation trend is noteworthy. Profit-Taking and Caution One obvious reason is profit-taking. Long-time holders who waited for BTC to reach its all-time high have pulled back a bit to make gains. ETFs by Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark & 21Shares have also recorded outflows. Also, whenever Bitcoin has peaked, market conditions have turned volatile, which has made investors cautious. This can be seen from the low trading volumes as of late, indicative of bulls and bears being evenly matched. Pause Before the Next Surge Most of the big names within the cryptocurrency space have been very bullish about Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, has said that Bitcoin reaching $1 million between now and 2028 is “ inevitable .” Robert Kiyosaki, Cathie Wood, and Binance founder CZ have also echoed these sentiments. However, Bitcoin reaching that level hinges on geopolitical conditions and the changing financial ecosystem. That’s why shrewd investors are biding their time, holding their assets (or trading them sparingly) in order to wait for BTC to finally reach $1 million. Waiting for the Output of Crypto Week Crypto Week is one of the biggest events that could set the regulatory tone of decentralized finance moving forward. While several of the core bills were blocked ahead of the week, Trump claims that they are now moving forward. Whether or not these words hold true is making people cautious, leading to Bitcoin trading sideways. ETFs Have Plateaued for the Time Being While the institutional inflow had a massive surge after Bitcoin ETFs were approved, now that these exchange-traded funds have become mainstream, interest in them has stagnated. While BlackRock’s IBIT has seen consistent inflows , FBTC has seen outflows over the last two days. Is Bitcoin Still the Best Crypto to Buy Now? When we consider the sheer level of market interest, Bitcoin stands out as one of the best cryptocurrency investments for long-term holders. 2025 has seen massive institutional push and new highs for BTC. And since the new US administration is moving ahead with creating crypto-specific regulations where investors could get a bit more leeway, the apex crypto looks to be a good cryptocurrency investment. However, it is a high-cap asset, which means it is out of reach for many retail investors. And since going mainstream, chances are high that it could chart in the same way as a traditional asset. In simple words, it may not provide parabolic gains like it did before. Therefore, investors should consider altcoins that could be directly impacted by Bitcoin’s growth. Here are a few options that investors can look into. Bitcoin Hyper It is common knowledge that meme coins are the first to see a massive surge in price whenever Bitcoin hits a new high. However, Bitcoin Hyper is a project that not only tries to capitalize on Bitcoin’s core narratives but also aims to create a Bitcoin network that has more use cases. Developed on the Ethereum blockchain and integrated with the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper aims to make the Bitcoin network capable of handling smart contracts and become faster and more efficient. An L2 scaling solution provided by the Lightning Network is being used to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities. Furthermore, the project is also using a Canonical Bridge to provide seamless interoperability between the two chains. In time, the developers hope that more decentralized applications could be built on the Bitcoin network so that it would no longer be limited to just being another “store of value” asset. Recent updates reveal that Bitcoin Hyper has already made the Devnet live, which further indicates that the project does want to follow a utility-focused path. Experts at 99Bitcoins have called Bitcoin Hyper the next 10x BTC layer 2. Snorter Bitcoin’s consolidation has had little impact on the Solana price, which is now following an uptrend, with the community hoping that it could cross the $200 mark soon. One of the reasons why Solana has been such a success is due to Solana-based meme coins. Most of them have proven to be wildly successful, and Snorter has emerged as a trading bot that could help investors find the best one among them. Developed for Telegram, Snorter is a trading bot equipped with automated sniping features to find the best Solana-based investments. It also features security tools such as honeypot and rugpull protection, as well as social trading features like copytrading. Being active on Telegram means it could have a large following that could directly influence the Snorter token’s price in the short and long term. Snorter is also a meme coin, highlighted by its main animal: an aardvark. With a unique animal as a meme, Snorter also has viral potential. Experts like Crypto ZIP have said that Snorter could be a strong 10x presale due to its mix of use cases and memes. Token6900 According to Token6900 , the key to success when investing in memes is not going through too much research or tracking corporate earnings, but letting go of fundamentals altogether. The project completely embraces its lack of utility and creates an ambiance similar to SPX6900, down to aesthetics, and aims to provide users with a “not-so-unique” but honest meme coin that could offer massive short-term gains. The official website has a look of Windows 95, and the social media posts are full of AI-driven memes, most of them making no sense and focusing on the new “AI slop” genre. It means users will find random interviews, artworks that look as if built by someone influenced by chemicals, and an aesthetic that pays homage to the sheer ridiculousness of meme coins. Its tokenomics is simple but involves key aspects like vesting, giving the cryptocurrency community complete power. Staking rewards are also part of its appeal, and there is one hidden task to which exactly 24.9993% of the total supply has been allocated. Despite pursuing no utility, Token6900 has raised upwards of $500K within days of being launched on presale. Conclusion Although Bitcoin has started to trade sideways, there is no cause to worry. Correction and consolidation after a growth cycle are common. However, due to ongoing regulatory conversations and geopolitical conditions that often involve liberal talks about tariffs and war, the current trends feel more important than they actually are. Investors are advised to exercise patience. And if they are looking for the best crypto to buy now, they should focus on assets currently only available on presale. These assets could provide gains without subjecting investors to the current market’s volatility and have themes that could create strong communities.

Whales Buy Big, Altcoin Season Ignites appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is on fire again. As Bitcoin briefly pulls back from its new highs, ETH is climbing steadily, fueling growing buzz about a coming altcoin season. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe are doubling down on this trend, highlighting Ethereum’s surge as a sign of broader altcoin momentum in the making. There we go, a new high for $ETH / $BTC . This signals that #Altcoins are the play for the coming period, as those will follow Ethereum in the momentum. The breakout at 0.02425 was crucial. pic.twitter.com/pEk2Pqb5zA — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 16, 2025 ETH Gains Momentum Amid BTC Cool-Off Bitcoin recently soared past $120,000 , hitting multiple all-time highs before slipping back below $117,000, its lowest in five days. Meanwhile, Ethereum jumped to $3,128, up 20% on the week and 4% in the last 24 hours, marking its highest level in five months. According to Amberdata’s Greg Magadini, “ETH is gaining traction again” after years of lagging behind BTC. The reversal in momentum is noteworthy mainly because of the fact that while Bitcoin surged nearly 300% over the past two years, Ethereum posted just a 60% gain and is still down 8% year-to-date. But that trend could now be shifting. Another good morning, a great morning in the history of mankind. $ETH and #Altcoins continue to go up. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 16, 2025 Michaël van de Poppe explained that the market appears to be preparing for a classic shift into altcoins. He pointed out that Ethereum’s breakout has historically been one of the first signs that investors are beginning to move capital from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin’s dominance starting to decline, van de Poppe sees this as a clear indication that an altcoin season could be on the horizon. Crypto analyst Wolf says Ethereum’s long consolidation below $4K isn’t weakness but built-up pressure ready to explode. He compares it to Tesla’s 2019 breakout, warning that once ETH clears $4K, panic-buying will follow. Meanwhile, Ash Crypto pointed out that ETH is just 9.73% away from breaking out of a massive 4-year accumulation triangle. $ETH IS NOW ONLY 9.73% AWAY FROM BREAKING OUT OF THIS MASSIVE 4-YEAR ACCUMULATION TRIANGLE. ONCE IT BREAKS, ETH WILL EXPLODE pic.twitter.com/05vz8d8QPv — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 16, 2025 Institutional Demand Shifts to Ethereum A flood of institutional ETH buys adds weight to this theory. Sharplink Gaming just bought $225M worth of Ethereum , while BitMine pushed its ETH holdings above $500M. Simultaneously, Ethereum-based funds have seen 19.5% AUM growth over 12 weeks, double that of Bitcoin ETFs in the same period. These moves, along with growing institutional demand, are boosting sentiment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip , Ethereum-based investment products are also seeing significant inflows. CoinShares’ James Butterfill reported a 19.5% rise in ETH fund assets under management over the last 12 weeks, outpacing Bitcoin funds, which grew 9.8%. “People are preferring Ethereum over Bitcoin,” Butterfill noted. Notably, open interest in ETH futures just hit a 12-month high, further suggesting that whales are gearing up. Altcoin Season Around the Corner? Van de Poppe isn’t the only one pointing to Ethereum as the “kickstarter” of altcoin cycles. With Solana, Chainlink, and other majors also showing signs of bottoming and rotating upward, many traders now expect a wave of capital to flow into altcoins over the next few weeks. If Ethereum continues to hold above $3,100, the stage could be set for a full-blown altcoin breakout, with ETH leading the charge and Bitcoin quietly making room. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On his Truth Social platform, Trump revealed a crucial development regarding the long-awaited US stablecoin bill , stating that lawmakers have agreed to advance the legislation for a vote on the morning of July 16. This unexpected breakthrough signals a potential turning point for digital asset regulation in the United States, sending ripples of excitement and speculation across the industry. For months, the crypto community has watched closely as efforts to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins have navigated the complex corridors of Capitol Hill. The prospect of a definitive vote, especially after previous procedural setbacks, marks a pivotal moment. This article delves into the details of this agreement, explores the implications of the GENIUS Act , and examines what this rapid progression means for the future of digital finance. What is the GENIUS Act and Why is a US Stablecoin Bill So Important? The legislation at the heart of this discussion is often referred to as the GENIUS Act , or more formally, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. This proposed bill aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to a basket of assets. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are intended to offer price stability, making them suitable for transactions, remittances, and as a safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. The push for a dedicated US stablecoin bill stems from several critical needs: Consumer Protection: A clear regulatory framework can safeguard users from potential risks, including insolvency of stablecoin issuers, lack of transparency regarding reserves, and illicit activities. Financial Stability: As stablecoins gain wider adoption, their potential impact on the broader financial system becomes a concern for regulators. Proper oversight can mitigate systemic risks. Innovation and Competitiveness: A defined regulatory environment can foster innovation by providing legal certainty for businesses building on stablecoin technology, potentially positioning the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space. Market Clarity: The current lack of a unified federal approach creates a patchwork of state-level regulations and legal uncertainties, hindering growth and institutional adoption. The urgency to regulate stablecoins intensified following events like the TerraUSD (UST) collapse in 2022, which highlighted the potential for contagion and significant financial losses in unregulated markets. The GENIUS Act seeks to address these vulnerabilities by setting clear standards for stablecoin issuance, reserve requirements, and operational transparency. Understanding the Path to a Stablecoin Vote: What Changed? The journey of the stablecoin vote has been fraught with challenges. Earlier attempts to bring the bill to the floor for a vote faced significant hurdles, including a procedural vote failure that seemed to stall its progress indefinitely. This makes Trump’s recent announcement all the more remarkable. According to his Truth Social post, he met in the Oval Office with 11 of the 12 lawmakers required to pass the GENIUS Act. This indicates a high level of bipartisan engagement and a concerted effort to push the legislation forward. A key participant in this critical meeting was House Speaker Mike Johnson, who reportedly joined by phone and expressed his readiness to move the vote forward as swiftly as possible. This commitment from the House leadership is a strong signal of renewed political will. The sudden consensus among a significant number of lawmakers, after previous impasses, suggests that either new compromises have been reached, or the political calculus around crypto regulation has shifted dramatically. Possible factors contributing to this acceleration could include: Increased Industry Pressure: The crypto industry has consistently lobbied for regulatory clarity, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to keep pace with other nations. Bipartisan Alignment: While crypto has often been a politically charged topic, stablecoin regulation has shown moments of bipartisan support due to its perceived importance for financial stability and national security. Electoral Considerations: With an election looming, both parties may see the benefit of showing progress on an issue that resonates with a growing segment of voters interested in digital assets. Urgency from Key Figures: Direct involvement from influential figures like former President Trump can provide the necessary impetus to overcome legislative inertia. The agreement to proceed with a vote on July 16, a mere few weeks away, signifies an unprecedented pace for such complex legislation. It suggests that the groundwork for consensus has been laid, and lawmakers are now eager to capitalize on this momentum. How Will New Crypto Regulation Impact the Digital Asset Landscape? The passage of comprehensive crypto regulation , specifically concerning stablecoins, would usher in a new era for the digital asset landscape in the United States. The implications are far-reaching, affecting everything from how stablecoins are issued and used to how traditional financial institutions interact with the crypto economy. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Investor Confidence: Clear rules can reduce uncertainty, making stablecoins more attractive to institutional investors and retail users who have been hesitant due to regulatory ambiguity. Increased Institutional Adoption: Banks and other financial entities require regulatory clarity to integrate stablecoins into their operations. A federal framework could pave the way for wider adoption in traditional finance. Reduced Market Fragmentation: A unified federal law would supersede disparate state-level regulations, creating a more consistent and predictable operating environment for stablecoin issuers and users across the U.S. Improved Global Competitiveness: By establishing robust standards, the U.S. could reinforce its position as a leader in financial innovation, preventing talent and capital from flowing to jurisdictions with clearer crypto policies. Potential Challenges and Concerns: Risk of Over-Regulation: Critics worry that overly stringent rules could stifle innovation, making it difficult for new stablecoin projects to emerge and compete. Compliance Burden: Small and medium-sized stablecoin issuers might face significant compliance costs, potentially leading to market consolidation among larger players. Definition and Scope: The exact definitions within the bill will be crucial. If the scope is too broad, it could inadvertently impact other types of digital assets or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. International Harmonization: While U.S. regulation is important, the global nature of crypto means that lack of international coordination could create arbitrage opportunities or regulatory gaps. The specifics of the GENIUS Act, once fully revealed and debated, will determine the precise impact. However, the general consensus is that some form of clear crypto regulation is necessary for the industry’s maturation and mainstream acceptance. What Does Trump Stablecoin Support Mean for the Future? The involvement of former President Donald Trump in accelerating the Trump stablecoin bill’s progress adds a unique political dimension to this development. While Trump’s stance on cryptocurrencies has evolved over time – from initial skepticism to more recent expressions of support – his direct intervention here underscores the growing political salience of digital assets. His advocacy for the GENIUS Act suggests a strategic recognition of the economic and technological importance of stablecoins. For a figure who has historically been critical of decentralized currencies like Bitcoin, his proactive engagement in pushing stablecoin legislation signals a potential shift in the Republican party’s approach to crypto. This could be interpreted as: Pragmatism: Recognizing the inevitable rise of digital assets and aiming to shape their regulation rather than resist it entirely. Economic Opportunity: Viewing stablecoins as a tool to enhance the U.S. dollar’s global dominance in the digital age. Political Play: Tapping into the growing demographic of crypto-savvy voters ahead of the upcoming presidential election. Trump’s direct involvement could also influence other lawmakers, potentially swaying fence-sitters and consolidating support for the bill. His ability to rally a significant number of legislators, as evidenced by the Oval Office meeting, highlights his continued influence in legislative matters. The fact that a bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed to this expedited vote under his apparent guidance suggests a rare moment of cross-aisle cooperation on a significant economic issue. The long-term implications of this Trump stablecoin push could extend beyond just this bill. It might signal a broader willingness within conservative political circles to engage with and even champion certain aspects of the crypto industry, particularly those that align with traditional financial structures or national interests. Key Stakeholder Perspectives on the GENIUS Act The advancement of the GENIUS Act naturally elicits varied responses from different stakeholders within and outside the crypto ecosystem. Understanding these perspectives is crucial for a complete picture of the bill’s potential impact. Crypto Industry Leaders: Many in the crypto industry, especially major stablecoin issuers, have long called for regulatory clarity. They generally welcome federal legislation as it can provide the certainty needed for institutional adoption and long-term growth. However, they will scrutinize the specifics of the bill to ensure it doesn’t stifle innovation or impose overly burdensome compliance requirements that could push businesses offshore. Traditional Financial Institutions: Banks, payment processors, and other legacy financial firms are keen on understanding how stablecoins will integrate into existing financial systems. Clear regulation would allow them to confidently explore stablecoin-related services, from settlement to custody, without fear of regulatory backlash. They often favor a framework that aligns with existing financial regulations, ensuring stability and preventing illicit finance. Consumer Advocacy Groups: These groups primarily focus on protecting individual users. They advocate for strong reserve requirements, transparent audits, and clear disclosure rules to prevent fraud and ensure that stablecoins are truly backed one-to-one. Their concern is often with the safety and soundness of the stablecoin ecosystem for the average user. Regulators (e.g., Treasury, Federal Reserve): Government agencies have been vocal about the need for stablecoin regulation to address financial stability risks, prevent money laundering, and ensure consumer protection. They typically favor robust oversight mechanisms and enforcement powers to maintain the integrity of the financial system. The GENIUS Act represents a step towards achieving these objectives. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community With the stablecoin vote on July 16 fast approaching, members of the crypto community, from individual investors to businesses, should be prepared for potential shifts. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Closely follow news and analysis regarding the bill’s final text and the outcomes of the vote. Understanding the specific provisions will be crucial. Assess Impact on Holdings: If you hold stablecoins, consider how the new regulations might affect their backing, transparency, and overall risk profile. While most major stablecoins already strive for compliance, new rules could impact smaller or less transparent offerings. Evaluate Business Strategies: For crypto businesses, especially those involved in stablecoin issuance, trading, or integration, begin assessing potential compliance requirements. This might involve updating internal policies, technological infrastructure, or legal frameworks. Engage with Policy Makers: If possible, participate in industry discussions, provide feedback, or support organizations that advocate for sensible regulation. Your voice can contribute to shaping the future landscape. Look for Opportunities: Regulatory clarity often brings new opportunities. As institutions gain confidence, expect increased capital inflows, new product offerings, and broader adoption of stablecoin technology. The July 16 vote is not just a legislative event; it’s a market-moving catalyst that could redefine how stablecoins operate and how the U.S. positions itself in the global digital economy. The Road Ahead: What Happens After the July 16 Vote? The July 16 vote on the US stablecoin bill is a critical milestone, but it’s important to understand that its passage in the House is just one step in a multi-stage legislative process. Here’s a look at what could happen next: If the Bill Passes the House: Senate Consideration: The bill would then move to the Senate. The Senate has its own legislative priorities and potentially different views on crypto regulation. While bipartisan momentum in the House is positive, securing passage in the Senate could still present challenges. Conference Committee (if needed): If the Senate passes a different version of the bill, a conference committee would be formed to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions. Presidential Assent: Once both chambers pass identical legislation, it would be sent to the President for signature. Given Trump’s apparent support, if he were to be President at the time, his assent seems likely. If the bill is passed during the current administration, President Biden’s stance would be crucial, though his administration has also signaled a desire for stablecoin regulation. Implementation: Even after becoming law, there would be a period of implementation where regulatory agencies (like the Treasury, Federal Reserve, SEC, or CFTC) would develop detailed rules and guidelines based on the new legislation. This process can take months or even years. If the Bill Fails in the House: Setback for Regulation: A failure would be a significant setback for federal stablecoin regulation efforts in the U.S. It would mean continued regulatory uncertainty and a fragmented approach. Renewed Efforts or Stagnation: Lawmakers might try to reintroduce revised versions of the bill in the future, or the issue could languish until a more favorable political climate emerges. State-Level Focus: In the absence of federal clarity, states might continue to develop their own stablecoin regulations, further complicating the landscape for businesses operating nationwide. Regardless of the outcome, the fact that a vote is even happening with such political backing signifies a maturing conversation around digital assets in Washington. It underscores that stablecoins are no longer a fringe topic but a central element in discussions about the future of finance. Conclusion The upcoming July 16 vote on the US stablecoin bill , the GENIUS Act, represents a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Former President Donald Trump’s announcement of a bipartisan agreement to advance this legislation has injected a renewed sense of urgency and optimism into the quest for regulatory clarity. This development highlights a significant shift in political will, potentially paving the way for comprehensive crypto regulation that could foster innovation, enhance consumer protection, and solidify the U.S.’s position in the global digital economy. While the path to final enactment still involves navigating the Senate and presidential assent, the imminent stablecoin vote in the House is a powerful indicator that the era of regulatory ambiguity for stablecoins may soon be drawing to a close. The crypto community watches with bated breath, recognizing that the outcome of this vote will have profound and lasting implications for the future of digital finance.

The KF-01 mission kicked off a three-launch deal inked by the two rivals in December 2023. The deployment expanded Amazon’s fleet of internet satellites to 78. Amazon’s Project Kuiper launched its broadband internet satellites into orbit using today’s 27-minute launch window, which opened at 2:18 AM ET. The Falcon 9 rocket used in today’s mission lifted off from Florida’s Space Coast–Launch Complex 40. The e-commerce giant used rockets provided by the United Launch Alliance (ULA) in April and June to send 54 internet satellites into space. Each mission carried 27 satellites. The Project Kuiper team said it will use over 80 missions to deploy its initial internet satellite constellation, totaling over 3.2K devices. Today’s SpaceX mission deployed the Kuiper satellites nearly 465 KM (~289 Miles) above Earth. The Kuiper team then took over command from its Redmond operations center in Washington to complete the initial health check for the satellites. The satellites will ultimately be raised to their assigned altitude of about 630 KM. Kuiper’s initial ULA deployment of 54 satellites remains healthy The Kuiper team confirmed on July 15 that its initial deployment of 54 broadband satellites was healthy and fully operational. The ULA launched Kuiper’s first 27 spacecraft into its low Earth orbit satellite network on April 28 aboard the ULA Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station–Launch Complex 41, Florida, at 7:01 PM EDT. All 27 satellites were successfully released 36 minutes later at approximately 450 KM above Earth. Kuiper’s mission control established contact with all devices 90 minutes after the launch for a health check of all systems and subsystems, and final positioning. The second Kuiper mission (KA-02) deployed another batch of 27 internet satellites carried to low Earth orbit by the ULA Atlas V rocket. The June 23 launch began at 6:54 AM EDT from Space Launch Complex 41, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. ULA said the mission marked Amazon’s next step in providing fast internet connections to underserved and unserved communities worldwide. “We are proud to continue our strong partnership with Amazon and empower their mission to bridge the digital divide through reliable satellite technology.” – Gary Wentz , Vice President of Government and Commercial Programs at ULA Wentz pointed out that ULA was a catalyst and collaborated with Amazon to advance global internet connectivity. He added that ULA would enable the delivery of nearly half of all 3.2K Project Kuiper’s satellites. Badyal says Kuiper satellites are the best ever built The Vice President of Project Kuiper, Rajeev Badyal, said his company had designed the “most advanced” communications satellites. He added that every launch was an opportunity to add to Kuiper’s network coverage and capacity. The Kuiper VP stressed that his team had carried out extensive and comprehensive testing to prepare for future missions. However, he also pointed out that some things were better understood through experience. Badyal asserted that this was the beginning of Kuiper’s long journey. He added that the company had all the pieces in place to adapt and learn over the coming years, regardless of how the missions unfolded. Amazon disclosed that the ULA and Kuiper teams will carry out seven more launches on the Atlas V rocket and about 38 missions on the larger Vulcan Centaur rocket. Over 30 other missions are planned through other launch providers, including Amazon’s own Blue Origin, Arianespace, and rival SpaceX. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Imagine leveraging your digital assets to achieve traditional dreams, like owning a home. Well, that future is now a reality in Australia, thanks to a groundbreaking initiative. Australian fintech firm Block Earner has just unveiled the country’s first Bitcoin-backed home loan , a move that could fundamentally change how Australians approach property ownership and asset utilization. How Does a Bitcoin-Backed Home Loan Work? This innovative offering from Block Earner is designed to provide a flexible financing option for homeowners. At its core, the service allows individuals to use their Bitcoin holdings as collateral to secure a home loan. But how exactly does this mechanism function, and what are the specifics? Collateralization: Users can borrow up to 50% of a property’s value. The crucial part here is that your Bitcoin, instead of being sold, is held as collateral by Fireblocks, a reputable crypto custody company. This means you retain ownership of your Bitcoin, but it’s locked up to secure the loan. Loan Structure: The loan itself is structured as interest-only for a period of up to four years. This provides a window for borrowers to manage their finances, potentially anticipating future Bitcoin price movements or other income streams. Flexible Repayments: In a nod to the crypto-native audience, repayments are accepted in either traditional fiat currency (cash) or, uniquely, in cryptocurrency. This flexibility is a significant draw for those deeply invested in the digital asset space. This model is a significant departure from traditional mortgage lending, which typically relies on fiat currency and conventional assets as collateral. By enabling Bitcoin as collateral , Block Earner is bridging a gap between the digital and physical asset worlds. What Are the Advantages of a Crypto Home Loan in Australia? For many crypto holders, their digital assets represent a substantial portion of their wealth. However, liquidating these assets often comes with tax implications and the loss of potential future gains. This is where a crypto home loan Australia presents compelling advantages: Unlock Liquidity Without Selling: The primary benefit is the ability to access capital without selling your Bitcoin. This means you avoid triggering capital gains tax events and can potentially benefit from future appreciation of your BTC. Asset Diversification (Indirect): While your loan is backed by Bitcoin, the funds received are in fiat, allowing you to invest in a tangible asset like real estate, diversifying your overall portfolio. Flexibility for Crypto Enthusiasts: For those who believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin, this offers a way to leverage their conviction while still achieving traditional financial goals like home ownership. The option to repay in crypto further enhances this flexibility. Consider a scenario: a Bitcoin holder needs funds for a down payment on a house. Instead of selling their BTC, incurring taxes, and potentially missing out on future price surges, they can use it as collateral. This strategy allows them to keep their “HODL” philosophy intact while still making a significant life purchase. What Are the Considerations When Using Bitcoin Collateral? While the benefits are clear, it’s crucial to approach any financial product, especially one involving volatile assets, with a clear understanding of the risks. Using Bitcoin collateral comes with its own set of unique challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant drop in Bitcoin’s value could lead to a margin call, requiring you to provide more collateral or face liquidation of your Bitcoin to cover the loan. Custody Risks: While Fireblocks is a reputable custodian, the principle of “not your keys, not your crypto” still applies. Entrusting your assets to a third party always carries some inherent risk, however small. Interest-Only Period: The four-year interest-only period means you’re not paying down the principal during this time. Borrowers must have a clear plan for how they will manage the principal repayment at the end of this term. Regulatory Landscape: The crypto regulatory environment is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the terms or availability of such loans in the future. It’s essential for potential borrowers to conduct thorough due diligence, understand the terms and conditions, and assess their personal risk tolerance before committing to such a loan. This isn’t just about getting a loan; it’s about making an informed financial decision in a new and exciting space. Block Earner: A Pioneer in Australian Digital Asset Lending The launch of this product solidifies Block Earner ‘s position as a trailblazer in the Australian fintech scene. By being the first to offer a Bitcoin-backed home loan, they are not just providing a new service; they are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in financial innovation. The company has been actively involved in the Australian crypto space, navigating regulatory challenges and working towards mainstream adoption of digital assets. Their partnership with Fireblocks underscores a commitment to security and professional asset management, which is vital for building trust in this nascent industry. This move by Block Earner could inspire other financial institutions to explore similar offerings, potentially leading to a more diverse and innovative lending market. The Broader Impact on Digital Asset Lending Block Earner’s initiative is more than just a new product; it’s a significant step forward for the entire field of digital asset lending . Historically, crypto assets have been viewed as speculative investments, detached from traditional financial instruments. This loan bridges that gap, demonstrating the utility and real-world applicability of cryptocurrencies beyond mere trading. This development could pave the way for a future where: More diverse digital assets are accepted as collateral for various types of loans. Traditional banks begin to integrate crypto-backed financial products into their offerings. The line between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) continues to blur, creating hybrid financial ecosystems. The success of this loan product in Australia will be closely watched by fintech firms and regulators globally, as it could serve as a blueprint for similar innovations in other markets. It signals a growing maturity in the crypto space, moving beyond just investment vehicles to becoming integral components of broader financial strategies. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Crypto and Property? This groundbreaking launch by Block Earner is just the beginning. As the crypto market matures and regulatory frameworks become clearer, we can expect even more sophisticated financial products that leverage digital assets. For homeowners and aspiring homeowners, this opens up a new avenue for accessing capital, potentially offering more flexible and efficient solutions than traditional routes. It’s an exciting time to be involved in both real estate and cryptocurrency. The convergence of these two powerful sectors promises to unlock new opportunities and redefine financial possibilities for individuals and institutions alike. Stay informed, understand the risks, and explore how these innovations might fit into your financial journey. In conclusion, Block Earner’s Bitcoin-backed home loan is a pivotal moment for Australian finance, showcasing the immense potential of digital assets to revolutionize traditional lending. By offering a path to property ownership without liquidating valuable crypto holdings, this product empowers a new generation of borrowers and sets a precedent for future financial innovation. It’s a bold step towards a more integrated and flexible financial future, where your digital wealth can truly work for you.

Layer 1s, DeFi, and AI coins are leading the charge with real-world integrations and ecosystem growth. SUI, ARB, and AVAX are surging on high-profile partnerships and rising on-chain metrics. HBAR and LINK show breakout potential backed by institutional adoption and network activity. The total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin (TOTAL2) has pushed to $1.34 trillion, its highest since April — a strong confirmation that altcoin season is underway. Volume has picked up sharply over the last week, and price is well above all major EMAs (20/50/100/200), indicating sustained momentum. This sets the stage for aggressive rotation into mid-cap and high-utility altcoins. While Bitcoin remains the long-term anchor for crypto investors, its short-term dominance is down by 60% from 63% in the past week, and that’s good news for altcoins. Ethereum has reclaimed strength above $3,000, reaching its 5-month high, and the ETH/BTC ratio is showing a reversal, typically signalling the start of “alt season.” With capital rotating into smaller caps, several altcoins are now flashing bullish technical setups, backed by real usage, new partnerships, and rising token velocity. Here are 5 altcoins to buy today , each with strong catalysts and a realistic path to further upside in this rally. 1. Sui (SUI) Sui is shaping up to be one of the clearest winners in this altcoin cycle. The protocol’s Total Value Locked (TVL) just hit a new all-time high of $2.326 billion as of July 16, 2025, according to DeFiLlama. What’s even more telling is the surge in net inflows — $1.57 million on July 15 alone — showing strong conviction from capital allocators at this stage in the rally. This momentum hasn’t come out of nowhere. The recent partnership with Google Cloud to bring AI-powered tooling to Web3 builders has turned heads, especially with institutional validators like HSBC and DBS now participating in consensus. From a technical perspective, SUI Coin has just completed a clean breakout above the $3.20–$3.40 zone — and even touched the $4.00 mark, which it struggled to reach over the past two months. Momentum can shift quickly, and reclaiming such levels often signals renewed strength. The daily chart shows strong bullish candles, with volume expanding and no immediate signs of exhaustion. With momentum intact, traders are now watching the psychological $5.00/ SUI level as the next probable target. 2. Arbitrum (ARB) According to The Block, Arbitrum’s Timeboost — a transaction ordering system launched in April 2025 — has already pulled in over $2 million in fees. The system lets users bid for faster transaction inclusion, and now powers nearly a third of all DEX trades on Arbitrum. It’s not only curbing congestion and front-running risks but also bringing sustainable revenue back into the ecosystem. With 3.5 billion ARB tokens in the DAO treasury (worth ~$1.3B), this new revenue stream makes Arbitrum more than just a fast L2 — it’s now a self-sustaining ecosystem with real economic value flowing through its governance structure. On the technical front, ARB is showing early signs of strength after retesting the $0.414–$0.420 zone — a critical reversal area where price was rejected multiple times in the past. With the current bounce, bulls are now eyeing the $0.460 resistance as the next hurdle. If broken, we could see an extended move toward $0.483 or higher. Recent ecosystem stats show a spike in fee revenue and developer deployment. Technically, ARB is breaking out from consolidation with room to run toward $1.40–$1.60, especially as institutional adoption continues to grow. 3. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche recently made headlines as FIFA officially selected it to power the FIFA+ collectibles platform — a major validation, especially as it replaced Algorand. This move positions AVAX as a go-to chain for large-scale consumer applications and digital assets. On the infrastructure side, Avalanche continues expanding its subnet architecture with “Avalanche 9000,” giving developers more freedom to launch custom, high-performance chains. On the charts, AVAX has pushed through the $20.36 barrier (February 2025 low) and is currently testing the $22.30 zone — a key recovery hurdle. Just above sits the 100 EMA at $23.15, which now acts as resistance. If bulls can flip this level, the next major target lies near $25.60 — a long-standing supply zone. AVAX Technical Levels: Immediate Support: $20.36 (previous resistance turned support) Resistance: $22.30–$23.15 zone Upside Target: $25.61 (key supply zone) Hedera (HBAR) Hedera is quietly building bullish momentum across both fundamentals and technicals. Grayscale’s recent inclusion of HBAR in its Smart Contract Platform Fund — replacing Polkadot — alongside stablecoin pilots by banks like Shinhan and Standard Bank, is fueling renewed institutional interest. On-chain USDC activity is steadily rising, and the number of exchanges supporting HBAR has expanded throughout Q2. Technically, HBAR Coin broke above the $0.22 zone and briefly tagged $0.25 in mid-July, continuing its sharp upward trajectory from earlier this month. The RSI is hovering near 78 — slightly overheated, yes, but still a healthy sign of strength — while MACD histogram bars continue to rise, suggesting the trend still has fuel. If it maintains above $0.23, the path toward $0.28–$0.30 remains open. 5. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink remains the dominant oracle solution and has deepened its institutional role in 2025. It now powers interoperability for tokenized funds across thousands of banks via Project Guardian, and recently launched its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on Hedera. On-chain data shows LINK usage spiking, and while the token is still well below its 2021 highs, accumulation by whales and fund managers points to a quiet buildup phase. If tokenized RWAs and cross-chain DeFi continue expanding, LINK is poised to benefit directly.",Price Analysis|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|ARB|LINK|AVAX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 11:54:31

The rally comes amid renewed optimism in crypto markets, with altcoins leading a charge that saw total market capitalization edge higher on the back of rising open interest and technical momentum. From July 15 at 11:00 UTC through July 16 at 10:00 UTC, BONK appreciated by 15.08%, climbing from $0.00002824 to $0.00003253 before peaking at $0.00003309. The Solana-based memecoin posted a sequence of higher highs and higher lows, punching through resistance at $0.000030000 and $0.000032000 as traders rotated into high-volatility assets, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. The move coincided with BONK’s inclusion on Grayscale’s institutional surveillance list , a milestone that further legitimizes the memecoin in the eyes of broader market participants. Technically, BONK’s momentum remained strong even during volatile periods. In the final hour of the session, the token pulled back to $0.00003225 at 09:45 UTC before bouncing sharply on volume spikes exceeding 134 billion tokens, lifting it to $0.000033034. New short-term support has formed at $0.00003295. With sentiment improving across the altcoin landscape and BONK showing both volume and price leadership, the token now appears poised to challenge the $0.000035000 level - a psychological barrier that could open room for further upside if the broader rally continues. Technical Analysis Highlights BONK gained 15.08% in 24 hours, moving from $0.00002824 to $0.00003253. Full trading range spanned 18.93%, with a high of $0.00003309. Resistance at $0.000030000 and $0.000032000 was cleanly broken. Immediate resistance now at $0.000033000; next upside target sits at $0.000035000. Solid support emerged at $0.000028500 and more recently at $0.000032950. Volume surged above 134B tokens during final-hour recovery and breakout. BONK rebounded 2.4% from intraday low of $0.00003225. Current price: $0.00003343, leading Solana ecosystem tokens in daily gains.

Details of the Attack: BigONE is a total of four different blockchain networks: 120 BTC 350 ETH 1,800 SOL It announced a loss of 8.54 million USDT. It was also reported that assets in eight other cryptocurrencies, including DOGE, SHIB, and CELR, were stolen. Blockchain security firm SlowMist reported that the attack was carried out through the supply chain. In such attacks, hackers manipulate the operation of a system by injecting malicious code into the software infrastructure. SlowMist stated that the attackers manipulated the operating logic of account and risk control servers to enable unauthorized withdrawals. Importantly, it emphasized that despite the attack, the wallets' private keys were not compromised. The exchange stated that they had identified the attack vector and prevented further losses. BigONE also announced that they were tracking the hacker and the movement of funds in collaboration with SlowMist. “BigONE will fully compensate for all losses arising from this incident,” the company stated, adding that internal security reserves have been activated to balance liquidity pools and that deposits and trading will reopen shortly. This incident has once again brought to the fore the security measures of centralized crypto exchanges and the potential risks of hot wallets. *This is not investment advice.

Active management and flexible covered call strategies—mixing weekly and monthly options—enable the Fund to adapt to Bitcoin's volatility and maximize returns. Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF's performance is still closely tied to Bitcoin's direction; it softens losses in downturns but will decline if Bitcoin enters a bear market. YBTC is best suited for investors bullish or neutral on Bitcoin; I own it for diversification but recommend only a modest allocation due to inherent volatility. Introduction and Performance Overview Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ) is a covered call fund that focuses specifically on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). This is certainly not the only Bitcoin based covered call fund out there, but it seems to be the best performing one so far and capturing the most upside from Bitcoin. Since April, Bitcoin itself is up 40.59% while this fund is up 32% in total returns, indicating that it was able to capture 80% of the upside. Some of this fund's more popular competitors such as YieldMax Bitcoin fund ( YBIT ) and Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call fund ( BTCC ) was able to generate total returns of 18% to 20% during the same time period, capturing only about half of Bitcoin's rise. Data by YCharts Since inception, the fund's share price has been virtually flat (dropping 0.02%) while its total return was an impressive 99.8%. Basically, all the fund's returns came from distribution, but it's amazing that the fund was able to preserve all of its NAV despite distributing a yield close to 100% during this time. Data by YCharts Unstable Payments but Stable NAV The fund has a 40% distribution yield, and it recently switched from monthly payments to weekly payments. The fund's distributions are not very stable and can vary wildly from week to week depending on how much money the fund made from its options plays, and the long-term average comes out to an annualized 35% to 45% yield so far. On one side, the fund's varying distributions make it difficult to have consistency and rely on stable income but on the other hand it provides investors with a stable NAV and stable share price because the fund only pays out the profits it made and not from NAV itself. We've seen so many funds bleed themselves half to death while paying out more than they make just to support high distribution rates, so I like that this fund isn't doing that. YBTC Distributions From Last 12 Months (Roundhill) It's Still a Bullish Bet on Bitcoin While considering the fund's strong performance, keep in mind that Bitcoin itself has been performing very well lately. If Bitcoin's performance were to go south, it is very possible that this fund's performance would also suffer, so I wouldn't count on the fund's past performance to continue the same way forever considering that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset. Earlier this year, Bitcoin went through a correction from mid-January to mid-April where its price declined by almost -30%. During the same period this fund declined by about -17% which means it was able to soften the blow by selling covered calls and collecting premiums, but it dropped regardless so if Bitcoin were to enter a prolonged bear market, this fund would also enter into one, although the effects might be a bit softer due to the premiums it's been collecting. Data by YCharts What Sets This Fund Apart ? The big question is: How come this fund has been outperforming its peers by such a wide margin? After all, they all write covered calls, and there are only so many ways you can write covered calls. Sure, you can pick different strike prices and different time periods, but typically covered call funds tend to have similar performance metrics. This one seems to be doing much better than others, though. First of all, the fund is actively managed , so its managers analyze the situation every single week to determine what makes sense in terms of strike price and other variables such as expiration dates. They also decide which vehicles to use (Bitcoin futures vs ETFs) depending on a number of factors. So the fund's strategy can be slightly different every week and every month depending on how bullish or bearish the fund's managers feel about Bitcoin. For example, in March and April when Bitcoin had its 30% correction described above, the fund's management saw this as a sign that Bitcoin was oversold and made their bet to the upside where they sold covered calls at strike prices significantly higher than the price at the time. This allowed them to capture more upside. Another factor is that since the fund doesn't distribute more than it generates in profits, its stable NAV allows it to have maximum buying power, which allows it to take advantage and buy the dip when Bitcoin is on sale. Other funds might distribute too much and end up not having enough assets to buy the dip in a substantial manner in the same way this fund does. There is also the luck factor. It's impossible to know where Bitcoin will go tomorrow, next week or next month. This is a highly volatile asset with no earnings, no dividends and no valuation metrics which means that its price is entirely set by sentiment which can easily change overnight as we've seen many times before. When it comes to Bitcoin, whether you are doing covered calls or just trading the asset itself, some part of your success will be dependent on luck. The thing with luck is that it doesn't always stay in the same place though, and today's lucky investors (trader) could be tomorrow's unlucky investor (trader) and vice versa. Finally, the fund doesn't limit itself to monthly options like many of its competition. Some funds only sell weekly options and others sell monthly options, but this fund uses a mix. Since it's an actively managed fund, the managers of the fund decide which options are more appropriate to sell. At the moment the fund seems to have sold a bunch of weekly options expiring on July 18th, but this isn't always the case. YBTC's current holdings (Roundhill) There are cases where selling weekly options might be more profitable, and there are cases where selling monthly options would be more profitable. Weekly options have smaller premiums since they have less time until expiration, but typically the difference can be small. For example, one of the most commonly used Bitcoin ETFs is iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and its current price is $66. If you wanted to write at-the-money weekly call options in this fund, you would get about $1.86 of premium in a typical week. For the same fund, if you wanted to write monthly at-the-money calls you would generate $3.45 which is about only twice the amount you'd get for a weekly even though there are 4.5 weeks in a month. On the other hand, if you are feeling bullish and trying to sell options that are out of money, monthly could be a better option. For example, if you sell weekly calls at a strike price of $71 (just $5 above the current price) you will get a weekly premium of 37 cents but if you sell the same option for a monthly expiration you will get about $1.53 which is almost 5 times the amount. Different Option Prices ( OptionProfitCalculator) So the manager of the fund will have to decide on not only strike prices but also expiration dates depending on how bullish or bearish they feel at the time. Many funds put constraints on their management about how they can sell covered calls, but this fund gives its management a lot of flexibility and freedom, and this might explain some of its performance. Conclusion So far, the fund's flexible and active approach seems to be working very well. At the end of the day, whether you would want to buy and hold this fund depends on one thing: are you bullish or bearish on Bitcoin overall? If you think Bitcoin presents a great value and is here to stay for a very long time and that its current price represents a good entry point or at least if you have mixed feelings and feel neutral about it, I would also suggest you to buy YBTC. If you think Bitcoin itself is a huge bubble that's about to burst and crash and burn, then I would also suggest you to stay away from YBTC. At the end of the day, this fund is a bet that Bitcoin will be somewhere between ""stable"" and ""bullish"" in the foreseeable future. Personally, I am not a huge fan of Bitcoin because it's impossible to value it and its price is entirely driven by sentiment, but I am not bearish on it either, and I don't see it as a bubble because I don't know what proper value is for it. How can I tell something is overvalued or a bubble if I don't even know how to value it and what its proper value should be? Having said that, I own YBTC because it gives me exposure to this asset, which helps my diversification goals. I wouldn't put too much money into this fund, but I would put at least some.",YBTC,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-16 11:59:44

The move is designed to give Aethir’s native ATH token holders and node operators access to stablecoin credit without liquidating their tokens — a step toward blending on-chain infrastructure with real-world financial capital. The product, which debuted on Wednesday, lets eligible users collateralize their ATH tokens to access a revolving credit line or preload a no-fee card with ATH or stablecoins on Solana. Loan approvals and limits are determined by Credible’s AI-driven credit engine, which evaluates a user’s on-chain activity, asset holdings and transaction history. DePIN projects leverage blockchain incentives to crowdsource the development of real-world infrastructure. In Aethir’s case, node operators contribute computing power and earn ATH in return. These rewards are based on factors like uptime, performance and job completion, effectively turning physical infrastructure into on-chain income. The launch of the credit card comes as crypto borrowing slides. According to the team, decentralized lending platforms saw a $4.75 billion decline in open loans in the first quarter, the biggest quarterly contraction since 2023. At the same time, the global credit gap for small- and medium-sized businesses in emerging markets stands at $5.7 trillion. “This downturn underscores the limitations of overcollateralized lending models and highlights the need for credit systems that reflect real on-chain activity and infrastructure ownership,” the team wrote a release shared with CoinDesk. “This is the first DePIN-native token being activated for real-time credit,” said Shrikant Bhalerao, CEO of Credible Finance, in the release. “We’re turning tokenized infrastructure into usable financial capital.” The team wrote that credit card access will initially be available to their GPU providers, node operators and token holders, with plans to expand later Read more: Aethir's Mark Rydon: Decentralizing AI Computing",Tech|DePIN|credit cards|Loans|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 12:00:00

The new products, mMEV and mRe7YIELD, are designed to offer opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi) and are monitored by MEV Capital and Re7 Capital, respectively, each acting as appointed risk manager, according to a Wednesday press release. The move builds on Midas’ earlier products, mBASIS and mTBILL, which have together attracted $11 million in total value locked (TVL) on Etherlink since their introduction. These tokenized certificates track financial strategies through ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to hold exposure through self-custodied, permissionless smart contracts while retaining compliance oversight. The new products follow a similar model. mMEV offers exposure to arbitrage and market-neutral opportunities across blockchain ecosystems, while mRe7YIELD tracks diversified DeFi yield strategies. In both cases, investors avoid dealing with multiple intermediaries or regional regulations by executing strategies via a single on-chain transaction. Etherlink, with its fast confirmation times and negligible transaction fees, has seen recent network upgrades, including near-instant withdrawal times. What once required contracting through multiple layers of intermediaries, each governed by their own local regulations, may soon be executed through a single smart contract call, said David Relkin, head of DeFi at Nomadic Labs, a Tezos developer group working on Etherlink. ""Products like mMEV and mRE7YIELD finally make advanced yield-farming strategies accessible to institutional investors. We view them as one important step toward bringing wholesale finance fully on-chain,” Relkin said in the statement. For Midas, Etherlink provides the ideal environment for scalable financial applications, where strategies can be composed directly into lending, automated market making and structured vaults with minimal overhead and maximal accessibility, said Dennis Dinkelmeyer, CEO at Midas “Etherlink offers the scalability and composability needed to bring structured, compliant strategies fully on-chain. With mMEV and mRe7YIELD, we’re expanding secure, self-custodied exposure to institutional-grade products.” Dinkelmeyer said in a statement.",Finance|Tokenization|Layer 2s|Tezos|DeFi|News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|XTZ|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 12:00:00

This also creates a path for further fusions of Liquid Yield Tokens (LYTs) into Etherlink’s ecosystem, offering various use cases that include collateralized lending, risk tranching, and portfolio management. Midas’ New Collaboration According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato , the institutional-grade asset tokenization platform is steadily developing on Etherlink. The focus is on creating secure, transparent, and efficient structures that allow investors to access the performance of select reference strategies through tokenized formats. After launching mBASIS, the protocol for tracking the performance of crypto funding rates, and mTBILL, which tracks short-term US Treasuries, two new products were introduced: mMEV and mRe7YIELD. The former follows a yield strategy by MEV Capital, a digital asset manager, and the latter does the same, but for Re7 Capital, an investment firm specializing in DeFi yield and liquid alpha strategies. At the time of printing, according to information from Midas’ website, the reported Total Value Locked (TVL) is close to $350 million; however, data from DefiLlama paints a different picture, with nearly $190 million. Etherlink as The Backbone The L2 blockchain is non-custodial, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible, built on Tezos Smart Rollups, offering developers favorable conditions in terms of transaction costs and confirmation times. “Etherlink offers the scalability and composability needed to bring structured, compliant strategies fully on-chain. With mMEV and mRe7YIELD, we’re expanding secure, self-custodied exposure to institutional-grade products.” – Dennis Dinkelmeyer, CEO at Midas David Relkin, the Head of DeFi at Nomadic Labs, which is the core team behind Tezos, believes this is an essential step toward bringing wholesale finance fully on-chain. The timing aligns with notable progress achieved by the blockchain, which has grown from $1.45 million on March 1st to over $45 million in TVL as of today, indicated by DefiLlama. This is just one of the use cases that Etherlink boasts, which also includes gaming & NFTs, cross-chain liquidity through bridges like LayerZero or Bifröst, support for .etherlink domains, and more.

33767162,[object Object],1752667216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"XRP Open Interest Explodes To January ATH Levels, Will Price Follow Above $3?",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-open-interest-explodes-2/,"XRP has seen its open interest explode by more than half in the month of July so far, as the price moves to turn $3 into support. Not only has the growth in July been exponential, but it has also sent the open interest barreling toward the all-time high levels that were set back in January 2025. Given that the price climbed rapidly with the open interest early this year, it is possible that this is only the start for the XRP price, and the uptrend could continue. XRP Open Interest Hits $8 Billion Levels After a long consolidation that spanned years, the XRP open interest had begun to surge back in November 2024, and this continued into 2025. By January 2025, the open interest surged above the $8 billion level for the first time in history to set new all-time highs. While the XRP price did not hit new all-time highs at this time, it also cleared the $3.2 level as it followed the trajectory of the open interest. Following the drive to new peaks earlier in the year, the XRP open interest fell once again, trending below the $5 billion mark for a few months. This saw the price enter into another consolidation that has now been broken in the month of July. According to data from the Coinglass website , the open interest is sitting at approximately $8 billion, less than $400 million shy of the $8.33 billion that was recorded back on January 18. At the same time, the XRP price has also rallied, stopping short of $3 as bulls look to turn this resistance level into support in the coming weeks. If the open interest does continue to rise, then the XRP price is expected to keep going . It is currently only 23% below its all-time high of $3.84 recorded back in 2017, so a repeat of January’s price push could put the altcoin at new all-time highs. Volumes Show Next Steps Another bullish development for the XRP price has been the rise in the trading volume. Coinglass data shows that the daily trading volume spiked by 200% to touch $35 billion on July 12, and while there has been a slowdown since then, the daily trading volume remains high at an average of $16 billion over the last few days. There has also been dominance in the market from South Korean crypto exchange Upbit , which has accelerated to command the second-highest volume for XRP, second only to Binance. Upbit’s volume for the altcoin over the last seven days has risen above $3.8 billion, to beat out Coinbase and Bybit. Of the top 5 exchanges leading in terms of volumes, Upbit is the only crypto exchange that has seen positive net flows of $131.4 million. Meanwhile, the likes of Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit have seen negative net flows during this time, signaling that there is more buying going on on Upbit.",XRP|crypto|crypto news|open interest|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP Open interest|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-16 12:00:16

Here’s the Latest from the U.S. Banking System,https://timestabloid.com/xrps-banking-moment-has-arrived-heres-the-latest-from-the-u-s-banking-system/,"A groundbreaking shift has just occurred in the U.S. financial system. In an unprecedented move, the Federal Reserve , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have jointly authorized U.S. banks to offer crypto custody services. This regulatory alignment officially greenlights the safekeeping of digital assets, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry, and especially for XRP. Regulatory Alignment Opens the Doors for Custody For the first time, America’s top banking regulators have issued unified guidance defining “safekeeping” as the act of holding digital assets on behalf of customers, with or without fiduciary responsibility. This clarity now allows U.S. banks to directly custody cryptocurrencies , a major step toward legitimizing and integrating digital assets into traditional finance. From retail clients to large institutions, banks can now offer secure, regulated storage of assets like XRP, without ambiguity. XRP’S BANKING MOMENT HAS ARRIVED THE U.S. BANKING SYSTEM HAS JUST BEEN AUTHORIZED TO SAFEGUARD CRYPTO. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC just dropped a bombshell: pic.twitter.com/vmiSRhKmED — Pumpius (@pumpius) July 15, 2025 XRP Positioned for Institutional Adoption This regulatory breakthrough is particularly significant for XRP. As highlighted by Pumpius on X, this moment has been long anticipated by Ripple and its ecosystem. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was purpose-built for institutional use, not speculation. Its design and architecture reflect its intended use for serious financial applications. With over 70 million ledgers successfully closed, transaction finality within 3 to 5 seconds, and native support for tokenization, the XRPL is technically primed for the custody role now permitted by regulators. XRP’s speed, scalability, and reliability make it uniquely suited to meet the needs of custodianship, and these capabilities are exactly what financial institutions require in a compliant and scalable custody framework. Ripple’s Infrastructure Is Already in Place This policy shift comes at a time when Ripple’s infrastructure is maturing at an institutional level. The company has already applied for a U.S. national bank charter , a bold move that, if approved, would make Ripple one of the few blockchain firms with formal banking privileges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Meanwhile, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, is being integrated into BNY Mellon’s custody platform. As one of the oldest and most trusted banks in the world, BNY Mellon’s involvement lends substantial credibility to the initiative. This stablecoin-custody pairing signals the readiness of Ripple’s architecture to handle regulated, fiat-pegged digital assets at scale. Biometric Identity and the Future of Digital Custody Beyond financial integration, Ripple is also advancing identity solutions through the XRPL. The DNA Protocol, another innovation being built into the ledger, combines biometric identification and vGenome data with decentralized finance. This innovation adds a crucial layer of compliance and identity verification, meeting the growing demands of institutions and regulators in today’s digital landscape. The Institutional Era for XRP Has Begun What we are witnessing is not just a policy change, it’s the formal institutionalization of XRP. With regulatory support now in place, Ripple’s robust infrastructure, stablecoin initiatives, and identity integrations are converging to make XRP a foundational rail for the future of finance. As Pumpius noted, “Stealth mode is ending. Deployment has begun.” The institutions are moving in. The framework is set. And XRP stands at the heart of this evolution.

A recent development that has sent ripples through the community involves the infamous BigONE hacker . This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present risks in the cryptocurrency space, highlighting how quickly stolen funds can be moved and transformed. Let’s delve into the details of this significant event and what it means for the broader crypto ecosystem. What Happened in the BigONE Hacker Incident? The saga began with a substantial security compromise at BigONE, a prominent crypto exchange. The perpetrator managed to siphon off a staggering $27 million in various digital assets. This kind of event immediately triggers alarms, not just for the affected exchange and its users, but for the entire industry, raising questions about security protocols and vulnerability points. The initial breach was a significant blow, but the subsequent actions of the hacker are what truly captivated the attention of blockchain analysts. Unpacking the Crypto Exchange Breach: The Conversion Strategy Following the successful exfiltration of funds, the BigONE hacker wasted no time in attempting to obscure their tracks and convert the diverse portfolio of stolen assets into more liquid and potentially harder-to-trace cryptocurrencies. This is a common tactic employed by cybercriminals to ‘clean’ their ill-gotten gains. According to meticulous on-chain data analysis by Lookonchain, a reputable blockchain analytics firm, the hacker systematically converted the $27 million worth of assets into a specific mix of leading cryptocurrencies. Here’s a breakdown of the conversions: Converted Asset Amount Approximate USD Value Bitcoin (BTC) 120 BTC $14.15 million Tron (TRX) 23.3 million TRX $7.01 million Ethereum (ETH) 1,272 ETH $4 million Solana (SOL) 2,625 SOL $428,000 This strategic conversion highlights the hacker’s intent to move funds into assets with high liquidity, making them easier to sell or further obfuscate across different blockchain networks. Why the Bitcoin Conversion and Other Key Assets? The choice of assets for conversion by the BigONE hacker is not arbitrary. Each cryptocurrency serves a particular purpose in the post-hack laundering process: Bitcoin (BTC): Often considered the ‘king’ of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin offers unparalleled liquidity. For large sums like $14.15 million, BTC provides the easiest route to conversion into fiat currency or other assets, even with increased scrutiny. While not truly anonymous, the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin transactions still offers a layer of separation for criminals trying to evade direct identification. Ethereum (ETH): As the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum’s ecosystem offers numerous avenues for moving funds, including through decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and various dApps, which can complicate tracking efforts. Tron (TRX): Tron is known for its low transaction fees and high throughput, making it an efficient network for transferring large volumes of tokens quickly. Its growing ecosystem also provides various liquidity pools and decentralized applications. Solana (SOL): Solana offers extremely fast and cheap transactions, which can be appealing for quickly moving funds or engaging in rapid trading activities to further mix and obscure the trail. The hacker’s strategy seems to involve diversifying the stolen crypto across different blockchains and asset types to increase the complexity of tracking and recovery efforts. The Power of On-Chain Data in Tracking Stolen Crypto One of the most fascinating aspects of this incident is the role of on-chain data . Unlike traditional financial systems, blockchain transactions are publicly recorded and immutable. This transparency, while sometimes seen as a privacy concern, is also a powerful tool for law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain. How does on-chain data help in tracking stolen crypto ? Public Ledger: Every transaction, from the initial theft to the subsequent conversions, is recorded on the respective blockchain’s public ledger. Address Tracking: Analysts can follow the flow of funds from one wallet address to another, mapping out the hacker’s movements. Clustering: Sophisticated tools can identify clusters of addresses that are likely controlled by the same entity, even if they use multiple wallets. Transaction Analysis: By analyzing transaction patterns, volumes, and timings, investigators can piece together the hacker’s strategy. While hackers employ various techniques like mixers or multiple hops to obscure their trail, the fundamental transparency of the blockchain means that a digital footprint always remains. This makes it incredibly difficult for large sums of stolen crypto to disappear without a trace, often leading to their eventual identification, if not direct recovery. Challenges and Implications for Crypto Security The BigONE incident, like many other crypto exchange breach events, underscores several critical challenges facing the digital asset industry: Persistent Threat of Hacks: Despite advancements in security, exchanges remain prime targets due to the vast amounts of assets they hold. Hackers are constantly evolving their methods, from sophisticated phishing attacks to exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts or internal systems. Difficulty of Recovery: While funds can be tracked, their recovery is a complex legal and technical challenge, often requiring international cooperation and precise legal frameworks that are still developing. Reputational Damage: A breach significantly damages an exchange’s reputation, eroding user trust and potentially leading to a loss of business. These incidents highlight the urgent need for continuous innovation in security measures and a proactive approach to threat intelligence. Actionable Insights for Users and Exchanges In light of incidents like the BigONE hacker , both individual users and cryptocurrency exchanges must prioritize robust security practices: For Users: Choose Reputable Exchanges: Opt for exchanges with a strong track record of security, transparent practices, and robust insurance policies. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA for all your crypto accounts. Hardware-based 2FA (like YubiKey) is preferable over SMS-based. Use Hardware Wallets for Large Holdings: For significant amounts of crypto, transfer them off exchanges into hardware wallets (cold storage), which offer superior security. Be Wary of Phishing: Always double-check URLs and email senders. Never click suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources. Regularly Monitor Accounts: Keep an eye on your transaction history and account balances for any unusual activity. For Exchanges: Implement Multi-Layered Security: Beyond basic firewalls, exchanges need advanced intrusion detection systems, regular penetration testing, and bug bounty programs. Cold Storage Dominance: A significant portion of user funds should be held in cold storage, isolated from online systems. Robust Incident Response Plan: Having a clear, practiced plan for how to respond to a breach, including communication strategies and recovery protocols, is crucial. Regular Security Audits: Engage third-party security firms for frequent and thorough audits of their entire infrastructure. Educate Users: Provide clear and accessible security guidelines and warnings to users about common scams and best practices. Compelling Summary The incident involving the BigONE hacker and the subsequent conversion of $27 million into BTC, TRX, ETH, and SOL serves as a powerful testament to both the vulnerabilities and the transparency inherent in the cryptocurrency world. While cybercriminals continue to target valuable digital assets, the increasing sophistication of on-chain data analysis provides a formidable counter-tool, making it progressively harder for stolen crypto to vanish without a trace. This ongoing cat-and-mouse game between hackers and security experts reinforces the critical importance of continuous vigilance, robust security measures, and community awareness to safeguard the integrity of the digital economy.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is becoming aggressively bullish as in the year’s second half, July, a new ATH has been marked, smashing previous all-time highs of $112K . As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop, as it has entered a price discovery mode. This optimism has been directly fueled by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , skyrocketing institutional adoption , much clearer regulations, and unwavering political support from figures like President Trump. It’s now seen as “a hedge against inflation” more than ever, and the cryptocurrency is capturing global attention. Major players like MicroStrategy , Metaplanet , Trump Media , and several other entities are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. With the Federal Reserve hinting at future rate cuts and market enthusiasm at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $115,765.69 and $119,298.17 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin’s performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader. Iran’s defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 The Bitcoin price performance in July 2025 has been nothing short of impressive. Since the final week of June, Bitcoin has broken free from its consolidation range, fueled by a combination of whale accumulation, increased spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On-chain data also reveals a sharp increase in whale transactions, especially in the $100K+ and $1M+ brackets. Spot volume also hit a 3-month high, indicating heightened market participation. These catalysts combined helped the BTC price to establish a new all-time high at $123231, but in mid-July, it faced a slight decline to $116K due to profit booking. However, amid the cooldown in rally, investors kept accumulating and surged back to $119K and are aiming for the ATH retest. From a technical perspective, BTC now eyes the psychological milestone of $125,000. Should the price maintain upward momentum, this level may be tested before the end of the month. However, any short-term pullback would make $120,000 a crucial support to hold. A drop below this level potentially pulls BTC back to the $110,000 swing low support zone, and the final defense line stays near the $101,000 mark. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. Successively, we can expect an upward target of 195. However, a crackdown by the bears could take the price down to $145. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $8.19 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $870M–$498M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

Announcing on its official website, SWC confirmed the purchase of an additional 325 BTC, elevating its total corporate Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,600 BTC. This strategic accumulation by a company outside the traditional financial sector speaks volumes about the evolving perception of cryptocurrencies as legitimate treasury assets. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a powerful statement from a company deeply rooted in the digital realm, showcasing profound confidence in Bitcoin ‘s long-term value proposition. As more corporations look to diversify their balance sheets and hedge against economic uncertainties, SWC’s actions provide a compelling case study in proactive financial management within the rapidly changing global economy. Smarter Web Company ‘s Bold Move: A Deep Dive into Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The Smarter Web Company’s journey into substantial Bitcoin accumulation began earlier, and this latest purchase of 325 BTC is a continuation of a well-defined strategy. Bringing their total to 1,600 BTC positions SWC among a growing, albeit still exclusive, club of publicly traded companies holding significant amounts of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. For a web development firm, this move is particularly insightful, demonstrating how businesses at the forefront of digital innovation are increasingly embracing decentralized finance. What drives such decisions? It’s often a blend of factors: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a ‘digital gold’ – a scarce asset with a fixed supply, making it attractive as a store of value. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Many institutional investors and corporations believe Bitcoin is still in its early stages of adoption and has significant upside potential as it becomes more integrated into global finance. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding Bitcoin can be seen as a way to diversify treasury reserves beyond traditional cash and fixed-income assets, potentially boosting overall company value. Alignment with Digital Future: For a web development company like SWC, embracing Bitcoin aligns with its core business of building the digital future, showcasing a forward-thinking approach. SWC’s continued investment highlights a broader trend: the increasing comfort level of established businesses with integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. This is a crucial step for the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, moving beyond speculative retail interest to sustained institutional Bitcoin adoption . Why Bitcoin ? Unpacking SWC’s Strategic Crypto Investment Rationale The choice of Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies for significant corporate treasury allocations is often deliberate and rooted in its unique characteristics. While the broader crypto market offers a diverse range of assets, Bitcoin stands out for several reasons that appeal to institutional players seeking stability and recognition: Scarcity and Predictability: With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin ‘s supply is finite and predictable, mimicking the scarcity of precious metals. This makes it an attractive asset in a world of unlimited fiat currency creation. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin ‘s decentralized network and robust cryptographic security make it resistant to censorship and manipulation, offering a level of autonomy not found in traditional financial systems. Liquidity and Market Cap: As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin offers unparalleled liquidity, making it easier for large entities like Smarter Web Company to buy and sell without significant market impact. Growing Infrastructure: The ecosystem around Bitcoin , including institutional-grade custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and financial products, has matured significantly, reducing operational risks for corporate investors. This strategic crypto investment by SWC is not just about holding an asset; it’s about making a calculated decision based on a deep understanding of macroeconomics and the potential of decentralized technology. It reflects a growing conviction that Bitcoin is not merely a speculative asset but a foundational layer for the future of finance. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings : Who Else is Joining the Digital Gold Rush? The Smarter Web Company is certainly not alone in its embrace of Bitcoin . Over the past few years, a notable trend has emerged, with several prominent corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This movement signals a broader acceptance of digital assets beyond early adopters and tech-centric firms. Here’s a look at some of the notable players: Company Industry Approx. BTC Holdings (as of recent reports) Primary Rationale (Publicly Stated) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence ~214,400 BTC Primary treasury reserve asset, inflation hedge. Tesla Automotive, Clean Energy ~9,720 BTC Diversification, belief in Bitcoin ‘s long-term potential. Block (formerly Square) Financial Services, Payments ~8,027 BTC Future of currency, economic empowerment. Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~17,631 BTC Core business asset, holding strategy. Coinbase Global Cryptocurrency Exchange ~9,000 BTC Operating asset, supporting the crypto economy. The Smarter Web Company (SWC) Web Development 1,600 BTC Strategic treasury diversification, alignment with digital future. This table illustrates a diverse range of industries engaging in corporate Bitcoin holdings , from software and automotive to financial services and mining. Each company’s rationale may differ slightly, but the underlying theme is a recognition of Bitcoin ‘s unique properties as a non-sovereign, digital asset that can serve as a valuable component of a corporate treasury strategy. This trend suggests that what started as a niche investment is steadily gaining traction as a legitimate and increasingly common corporate asset. What Does This Mean for Smarter Web Company ‘s Future and the Digital Asset Landscape? The latest Bitcoin acquisition by Smarter Web Company carries significant implications, both for the company itself and for the broader digital asset ecosystem. For SWC, this move could bolster its financial standing and brand image in several ways: Enhanced Balance Sheet: A substantial holding of Bitcoin , an asset with significant appreciation potential, can strengthen SWC’s balance sheet, providing a hedge against currency devaluation and offering potential for future capital gains. Innovation and Brand Positioning: By actively engaging with cryptocurrencies, SWC reinforces its image as a forward-thinking, innovative company. This can attract top talent interested in cutting-edge technology and appeal to clients seeking digitally savvy partners. Competitive Advantage: In the web development space, demonstrating a deep understanding and adoption of emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies can differentiate SWC from competitors. From a wider perspective, SWC’s decision contributes to the normalization of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. Every company that publicly announces significant corporate Bitcoin holdings adds another layer of legitimacy to the asset class, potentially encouraging other firms to explore similar strategies. This collective institutional interest can: Increase Market Stability: As more long-term corporate holders enter the market, it can reduce volatility often associated with retail speculation. Drive Regulatory Clarity: Increased corporate participation often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure and predictable environment for digital assets. Accelerate Infrastructure Development: The demand from corporate entities for secure custody, trading, and reporting solutions will continue to spur innovation and development in the crypto infrastructure space. Ultimately, Smarter Web Company ‘s continued commitment to Bitcoin reflects a growing conviction among corporate leaders that digital assets are not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how value is stored and transferred in the 21st century. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Financial Strategy with Bitcoin The Smarter Web Company’s latest acquisition of 325 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 1,600 BTC, is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin ‘s growing role in corporate treasury management. This strategic move by a UK-based web development firm highlights a significant shift in how companies perceive and utilize digital assets, moving beyond speculative interest to a foundational component of their long-term financial health. As we’ve explored, the rationale behind such substantial corporate Bitcoin holdings is multifaceted, encompassing a desire for inflation hedging, diversification, and alignment with the digital future. SWC joins a distinguished list of forward-thinking companies that are leveraging Bitcoin to optimize their balance sheets and position themselves for future growth in an increasingly digital world. This trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption is a testament to the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. It signals a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into mainstream finance, offering new avenues for value creation and wealth preservation for businesses of all sizes. The Smarter Web Company’s actions serve as a compelling example for others considering the immense potential that crypto investment holds.

Announces Intent to Explore Proprietary USD-Backed Stablecoin Culver City, United States, July 16th, 2025, Chainwire Snail, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNAL) (“Snail Games” or the “Company”), a leading global independent developer and publisher of interactive digital entertainment, announced its intention to explore pursuing a strategic digital asset initiative that includes the evaluation and feasibility for introduction of its own proprietary stablecoin. This initiative would be subject to a range of factors, including but not limited to, regulatory approvals, market conditions, technical feasibility, cybersecurity safeguards, financial controls, and internal governance. The Company believes that exploring stablecoin infrastructure may position it as an early mover within the digital entertainment industry. While no decisions have been made to integrate such technology into the Company’s corporate strategy, it continues to evaluate and explore opportunities as part of its broader innovation roadmap. Recognizing the growing potential of crypto-based transactions in the digital entertainment and gaming industry, the Company is currently assessing the feasibility of developing and exploring its stablecoin with multiple external use cases, with no current timeline or commitment. To support this initiative, Snail Games has retained Dr. George Cao, an external consultant. Dr. Cao earned his PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Chicago and is the Founder and the Chief Executive Officer of AscendEX, a full-stack cryptocurrency financial platform that offers simple solutions for investing, trading, and earning to global users. In addition, the Company also retained seasoned legal advisors, including a nationally recognized law firm ranked by Chambers FinTech Legal USA as a leading firm serving cryptocurrency and blockchain clients. “This stablecoin exploration is a natural evolution of our innovation-led strategy and will support a broader effort to evaluate how blockchain-based technologies could be aligned with the Company’s long-term goal to be at the forefront of digital transformation in the entertainment space,” said Snail, Inc. co-CEO Hai Shi. “To support this initiative, we’ve engaged a nationally recognized law firm and a seasoned strategic advisor to support and guide the successful exploration of this opportunity. We are evaluating potential future phase hiring needs for professionals with specialized experience in blockchain, stablecoins, and digital asset strategy. While our focus continues to remain on gaming across our ARK franchise, indie titles, and other up-and-coming genres, this investigation into the crypto space and evaluation of the feasibility of launching our own stablecoin would mark a key step in advancing our vision of driving innovation across digital entertainment. We’re excited to share continued updates as we reach meaningful milestones in our evaluation.” About Snail, Inc. Snail, Inc.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.74452622 2.81% Market Cap $ 26,352,767,218.3811 Trading Volume $ 1,287,339,392.9237 Circulating Supply 35,395,351,625.8849 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 The Cardano price is trapped in a long bleeding range in the entire H1 2025, but showed signs of recovery in late June, triggered by the ceasefire in the Iran-Israel-US short-term war. Over the last 22 days, it has recovered nearly 47% from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector, by mid-July, the ADA price has broken out from the upper border of the declining wedge. With the growing hopes of an ADA ETF, rising institutional interest, and global sentiment rising as BTC jumped to a new ATH of $123,231. ADA has now pierced the 200-day EMA band and turned it into support. The current rally shows a sustained bullish momentum that could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch next is $0.83. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $1.10, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.32 by July end. Moreover, in the past 15-day span, Spot volume has peaked, active addresses (7d) have increased to 158.65K, and whale transactions are also pacing up. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum. However, failure to stay above $0.70 could send ADA back to $0.65, and $0.55 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. Technically, if ADA price intends for a long-term rally, then a break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. Another would be a global attraction in the sector with BTC continuing northward moves. Therefore, if ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year.

Lately, a significant tremor has been felt across the industry: a massive decline in centralized exchange volumes . In June, top centralized exchanges (CEXs) like MEXC, KuCoin, and Upbit experienced a dramatic drop of over 39% in their trading volumes compared to May. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a strong indicator of reduced retail crypto engagement, particularly in the Asian market. But what exactly is driving this downturn, and what does it mean for the future of crypto trading? Understanding the Alarming Drop in Crypto Trading Volumes When we talk about crypto trading volumes , we’re referring to the total amount of cryptocurrency traded on an exchange over a specific period. High volumes often indicate strong market interest and liquidity, while low volumes can signal a cooling-off period or a shift in investor sentiment. The recent data paints a clear picture of a market experiencing a significant slowdown on CEX platforms. According to BeInCrypto, citing a report by Wu Blockchain, the figures are quite stark: Binance , the world’s largest exchange, saw a notable 22% drop in its trading volume. MEXC experienced an even steeper decline of 44%. KuCoin followed closely with a 42% decrease. Upbit , a major player in South Korea, posted a 39% decline. This widespread reduction across multiple prominent exchanges suggests a systemic issue rather than an isolated incident. Here’s a quick overview of the declines: Exchange Volume Drop (June vs. May) MEXC 44% KuCoin 42% Upbit 39% Binance 22% Why the Decline? Unpacking Crypto Market Corrections and More The report attributes this significant downturn to a confluence of factors, with crypto market corrections being a primary driver. A market correction refers to a short-term price decline, typically 10-20%, from a recent peak. While healthy for long-term market stability, corrections can dampen investor enthusiasm and lead to reduced trading activity as participants adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach or pull back from riskier assets. Beyond market dynamics, other global influences are at play: Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global events, conflicts, and economic instability can significantly impact investor confidence across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. When the world feels uncertain, capital often flows into perceived safer havens, or simply stays on the sidelines. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Rising inflation, interest rate hikes, and fears of recession in major economies can reduce discretionary income and risk appetite, leading to less engagement in speculative markets like crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increasing regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges in various jurisdictions can create uncertainty for both exchanges and users, potentially leading to reduced activity. Is Reduced Retail Crypto Engagement a Cause for Concern? The drop in trading volumes is often directly linked to a decrease in retail crypto engagement . Retail investors, or individual traders, form a significant portion of the crypto market’s liquidity and activity. When they pull back, the market feels it. This reduced engagement can lead to: Lower Liquidity: Fewer buyers and sellers can make it harder to execute large trades without significant price impact. Increased Volatility: With less depth in the order books, even smaller trades can cause larger price swings. Slower Market Growth: New capital inflows are crucial for market expansion, and reduced retail interest can stifle this growth. While institutional adoption continues to grow, retail participation remains a vital component of the crypto ecosystem’s vibrancy and decentralization ethos. A sustained decline could signal a shift in the market’s structure or a period of consolidation. The Rise of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): A Capital Shift? One of the most intriguing aspects of the report is the suggestion of a shift of capital toward decentralized exchanges (DEXs) . DEXs operate without a central authority, allowing users to trade directly from their wallets. This offers several distinct advantages that are becoming increasingly appealing to users: Enhanced Privacy and Anonymity: DEXs typically do not require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, appealing to users who prioritize privacy. User Control Over Funds: Funds remain in the user’s wallet (non-custodial) throughout the trading process, reducing the risk of exchange hacks or freezes. Censorship Resistance: Being decentralized, DEXs are less susceptible to government or institutional censorship. Wider Token Selection: Many new and smaller tokens often list on DEXs before or instead of CEXs. While DEXs still face challenges like higher gas fees on some networks and a steeper learning curve for new users, their growing popularity indicates a maturing market where users are increasingly valuing self-custody and censorship resistance. This shift could be a long-term trend, reshaping how crypto assets are traded globally. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights for Traders For active traders and long-term investors, these trends offer crucial insights. Understanding the dynamics behind declining centralized exchange volumes and the rise of DEXs can inform your strategy: Diversify Your Trading Venues: If you’re primarily using CEXs, consider exploring DEXs like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, or Curve for certain types of trades, especially for newer tokens or if privacy is a concern. Stay Informed on Market Sentiment: Pay close attention to macroeconomic indicators, geopolitical news, and on-chain metrics that can signal shifts in retail engagement and overall market health. Prioritize Security and Self-Custody: The move towards DEXs reinforces the importance of self-custody. Learn how to securely manage your private keys and hardware wallets. Adjust Risk Management: In periods of lower liquidity and higher volatility, stricter risk management strategies become even more critical. Consider smaller position sizes or wider stop-losses. The market is always evolving, and adapting to these changes is key to navigating the crypto landscape successfully. The shift towards DEXs might also spur CEXs to innovate, perhaps by offering more non-custodial options or integrating DeFi features to retain users. The Road Ahead: Will CEXs Rebound or Will DEXs Dominate? The recent drop in crypto trading volumes on centralized exchanges is a significant development, but it doesn’t necessarily spell the end for CEXs. They still offer unparalleled user experience, fiat on-ramps, and a wide array of services like derivatives trading and lending that DEXs are still catching up on. However, the trend highlights the growing maturity and diversification of the crypto ecosystem. Users are becoming more sophisticated, demanding greater control and privacy. The interplay between CEXs and DEXs will likely continue to evolve, with both types of platforms coexisting and perhaps even integrating more closely. The June figures serve as a powerful reminder that the crypto market is not monolithic. It’s a complex interplay of technology, economics, human psychology, and global events. Keeping an eye on these underlying trends, especially the ebb and flow of retail crypto engagement and the steady rise of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) , will be crucial for anyone looking to understand where the market is headed next.

Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Kaspa: A New Era of Speed and Scalability in Cryptocurrency Kaspa is shaking up the crypto world with a fresh approach to blockchain technology. Instead of discarding blocks that are created at the same time, Kaspa's GHOSTDAG protocol lets them exist together and sorts them in order. This forms what's called a blockDAG, allowing the network to run securely while handling blocks at lightning speeds. Currently, Kaspa processes one block per second, but it's aiming for ten, and even dreaming of a hundred per second. This means transactions are confirmed almost instantly, only limited by internet speed. What makes Kaspa stand out are features like Reachability, which helps users explore the network's structure, and block data pruning to keep the blockchain size manageable. Plans for block header pruning and subnetwork support are on the horizon, making it easier to build advanced solutions on top of Kaspa. In today's market, where speed and scalability are more important than ever, Kaspa offers an attractive alternative to traditional coins like Bitcoin. Its innovative technology could place it at the forefront of the next wave of cryptocurrency development. Shiba Inu Coin: From Meme to Marvel – Is SHIB the Crypto to Watch? Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by the popular Dogecoin but with a twist. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, making it compatible with a vast array of decentralized applications. Created by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB began with a staggering one quadrillion tokens. SHIB's integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting developments. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, are already live. There's also talk of launching a platform for NFTs and implementing a governance system where holders have a say in decisions. This sets SHIB apart from other meme coins by offering real utility. In today's market, where investors are looking beyond memes to coins with potential applications, SHIB stands out. Sui: Transforming Blockchain with User-Friendly Innovations Sui is a new blockchain platform that's aiming to change the game. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable system designed for global use. At its heart, Sui uses a unique way of handling data, focusing on objects rather than traditional methods. It also uses a secure programming language called Move. Together, these features help solve common problems found in other blockchains. But Sui isn't just about strong technology. It also puts users first by making blockchain easier to use. With features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui makes blockchain applications more accessible and friendly. In the current market, where user experience is key, Sui stands out. While other coins focus on complex technical aspects, Sui's approach to simplifying blockchain could make it an attractive option. Is HBAR the Next Big Thing in Digital Transactions? Hedera Hashgraph is making waves with its unique approach to digital networks. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum that use blockchain, Hedera uses hashgraph technology. This makes it faster and more efficient. Without the need for mining, it's kinder to the environment. Transactions on Hedera are quick and cost less. HBAR is the network's own currency. It's used to pay for transactions and to keep the network secure through a system called Proof of Stake. Hedera promises a secure and speedy way to handle transactions and run smart contracts. It's aiming to make a mark in finance and other industries. But it's up against tough competition in the crypto world. Its patented technology means it's not open-source, which might limit community involvement. Even so, with big industry players backing it, there's hope for its future. TRX: The Crypto Coin Giving Power Back to Content Creators TRON (TRX) is a digital coin aiming to change how we share and enjoy online content. Started in 2017, TRX began as a token on the Ethereum network but soon moved to its own system. The big idea behind TRON is simple: let content creators fully own their work and earn more from it. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking a large slice, TRON allows fans to reward creators directly. This means artists, writers, and video makers can get fair pay for their efforts. TRON's network supports apps that run without central control, much like Ethereum but with some differences. One key feature is that TRON focuses on making transactions fast and free, encouraging more people to use it. In today's market, TRX stands out by empowering both users and creators. While coins like Bitcoin are seen more as digital gold, TRX has a clear purpose in the content world. Fetch.AI: Pioneering Decentralized AI for a Smarter Future Founded in 2017, Fetch.AI is an artificial intelligence lab aiming to create an open and permissionless machine learning network. Launched on Binance in March 2019, Fetch.AI uses crypto economics to democratize access to AI technology. Its network allows anyone to connect and access secure datasets using autonomous AI agents. These agents execute tasks by leveraging a global data network. Fetch.AI focuses on optimizing services like DeFi trading, transportation networks, smart energy grids, and travel systems—any complex digital system that relies on large-scale data. Looking at historical price movements and market trends, the Fetch.AI token (FET) shows interesting potential in the coming years. In the current market cycle, where AI and blockchain technologies are increasingly important, Fetch.AI stands out by combining both fields. Its approach to decentralized AI positions it uniquely among other coins. As demand for AI and secure data exchange grows, Fetch.AI could become a significant player in the future of decentralized technologies. Toncoin's Comeback: A New Contender in the Crypto Space Toncoin (TON) is catching the eye of crypto enthusiasts. Originally launched by Telegram as the ""Gram"" token, it faced hurdles when Telegram halted the project in 2020 due to legal issues. Now reborn as The Open Network and backed by the non-commercial TON Foundation and a passionate community, Toncoin is making a strong return. Operating on a proof-of-stake model, it promises fast and secure transactions with minimal fees. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows promising potential. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Toncoin's emphasis on real-world applications and network reliability sets it apart. In the current market cycle, where solid technology and practical use cases are highly valued, Toncoin is emerging as an exciting project to watch. JasmyCoin: Revolutionizing Data Ownership in the IoT World In a world where data is the new gold, JasmyCoin (JASMY) emerges as a pioneer empowering individuals to take control of their personal information. Developed by Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, this cryptocurrency project combines Internet of Things (IoT) technology with blockchain to create a secure platform for data exchange. By connecting service providers and data users, Jasmy enables a trustless environment where personal data can be safely shared between devices like computers, cars, and phones. JasmyCoin's potential lies in its unique approach to data democratization. By decentralizing data storage using technologies like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and leveraging edge computing, it ensures data is securely protected and owned by users. In the current market cycle, where data privacy concerns are at an all-time high, cryptocurrencies focusing on real-world applications like data security are gaining traction. Compared to other coins, Jasmy stands out with its specific focus on IoT devices and personal data management. VeChain: Bridging Physical Goods to the Digital World VeChain is making waves by bringing real-world products onto the blockchain. Founded by Sunny Lu, a former CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain aims to enhance transparency in supply chains across various industries like food, fashion, and automotive. It does this by assigning unique IDs and sensors to products, allowing detailed tracking from origin to consumer. This innovation helps verify authenticity and manage recalls, which is crucial for sectors like luxury goods and groceries. In 2018, VeChain launched its own blockchain, VeChainThor, introducing a dual-token system: VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction fees. In the current market, VeChain stands out due to its practical applications and partnerships with big names like Walmart China and BMW. While some cryptocurrencies focus solely on digital transactions, VeChain connects physical products with the blockchain, offering tangible utility. Its proof of authority consensus mechanism enhances transaction validation, setting it apart from other platforms. Despite lower staking rewards compared to some coins, VeChain offers opportunities for passive income. Conclusion While KAS, TRX, FET, and JASMY are promising, XYZVerse stands out by merging sports and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth through a community-driven movement.

One popular X user believes the meme coin will soon flip SHIB and become the second-biggest meme coin. PEPE on the Run The frog-themed meme coin has followed the overall rally of the cryptocurrency market in the past several days. Just a few hours ago, it spiked to $0.00001307, which represents a 27% weekly increase. PEPE Price, Source: CoinGecko PEPE’s market capitalization currently stands at around $5.5 billion, making it the 34th-largest cryptocurrency and the third-biggest in the meme coin sector. Some analysts believe the asset’s bull run is only starting. The X user Max thinks PEPE “is about to begin flying,” adding that “conviction has never been higher than right now.” $Pepe is about to begin flying. Conviction has never been higher than right now. This is exactly the same set up at Feb/March of 2024 except this time we have ETHBTC as a tailwind instead of a headwind. Look closely at my chart lines & their annotations. Same exact set up. https://t.co/bCVTezE32I pic.twitter.com/GdYigrUrFy — Max (@MaxBecauseBTC) July 15, 2025 The popular analyst, using the X moniker Nebraskangooner, also touched upon the meme coin, noting the formation of an “inverse head and shoulders” structure on its price chart. This is considered a bullish technical pattern that indicates additional gains in the short term. Jake Gagain described PEPE as the SHIB of this bull cycle. In his view, the most significant advantages of the frog-themed meme coin include its listing on most leading crypto exchanges and the sporadic support from Elon Musk. Gagain went even further, claiming that Shiba Inu has already had its “major run up,” predicting that PEPE could flip it in the near future . Currently, the gap between the two is less than $3 billion. The Indicators Less than a week ago, one whale identified as 0x06b3 purchased 227.8 billion PEPE tokens for approximately $2.7 million. Such actions are closely monitored by smaller players who could also decide to enter the ecosystem and distribute fresh capital. Accumulation from whales is bullish for another reason: it leaves fewer tokens available on the open market, which could propel a price pump (assuming demand doesn’t head south ). However, some metrics should be viewed by investors as warning signs. PEPE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has neared the bearish zone of 70, indicating that the price has risen too rapidly in a short period. PEPE RSI, Source: CryptoWaves Readings above that zone typically suggest that the asset is overbought and may be headed for a short-term pullback, while anything below 30 is considered bullish territory.

48348568,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=767014,1752668846,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48348568.jpeg,SEC commissioner removes head of the PCAOB,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-sec-head-dismisses-pcaob-head/,"Paul Atkins, the newly appointed chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, has removed Erica Williams from her role as head of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The decision brings an abrupt end to a reform-heavy tenure and marks a clear turn in Washington’s approach to market oversight. Williams, a former SEC lawyer and the first Black woman to lead the PCAOB, confirmed to staff on Tuesday that Atkins had asked her to step down. Her last day will be July 22. Her departure is more than just a change in leadership; it signals the rollback of a regulatory era built on stricter scrutiny of the auditing profession. In her farewell message, Williams didn’t mince words. She defended her push for higher audit standards, stressing that weakening the PCAOB’s authority would make investors more vulnerable at a time when economic uncertainty and corporate risk remain high. “With high economic uncertainty increasing the risk of fraud, the PCAOB’s mission is as important as ever,” she told staff. “It’s critical the expert PCAOB staff continue to be empowered to carry out their work of ensuring American investors are protected.” A regulator who raised the bar When Williams took the reins of the PCAOB in 2022, she championed new, more expansive auditing standards, sharpened the agency’s inspection process, and hit firms with record-setting penalties for misconduct. As tensions grew, industry voices grew louder, calling for the PCAOB to shift back to what they viewed as a more balanced, “collaborative” approach. That pushback soon reached Capitol Hill. Several Republican lawmakers launched efforts to fold the PCAOB into the SEC , essentially gutting the independent watchdog Congress created in 2002 after the Enron and WorldCom scandals shook public confidence in financial markets. While those proposals didn’t make it into the massive financial “big, beautiful bill” package, they set the stage for political pressure that has now come to a head. Atkins takes the wheel—and the knife Atkins, who was sworn in as SEC chair in April, is a familiar figure in financial regulation. A staunch advocate for limited government oversight and free markets, he’s wasted little time in remaking the SEC in Trump’s image. Since taking over, he’s walked back a raft of rules introduced under Biden-era SEC chief Gary Gensler , targeting everything from climate-related disclosures to private equity transparency. Williams’ removal fits a pattern. She’s the third PCAOB chair in a row to be ousted by a new SEC leader, following similar clean-outs under both Trump’s Jay Clayton and Biden’s Gary Gensler. It’s a tradition that reflects how closely the PCAOB’s direction now swings with the political pendulum. Though Atkins hasn’t publicly explained his decision, his recent remarks offer clues. He suggested that the SEC was capable of absorbing the PCAOB’s responsibilities, though he noted the agency would need more resources to do so. That comment raised eyebrows among audit watchdogs, who worry that rolling the PCAOB into the SEC would dilute its independence and weaken enforcement. What’s next for the PCAOB? While it remains legally intact, Williams’ departure has reignited fears among transparency advocates that the board’s days as a truly independent overseer are numbered. Even so, the agency is not without support. Williams’ tenure attracted strong backing from investor groups, international regulators, and academics who saw the board as a critical line of defense against weak corporate audits. In her final message, Williams thanked those who stood by the PCAOB during what she described as “a groundswell” of opposition. “Raising audit standards was never going to be easy,” she wrote, “but the stakes for market integrity demanded nothing less.” Meanwhile, efforts to formally eliminate the PCAOB continue to run into roadblocks. Last month, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that Republican proposals to abolish the board through budget reconciliation violated procedural rules, a blow to their chances of success, at least in the near term.

In a recent development that has captured the attention of the DeFi community, Mary-Catherine Lader, the esteemed President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Uniswap Labs , the driving force behind the pioneering decentralized exchange Uniswap, has announced her resignation. This news, shared personally by Lader on X, marks the end of an impactful four-year tenure and raises questions about the future trajectory of one of the most influential platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. A Legacy of Innovation: Mary-Catherine Lader’s Impact at Uniswap Labs Mary-Catherine Lader joined Uniswap Labs at a crucial time, helping to navigate its rapid growth and establish its position as a cornerstone of the DeFi space. Her role as President and COO was instrumental in shaping the company’s operational strategy, fostering partnerships, and advocating for the decentralized exchange model in an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. During her four years, Uniswap transformed from a promising protocol into a dominant force, processing trillions in trading volume and becoming a benchmark for decentralized trading. Strategic Growth: Lader was key in scaling Uniswap Labs’ operations, ensuring the team could support the exponential growth of the Uniswap protocol. Regulatory Engagement: She played a vital role in representing Uniswap Labs in discussions with policymakers and regulators, advocating for clear and sensible frameworks for DeFi. Product Development Oversight: Her leadership contributed to the successful launch and iteration of various Uniswap protocol versions, enhancing user experience and functionality. Team Building: Lader was instrumental in building and nurturing a robust and talented team at Uniswap Labs, fostering a culture of innovation and resilience. Her departure signifies not just a change in personnel, but potentially a shift in the strategic direction or focus for Uniswap Labs as it enters its next phase of development and adaptation. What Does This Leadership Change Mean for the Decentralized Exchange Landscape? The resignation of a high-profile executive like Mary-Catherine Lader from a leading entity like Uniswap Labs inevitably sends ripples across the entire decentralized exchange sector. Uniswap’s prominence means that any internal shifts are closely watched for their potential impact on market dynamics, liquidity, and regulatory sentiment. While the immediate operational impact might be minimal due to the decentralized nature of the Uniswap protocol itself, the leadership at Uniswap Labs is crucial for the protocol’s continued development, legal defense, and community engagement. The DeFi space thrives on innovation and adaptability, but also relies on strong, experienced leadership to navigate its unique challenges. Lader’s departure could prompt several considerations for the broader DEX ecosystem: Talent Mobility: It highlights the dynamic nature of crypto leadership , where top talent often moves between projects, bringing new perspectives and expertise. Succession Planning: It underscores the importance for major DeFi projects to have robust succession plans in place to ensure continuity and stability. Market Confidence: While Uniswap’s protocol is resilient, significant leadership changes can sometimes briefly impact investor and user confidence, though this is often short-lived for established protocols. This event is certainly a key piece of DeFi News that will be analyzed for its long-term implications. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Uniswap Labs With Mary-Catherine Lader moving on, Uniswap Labs faces both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in maintaining momentum and strategic direction without a key figure who has been central to its growth. The opportunities, however, are equally significant: new leadership can bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and renewed energy to tackle evolving market conditions and regulatory pressures. Challenges: Maintaining Regulatory Dialogue: Lader was a strong voice in regulatory discussions. Finding a successor with similar expertise and influence will be crucial. Intensifying Competition: The decentralized exchange landscape is increasingly competitive, with new DEXs and aggregators constantly emerging. Uniswap Labs must continue to innovate to stay ahead. Market Volatility: The crypto market remains highly volatile, requiring agile leadership to adapt strategies and manage risks effectively. Opportunities: Fresh Perspectives: A new COO or President could introduce novel strategies for growth, product development, and community engagement. Strategic Re-evaluation: This transition offers an opportunity for Uniswap Labs to re-evaluate its long-term goals and operational structures. Strengthening Decentralization: While Uniswap Labs is a centralized entity supporting a decentralized protocol, leadership changes can sometimes prompt deeper discussions about progressive decentralization of control and governance. The ability of Uniswap Labs to seamlessly transition and continue its trajectory will be a testament to its organizational strength and the robustness of the Uniswap protocol itself. This is not just internal news for Uniswap, but a significant event in broader DeFi News . The Broader Context of Crypto Leadership Transitions: What’s Next for Mary-Catherine Lader? The crypto industry has seen numerous high-profile leadership transitions, reflecting its dynamic and often turbulent nature. Executives move between projects, launch new ventures, or step back to explore different avenues. Mary-Catherine Lader ‘s decision to start ‘something new’ is a common narrative in this space, often indicating a desire to tackle fresh challenges or innovate in emerging areas. While her next steps are not yet public, her extensive experience in traditional finance, coupled with her deep understanding of decentralized finance, positions her uniquely for future endeavors. Her move could involve: Launching a new DeFi project or startup. Joining a venture capital firm focused on Web3. Taking on a leadership role in another established crypto company. Focusing on regulatory advocacy or policy development for the broader crypto industry. Her influence and insights will undoubtedly continue to shape the future of digital assets, regardless of her next professional home. Her departure is a prime example of the fluidity and evolution within crypto leadership . Concluding Thoughts: A New Era for Uniswap and DeFi Mary-Catherine Lader’s departure from Uniswap Labs marks a significant moment for one of DeFi’s most pivotal organizations. Her contributions over the past four years have been immense, helping to solidify Uniswap’s position as the leading decentralized exchange . While her absence will certainly be felt, the robust nature of the Uniswap protocol and the talented team at Uniswap Labs are well-positioned to continue their mission of fostering open, permissionless financial systems. This event serves as a reminder of the continuous evolution within the crypto space, where innovation, adaptation, and leadership transitions are par for the course. As the industry matures, the ability of projects like Uniswap to attract, retain, and transition top crypto leadership will be critical to their long-term success. The DeFi community will keenly watch what unfolds next for both Lader and Uniswap Labs, as this piece of DeFi News sets the stage for future developments.

PayPal, a name synonymous with online payments, has just made a significant one, poised to redefine accessibility and efficiency for its digital currency users. The latest update to PayPal’s Cryptocurrency Terms and Conditions, quietly updated on July 16, reveals a crucial expansion for its native stablecoin, PYUSD. Beyond its existing presence on the Ethereum network and Solana network , PYUSD now officially embraces Arbitrum support . This isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a strategic enhancement that could profoundly impact how users interact with PayPal crypto and the broader stablecoin ecosystem. PayPal’s Bold Move: Embracing Arbitrum Support for PYUSD The announcement that PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin is now supported on Arbitrum is a testament to the increasing demand for scalable and cost-effective blockchain solutions. For those new to the space, Arbitrum is a leading Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution built on top of Ethereum. Think of Ethereum as a bustling superhighway that can sometimes get congested, leading to higher tolls (gas fees) and slower speeds. Arbitrum acts like a dedicated fast lane, processing transactions off the main highway and then bundling them efficiently back onto Ethereum. This dramatically reduces transaction costs and increases speed, making it far more practical for everyday use. Why is this Arbitrum support so significant for PYUSD? Here’s a quick breakdown: Reduced Transaction Costs: One of the biggest hurdles for widespread crypto adoption has been the high gas fees on popular networks like Ethereum. Arbitrum slashes these costs, making micro-transactions and frequent transfers of PYUSD far more affordable. Increased Transaction Speed: While Ethereum can handle a certain number of transactions per second, Arbitrum can process thousands. This means faster confirmations for PYUSD transfers, enhancing user experience. Enhanced Scalability: As PayPal’s stablecoin potentially sees wider adoption, the underlying network needs to handle a massive volume of transactions without faltering. Arbitrum provides the necessary scalability to support a growing user base. Broader Accessibility: By expanding to Arbitrum, PYUSD becomes accessible to a wider array of decentralized applications (dApps) and users already active within the Arbitrum ecosystem, fostering greater interoperability. This strategic decision highlights PayPal’s commitment to not just entering the crypto space but actively participating in its evolution by leveraging cutting-edge scaling solutions. It’s a clear signal that they understand the practical needs of crypto users. Decoding PYUSD: PayPal’s Stablecoin and Its Multi-Chain Foundation To truly appreciate the significance of Arbitrum integration, let’s first understand what PYUSD stablecoin is and how it operates. Launched in August 2023, PYUSD is a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. This means that, in theory, one PYUSD will always be redeemable for one U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value, making them ideal for payments, remittances, and as a store of value without the dramatic price swings. Crucially, PayPal’s Cryptocurrency Terms and Conditions explicitly state that PYUSD is issued by Paxos Trust Company , not PayPal itself. Paxos is a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform and a regulated stablecoin issuer. This arrangement provides a layer of trust and regulatory compliance, as Paxos is subject to oversight by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This distinction is vital; while PayPal facilitates the access and use of PYUSD for its vast user base, the underlying issuance and reserves management are handled by a dedicated, regulated entity. Before Arbitrum, PYUSD was primarily available on the Ethereum network and the Solana network . Let’s briefly look at these foundational networks: Network Characteristics Role for PYUSD Ethereum Network The largest and most established smart contract platform; robust security, vast developer ecosystem, but can face high fees and congestion. Primary settlement layer for many stablecoins, offering unparalleled security and decentralization. Solana Network Known for its extremely high transaction throughput and low fees; designed for speed and scalability, though it has faced occasional network outages. Provides a fast and cost-effective alternative for users prioritizing speed for transactions. Arbitrum Network A leading Layer 2 scaling solution built on Ethereum; offers significantly lower fees and faster transactions than Ethereum mainnet. Enhances practical usability and broadens reach within the thriving Ethereum L2 ecosystem. The decision to deploy PYUSD across multiple blockchains from the outset, and now to expand with Arbitrum support , underscores a strategic vision. It acknowledges that no single blockchain can serve all purposes perfectly. By offering PYUSD on different networks, PayPal and Paxos are catering to diverse user needs and preferences, from the robust security of Ethereum to the lightning-fast speeds of Solana, and now the cost-efficiency and scalability of Arbitrum. What This Means for PayPal Crypto Users and Beyond For the millions of individuals who already engage with PayPal crypto services, this integration unlocks a new realm of possibilities. While PayPal has been steadily expanding its crypto offerings, allowing users to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies, the introduction of PYUSD was a significant step towards enabling actual crypto payments and transfers. With Arbitrum now in the mix, the practical utility of PYUSD for everyday transactions gets a massive boost. Consider the typical user scenario: you want to send PYUSD to a friend, pay for a service, or engage with a DeFi application. On the Ethereum mainnet, even a small transaction could incur fees that make it impractical for routine use. On Arbitrum, those fees plummet, making PYUSD a genuinely viable option for more frequent and smaller-value transactions. This move is not just about technology; it’s about usability and expanding the real-world applications of a stablecoin backed by a financial giant like PayPal. Beyond individual users, this development has broader implications for the stablecoin market and institutional adoption of blockchain technology: Increased Stablecoin Utility: As more stablecoins become available on L2 solutions, their utility as a medium of exchange grows exponentially. This move by PayPal pushes the entire industry forward. Validation for Layer 2s: A major financial player like PayPal adopting an L2 solution like Arbitrum provides significant validation for the technology, potentially encouraging other institutions to follow suit. Competitive Edge: In a crowded stablecoin market, offering multi-chain support with a focus on efficiency can be a key differentiator for PYUSD, attracting users who prioritize low costs and fast transactions. Future-Proofing: By building a multi-chain presence, PayPal is positioning PYUSD to be resilient and adaptable to the evolving blockchain landscape, ensuring it remains relevant regardless of which network gains prominence. The goal is clear: make stablecoins as easy and inexpensive to use as traditional digital payments, and PayPal is taking concrete steps to achieve this. Navigating the Digital Frontier: Opportunities and Challenges for PYUSD While the addition of Arbitrum support presents immense opportunities for PYUSD stablecoin , it’s also important to consider the broader landscape of challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for PayPal in the crypto space. The digital asset frontier is constantly shifting, marked by technological innovation, regulatory scrutiny, and fierce competition. Opportunities: Expanding Global Reach: Stablecoins, particularly those backed by major currencies like the USD, have the potential to revolutionize cross-border payments by offering faster, cheaper alternatives to traditional remittance services. PayPal’s global footprint positions PYUSD strongly in this area. DeFi Integration: With Arbitrum support, PYUSD becomes more deeply integrated into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This could lead to new use cases within lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols, attracting a new segment of users. Merchant Adoption: As PayPal continues to integrate crypto capabilities, the increased efficiency of PYUSD on Arbitrum could make it a more attractive option for merchants looking to accept digital payments, potentially reducing processing fees and settlement times. Innovation Catalyst: PayPal’s active participation in the blockchain space can spur further innovation, not just within its own offerings but across the entire industry, encouraging more mainstream companies to explore crypto solutions. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving globally. Different jurisdictions may impose varying rules, which could impact PYUSD’s operations and adoption. Maintaining compliance across diverse legal frameworks will be crucial. Competition: The stablecoin market is highly competitive, with established players like USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin) dominating. PYUSD needs to continually demonstrate unique value propositions, such as its deep integration with PayPal’s existing user base, to carve out significant market share. Network Fragmentation: While multi-chain support is beneficial, it can also lead to network fragmentation, where liquidity is spread across different chains. Ensuring seamless bridging and user experience across Ethereum network , Solana network , and Arbitrum will be key. Technological Risks: Despite their benefits, L2 solutions and blockchain networks, in general, are not without risks, including potential smart contract vulnerabilities or network congestion. Ongoing security audits and robust infrastructure are paramount. PayPal’s move to embrace Arbitrum demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing some of these challenges, particularly around scalability and cost, while positioning itself to capitalize on future opportunities. A New Era for Digital Payments: The Lasting Impression PayPal’s quiet but impactful update, confirming Arbitrum support for its PYUSD stablecoin , marks a significant milestone in the journey towards mainstream digital asset adoption. By leveraging advanced Layer 2 scaling solutions, PayPal is not just adding another chain; it’s enhancing the practical utility and accessibility of its stablecoin for millions of users worldwide. This strategic expansion across the Ethereum network , Solana network , and now Arbitrum, positions PYUSD as a versatile and efficient digital dollar, ready for the demands of modern commerce. This move underscores a broader trend: the convergence of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology. As more financial giants like PayPal embrace the benefits of decentralized networks, we can expect to see a continued evolution in how we conduct transactions, manage our finances, and interact with digital value. For PayPal crypto users, this means a smoother, faster, and more affordable experience, paving the way for stablecoins to truly fulfill their promise as a cornerstone of the future of money.

Over the past two weeks, Ripple’s token has broken out from long-standing patterns against both USD and BTC, shifting market structure and flipping critical resistances into support. The breakout is not only technical, it’s aggressive, with surging momentum and elevated RSI levels, hinting at the return of speculation and perhaps early signs of a narrative forming around XRP again. But how sustainable is this rally? Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair The XRPUSDT chart is showing a powerful breakout above $2.30 after months of sideways action. The price broke out of a falling wedge pattern that had been forming since late 2024. The wedge breakout was accompanied by a strong bullish candle that closed well above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, both located around the $2.30 zone. XRP is now pushing into a major resistance area at $3.00, a zone that previously acted as a supply ceiling multiple times during the past year. The rally has been sharp, and the RSI has entered extremely overbought territory at 80. Historically, such RSI spikes have led to corrections or sideways consolidation before continuation. As long as XRP holds above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages in the coming days, the path toward $3.40 and even $4.00 opens up. However, a close below the MAs could trigger profit-taking and drag the price back below $2.00. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair also confirms this momentum shift. The price has broken out of a falling wedge structure and flipped the key 2,200 SAT range into support. This is significant, as XRP had been trending downward against BTC for the majority of 2025. The breakout invalidates the bearish market structure and suggests a new trend phase could be developing. Currently sitting around 2,500 SAT, XRP/BTC is testing its 200-day moving average and is trying to make higher highs and higher lows above it. Moreover, the RSI on this pair is also overbought at 83, suggesting the rally may be overextended in the short term. The next significant resistance lies around 3,100 SAT, a zone that acted as a major distribution region during XRP’s last bullish leg. If XRP/BTC can consolidate above the 2,400 SAT level, the buyers will likely aim for this zone in the next impulse.

Ethereum is a significant investment, but some new tokens besides ETH have a high probability of experiencing substantial growth in 2025. Today, in this article, we will identify six crypto coins to watch, which have the potential to surpass Ethereum and generate substantial profits as the market around them continues to develop. Little Pepe ( LILPEPE ) The meme coin Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is gaining popularity quickly. Surprisingly, LILPEPE is not only a viral hyped project like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), but it also utilizes a Layer-2 blockchain as its underlying technology, which enables its strong scalability, fast speeds, and low fees. By creating its Pepe Pump Pad, LILPEPE provides meme token developers with the option to ensure their tokens are secure by implementing liquidity locks and anti-rug pull protocols, thereby offering safer and more sustainable investments. And it is already on CoinMarketCap, stirring up the crypto community as LILPEPE has raised over $5.3 million in its ongoing presale. LILPEPE is currently available at a price of $0.0014 as of writing; later in 2026, it can increase by 3500%, making it one of the most likely meme coins to become a hot topic in 2025. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera (HBAR) is a high-performance, business-grade network that enables fast transactions at low costs. Hedera is more scalable and efficient compared to Ethereum because it utilizes a hashgraph consensus algorithm, as opposed to a proof-of-work consensus model. As the number of enterprises using it continues to surge, HBAR's distinct, proprietary consensus system is poised for a significant growth in 2025, particularly in financial services applications and supply chains. By being more cost-effective, companies will seek the services of Hedera, which is strategically positioned to attract market share and deliver excellent returns. As of July 11, 2025, HBAR has an exchange rate of $0.1981. It is the only blockchain with the prospect of being among the top blockchain winners in 2025, largely due to its unique Hashgraph technology and expanding enterprise partnerships. Fartcoin (FART) Fartcoin (FART) is a meme token that has gained popularity due to its humorous branding and community support. Although numerous meme coins are deeply rooted in viral patterns, Fartcoin has been a topic of discussion because of the presence of more fan reports and a transient market. The price of FART is currently trading at $r1.27. In 2021, the fastest-rising altcoin was Fartcoin. Fartcoin is reportedly the most prominent and notorious meme-based cryptocurrency. While Fartcoin has one of the smallest market capitalizations, it manages to break above the $ 1 billion market cap barrier and fast-tracks into the limelight for a growing population. Such wide-reaching following and unique magnetism would likely see FART evolving dramatically by 2025. Bonk (BONK) Bonk (BONK) has already become one of the highly discussed meme coins within the crypto environment. BONK was initially presented as a Solana-based currency, but since that time has spread to the area of other specialized blockchain networks, and its popularity attracted the general audience due to its cheap cost and virality. On July 11, 2025, BONK is being traded at $0.000022. Compared to other coins, BONK still has a relatively low market capitalization and may experience explosive growth in 2025 as the meme coin market develops. It has a significantly large community and future events that make it a serious participant in the 2025 crypto rally. TRON (TRX) Tron (TRX) is a decentralized platform based on Blockchain and oriented towards DeFi solutions and digital content. Tron is also one of the most scalable blockchains for decentralized applications (dApps) and is characterized by high throughput and low transaction costs. With a current price of $0.3011, Tron has experienced massive growth over the last few years, and with the DeFi boom not showing signs of slowing down, TRX is expected to enjoy an enormous price surge in 2025. In 2025, Tron can also exceed expectations, including meeting minimum charges, facilitating fast transfers, and fostering more collaborations. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) is another blockchain designed to provide low-cost and speedy cross-border payments. The intention was to make a mark in cross-border payments through partnerships with heavyweights such as IBM and MoneyGram, as well as others in the financial system domain. As of July 11, 2025, the price of XLM is $0.3695. XLM has real-life applications and is increasingly being accepted by financial players. It is thus likely to perform well in 2025, making it one of the brightest cryptocurrencies to invest in, as it provides investors seeking price growth with a perfect medium to do so. Why LILPEPE Is the Go-to Buy in 2025 Although all these coins have huge growth opportunities in 2025, LILPEPE stands out due to its practical use and Layer-2 scalability. This is why the LILPEPE is the best purchase: Layer-2 Blockchain: LILPEPE offers speedy transactions and low transaction fees, making it a better solution than Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains for the use of DeFi and NFT products. Practical Usership: LILPEPE is a sensible use case with in-the-real-world infrastructure serving as a launchpad for meme tokens, featuring liquidity locks and anti-rug pull capabilities. This qualifies it as a safer and more sustainable investment as compared to a majority of meme coins. Huge Potential Upside: LILPEPE is vastly undervalued, currently trading at only 0.0014, with far more growth potential than other well-known meme coins, such as SHIB. LILPEPE raised more than $5.3 million in presale funds, which makes the idea expected to experience an explosion in 2025. Where to purchase LILPEPE To reap this high-potential investment, here is how to purchase LILPEPE: Get MetaMask or Trust Wallet Fund your wallet with ETH or USDT (ERC-20) Check out the presale website of LILPEPE Connect your wallet and buy your LILPEPE token The price of LILPEPE will increase as the presale goes on; the faster you invest, the more you will be rewarded. Conclusion: LILPEPE vs. ETH. Does anyone have any chance in 2025? Although Ethereum (ETH) is also one of the options to consider when looking at a long-term perspective, LILPEPE has enormous growth potential in 2025. With a Layer-2 blockchain, a real-world use case, and a community behind it, LILPEPE can easily surpass SHIB, DOGE, and even ETH in terms of price and market demand. LILPEPE offers the most suitable risk-reward opportunity for those interested in maximizing returns in 2025. With a low price, real infrastructure, and multibag returns potential, LILPEPE is poised to deliver 10,000%+ returns before 2025.

48351732,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=404558,1752673497,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/48351732.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bullish Momentum Returns After Recent Correction, Is $140K Next?",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bullish-momentum-returns-after-recent-correction-is-140k-next/,"Bitcoin is currently trading around $119K after reaching a new all-time high above $123K just days ago. This historic breakout has come with aggressive momentum, flipping prior resistance levels into strong support. The overall structure remains bullish, but recent price action shows early signs of a potential short-term exhaustion. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC has respected its macro bullish channel and just broke out from a large bull flag formation that had been developing for several weeks. This continuation pattern came after a steep rally from the April lows around 75K and was followed by a clean breakout above the 108K resistance zone. Once BTC cleared that level, momentum accelerated rapidly, with the price pushing through the key 114K resistance level and tapping $123K, forming new all-time highs. The bullish structure remains intact, with higher highs and higher lows forming clearly. BTC is now sitting below the dotted trendline that marks the midline of the multi-month ascending channel. This midline zone could be the target of this price rally, as the market might reach and test it around $140K. Another critical observation on the daily chart is the confluence between the breakout and the moving averages. The asset is holding well above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are slowly curving upward. This suggests strong underlying demand and trend continuation. If BTC does retrace, the 110K zone stands out as the primary support block, not only due to recent price memory but also because it aligns with recent major highs. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in on the 4-hour timeframe, BTC is testing the $118K–$119K bearish fair value gap, which is now acting as resistance. After the sharp rally toward $121K, the price has pulled back modestly, forming a small range just under the bearish FVG. The RSI has also cooled down from overbought levels and now sits around 58, suggesting there’s still room for more upside in the short term. However, the recent rejection from the $123K highs shows that some local resistance is forming. This could lead to short-term distribution unless bulls reclaim this bearish FVG convincingly. Yet, below the current price, several clean bullish FVGs exist, starting at $114K and extending down to $111K. These are prime zones to watch for long setups if BTC dips further. They mark strong, unmitigated demand areas where the price rallied impulsively with little resistance. A drop into these zones, followed by bullish price action (like a sweep and reclaim), would offer high-probability continuation opportunities toward 125K and beyond. Sentiment Analysis Bitcoin Retail Activity Surge One of the most telling on-chain signals right now is the surge in retail trading activity, as measured by the Bitcoin Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency indicator. This metric evaluates the relative increase in retail participation based on changes from the one-year moving average. Historically, surges in this metric, especially when it turns red, have coincided with major pivots, mostly indicating overheated conditions and excessive euphoria. Right now, the chart is not showing red signals, meaning retail participation is still average. This indicates that retail traders and investors are yet to flood the market and chase the price, at least not to the extent that they have during previous all-time highs. This suggests that the price could still rise sustainably if other factors, especially the futures market metrics, remain stable.

Martinez noted that XRP is showing renewed strength on the weekly chart, emphasizing that breaching $3 would serve as the key catalyst for a breakout to new highs at $4.9, he said in an X post on July 16. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analysis highlighted that XRP has repeatedly tested the $3 mark since early 2025 but has consistently failed to close above it, reinforcing its role as a major resistance level. However, recent price action shows a shift in momentum, with XRP forming higher lows since bottoming near $1.90 in April. The steep rally into mid-July, which saw XRP briefly reclaim $3, suggests strong buying interest, putting the token on the brink of a critical breakout. Now, if buyers can push the price above $3 and hold it through the weekly close, the setup would confirm a bullish continuation, targeting $4.80, which is nearly 60% above current levels. XRP fundamentals Overall, XRP has been on a bullish run in line with broader market sentiment, driven by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rally to a record high above $123,000. This momentum has helped XRP reclaim its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The rally also follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision in late June to drop its appeal in the long-running case against Ripple, ending four years of legal uncertainty. Both parties are now exploring a settlement pending court approval. Adding to the optimism, Ripple applied on July 2 for a federal bank charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, signaling an ambitious move into regulated financial services. Investor interest is also rising, with eleven asset managers filing for spot XRP ETFs and ProShares launching leveraged products tied to the token. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.96, up 3% on the day and nearly 24% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The price is well above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.29 and 200-day SMA near $1.80, confirming strong bullish momentum. However, with a 14-day RSI of 80.62 signaling extreme overbought conditions, the market risks a short-term pullback that could limit its ability to break and hold above the key $3 level decisively.

Despite a recent 5.3% drop to $157.63, Solana ranks among the most widely talked-about cryptocurrencies. However, a couple of lesser-known tokens are sneaking up quietly and might even outdo Solana’s performance. There is one project called Remittix (RTX) that is showing tremendous growth potential and practical application. Early-stage crypto investors are taking notice. Solana Price Prediction and Market Sentiment Solana Price Prediction recently states that a breakout rally can propel SOL to levels of more than $300 in 2025, driven by its dominance in the NFT and DeFi sectors. Solana’s market capitalization of $84.51B and high $6.04B trading volume signify that investor faith is high even during short-term corrections. Experts are hopeful due to Solana’s fast transaction times, low gas prices, and growing adoption as a Layer 2 Ethereum alternative. Its popularity within decentralized exchanges and GameFi has made SOL one of the top crypto to invest in today. But other traders are betting big on newer and more agile altcoins with great potential. Stellar and the Quiet Comeback Another prominent off-the-radar altcoin is Stellar (XLM). At $0.4428, Stellar has dropped 5.54%, yet fundamentals remain intact. The emphasis of the network on cross-border payments puts it in the game, big time, in international finance. With a market value of $13.75B and over $1.89B value traded, Stellar is often compared to Ripple. Traders are referring to it as a crypto with real utility, especially as central banks ponder stablecoin partnerships. Despite that, even Stellar’s projections seem dim in comparison to what is brewing with Remittix (RTX). Why Remittix Could Head the 1500% Club Remittix (RTX) is shaping up to be one of the year’s top DeFi projects. It solves a huge pain point—enabling users to send crypto straight to bank accounts in 30+ countries. With Q3 2025 wallet launch on the horizon, hype is picking up momentum fast. Token value is just $0.0811, with $16.2M+ already raised and 553M+ tokens sold. RTX is one of the best crypto under $1. RTX is both cheap and practical, thus the next 100x crypto. Why Remittix Is Gathering Momentum: Real crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries Audited by CertiK — extremely high trust factor Wallet with FX conversion coming live this quarter 50% bonus tokens for early buyers now live $250,000 giveaway building gigantic FOMO 3 Altcoins, 1 Bull Cycle While the Solana Price Prediction is necessitating healthy upside, new altcoins like Remittix are drawing smart money on real-world use cases and strong tokenomics. XLM is stable, yet RTX has explosive upside and solves a real-world $19T payment problem. With presales already launched in crypto, no surprise that RTX is said to be the top crypto presale of 2025. For people who want to buy RTX tokens before listings take effect, the chance may expire sooner than expected.

Top traders are saying it’s the next Shiba Inu or Pepe. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the first meme currency that combines meme appeal with real usefulness. It achieves this by utilizing its own Layer 2 blockchain. With a presale price of only $0.0014 for Stage 5, early investors are already poised to make a substantial profit. Many analysts believe that investing $400 now could increase to $100,000 or more by 2026, as Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) gains traction before major exchange listings and the next meme coin bull run. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): A Meme Coin with Real Utility and Layer-2 Speed Little Pepe is constructing the first Layer-2 blockchain specifically for meme currencies, which differs from other meme coins that rely solely on hype. It has very low gas expenses, instant finality, security against sniper bots, and a safe place to launch memes. This infrastructure makes Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) a real utility token, not merely a fad. Little Pepe aims to be the Ethereum of meme currencies, but faster and cheaper, by focusing on meme culture and addressing key issues with blockchain technology. Little Pepe is a micro-cap gem at the moment, and the presale price is less than $0.002. Investors can buy more than 200,000 tokens for about $400. If Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) reaches $0.50 by 2026, which is a plausible goal based on historical meme coin rallies, you may profit more than $100,000. This is one of the most asymmetric high-reward plays on the market right now. Even a slight climb to $0.10 would bring in $20,000. People who got in on Shiba Inu and PEPE early on saw similar life-changing results. Traders believe that Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) could do even better. The team is creating a robust DeFi environment built around memes, encompassing everything from staking to token launches and cross-chain integrations. Little Pepe differs significantly from DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE, as it possesses both cultural and practical value. Game-Changing Features: Anti-Sniper Protection and Meme Launchpad Little Pepe presents Anti-Sniper Bot Technology, which stops bots from front-running releases on its blockchain. This prevents big wallets and automated systems from taking advantage of presales and listings, ensuring that all investors, especially retail buyers, have a fair chance. Another great feature is the Meme Launchpad. This decentralized platform enables anyone to create their meme token fairly, thereby increasing volume and innovation within the Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) ecosystem. Every launch creates demand for transactions, making tokens more valuable and the network busier. Backed by Experts, Listed on CoinMarketCap Already Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is not just a random community token. Anonymous specialists with extensive expertise in developing popular meme initiatives are behind it. Few meme currencies can claim to have a track record that lends legitimacy and strategic advice to the project. Additionally, CoinMarketCap has already confirmed the Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) listing. These listings will make a significant difference in liquidity and exposure; therefore, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) won’t remain a hidden gem for long. The crew is also targeting the largest exchange platforms in the world. These stats aren’t made up. SHIB also went up a lot. PEPE did it in a few months. However, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) possesses both meme power and practical usefulness, which suggests it might rise even higher and remain there for longer. Little Pepe’s community is rapidly expanding across X, Telegram, and Discord, with thousands of new members joining each week. The community was what drove the development of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, and Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is already attracting more people to its early stages. Staking, NFT integrations, DAO voting, and launchpad incentives are all part of the roadmap. Each milestone adds more utility and demand for the token, which is a feature that most meme coins lack. Conclusion Little Pepe is quietly becoming the best Layer 2 and meme token hybrid, even as Solana, XRP, and Cardano receive all the attention. It’s still early, it’s affordable, and it incorporates actual technology. When traders and analysts compare Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) to early SHIB and PEPE, it becomes evident that this coin could be the biggest crypto moonshot of 2025. This might be your second-best chance if you missed the last meme explosion.

48352393,271361,1752673698,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/48352393.jpeg,The Sandbox Launches Largest LAND Sale to Date on GBM Auctions,https://chainwire.org/2025/07/16/the-sandbox-launches-largest-land-sale-to-date-on-gbm-auctions/,"London, United Kingdom, July 16th, 2025, Chainwire Over 110 LANDs and 220 avatars go live in the metaverse’s most IP-rich auction to date, all powered by GBM’s Win-Win protocol. The Sandbox , the leading social gaming metaverse, is partnering exclusively once again, with GBM Auctions to launch its largest set of auctions for LAND to date. The drop includes 110 LANDs (including 4 Estates exclusive to this sale) and 220 branded avatars across 22 IPs, all distributed via GBM Auctions' Win-Win auction protocol. In a first for The Sandbox, auctions will precede its own platform sale, highlighting a shift in how LAND is brought to market and underscoring GBM’s role as the auction layer for Web3-native asset distribution. A Fairer and More Transparent Way to Buy LAND Traditional NFT sales often reward speed or capital, using first-come-first-serve mechanics or gas wars. GBM’s Win-Win model changes the experience by rewarding every participant rather than just the final buyer. With GBM’s Win-Win auction model, even outbid participants are rewarded. Every bid: Is fully refunded if outbid Comes with an incentive reward based on auction mechanics Contributes to true, onchain price discovery The Win-Win model flips the typical auction dynamic on its head. Instead of punishing latecomers or smaller bidders, it turns participation itself into a value-generating act, transforming auctions from winner-takes-all battles into high-engagement, trustless events where every bid matters and every bidder benefits. “We’re thrilled to bring this expanded LAND auction to our community for the Training Grounds LAND sale through GBM.

Total trading volume across the top 10 exchanges reached $21.6 trillion despite declining 6.16%. Binance held a 35.39% market share, while five exchanges posted gains. Crypto market capitalization rebounded to $3.46 trillion, marking 28.2% quarterly growth. Binance maintains dominant position Binance held 35.39% trading volume share in Q2 2025, marking a slight decline from Q1. The exchange dropped 1.18% from the previous quarter’s 36.57% market share. Nevertheless, Binance remained the only exchange consistently capturing over one-third of market share. OKX secured second position with 14.34% market share, posting 1.08% quarter-on-quarter growth. The exchange increased from 13.26% in Q1 2025, showing steady market expansion. Bybit maintained third position with 12.20%, declining 0.80% from the previous quarter. Bitget held 11.45% market share with 0.14% growth from Q1’s 11.31% position. MEXC posted an 11.45% share, declining 1.58% from 13.03% in Q1 2025. Gate achieved the largest market share increase, rising 2.55% to 7.95%. Source: TokenInsight BingX recorded 2.17% market share, a 0.17% decline from Q1 levels. HTX maintained 2.64% share, posting 0.51% growth quarter-on-quarter. Coinbase held 1.06% market share, declining 0.62% from the previous quarter. KuCoin maintained a 1.29% market share with 0.05% growth from its Q1 position. Five exchanges saw market share growth during the Q2 2025 period. Gate led gains followed by OKX with substantial quarter-on-quarter improvements. Total trading volume reached $21.6 trillion across the top 10 exchanges combined. The volume declined 6.16% from Q1 despite Bitcoin’s recovery to $106,000 by the end of the quarter. Market conditions drive trading volume decline Bitcoin rose from $83,000 to peak at $111,900, ending the quarter near $106,000. Most other assets saw limited recovery, with altcoins experiencing sharp liquidity drops. Trading activity declined across many alternative cryptocurrencies during the quarter. Crypto market capitalization rebounded to approximately $3.46 trillion by Q2’s end. The recovery marked a 28.2% quarter-on-quarter increase following Q1’s deep correction. ETF product inflows and Bitcoin rally primarily drove market recovery. Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and improving employment data supported sentiment. However, geopolitical tensions and sluggish global growth limited a broader rebound. Ongoing macro uncertainty and slow regulatory progress weighed on activity. Cautious investor sentiment continued affecting trading volumes across exchanges consistently. For the second consecutive quarter, the market’s volume performance declined. Volumes could stay low in the absence of robust inflows or new policy support. In the first quarter, spot trade volume was $51 billion per day; now, it is $40 billion. Spot trading totaled $3.63 trillion, a 21.7% decrease from $4.6 trillion in Q1. Derivatives trading stats fell 3.6% from the previous quarter to $20.2 trillion. The average daily trade of derivatives decreased from $233 billion to $226 billion. Exchange tokens showed mixed performance Exchange tokens showed mixed performance in Q2 2025 with all major tokens underperforming Bitcoin . Bitcoin gained 31.62% while exchange tokens failed to show similar momentum. BNB recorded the highest gain among exchange tokens at 8.91% quarterly. OKB, BGB, and KCS posted modest increases during the quarter. Most other major exchange tokens experienced declines across the timeframe. Exchange token performance remained closely tied to struggling altcoin market conditions. Bitcoin rallied strongly, backed by spot ETF inflows and regulatory clarity. Exchange tokens failed to benefit from the same institutional momentum. During Q2, there was a noticeable drop in altcoin market trading activity and liquidity. Exchange token performance from TokenInsight In Q2 2025, spot trading share continued to fall on most exchanges. With a 2.70% gain in spot share, MEXC had the biggest growth, followed by Bitget. In the face of uncertainty, traders continued to choose high-frequency derivatives trading in Q1. The goal of trading derivatives was to leverage market volatility and manage risks. The pattern showed that spot markets had a more severe decline than derivatives. Binance maintained its leading open interest position with a 23.83% average market share. The exchange increased 0.36% from Q1’s 23.47% open interest share. HTX, Bitget, and OKX recorded the largest open interest gains at 1.19%, 0.71%, and 0.63%.

Recently, a significant announcement sent ripples across the crypto and real estate sectors: the Ripple partnership with Ctrl Alt. This collaboration isn’t just another headline; it’s a monumental step towards reimagining property ownership and investment, particularly within the ambitious landscape of Dubai. Unpacking the Revolutionary Ripple Partnership In a strategic move set to reshape the future of digital assets, Ripple, the enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions provider behind the XRP token, officially announced its alliance with Ctrl Alt. This isn’t a mere handshake; it’s a foundational collaboration aimed at leveraging Ripple’s cutting-edge crypto custody technology to underpin the Dubai Land Department’s ambitious real estate tokenization project. For those closely watching the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain, this marks a pivotal moment. Ctrl Alt, known for its robust tokenization infrastructure platform, will be integrating Ripple’s secure custody solutions to ensure the integrity and safety of digitized real estate assets. This means that physical properties in Dubai can be represented as digital tokens on a blockchain, offering unprecedented levels of liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. The partnership highlights a shared vision: to unlock new investment opportunities and streamline the cumbersome processes traditionally associated with real estate transactions. Why Dubai is Leading the Charge in Dubai Real Estate Tokenization? Dubai has long positioned itself as a global hub for innovation, technology, and business. Its proactive approach to adopting emerging technologies, particularly blockchain, makes it an ideal incubator for projects like real estate tokenization. The city’s leadership, through entities like the Dubai Land Department (DLD), has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation and creating a ‘smart city’ ecosystem. The DLD’s involvement is crucial. As the government entity responsible for all real estate transactions and regulations in Dubai, its endorsement provides the necessary regulatory clarity and institutional backing for such a project to thrive. This isn’t just about technology; it’s about building trust and ensuring a secure, compliant environment for digital assets. The vision is clear: to make Dubai’s real estate market more accessible, efficient, and attractive to a global pool of investors. Key reasons for Dubai’s leadership in this space include: Government Vision: A clear strategy for digital transformation and blockchain adoption. Regulatory Support: Progressive regulations from entities like the Dubai Land Department fostering innovation. Global Appeal: Dubai’s status as an international business and investment hub attracts diverse capital. Infrastructure Readiness: A modern infrastructure capable of supporting advanced technological deployments. The Power of Blockchain Real Estate: What Does It Mean? At its core, blockchain real estate , or real estate tokenization, involves converting property rights into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token can represent a fractional share of a property, much like shares in a company. This seemingly simple concept carries profound implications for the traditional real estate market. Consider the benefits: Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy small portions of high-value properties, democratizing access to real estate investment. Increased Liquidity: Tokens can be traded on secondary markets much more easily than traditional property, reducing illiquidity. Transparency & Immutability: All transactions are recorded on a public, immutable ledger, enhancing trust and reducing fraud. Reduced Costs & Time: Automating processes like due diligence, legal transfers, and payments through smart contracts can significantly cut down on fees and transaction times. Global Accessibility: Investors from anywhere in the world can participate, expanding the market reach beyond geographical boundaries. However, it’s not without its challenges. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving in many jurisdictions, and ensuring legal enforceability of digital ownership remains a complex area. Scalability, interoperability between different blockchain networks, and educating the broader market are also crucial hurdles that projects like the one in Dubai aim to address head-on. How the XRP Ledger Powers This Digital Revolution? Ripple’s choice of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for its underlying technology in various enterprise solutions speaks volumes about its capabilities. While the initial announcement specifically mentions Ripple’s crypto custody technology, it’s important to understand the broader ecosystem that Ripple provides. The XRPL is a decentralized, public blockchain known for its speed, efficiency, and low transaction costs. Key features of the XRP Ledger that make it suitable for such large-scale tokenization projects include: High Transaction Throughput: Capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, essential for a liquid real estate market. Low Transaction Fees: Negligible costs per transaction make micro-investments economically viable. Energy Efficiency: A more environmentally friendly alternative compared to proof-of-work blockchains. Built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX): Facilitates direct token trading without intermediaries. Robust Security: Enterprise-grade security protocols ensure the safety of digital assets. Ripple’s crypto custody technology, built upon the foundation of the XRPL’s robust infrastructure, provides the secure framework necessary for holding and managing these valuable digital real estate assets. This ensures that the tokenized properties are protected against theft, loss, and unauthorized access, a critical component for institutional adoption and investor confidence. Ctrl Alt: The Innovative Tokenization Platform at the Forefront Behind every successful blockchain implementation is a capable infrastructure provider, and in this case, it’s Ctrl Alt. As a leading tokenization platform , Ctrl Alt specializes in creating the digital rails necessary to convert real-world assets into secure, tradable digital tokens. Their expertise lies in navigating the complexities of asset digitization, from legal structuring to technical implementation. Ctrl Alt’s role in this partnership is multifaceted: Infrastructure Provision: They provide the core platform for minting, managing, and transferring the real estate tokens. Integration with Ripple: Seamlessly integrating Ripple’s custody technology to ensure secure storage of digital assets. Compliance & Legal Frameworks: Working within Dubai’s regulatory environment to ensure all tokenized assets are compliant. Market Facilitation: Potentially enabling secondary trading of these tokens, enhancing liquidity for investors. This collaboration between a leading blockchain enterprise (Ripple) and a specialized tokenization platform (Ctrl Alt), supported by a forward-thinking government entity (Dubai Land Department), creates a powerful trifecta poised to set a new global standard for real estate tokenization. The Future is Tokenized: What This Means for You This partnership between Ripple and Ctrl Alt for Dubai’s real estate tokenization project is more than just a technological advancement; it’s a blueprint for the future of asset ownership. It signals a shift towards a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent global real estate market. For individual investors, it could mean the ability to diversify portfolios with smaller investments in prime properties. For developers, it offers new avenues for fundraising and broader investor reach. For the broader market, it sets a precedent for how traditional assets can be seamlessly integrated into the digital economy. The success of this initiative in Dubai could very well inspire other major cities and nations to explore similar blockchain-powered solutions for their real estate markets. As the digital and physical worlds continue to converge, tokenization stands out as a powerful tool for unlocking value and creating new economic opportunities. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Real Estate and Blockchain The collaboration between Ripple and Ctrl Alt, championed by the Dubai Land Department, marks a significant milestone in the journey towards mainstream blockchain adoption. By leveraging Ripple’s secure crypto custody technology and Ctrl Alt’s robust tokenization platform, Dubai is not just digitizing real estate; it’s democratizing access, enhancing liquidity, and setting a new standard for efficiency and transparency in property investment. This groundbreaking initiative is a testament to the transformative power of blockchain and a clear indicator that the future of real estate is undoubtedly digital.

The Sandbox, the leading social gaming metaverse, is partnering exclusively once again, with GBM Auctions to launch its largest set of auctions for LAND to date. The drop includes 110 LANDs (including 4 Estates exclusive to this sale) and 220 branded avatars across 22 IPs, all distributed via GBM Auctions' Win-Win auction protocol. In a first for The Sandbox, auctions will precede its own platform sale, highlighting a shift in how LAND is brought to market and underscoring GBM’s role as the auction layer for Web3-native asset distribution.

Despite this pause in its rally, strong institutional interest remains clear, as consistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs continued to support market confidence and the broader bullish momentum. Bitcoin ETFs Are Soaking Up Fiat Market intelligence platform Santiment revealed that there has been a surge of capital moving into Bitcoin ETFs as the top crypto asset trades in new territory. Since June 9, these investment vehicles have recorded a combined net inflow of $7.78 billion, averaging $353.8 million daily. Glassnode also observed that Monday marked one of the largest daily inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past three months, with over 7,500 BTC added in a single day. What’s striking is Tuesday’s follow-through, as institutions showed no hesitation, adding another 3,400 BTC or around $402 million in net inflows, despite the previous day’s surge. This also represented nine consecutive days of consistent buying pressure. According to data updated by SoSoValue, BlackRock’s IBIT was the top performer as it captured $416.35 million in net inflows. Next up was VanEck’s HODL, which added $19 million, while Grayscale’s Mini Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s BITB also saw $18.56 million and $12.7 million, respectively. This steady influx of fiat into the funds aligns with on-chain whale accumulation, which, according to Santiment, is contributing to Bitcoin’s record-setting all-time high levels and demonstrates the growing appetite for institutional exposure to BTC amid its historic rally. Bitcoin Could Hit $200K on Global Institutional Inflows If global institutional inflows alone enter the market, Bitcoin could rise another 70% to approach $200,000, as per an update by Kobeissi Letter. With Bitcoin delivering a 90% CAGR over the past 13 years, even conservative funds are allocating 1% to BTC as treasury adoption gains momentum. Kobeissi noted that with $31 trillion in institutional AUM in the US, a 1% allocation could inject $300 billion into Bitcoin. This, in turn, could drive prices to around $133,000, a widely cited short-term target. Factoring in global institutional AUM, a $1 trillion inflow could add 70% to Bitcoin’s price, thereby pushing it closer to $200,000, all without retail participation. As more institutional products launch and entities accumulate BTC for treasuries, experts believe that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory will continue.

SEC approves UXRP, the first U.S.-listed leveraged XRP ETF, set to launch on NYSE Arca. 3iQ’s Canadian XRP ETF tops $50M in assets as regulated products gain traction globally. XRP Futures Set New Record on CME CME’s XRP futures market posted its highest trading volume to date on July 11. Over $235 million in notional value changed hands in a single day, with volume spread across standard and micro contracts. This brings the total traded volume since the May 19 launch to over $1.6 billion. The contracts offer exposure to XRP without requiring token ownership. The standard contract is based on 50,000 XRP, while the micro version covers 2,500 coins. These cash-settled products are tied to CME’s XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and are available to both institutions and retail traders. Institutions Turn to Regulated Exposure CME has become a go-to exchange for investors who want access to crypto through regulated markets. Its Bitcoin and Ether futures are already widely used, and XRP is now following a similar path. The latest numbers suggest growing use of XRP futures among trading firms. CME’s Active Trader account posted , “XRP and Micro XRP futures crossed $235M notional traded on July 11.” That day, over 9,100 contracts were traded, equal to more than 82 million XRP. Micro contracts also saw their busiest session since launch. Ripple, which uses XRP for international payments, is applying for a banking license in the United States. It is also looking to register under the MiCA framework in the European Union. These moves are part of a broader strategy to build compliant infrastructure for XRP in major markets. XRP Gets First U.S. ETF as Global Demand Grows XRP futures aren’t the only regulated product gaining traction. On July 14, 3iQ reported that its XRP ETF, trading on Canada’s TSX, crossed $50 million in assets. CME data also shows that 45% of XRP futures volume comes from outside North America, pointing to strong demand across regions. Adding to this institutional wave, the SEC has approved the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, a leveraged futures-based product set to trade under the ticker UXRP on NYSE Arca. Trading is scheduled to begin by week’s end, giving XRP its first U.S.-listed ETF exposure.

The analyst noted that DOGE previously reached this Fibonacci level, which suggests it may do so again in this cycle. Dogecoin Price Eyes Rally Above $10 With This Fibonacci Level In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10 if it reaches the 423.6% Fibonacci level. The analyst used the Fibonacci tool to highlight the fact that both the first and second DOGE cycles topped at the 423.6% level. Based on this, the foremost meme coin could reach this level, surpassing the $10 target. Related Reading: Dogecoin Returns To December 2020 Levels, Is Another 36,000% Rally Possible? Interestingly, DOGECAPITAL noted that should history repeat itself, the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $36, which is where the 423.6% is. This could mark the potential top for the meme coin in this cycle. The analyst also confirmed that DOGE is nowhere near its top in this third cycle based on the historical timing of past cycles. If this historical pattern keeps playing out, DOGECAPITAL predicts that the projected top for the Dogecoin price could occur around the final week of October. The analyst also believes that the market has entered DOGE season with Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) and the meme coin currently sitting near key support. However, despite the current bullish sentiment in the crypto market, it is worth noting that the Dogecoin price is still sitting just below the psychological $0.2 level. As such, this raises doubts about whether the DOGE season has truly begun. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the DOGE/BTC chart may show a God candle this season, which would kickstart the DOGE season. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Kevin Capital noted that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support. He added that the monthly time frame indicators are also fully reset, providing the best setup for the Dogecoin price. DOGE Eyes Rally To $0.25 In The Short Term In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally to $0.25 in the short term. Alluding to DOGE’s daily chart, Martinez stated that the meme coin is trading within a channel and that it just bounced off the bottom. He added that a buying spike at this level could send DOGE to the top of the channel at $0.25. Related Reading: Analysts Predict Major Dogecoin Price Rally After Breaking 50-Day Trendline This level is significant as it marked the last local top for the Dogecoin price. As such, a successful break above this level could lead to higher prices for the meme coin. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade stated that DOGE’s daily RSI might find support soon, completing a healthy pullback and preparing for a new surge. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.19, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For years, Bitcoin has largely remained an isolated giant, its immense liquidity locked away from the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. Now, a groundbreaking development is set to change that narrative. Bitlayer, a prominent Bitcoin layer-2 network, has launched its innovative BitVM Bridge on the mainnet, promising to usher in a new era for Bitcoin DeFi . This is not just another bridge; it’s a trust-minimized pathway designed to unlock Bitcoin’s true potential within decentralized applications, ensuring security and efficiency. Are you ready to witness how this pivotal innovation could redefine the future of crypto finance? What is the Significance of Bringing Bitcoin DeFi to the Forefront? For too long, Bitcoin, despite its market dominance, has been underutilized in the DeFi space. Most DeFi protocols reside on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, which offer smart contract capabilities that Bitcoin’s native blockchain does not. To use BTC in DeFi, users often relied on ‘wrapped’ versions of Bitcoin (like WBTC) or centralized custodians, introducing various levels of trust and potential points of failure. This meant that the security and decentralization inherent to Bitcoin were often compromised when it entered DeFi. The significance of truly integrating Bitcoin DeFi lies in several key areas: Unlocking Liquidity: Bitcoin represents hundreds of billions of dollars in dormant capital. Bringing this liquidity into DeFi can supercharge existing protocols and enable entirely new financial products. Enhanced Security: By leveraging Bitcoin’s foundational security, DeFi applications can potentially become more robust and resilient. Increased Decentralization: Reducing reliance on centralized custodians or multi-signature schemes for bridging promotes a more decentralized financial ecosystem, aligning with the core ethos of crypto. New Use Cases: Imagine Bitcoin being seamlessly used as collateral for loans, participating in liquidity pools, or earning yield in a trust-minimized manner. This opens up a universe of possibilities for innovation. Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge aims to address these challenges head-on, offering a pathway that respects Bitcoin’s security principles while expanding its utility. How Does the BitVM Bridge Work its Magic? At the heart of Bitlayer’s innovation is the BitVM Bridge , which leverages the powerful, albeit complex, concept of BitVM. BitVM, or Bitcoin Virtual Machine, is a revolutionary proposal that allows for the execution of complex computations on Bitcoin without altering its core protocol. It achieves this by proving that a given computation could have been executed on Bitcoin, even if it wasn’t. This is done through a mechanism known as ‘fraud proofs’. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how the BitVM Bridge operates: Locking BTC: When a user wants to bring their BTC into the Bitlayer ecosystem (or another DeFi platform via the bridge), their Bitcoin is locked in a special multi-signature address on the Bitcoin mainnet. This address is controlled by a set of participants, including the user and a designated ‘challenger’ or ‘verifier’. The Role of BitVM Smart Contracts: The bridge utilizes a BitVM smart contract. This isn’t a smart contract in the Ethereum sense, but rather a way to express and verify complex conditions using Bitcoin’s existing scripting language (Script). Trust-Minimized Security: The core innovation is the ‘trust-minimized’ framework. It operates on the assumption that at least one honest participant exists within the system. If any malicious activity occurs (e.g., an attempt to improperly release locked BTC), an honest participant can generate a fraud proof. Fraud Proofs and Dispute Resolution: This fraud proof is a cryptographic proof that demonstrates the malicious behavior. It can be verified on the Bitcoin mainnet, effectively penalizing the dishonest party and ensuring the integrity of the locked funds. This mechanism discourages fraud by making it economically irrational. This approach significantly differs from traditional wrapped BTC solutions, which often rely on a centralized entity or a small consortium of multi-sig signers. The BitVM Bridge shifts the security paradigm towards cryptographic proofs and economic incentives, aligning more closely with Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. The Role of the Bitlayer Network in This Innovation The Bitlayer network is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution built to scale Bitcoin and enhance its smart contract capabilities. It serves as the environment where the bridged BTC can actually be used in DeFi applications. Think of it as an extension of Bitcoin, providing the infrastructure for faster, cheaper transactions and complex smart contract interactions, all while maintaining a strong connection to Bitcoin’s underlying security. Key aspects of the Bitlayer network’s role: Scalability: By processing transactions off the main Bitcoin chain, Bitlayer reduces congestion and transaction fees, making DeFi activities more accessible and efficient. Smart Contract Compatibility: It provides an environment where smart contracts can operate, enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with Bitcoin. Security Inheritance: While a separate layer, Bitlayer aims to inherit as much security from Bitcoin as possible. The BitVM Bridge is a prime example of this, using Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities for dispute resolution. Ecosystem Growth: By facilitating the seamless movement of BTC, the Bitlayer network aims to foster a vibrant ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other decentralized applications built on Bitcoin’s foundation. The synergy between the innovative BitVM Bridge and the robust Bitlayer network is what makes this development so powerful. The bridge gets BTC onto the network, and the network provides the platform for its utility. Why is BTC Bridging So Crucial for Decentralized Finance? For decentralized finance to truly flourish and achieve mainstream adoption, it needs access to the largest pool of cryptocurrency liquidity: Bitcoin. Historically, BTC bridging has been a complex and often centralized endeavor. Early methods involved trusted third parties holding Bitcoin and issuing corresponding tokens on other chains. While effective in the short term, these methods introduced significant counterparty risk and went against the very principles of decentralization that DeFi champions. The advent of trust-minimized BTC bridging solutions, like Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge, is crucial because: Reduces Centralization Risk: By minimizing the need for trusted intermediaries, the risk of censorship, seizure, or single points of failure is significantly reduced. This makes the entire DeFi ecosystem more resilient. Enhances Capital Efficiency: Unlocking Bitcoin’s liquidity allows for more capital to be deployed in various DeFi protocols, leading to deeper liquidity pools, more stable lending markets, and more efficient trading. Boosts Innovation: Developers can now confidently build DeFi applications knowing they can integrate Bitcoin in a secure and decentralized manner. This fosters a new wave of innovation tailored for Bitcoin holders. Broadens DeFi Participation: Bitcoin maximalists and those wary of complex bridging mechanisms might now be more willing to explore DeFi, expanding the user base and overall adoption. The ability to move BTC across chains securely and efficiently is not just a technical feat; it’s a foundational step towards a more interconnected and robust decentralized financial system. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Decentralized Finance While the launch of the BitVM Bridge is a monumental step forward, the journey for Decentralized Finance , especially with Bitcoin integration, still has its challenges and immense opportunities. Challenges Ahead: Adoption and Education: Explaining complex concepts like BitVM and fraud proofs to a broader audience will be key for widespread adoption. Users need to understand the security guarantees. Scalability of Fraud Proofs: While trust-minimized, the actual generation and verification of fraud proofs on Bitcoin can be resource-intensive. Optimizing this process will be an ongoing challenge. Competition: Other Bitcoin Layer-2s and bridging solutions are also vying for market share. The landscape is competitive, requiring continuous innovation from Bitlayer. Security Audits and Real-World Testing: As with any new technology dealing with significant capital, rigorous security audits and extensive real-world testing are paramount to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and DeFi could impact the growth and operational models of such bridges. Opportunities on the Horizon: New Financial Primitives: The ability to use native BTC opens the door for entirely new DeFi products and services that were previously impossible or too risky. Cross-Chain Interoperability: This development paves the way for greater interoperability between Bitcoin and other major blockchain ecosystems, creating a more unified crypto space. Increased Market Efficiency: By bringing more liquidity and more secure assets into DeFi, the overall market can become more efficient and robust. Mainstream Acceptance: As DeFi becomes more secure and accessible with Bitcoin integration, it increases its appeal to institutional investors and traditional finance, accelerating mainstream acceptance. The integration of Bitcoin into DeFi via solutions like the BitVM Bridge represents a pivotal moment, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the decentralized economy. A New Horizon for Bitcoin’s Utility The launch of Bitlayer’s BitVM Bridge on the mainnet marks a significant milestone in the evolution of both Bitcoin and decentralized finance. By providing a truly trust-minimized framework for bringing BTC into DeFi, it addresses long-standing challenges and unlocks immense potential. No longer will Bitcoin be seen merely as a store of value, but also as a dynamic asset capable of fueling a new generation of decentralized applications. This innovation paves the way for greater liquidity, enhanced security, and unprecedented opportunities for developers and users alike. The journey of Bitcoin DeFi is just beginning, and with pioneering solutions like the BitVM Bridge, the future looks incredibly bright and interconnected.

According to prominent crypto analyst JackTheRippler, Ripple’s XRP and its dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD are uniquely positioned to win, regardless how Washington decides to regulate or restrict crypto and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). U.S. Crypto Legislation Hits a Wall On July 15, the U.S. House of Representatives voted down a key procedural resolution that would have advanced three major crypto-focused bills: the GENIUS Act (focused on stablecoin regulation), the CLARITY Act (aimed at defining market structure), and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance State Act (which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail CBDC). The U.S government wants CBDC. Ripple is strategically positioned to capitalize on the growing interest in CBDCs. In other words, #XRP and $RLUSD will win regardless of the outcome! — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) July 15, 2025 The resolution failed with a 196–223 vote, with 13 Republicans siding with Democrats to block it. This setback puts a temporary hold on what’s been called “Crypto Week” in Congress, a push for significant regulatory advancements that was expected to move the needle on crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act has already gained strong bipartisan support in the Senate, and the Clarity Act is gaining traction. However, the Anti-CBDC Act remains a contentious issue, sparking debate and division. Critics argue that banning retail CBDCs could halt innovation, while supporters cite surveillance concerns as justification for the restriction. Ripple Moves Forward While Congress Stalls Despite the uncertainty in the U.S. legislative landscape, Ripple is pressing ahead. JackTheRippler points out that Ripple already offers a purpose-built platform for issuing CBDCs, technology that is not just theoretical, but actively in use. Countries including Palau, Bhutan, Montenegro, and Colombia are already running pilot programs on Ripple’s CBDC infrastructure. This gives Ripple a first-mover advantage and real-world credibility that U.S. lawmakers have yet to match with any domestic initiative. Ripple’s lead in this area reinforces JackTheRippler’s argument: regardless of whether the U.S. bans CBDCs or eventually embraces them, Ripple is already solving the problems policymakers are still debating. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RLUSD: A Private-Sector Stablecoin Built for Utility Ripple’s 2024 launch of RLUSD, a fully backed U.S. dollar stablecoin, adds another layer to its strategic advantage. Unlike a future U.S. CBDC, delayed by political wrangling, RLUSD is already live and operational on the XRP Ledger. It supports real-time settlement, cross-border payments, and tokenized value exchange. Its design makes it ideal for institutions seeking regulatory-compliant, dollar-backed digital assets without waiting on federal agencies. For JackTheRippler, RLUSD proves that innovation doesn’t need to pause while the government decides its stance. XRP and RLUSD Are Built to Win Although the U.S. House has delayed movement on three of its most anticipated crypto bills, Ripple’s ecosystem remains unaffected. It’s thriving. As JackTheRippler rightly emphasizes, Ripple isn’t waiting for the U.S. to catch up. With XRP at the center of liquidity and RLUSD enabling programmable payments, Ripple’s ecosystem is already delivering what legislators are still trying to define. Whether the U.S. bans CBDCs or embraces them later, Ripple has already built the infrastructure, and that’s why XRP and RLUSD are poised to win, no matter the outcome.

48352525,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=789671,1752674640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/48352525.jpeg,Uniswap’s $73B Growth Fuels Optimism for DeFi and the Best Presales After Leadership Change,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/uniswap-73b-growth-defi-best-meme-coins-leadership-change/,"Mary-Catherine Lader just stepped down as President and COO of Uniswap Labs after a four-year run that transformed the platform into the biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum. During her time at the helm, Uniswap went from scrappy startup to DeFi juggernaut, pulling in over $73B in trading volume in the last month alone. That number alone has crypto optimists buzzing. So what’s next? Well, as Uniswap looks for its next leader, the rest of DeFi is doing what it does best – evolving fast. New crypto projects are stepping up to fill the innovation gap and take decentralized finance to the next level. And in true Web3 fashion, it’s not just about serious finance anymore. Why Lader’s Exit Matters Mary-Catherine Lader wasn’t just another name on the masthead. She was a driving force behind Uniswap’s rise to dominance in decentralized finance. Joining as President and COO in 2021, she played a central role in turning Uniswap from a developer-first protocol into a fully operational, structured business. Under her leadership, the company raised $165M in October 2022, achieving a valuation of $1.66B. But perhaps her most impressive feat was navigating the SEC investigation that loomed over Uniswap for nearly a year. That probe concluded in February 2025 with no enforcement action, a massive win for the entire DeFi sector. Lader’s departure after this victory feels intentional – a well-timed baton pass now that Uniswap stands on solid ground. It’s a clear signal: Uniswap is strong, mature, and ready for what’s next. Just like the DeFi ecosystem it helped build. Let’s take a look at three top crypto presales that could ride this next wave. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Your DeFi Wallet Just Got Smarter With DeFi entering a more mature phase, thanks to leaders like Mary-Catherine Lader pushing for transparency and regulation, it’s no surprise that users are demanding smarter tools. Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST), a next-gen crypto wallet aiming to outpace clunky legacy apps like MetaMask with advanced features, clean design, and serious security. Right now, you can buy $BEST for just $0.025335, and the project has already pulled in a hefty $13.9M during the presale. That’s not hype – it’s momentum. Best Wallet is packed with features that make it feel more like Apple Wallet (if Apple actually cared about DeFi). Its standout tool? Upcoming Tokens, which lets you buy presale tokens safely and directly inside the app – no sketchy mirror sites or third-party scams. Add to that Fireblocks-powered MPC-CMP security , reduced transaction fees, iGaming perks, and governance rights, and $BEST starts looking like a wallet token with real-world muscle. If Uniswap’s $73B surge fuels optimism for meme coins, $BEST is where you might safely store them. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Turning Clout Into Crypto The creator economy is booming, but most platforms still take a massive cut while leaving creators fighting for scraps. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) wants to change that by putting the power – and earnings – back into the hands of influencers, artists, and yes, even meme lords. Built as the first AI-driven, premium content platform on the blockchain, SUBBD lets users create and monetize content with game-changing tools. At the core is an AI agent that automates chat, edits videos, and helps creators engage fans without burning out. And with over 250M combined followers across SUBBD’s platform, Honny brand, and ambassador network, it’s already got a massive audience primed for Web3. Currently, you can buy $SUBBD for $0.055925, with $810K raised in presale – a strong signal of early traction.$SUBBD also offers 20% APY staking during the presale, plus real-time, low-fee crypto payments that make tipping and subscribing a breeze. In a DeFi world shaped by leaders like Mary-Catherine Lader, who bridged traditional finance with blockchain, $SUBBD is extending that legacy – bringing AI and creator freedom to the next generation of decentralized platforms. 3. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) – Meme Power Meets Layer‑2 Muscle Following Uniswap’s $73B surge, DeFi’s energy isn’t confined to Ethereum alone. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) seizes that momentum by launching the first meme‑focused Layer‑2 blockchain built on Ethereum. It combines the fun of meme coins with real utility, offering zero‑tax trading, lightning‑fast, low‑fee transactions, bot protection, staking, and DAO governance. Currently, 1 $LILPEPE = $0.0015, and its presale has raised $7,2M. That funding level underscores enthusiastic backing for its vision: a Layer‑2 chain for memes. The heart of the project is the Little Pepe Chain – EVM‑compatible, ultra‑scalable infrastructure built to launch new tokens via a meme launchpad, protect users from sniper bots, and host NFTs. It aims for seamless edge utility for creators and traders alike, reflecting the kind of platform Uniswap’s surge inspires. Alongside blockchain utility, it boasts a $777K giveaway, strong community traction, and plans for Tier‑1 exchange listings – that’s meme culture backed by infrastructure. As Uniswap settles into its next chapter, Little Pepe shows how the Uniswap $73B surge fuels optimism for meme coins – fusing humor, community, and real tech into the future of DeFi. The Torch Is Being Passed Lader’s exit doesn’t mean DeFi is slowing down. If anything, it’s accelerating. With projects like $BEST , $SUBBD , and $LILPEPE stepping up, the crypto world might be entering a new golden age – one that’s decentralized, community-driven, and just a little chaotic.

Filecoin’s historic price sentiment Filecoin price history by CoinGecko Filecoin (FIL) started trading in December 2017, a short period after conducting its ICO. Trading started long before the Filecoin mainnet was released. Between December 2017 and May 2020, FIL traded below $30. Then, starting mid-May, the Filecoin price started rising, and the bull trend continued until 1st April 2021, when it hit its highest price of $237.24. After hitting its all-time high in mid-May 2021, Filecoin took a bearish turn, which continued until mid-July when the market turned bullish again. Filecoin (FIL) experienced notable price fluctuations between 2022 and 2023. Starting 2022 at a higher value, FIL’s price declined amidst the broader crypto market downturn. The price fluctuated throughout 2022, influenced by market sentiment, technological developments, and broader economic conditions. Entering 2023, Filecoin (FIL) exhibited a dynamic price trajectory. The year commenced with FIL at $3 in January, experiencing a gradual ascent amid market fluctuations. By mid-year, it surged slightly to $4.32. Filecoin (FIL) started 2024 at $7.65 but saw a steady decline throughout the year, dropping to lows of $3.57 by August and $3.3743 by November. Despite the prolonged decline, FIL showed a brief spike, trading at $8.03 on December 5. In January 2025, FIL is trading between $4.3 and $5.9 However, the closing price for Filecoin in January was $4.9. In February 2025, FIL price declined toward the low of $3. In March, FIL price declined further and dropped toward the low of $2.6. However, it later recovered. In April, FIL dropped to $2.26. It continued to face intense volatility around $2.5. FIL ended April at $2.62. At the start of May, FIL price is trading between $2.5 and $3.0. FIL ended May at $2.85. In June, FIL is trading between $2.6 to $2.8.

That’s a soft print for wholesale prices, especially when economists had penciled in a monthly gain of 0.2%. Instead, the index just sat there flat, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Same story for core PPI, which strips out food and energy. Also expected to rise by 0.2%, but it didn’t move either. Not up, not down. Zero. This adds another layer to the inflation puzzle, especially right after the consumer price index (CPI) data hit on Tuesday. PPI update: Goods prices rise while services fall Even though the top-line PPI stayed flat, not every category was still. Final demand goods rose 0.3%, mainly thanks to communication equipment, which are most sensitive to trade restrictions and tariffs, surging 0.8%. But that gain got canceled out by a 0.1% drop in services, and snd services make up a big chunk of the U.S. economy. At the same time, May’s original PPI print got a facelift. The BLS revised it upward, from 0.1% to 0.3%. That might sound small, but it’s actually the biggest jump in wholesale goods prices since February. Within the core goods section again, this means excluding food and energy, there was another 0.3% increase. So even if the headline number didn’t move in June, certain parts of the economy clearly did. Zooming out a bit, on a 12-month basis, we see the headline PPI came in at 2.3%, down from 2.7% in May. That’s still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, but it’s easing. Compare that with the CPI data from Tuesday, where consumer prices rose 0.3% month-over-month, and the annual headline inflation rate landed at 2.7%. Core CPI, which cuts out the noise from food and energy, hit 2.9% year-over-year—its highest level since February. Trump demands rate cut while markets shrug Right after the CPI report dropped, Trump once again demanded that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates . He wants borrowing costs down. He thinks that’ll help businesses and households. But the market isn’t buying it. And the data is actively proving him wrong. Traders have since priced in zero chance of a cut in July. Even for September, odds are falling. The Fed hasn’t moved. Officials are still playing it cautious. They’ve said they want to wait and see what the full impact of tariffs will be before pulling the trigger on rates. They believe the U.S. economy is strong enough to handle the pressure… for now. Back to the PPI: energy prices saw a 0.6% jump in June, and food went up too, but just by 0.2%. One category that really stood out was chicken eggs, which down by 21.8% in a single month. While the U.S. is dealing with mixed inflation data, the U.K. is facing the opposite problem. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), U.K. inflation spiked to 3.6% in June, hotter than the 3.4% expected. That makes it two months in a row sitting above forecast. Core inflation across the pond hit 3.7%, also above the previous 3.5% reading from May. The bigger picture here is about expectations. When you expect something terrible and that’s exactly what you get, it’s not exactly a win. Yes, CPI and PPI numbers came in either flat or just slightly below forecast, but they’re still high enough to stress markets. According to Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, “The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump’s tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Economy|BOE|Federal Reserve|GBP|USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-16 14:10:10

Then you need to be aware of a growing threat that impacts the integrity and future of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. A recent report from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has unveiled an alarming trend: a dramatic surge in crypto laundering activities, particularly through sophisticated cross-chain methods. This isn’t just about small-time criminals anymore; it’s a systemic challenge that demands our attention and understanding. The Alarming Surge in Crypto Laundering via Cross-chain Swaps Imagine a digital web where money can jump seamlessly from one network to another, leaving a confusing trail. That’s essentially what criminals are exploiting with cross-chain swaps . According to Elliptic, as reported by Cointelegraph, illicit crypto laundering using these methods has skyrocketed by a staggering 211% over the past two years, with projected figures reaching an astonishing $21.8 billion by 2025. This isn’t just a slight uptick; it’s a seismic shift in how bad actors are attempting to hide their ill-gotten gains. What exactly are cross-chain swaps? Originally, these tools were designed to enhance the functionality and liquidity of decentralized finance (DeFi) by allowing users to move assets between different blockchains without needing a centralized intermediary. Think of them as digital bridges connecting isolated islands of crypto. Tools like decentralized exchanges (DEXs), specialized bridges, and coin swappers enable this seamless movement. While incredibly useful for legitimate DeFi users, their very nature—decentralization and the creation of complex transaction paths—makes them highly attractive to criminals seeking to obscure the origins of their funds. The appeal is clear: by bouncing funds across multiple distinct blockchain networks, criminals introduce layers of complexity that make tracing incredibly difficult. It’s like trying to follow a single drop of water through a vast, interconnected river system with countless tributaries and diversions. Unmasking Illicit Crypto Flows: The Criminal’s Evolving Playbook The landscape of illicit crypto operations is constantly evolving, and criminals are proving to be remarkably adaptable. Elliptic’s findings highlight that sophisticated groups, including notorious North Korean hackers, alongside smaller criminal outfits, are increasingly employing intricate multi-hop and structured chain-hopping methods. This isn’t random bouncing; it’s a calculated strategy to create a labyrinth of transactions. Consider the challenge for investigators: today, nearly one-third of all blockchain investigations require tracking funds across three or more distinct networks. This dramatically increases the time, resources, and technical expertise needed to follow the money trail. Each hop adds a new layer of obfuscation, making it harder to link funds back to their original source or ultimate destination. Criminals use these methods to: Break the Chain: By moving funds from one blockchain to another, they effectively ‘break’ the direct link of a transaction history, making it harder to follow on a single chain’s explorer. Mix and Muddle: Often, cross-chain swaps are combined with mixing services or privacy coins on the destination chain, further blending illicit funds with legitimate ones. Evade Detection: The sheer volume and complexity of cross-chain transactions can overwhelm traditional tracking methods, allowing funds to slip through the cracks. The ultimate goal for these criminals is to ‘cleanse’ their digital assets, converting them into fiat currency or other untraceable assets, thereby making them usable for further illegal activities or personal gain. The Counter-Offensive: How Blockchain Analytics is Revolutionizing the Fight Against Crypto Crime While the threat of sophisticated crypto crime is growing, there’s a powerful force fighting back: blockchain analytics firms like Elliptic. These companies are at the forefront of developing cutting-edge tools and methodologies to monitor cross-chain flows and identify suspicious activity. It’s a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game, but the good guys are getting smarter and faster. How do they do it? Blockchain analytics leverages advanced data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to analyze vast amounts of on-chain data. They identify patterns, link seemingly disparate transactions, and build comprehensive profiles of wallets and entities. For cross-chain movements, these firms are developing specialized algorithms that can: Trace Funds Across Bridges: By understanding the mechanics of various cross-chain bridges and protocols, they can follow assets as they move from one network to another. Identify Cluster Behavior: They can spot groups of addresses acting in concert, indicating coordinated illicit activity. Flag Suspicious Patterns: Unusual transaction volumes, frequent small transfers, or movements through known illicit services are automatically flagged for investigation. The work of these firms is crucial not only for law enforcement agencies, who rely on their intelligence to conduct investigations and seize illicit assets, but also for legitimate cryptocurrency businesses. By partnering with blockchain analytics providers, exchanges, DeFi protocols, and other crypto service providers can implement robust anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) measures, protecting their platforms from being exploited by criminals. What Does This Mean for You? Navigating the Future of Crypto Security The rise in cross-chain laundering underscores the critical need for continued vigilance and innovation within the crypto space. For individuals, businesses, and regulators alike, understanding these evolving threats is the first step toward building a more secure and trusted digital economy. Actionable Insights: For Individual Users: Always use reputable and regulated exchanges. Be wary of unsolicited offers or platforms promising unrealistic returns. Understand the basics of wallet security and transaction transparency. For Crypto Businesses: Implement stringent AML/KYC policies. Partner with leading blockchain analytics firms to monitor transactions and identify high-risk activities in real-time. Continuously update your security protocols to adapt to new criminal methodologies. For Regulators: Foster international cooperation to create harmonized regulatory frameworks that address cross-chain illicit finance without stifling innovation. Support the development and adoption of advanced investigative tools. The battle against crypto crime is ongoing. As technology advances, so too do the methods of those who seek to exploit it. However, with continued investment in blockchain analytics, stronger regulatory frameworks, and a collective commitment to security, the crypto ecosystem can become a safer place for everyone. The alarming rise in crypto laundering via cross-chain swaps presents a significant challenge to the integrity of the digital asset space. Elliptic’s report serves as a stark reminder of the evolving sophistication of financial criminals. Yet, it also highlights the powerful capabilities of blockchain analytics in combating these illicit flows. By understanding the methods employed by bad actors and supporting the tools designed to trace their activities, we can collectively work towards a more secure, transparent, and trustworthy future for cryptocurrency. The fight is complex, but with collaboration and innovation, we can safeguard the promise of decentralized finance from those who seek to abuse it.

QCP Capital: Bitcoin Pulled Back After Surpassing $120,000, But Market Still Structurally Strong As summer approaches, a seasonal decrease in trading volume is observed in the cryptocurrency market. Another key point highlighted in the report is the 10% depreciation of the dollar index since the beginning of the year. This paves the way for strong performance in dollar-denominated assets, particularly Bitcoin. QCP Capital also noted that Ethereum has recently outperformed Bitcoin. This strengthening is attributed to institutions like SBET, which have taken steps to diversify its Ethereum-based treasuries, and the increasing trend of other companies to increase their Ethereum holdings. Retreat Can Be a Healthy Correction According to the analysis, a pullback to $110,000 could allow Bitcoin to consolidate more robustly in the current uptrend. QCP Capital analysts emphasized that the overall market sentiment remains bullish and structurally positive. Although crypto markets tend to stagnate in terms of volume during the summer months, analysts believe such pullbacks present opportunities for long-term investors. *This is not investment advice.

According to TokenInsight’s latest Exchange Report, total crypto market capitalization climbed to $3.46 trillion by quarter-end, up 28.2% from Q1. However, exchange activity failed to keep pace with the broader recovery, as cautious sentiment, limited altcoin participation, and macroeconomic headwinds dragged down trading volumes. Trading Volume Down Despite Bitcoin Surge TokenInsight reports that the total trading volume across the top 10 crypto exchanges reached $21.6 trillion in Q2, a 6.16% decline from the previous quarter. 1/ The Top 10 exchanges total $21.58T in volume, a decrease of 6.16% compared to the previous quarter. pic.twitter.com/Ue57kdpUP0 — TokenInsight (@TokenInsight) July 16, 2025 While Bitcoin rallied from $83,000 to over $111,000 before closing near $106,000, the rest of the market saw uneven performance. Liquidity remained concentrated in a few large-cap assets, with many altcoins continuing to see low activity and sharp drops in interest. The spot market, in particular, experienced a marked pullback: average daily spot trading volume declined from $51 billion in Q1 to $40 billion in Q2. Total spot volume across major exchanges reached $3.63 trillion, a 21.7% drop quarter-on-quarter. Derivatives trading fared slightly better, reaching $20.2 trillion, down 3.6% from Q1. This segment remained more resilient as traders sought to hedge volatility and manage risk amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and sluggish global growth. The average daily derivatives trading volume fell to $226 billion, compared to $233 billion in Q1, reflecting broader market caution. Binance Leads, But Market Share is Shifting Binance retains its lead in total trading volume with a 35.39% share, though this reflected a slight decrease from Q1. Other exchanges gained ground: OKX, Bitget, HTX, Gate, and KuCoin all expanded their market shares during the quarter. Gate posted the largest gain with a 2.55% increase, followed by OKX with 1.08%. In the open interest market, Binance strengthened its position with a 0.36% increase, reaching a 23.83% share. Bitget, OKX, and HTX also made modest gains. The data shows a gradual diversification in user behavior, as smaller platforms continue to attract more trading volume despite the broader slowdown in market activity. Exchange Tokens Lag Behind Bitcoin Rally While Bitcoin surged 31.62% during Q2, exchange-related tokens underperformed. BNB led the pack with an 8.91% gain, followed by modest increases in OKB, BGB, and KCS. Most other exchange tokens posted declines, reflecting waning interest in altcoin markets. As TokenInsight notes, exchange tokens remain closely correlated with altcoin activity, which saw reduced liquidity and volume during the quarter. With persistent macro uncertainty and uneven regulatory developments , Q3 is expected to remain challenging for exchange token performance. TokenInsight anticipates continued divergence in this segment as market participants focus on high-cap assets and remain selective in deploying capital across the exchange sector.

On Monday, BTC surged to a new all-time high of $123,200, only to retrace to $115,700 by Tuesday, highlighting the fast-paced, high-stakes environment that has returned to the crypto market. Despite the sharp pullback, the overall trend remains bullish, with price structure and momentum still favoring the bulls.

The recent move is viewed by many as a healthy correction rather than a reversal, especially given the macro backdrop and rising institutional involvement. Adding to the bullish narrative, CryptoQuant data reveals that retail investors are making a comeback. The 30-day change in demand for small BTC transfers (ranging from $0–$10K) is signaling renewed interest from retail investors. Retail Demand Reawakens As Crypto Week Advances In Washington Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a critical on-chain signal that points to the return of retail investors in the Bitcoin market. The 30-day change in demand for small transfer volumes ($0–$10K) has moved out of negative territory for the first time in months. This shift indicates a meaningful increase in activity from smaller holders—widely interpreted as retail participants—after a prolonged period of dormancy. Retail involvement plays a crucial role in sustaining long-term bullish trends. While institutional demand often drives initial breakouts, it is the broad participation from everyday investors that adds momentum and staying power to rallies. The reappearance of retail buying interest not only strengthens Bitcoin’s current price structure but also suggests growing confidence in the asset’s outlook, despite recent volatility. This renewed demand comes at a pivotal time. “Crypto Week” is underway in the US Congress, where lawmakers are actively debating and voting on three major cryptocurrency bills. The outcomes of these discussions are expected to shape the regulatory landscape for years to come and could provide the clarity that both retail and institutional investors have long awaited. For now, the uptick in small-scale BTC transfers is a strong signal. That retail investors are re-engaging just as the crypto industry prepares for potentially historic policy changes.

After a sharp rally pushed it to a new all-time high of $123,200 earlier this week. The price has since retraced, but BTC continues to hold above key support levels, signaling bullish resilience. The recent dip toward $117,000 was met with buyer interest, as seen in the long lower wick and a moderate bounce on rising volume. The chart shows that BTC is comfortably trading above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Currently at $108,040, $102,116, and $97,362, respectively—all of which are upward sloping. This confirms a strong bullish structure, with momentum still favoring buyers in the medium to long term.

Recently, a significant announcement from Canadian fintech firm LQWD has captured the attention of the crypto community: a groundbreaking $10 million At-The-Market (ATM) Program. This move isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play designed to deepen the company’s commitment to the digital asset space, specifically through increased Bitcoin purchases and robust support for the Lightning Network. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto financing and how LQWD is positioning itself at the forefront of this exciting evolution. Understanding LQWD’s Strategic ATM Program LQWD, a company focused on decentralized finance and the Lightning Network, has unveiled its $10 million ATM Program. This financing vehicle is a common method used by publicly traded companies to raise capital by issuing and selling new common shares directly into the open market at prevailing prices. It offers flexibility and efficiency, allowing companies to tap into liquidity as needed without the complexities and costs associated with traditional underwritten offerings. So, what exactly is an ATM Program and why is it beneficial for a company like LQWD? Flexibility: Unlike a fixed-price offering, an ATM program allows the company to sell shares over a period, adapting to market conditions. Cost-Effective: It typically involves lower fees compared to a traditional public offering. Market-Driven: Shares are sold at market prices, reducing the potential for price dilution often seen with large, sudden issuances. Continuous Capital Access: Provides an ongoing source of funds for strategic initiatives. This approach highlights a growing trend in crypto financing , where companies are finding novel ways to fund their operations and expand their digital asset holdings. LQWD’s decision to utilize an ATM Program signals a mature and measured approach to capital management in the volatile crypto market. Why Are Bitcoin Purchases a Key Focus for LQWD? At the heart of LQWD’s ATM Program lies a clear objective: to facilitate more Bitcoin purchases . Bitcoin, as the original and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to be seen as a foundational digital asset and a store of value. For a company like LQWD, which is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its Lightning Network infrastructure, increasing its BTC holdings is a logical and strategic move. There are several compelling reasons why companies are increasingly prioritizing Bitcoin acquisitions: Balance Sheet Strength: Holding Bitcoin can be viewed as a hedge against inflation and a way to diversify corporate treasuries. Alignment with Core Business: For crypto-native companies, holding BTC aligns their financial interests with the success of the broader crypto market. Liquidity for Operations: Bitcoin can be used to fund various operational needs, especially within the crypto space. Strategic Asset: For a company focused on the Lightning Network, owning more Bitcoin provides the necessary liquidity to operate and expand its network nodes. LQWD’s commitment to increasing its Bitcoin reserves demonstrates a strong conviction in the long-term value and utility of the digital asset, reinforcing its position as a key player in the evolving digital economy. How Does This Program Impact the Lightning Network? Beyond direct Bitcoin purchases, a significant portion of the proceeds from LQWD’s ATM Program is earmarked to boost the Lightning Network . For those unfamiliar, the Lightning Network is a ‘layer 2’ payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It enables incredibly fast, low-cost, and scalable Bitcoin transactions, addressing some of Bitcoin’s inherent limitations as a medium of exchange. LQWD is a significant operator of Lightning Network nodes, providing crucial infrastructure that allows these rapid transactions to occur. By investing further in this network, LQWD aims to: Aspect Impact of LQWD’s Investment Node Capacity Increased capital allows for more robust and higher-capacity Lightning nodes. Channel Liquidity More Bitcoin enables the creation of larger and more liquid payment channels, improving transaction reliability. Network Reach Expanded infrastructure can lead to broader adoption and accessibility of Lightning payments globally. Transaction Efficiency A stronger network means even faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for users. This investment is crucial for the continued growth and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a transactional currency. A more robust Lightning Network means a better user experience, paving the way for Bitcoin to be used for everyday purchases, remittances, and micro-transactions worldwide. LQWD’s strategic focus on strengthening this vital layer of the Bitcoin ecosystem is a testament to its vision for a truly scalable digital economy. What Does This Mean for LQWD and Its Investors? For LQWD itself, this $10 million ATM Program represents a significant step in solidifying its financial position and executing its growth strategy. By securing flexible access to capital, the company can proactively pursue opportunities within the Bitcoin and Lightning Network space without being constrained by immediate cash flow needs. For investors, this move could be interpreted in several ways: Confidence in Strategy: The company is demonstrating confidence in its long-term vision for the Lightning Network and Bitcoin. Growth Potential: Increased investment in infrastructure and Bitcoin holdings could lead to enhanced revenue streams and asset appreciation. Market Signal: It sends a strong signal to the market about LQWD’s commitment to expanding its footprint in the digital asset industry. It’s an interesting time for companies operating at the intersection of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology. LQWD’s ATM Program exemplifies how established financial mechanisms are being adapted to fuel innovation in the rapidly expanding crypto landscape. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap Forward in Crypto Financing LQWD’s launch of a $10 million ATM Program is more than just a fundraising initiative; it’s a strategic declaration of intent. By leveraging this flexible financing vehicle, the Canadian fintech firm is not only securing capital but also directly investing in the foundational pillars of the decentralized economy: Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. This move underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the innovative ways companies are approaching capital management to drive adoption and build robust infrastructure. As the crypto space continues to evolve, we can expect to see more such sophisticated financial maneuvers. LQWD’s commitment to strengthening the Lightning Network through strategic Bitcoin purchases is a positive indicator for the broader ecosystem, promising faster, cheaper, and more accessible Bitcoin transactions for everyone. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance is becoming increasingly digital, and companies like LQWD are leading the charge.

With a current presale price of $0.005 during its fourth fundraising stage—already 400% up from its initial price of $0.001—the project has raised over $1.34 million. This funding round demonstrates early-stage investor interest. The platform offers a set of tools designed to assist traders, analysts, and enterprises with data analysis and forecasting. Its ecosystem includes predictive AI modules, decentralized storage, and high-speed data processing infrastructure. These features target real-world use cases in financial markets, differentiating Ozak AI from other speculative digital assets. Technology Infrastructure Designed for Real-World Application Ozak AI’s technological framework is built around four primary components that support its use-case-driven mission. The Ozak Stream Network (OSN) enables rapid financial data processing through a high-speed pipeline with low latency. This component is critical for applications requiring real-time market responsiveness. The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) ensures secure and distributed data computation, minimizing central points of failure. By decentralizing processing power, Ozak AI aims to deliver greater system resilience and improved data security. These structural elements collectively position the project as a functional infrastructure layer for AI-enabled crypto tools. Additionally, the platform includes Ozak Data Vaults, a secure data storage solution that operates in a decentralized format. These vaults support privacy-preserving analytics and are tailored for users who require confidential, yet accessible, data environments. Prediction Agents (PAs) are another key feature, offering customizable artificial intelligence tools that analyze market trends and support decision-making processes. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Market Positioning and Growth Potential Amid Broader Trends The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology has gained momentum across industries, with increased demand for predictive analytics, decentralized processing, and secure data solutions. Ozak AI enters this landscape with a focus on application rather than speculation, a strategy that may align with evolving investor preferences. At present, the token OZ of Ozak AI is already on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which is an indication of further exposure in the crypto realm. Being low-cap and in the middle of its presale, the token price might be considered by the investors as a high upside and an early-access initiative. In case OZ meets its estimated $1 price, this will translate to a 200x payoff of its presale value. Ozak AI has also launched a $1 million giveaway , where participants investing a minimum of $100 and completing specific tasks stand a chance to win prizes. The larger market trends, such as the Bitcoin all-time high periods and the new market interest by the institutions, have previously been a reason that has led to capital inflows into the small-cap tokens. The compatibility of Ozak AI with such critical narratives as AI integration, tangible utility, and decentralized infrastructure allows it to be categorized among a specific group of assets that can become the focus of more intense attention once the market enters the second phase of growth.

This triggered a pullback, which dragged the cryptocurrency near $116,000. It has since staged a recovery of nearly 2%, pushing Bitcoin above $119,000 at the time of writing. New data has emerged, signaling that BTC is not at a local top but in a transition phase, with timing, behavior, and structure all pointing to further upside. BTC Makes Room for Alts According to the analytics firm, SwissBlock’s latest market report, ‘Altcoin Vector,’ beneath the surface, capital rotation has started , and Ethereum is emerging as the next leg of the cycle. The firm said that Bitcoin is consolidating , and not breaking down. BTC dominance has likely peaked in the short term as capital rotation accelerates across the crypto market. The ETH/BTC ratio is also rising steadily, which is indicative of Ethereum’s relative strength and its ability to attract liquidity from Bitcoin while also lifting the broader altcoin complex. This is is also driving renewed momentum in other altcoins as liquidity moves within the market rather than exiting it. This trend indicates an expansion phase where capital is redeploying into Ethereum and select altcoins, while simultaneously reducing BTC’s market share. The rotation means that confidence remains intact as investors seek higher returns beyond BTC. BTC Hasn’t Topped Yet While Bitcoin’s pause has triggered rotation into Ethereum and altcoins, SwissBlock argued that the broader cycle for the world’s largest crypto itself remains unfinished. According to BTC Vector’s Optimal Signal, each major expansion in this cycle has lasted 15-30 days, while the current rally is only on day 12. With capital beginning to rotate into Ethereum, it indicates that the cycle remains incomplete. To top that, Glassnode’s Short-Term Holder Relative Unrealized Profit also remains well below levels seen during previous cycle tops in January and April 2024, which means that market participants are not exhibiting excessive profit-taking or euphoria yet. Additionally, both Willy Woo’s Speculation Index and VWAP Liquidity confirm that the market is not overheated, as neither indicator has reached prior cycle extremes. These factors together suggest there is ongoing structural support for Bitcoin to move higher.

Speaking on Wednesday at the opening of the China International Supply Chain Expo, the co-founder of the California chip designer praised LLMs from mainland firms such as DeepSeek, Alibaba, MiniMax, Baidu, and Tencent. He called the models “world-class” and noted they were shared openly despite being developed in China, adding that such sharing had sped up AI progress all over the world. Huang said the open‑source AI in China was acting as “a catalyst for global progress” and was giving “every country and industry a chance to join the AI revolution”. The expo, which runs through Sunday in Beijing, marked his third trip to the Chinese capital this year. Instead of his more usual leather jacket, Huang appeared as the guest of honor in a business suit. H20 chip sales in China will start soon Nvidia is preparing to restart sales of its H20 GPUs . This line of processors has been tailored for China. The company has already received word from Washington that export licenses would be approved. In a Tuesday statement, the company said the H20 was less powerful than its flagship accelerators but met U.S. trade rules. “I’m very happy that the export control has been lifted on H20 so that we can serve the market,” Huang said in an interview later that day. Soon after Nvidia’s notice, Tencent confirmed it was applying to buy the chips, Reuters reported. ByteDance, owner of TikTok, said a similar report about its own application was “not accurate”. The chip maker also plans to introduce a new RTX PRO graphics card for China, saying the part will fit digital‑twin uses in smart factories. Nvidia has gained fresh access to a huge AI market Gaining fresh access to China, one of the world’s largest spenders on AI, is timely for Nvidia. Bank of America expects AI funding in the country to jump 48 percent this year to about US$98 billion. Nvidia, which recently crossed the US$4 trillion mark in market value, stands to benefit from that surge, while Chinese developers gain quicker access to high‑end computing power. In January, Nvidia’s shares briefly fell 17 percent when the launch of DeepSeek highlighted how efficiently some Chinese teams could train large language models. The stock has since rebounded, and the company’s market capitalization again rose past US$4 trillion. Huang reminded the audience on Wednesday that over 1.5 million Chinese developers are building Nvidia’s platforms. He credited researchers, programmers, and entrepreneurs for what he called the country’s “super‑fast innovation”. Looking ahead, Huang predicted that in the next 10 years, the most advanced factories in China will rely on AI and robots rather than human workers for dangerous or repetitive tasks. Automation and ML, he said, will become as basic to industry as electricity or the internet. “Today, AI is fundamental infrastructure,” he told the expo audience. “It is revolutionizing the supply chain, changing how we build and move things.” He added that a large number of Chinese projects are using Nvidia’s Omniverse to create digital twins, to fine‑tune and design warehouses and factories before physical construction.

The developers aim to build a next-generation blockchain capable of competing with centralized exchanges ( CEX ) and traditional finance ( TradFi ) platforms like Nasdaq . Achievements in the First Half of 2025 In the first half of 2025, the BNB Chain team implemented two hard forks: Lorentz and Maxwell . These upgrades dramatically improved the network’s core performance metrics: Block time was reduced from 3 seconds to 0.75 seconds Transaction finality accelerated from 7.5 seconds to 1.875 seconds Average transaction fee dropped to $0.01 Malicious MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks fell by 95% The network also handled a peak load of 17.6 million transactions in a single day, with an average daily trading volume of $9.3 billion . Goals for the Second Half of 2025 In the second half of 2025, the primary focus will shift to scaling . Developers aim to enable processing of up to 5,000 decentralized exchange (DEX) swaps per second . To achieve this, the BNB Chain team plans to: Increase the block gas limit tenfold , up to 1 billion gas units (1G) Transition to a new client written in Rust to enhance performance Introduce “superinstructions” to optimize complex operations Accelerate access to the State Database (StateDB) These enhancements are designed to significantly improve both capacity and execution efficiency. Next-Generation BNB Chain: Vision for 2026 and Beyond Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, the developers plan to rebuild the network from the ground up , citing limitations in the current architecture. Key features of the next-generation BNB Chain will include: Transaction confirmations under 150 milliseconds Throughput of over 20,000 transactions per second (TPS) , even for complex DeFi operations Integrated privacy features for transfers and smart contracts A simplified Web2-style user experience , including support for multi-signature wallets “The next phase of BNB Chain will make on-chain access as intuitive as logging into your favorite app—while giving you full control over your assets,” the team stated in the roadmap announcement.

Bitcoin Consolidates With ETH, SUI, SEI Among Those Taking Charge",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/16/is-a-crypto-altcoin-season-here-bitcoin-consolidates-as-alts-take-charge,"Bitcoin triumphantly formed a series of fresh record highs last week, eventually topping out just shy of $124,000 as profit taking emerged. The rise has paved the way for what many are describing as the latest ""altcoin season,"" which involves crypto tokens other than bitcoin making often exponential moves to the upside. The recent bitcoin bull market has just been that: a bitcoin bull market with altcoins taking the back seat as institutions rallied around spot bitcoin ETFs and BTC-based treasuries. But there has been a change in behavior this week. Several altcoins have posted gains of between 50% and 80% as capital begins to flow from the world's dominant crypto to more speculative bets. Ether had a good week on the back of a wave of institutional interest, rising by 23.3% compared to bitcoin's 9.3% gain. Other layer-1 blockchains like SEI and SUI also performed well, increasing by 41% and 36%, respectively. Are we in an altcoin season? Altcoin seasons in previous bull markets have been a culmination of euphoria, speculative and viral moves often led by crypto influencers and celebrities. This time around it appears more precise and surgical, altcoins tied to projects with a lot of activity like SUI are the tokens moving. The data is also showing early signs of an altcoin season, CryptoQuant's MRVR-based altcoin season indicator has ticked into altcoin season for consecutive weeks for the first time since June 2024, indicating a shift in momentum. MVRV shows the market value's relative position to BTC and ETH, during previous bullish cycles the indicator was in an altcoin season for months at a time. Furthermore, the meme coin dominance chart has been on a significant downtrend since the turn of the year after botched meme coins issued by U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. The shift away from meme coins suggest that the this period of the cycle may be categorized by tokens tied to projects with merit rising as opposed to speculative high and euphoria. CoinDesk's CD20 index has also outperformed the CD5 index , the latter of which just considers BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA while the CD20 includes more altcoins, further demonstrating a transition into a bullish market for altcoins. CoinMarketCap's altcoin season barometer has also ticked up to 36 out of 100, a level seen just once in the past 90 days. What happens next The altcoin market is still heavily reliant on BTC. If bitcoin continues to consolidate above prior record highs at $112,000, altcoins are primed for a continued move to the upside. However, if bitcoin continues its ascent into unchartered territories, or if it breaks below $112,00, the altcoin market will underperform against BTC. This is because altcoins lack sufficient liquidity to deal with major price swings and if BTC continues to move to the upside, capital will be allocated to chasing that rally while altcoins take a back seat.",Markets|altcoin|alt season|Bull Market|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 15:39:28

While tech-savvy populations and economic instability drive adoption in some regions, others are strategically integrating digital assets into national development plans. This global shift offers massive opportunity, but also raises a critical challenge for crypto founders: how to gain visibility and trust in different markets. That’s where Outset PR plays a pivotal role. This review explores the top five countries leading the charge in crypto adoption this year: India, Bhutan, El Salvador, Nigeria, and Vietnam. India: The Retail Adoption Giant India continues to dominate global rankings with the largest number of cryptocurrency users—over 100 million, according to estimates by Triple-A . Despite regulatory ambiguity, Indian users have embraced crypto for investments, remittances, and participation in DeFi ecosystems. 🔹 Key Drivers: A rapidly digitizing economy with high mobile and internet penetration A booming startup and blockchain developer ecosystem Popular platforms like WazirX and CoinDCX providing local onramps 🔹 Use Cases: Retail investing and trading International remittances from the Indian diaspora NFT and gaming markets gaining traction among Gen Z 🔹 Challenges: Heavy taxation (30% on crypto gains) and lack of a dedicated regulatory framework may limit future growth if not addressed. Bottom Line: India’s crypto momentum is grassroots-led, massive in scale, and largely resilient to policy turbulence. Bhutan: The Sustainable Sovereign Crypto Model Bhutan is the quiet powerhouse in 2025’s crypto landscape, turning heads with its green Bitcoin mining, sovereign holdings, and national merchant adoption. Backed by abundant hydropower, the country has built a reputation for sustainable mining and forward-thinking digital asset policy. 🔹 Key Drivers: Over $1 billion in Bitcoin reserves held by Druk Holdings National strategy to integrate BTC, ETH, and BNB into the treasury Partnership with Binance Pay enabling crypto payments across 1,000+ merchants 🔹 Use Cases: State mining operations using renewable energy Tourism and retail payments in crypto Institutional investment and diversification 🔹 Innovations: The Gelephu Mindfulness City project integrates blockchain, green tech, and digital assets as part of a sustainable economic future. Bottom Line: Bhutan exemplifies a nation-state crypto model blending ecological sustainability with digital finance leadership. El Salvador: The Legal Tender Pioneer In 2021, El Salvador made history as the first country to declare Bitcoin legal tender. While the initial push was met with global scrutiny, 2025 reveals a more balanced approach—with BTC still central to national reserves but no longer mandatory for merchants. 🔹 Key Drivers: Sovereign Bitcoin holdings exceed 6,000 BTC, now worth over $300M–600M Educational campaigns, Bitcoin bonds, and the ""Bitcoin City"" development project Legal infrastructure created by the Bitcoin Law 🔹 Challenges: Low public adoption: Less than 2% of the population actively uses Bitcoin Minimal impact on remittance flows and financial inclusion despite state efforts 🔹 Adjustments: The government softened legal tender mandates in 2025 to align with IMF guidance, focusing on voluntary usage and infrastructure. Bottom Line: El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey remains symbolically and geopolitically significant, though grassroots adoption is limited. Nigeria: Crypto for Financial Survival Nigeria ranks among the top countries for grassroots crypto adoption, especially in peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. With chronic inflation, unstable fiat currency (the Naira), and a young, tech-adept population, crypto has become a financial lifeline. 🔹 Key Drivers: High inflation and limited access to traditional banking Broad adoption of stablecoins like USDT via platforms such as Binance P2P Youth-led digital innovation and freelancing boom 🔹 Use Cases: Daily savings and payments using stablecoins Remittances and cross-border transactions Hedge against local currency devaluation 🔹 Policy Landscape: The Central Bank has shifted from outright bans to regulatory engagement in 2025, signaling a more cooperative approach. Bottom Line: Nigeria showcases real-world crypto utility in response to systemic financial challenges. Vietnam: The Crypto-Gaming Nexus Vietnam continues to impress with a strong mix of grassroots crypto adoption, DeFi engagement, and a booming blockchain gaming sector. From retail investors to developers, Vietnam is a top player in Southeast Asia’s digital economy. 🔹 Key Drivers: Birthplace of Axie Infinity, a pioneer in play-to-earn (P2E) gaming High mobile penetration and youth engagement Fast-growing DeFi ecosystem 🔹 Use Cases: P2E gaming income and NFT trading Crypto savings and trading platforms (e.g., ONUS) Digital remittances among overseas Vietnamese 🔹 Market Dynamics: Despite cautious government oversight, crypto remains a mainstream financial tool in many Vietnamese households. Bottom Line: Vietnam blends tech innovation with financial opportunity, making crypto a vital part of its digital economy. A Multipolar Crypto World The top five countries in 2025 reflect a diverse set of crypto adoption models: Country Adoption Type Distinctive Trait India Mass retail World's largest crypto user base Bhutan Institutional Green mining + merchant adoption El Salvador Legal + symbolic First Bitcoin legal tender, still evolving Nigeria Grassroots survival Crypto as a hedge against inflation Vietnam Hybrid innovation Gaming + DeFi fueling national interest These nations prove that crypto adoption is not one-size-fits-all. Whether driven by necessity, opportunity, or strategy, digital assets are becoming increasingly embedded in national economic fabrics across the globe.

XRPL-powered digital deeds enable fast, transparent, and secure real estate transactions. Fractional ownership model opens the market to smaller investors globally. Project demonstrates Dubai and Ripple’s leadership in bridging traditional assets with blockchain technology. XRP Ledger to Anchor Dubai’s Digital Property Market Ripple has announced a major collaboration with UAE-based tokenization platform Ctrl Alt to revolutionize Dubai’s real estate sector by tokenizing property title deeds on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This landmark initiative, unveiled on July 16, not only cements Ripple’s footprint in the Middle East but also positions Dubai at the leading edge of government-backed blockchain adoption. How the Project Works Ctrl Alt will leverage Ripple’s institutional-grade digital asset custody solutions to safeguard and manage tokenized property deeds. These deeds, issued by the Dubai Land Department (DLD), will be stored and transacted directly on the XRPL—a public blockchain known for its speed, cost efficiency, and security. For the first time in the Middle East , a government real estate registry will mint title deeds as digital tokens. This digitization enables: Instant settlement: Paperwork and transfer times are reduced from days to seconds. Transparent ownership: Transfer histories are fully auditable on-chain. Fractional ownership: Investors can buy tokenized shares of property, starting from as little as AED 2,000 (roughly USD $545), democratizing access to Dubai’s premium real estate market. Compliance and Security at the Forefront Ctrl Alt recently became the first company in Dubai to secure a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), making it authorized to offer compliant issuance, custody, and management of tokenized assets. This partnership also marks Ripple’s first major custody collaboration in the UAE. Ripple’s global custody network, spanning Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, will now support compliant custody and settlement for institutional and retail investors entering the UAE real estate market via digital assets. Driving Dubai’s Blockchain Vision Dubai has rapidly emerged as a global hub for digital assets, seeking to modernize its property sector and attract international investment. By using the XRP Ledger for government-backed tokenization, Dubai enhances transparency, lowers barriers to entry, and makes its real estate market accessible to a wider pool of investors. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized the project’s transformative impact: “The Dubai Land Department’s Real Estate Tokenization Project is a perfect example of forward-thinking innovation that places Dubai at the heart of the global digital asset industry. Having the XRPL as the foundation reinforces its credentials as the blockchain of choice for real financial applications.” Future Implications and Global Outlook This move indicates Dubai’s ambition to be at the forefront of blockchain adoption in real estate, showcasing a scalable and secure model for other jurisdictions. The capability to tokenize and trade real estate shares 24/7 broadens access to otherwise illiquid assets and enables property developers to tap into new sources of capital without traditional debt. Ripple has continued to bolster its presence in the region, recently securing regulatory approval for its stablecoin RLUSD in the Dubai International Financial Centre and forming partnerships with local banks and fintech firms. As Ripple and Ctrl Alt set a new benchmark in tokenized real estate, all eyes will be on Dubai as a pioneer of digital asset innovation and regulatory progress in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain-powered finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-16 15:51:03

These adjustments could impact the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Which digital coins are positioned to thrive amidst these shifts? The article delves into the potential consequences and identifies the cryptocurrencies ready for a new wave of growth. This review is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native public relations agency. It leverages data, trend insights, and market dynamics to transform fleeting opportunities into sustained visibility and long-term growth for Web3 leaders. Bitcoin Shows Positive Momentum with Upward Growth Potential Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is currently moving between the low 111,000s to the high 122,000s, indicating a recent upward trend. Over the past week, Bitcoin has increased by over 8%, while the past month saw an upward shift of about 11%. In the last six months, it gained over 17%. The nearest resistance stands around 126,000, and if surpassed, it could aim for the upper 137,000s. This suggests room for substantial growth from today's levels. Investors are eyeing whether Bitcoin can break through these resistance points, which could drive the price higher. Monitoring support levels near 103,000 and 92,000 could also offer insights into potential pullbacks. Ethereum Eyes Growth with Recent Price Surge Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing promising movement in its current price range of just over two and a half thousand to over three thousand dollars. Recently, Ethereum's price has jumped by more than 18% in the past week alone. This could signal good news for investors. If it keeps climbing, it may face some challenges around the nearest resistance level, about ten percent higher than the current top range. But should it break through this point, the second resistance suggests the potential to rally much further, reaching nearly 23% from the present level. While it has dipped in the past months, this positive momentum hints that Ethereum could be bouncing back.

48357673,954d8cfc-4488-4c6f-a97c-f584fbe40423,1752681486,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/48357673.jpeg,Q2 2025: From Balance Sheets to Benchmarks,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/07/16/q2-2025-from-balance-sheets-to-benchmarks,"What looked like a rebound at first glance reflected something deeper; a change in the nature of demand. As digital assets rallied, institutional flows became more targeted, and corporate balance sheets emerged as a key driver of market structure. Bitcoin rose 29.8%, reaching a new all-time high in June, according to CoinDesk Data, but it was the nature of the buyers, not just the size of the move, that marked a turning point. With public companies increasing their BTC holdings by nearly 20%, and expanding into assets like ETH, SOL and XRP, corporate treasury adoption has entered a new phase, with the potential to reshape the asset landscape. Corporate treasuries take the lead Bitcoin’s performance in Q2 was not led by retail flows or leveraged positions. Instead, capital came from corporate treasuries. Public companies added nearly 850,000 BTC to their balance sheets by quarter-end, marking a 19.6% increase. For the third consecutive quarter, corporates outpaced ETFs in net accumulation, reinforcing the shift in long-term holders. The message from listed firms was clear: bitcoin is moving from speculation to allocation. Bitcoin is no longer the only asset benefiting from this trend. Public companies now hold over $1.4 billion in altcoins. ETH accounts for the majority, but firms are increasingly looking beyond the top two. Solana has seen corporate accumulation, while TRX, XRP and even BNB are beginning to feature in strategic announcements. Nano Labs, for example, unveiled a $1 billion initiative to accumulate BNB. Meanwhile, Tridentity and Webus.vip are planning substantial capital raises to support XRP buys. This level of activity, previously confined to BTC, is now spreading across the broader market. ETH reclaims market share, Aave tops index rankings Ethereum, which had lagged in earlier quarters, reclaimed its footing with a 36.4% rise in Q2, CoinDesk Data shows. Flows into ETH ETFs turned positive, and have now remained so for eight consecutive weeks. Adjusted for market cap, these flows are nearly on par with BTC, marking a convergence in sentiment. The 30% uplift in ETH/BTC hinted at a strategic rebalancing, with allocators rotating back into ether. Beyond ETH, Aave delivered the strongest performance within the CoinDesk 20 Index, gaining 72% in the quarter based on CoinDesk Data, as lending activity hit all-time highs and vePENDLE collateral was added to the protocol. Institutional relevance is beginning to take shape here too. The upcoming Aave v4 upgrade, along with the Horizon initiative aimed at tokenised real-world assets, positions the protocol for greater adoption beyond crypto-native circles. Solana keeps pace, but loses spotlight Solana returned 24.3% in the quarter, according to CoinDesk Data, and retained its position as the leading chain by application-level revenue. However, it underperformed both bitcoin and ether. Despite solid fundamentals, investor flows were directed elsewhere. Capital concentrated in assets with more mature ETF infrastructure and longer-established treasury narratives. Even the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana staking ETF, which attracted $12 million on its debut trading day, was not enough to reignite momentum. That said, investor interest is still building. The recent Pump.fun token generation event is drawing attention from both ends of the spectrum. On one side are speculative participants, while on the other are value-driven investors assessing the project’s revenue potential. Treasury activity also continues to rise, with over one million SOL now held by corporations such as SOL Strategies and DeFi Development Corp. Narrower gains, clearer signals The second quarter confirmed what the first quarter had suggested: leadership in digital assets is narrowing, and the market is rewarding clarity. The CoinDesk 20 Index rose by 22.1%, although only four constituents outperformed it: Aave, bitcoin cash, ether and bitcoin. The CoinDesk 80 declined by 0.78%, while the CDMEME Index ended the quarter up 27.8% despite a 109% spike in May (based on data from CoinDesk Indices). Outside the majors, most assets lacked consistent inflows or structural support, leaving them prone to retracements. Bitcoin and ether both saw their index weights decline by over five percentage points. This made space for assets that posted stronger returns, but it did not meaningfully change the composition of leadership. Aave and BCH still represent a small fraction of the index, reflecting the reality that outperformance alone is not enough to shift structural weightings. Liquidity and credibility remain prerequisites. Benchmarks as allocation tools As adoption broadens and corporate behaviour becomes more material to price action, benchmarks are playing a more active role in capital decisions. With more than $15 billion in cumulative trading volume since launch, the CoinDesk 20 is now both a measure of market direction and a foundation for building structured exposure. The rally in Q2 was real, but more importantly, it was orderly. Allocators are not trend-chasers. They are building frameworks. Benchmarks, indices and ETFs are at the centre of this evolution.

While analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Cardano’s potential breakout, a lesser-known DeFi player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is quietly turning heads with a powerful momentum of its own. MUTM currently sells at a price of $0.03 at stage 5 of presale, over 70% now sold. Phase 5 investors will be able to witness a guaranteed 100% ROI return on listing. The project has already passed over $12.4 million and onboarded over 13400 investors as of now. Mutuum Finance can reach $6 with the 10,000% forecast after launching live. With volatility high and investor sentiment split, the crypto market is bracing for Mutuum Finance. Analysts Signal a Modest Surge for Cardano, Will It Break $1? Recent updates show Cardano (ADA) trading near $0.73, recovering from sub‑$0.68 lows and breaking past resistance in the $0.70–$0.75 zone, a move that technical analysts suggest could pave the way toward the $1 threshold. Forecast models from platforms like CoinCodex predict ADA may inch higher within $0.73–$0.95 for July, with a medium‑term trajectory toward $1.00–$1.15 by year’s end, and even bullish targets up to $1.90 should momentum continue. In a broader context, multiple analysts believe once ADA sustains volumes above its recent support range $0.68, it could stage a gradual climb, though overextended resistance near $0.76–$0.80 may pose short‑term consolidation risks. Amid these projections, don’t overlook emerging developments from Mutuum Finance, which may add unexpected dynamics to ADA’s outlook. Mutuum Finance Presale Exceeds $12.4M as Growth Expands Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already enrolled over 13400 investors and raised $12.4 million, owing to its cutting-edge two-way lending model. MUTM currently trades at $0.03, but will increase even further in the following stages and go live at $0.06. This guarantees all phase 5 investors a 2x return at go-live. Additionally, MUTM will exceed $6.6, giving a 100x ROI. Mutuum Finance Scores 95.0 in CertiK Audit A CertiK smart contract audit has established that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) codebase has excellent levels of transparency with a trust score of 95.0/100. Backed by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform establishes a secure foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is merging leading-edge lending features with the strength of an ecosystem, having a clear path to the future of DeFi. Apart from augmenting its ecosystem more, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing an Ethereum-based, fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD. With the opposite of algorithmic models that depeg, the stablecoin built thus far will be such that it provides long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to retail and institutional customers. Mutuum Finance Smart Lending Mutuum Finance is Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending hybrid, offering customers great returns and total control over transactions, respectively. The platforms for lending provide end-to-end DeFi seamless experience best matched to user requirements and more secure, clearer, and more flexible than the conventional centralized lending products. As Cardano (ADA) edges toward the $1 mark, all eyes are on whether it can maintain upward momentum. But for those watching the broader DeFi market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a real coin, combining a dual lending model, top-tier security audits, and a fast-moving presale now 70% sold out at $0.03. With a launch price of $0.06 and long-term projections pushing as high as $6, the opportunity for early participation is quickly narrowing. Head to the official site now to explore the project and take part in the presale before the next price increase.

ETH broke above the $3,200 level for the first time since early February, gaining 6.5% over the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows. It's now ahead a full 22% over the past seven days. Bitcoin BTC also bounced back above $119,000 during the early hours of the U.S. session, climbing 2.6%. The CoinDesk 20 index , a broad-based benchmark focusing on majors, was up 4.5%. BTC investors bought this week's dip to $116,000 from record highs hand over fist, analytics firm Glassnode noted . According to the firm's data, market participants ""stepped in aggressively,"" scooping up around 196,600 BTC ($23 billion) between the $116,000 and $118,000 levels. Meanwhile, strong flows to spot exchange-traded funds and continuous bid from crypto treasury firms are providing a tailwind for ETH. U.S.-listed spot ETH ETFs booked record inflows over $900 million last week, accounting for 29% of all inflows this year, Anagram partner David Shuttleworth noted . At $450 million with only two days into the week, inflows could surpass $1 billion this week, he added. Sharplink Gaming (SBET) revealed this week it acquired more than 74,000 ETH with $257 million capital remaining for further purchases, while Bitmine Immersion (BMNR) bought over $500 million of the asset.

As of now, XRP is trading around $2.96, having pulled back modestly from a recent high near $3. This slight correction comes after a strong intraday rally, with price action swinging from lows of $2.85 to nearly $2.99. Despite the pullback, sentiment remains bullish, and market momentum suggests that another attempt to push above $3 may arrive sooner than expected. XRP Tests Resistance After Reclaiming $3 XRP’s brief move above the $3 mark marked a significant milestone, reawakening investor interest and triggering renewed speculation about an extended breakout. Analysts emphasize that this level now serves as both a psychological and technical barrier. With XRP quickly approaching it again, a confirmed close above $3 could usher in the next bullish phase. Won’t take long for $XRP to be above $3 again. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 16, 2025 The recent bounce was supported by rising trading volumes and increasing buying pressure, signaling strength among bulls. As XRP consolidates just below resistance, many believe it’s building energy for a sustainable surge. Institutional Tailwinds and Whale Accumulation A major catalyst supporting this bullish outlook is the upcoming launch of ProShares’ XRP futures ETF, set to go live on July 18. As the first XRP-related ETF to gain approval from the SEC, it’s expected to inject a wave of institutional capital into the XRP ecosystem. Meanwhile, on-chain data has shown an uptick in large investor activity. A multi-million XRP transfer into Coinbase was recorded just days before the ETF announcement, suggesting strategic positioning by whales. Additionally, the number of XRP wallets holding over 1 million tokens has reached a new high, underscoring growing long-term confidence. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts Forecast a Move Beyond $3 Market analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s trajectory. Some have identified bullish technical formations, including symmetrical triangle breakouts and a rare “fulcrum” pattern, which historically precede large moves. Forecasts range from initial targets around $3.40 to extended projections near $4.80, depending on market momentum. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has also weighed in, pointing to conditions that could support a rapid price advance if XRP clears the $3 threshold with conviction. Farina’s Confidence and the Broader Narrative Edo Farina’s remarks echo his longstanding belief that XRP remains significantly undervalued. Earlier this year, he warned that selling around $3 could be one of the worst financial mistakes an investor could make, citing constrained future supply and the prospect of institutional adoption. His recent post reinforces that view, suggesting the pullback is only temporary and that a breakout is imminent. For many XRP holders, Farina’s confidence is more than sentiment; it aligns with the evolving fundamentals and macro developments now supporting the asset. Final Outlook Though XRP has briefly slipped below $3 after reclaiming it, the retracement is widely seen as a consolidation phase rather than a reversal. With ETF-driven momentum building, growing whale accumulation, and bullish technicals converging, the market appears primed for another push. Farina’s words may soon prove prophetic: it may not take long for XRP to rise, and stay, above $3. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Together, they are changing the way property ownership works in the city by tokenizing real estate property title deeds. As announced in a recent X post, this project will use blockchain technology , specifically the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This move is poised to open the door to a faster, safer, and more inclusive real estate market in Dubai. Making Real Estate In Dubai Safer with Blockchain Real estate in Dubai has long attracted global investors, but the traditional process of buying and selling property remains complex. The Dubai Land Department hopes to simplify this process by using Ripple and Ctrl Alt’s blockchain solutions. Tokenized property titles will allow shared ownership of premium properties. This means more people can invest in Dubai real estate without needing to purchase an entire unit. It also opens up access for smaller investors while maintaining high standards of compliance and security. Furthermore, putting property title deeds on the blockchain will also make deals faster and easier to track. It will help people buy and sell these assets more easily, like trading shares. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s leader in the Middle East and Africa, said Dubai is showing outstanding leadership with this move. He stated that it is the first time a Middle Eastern government has fully tokenized title deeds on a public blockchain. Merrick believes the Dubai Land Department is setting a strong example for other governments exploring digital asset adoption. Ctrl Alt Strengthens Tokenization Efforts with VARA License Ctrl Alt is playing a major role in this project. The company recently received a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). This license allows Ctrl Alt to manage the full lifecycle of tokenized assets; from issuance to custody. Meanwhile, this is not Ctrl Alt’s first experience with tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). The company has already tokenized over $325 million in assets, including real estate, private credit, and investment funds. Ripple’s Expanding Presence in the UAE Ripple’s partnership with Ctrl Alt is part of its growing footprint in the Middle East . The company was the first blockchain-based payments provider to receive a license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). Ripple has also collaborated with Zand Bank and recently gained approval for its stablecoin, RLUSD, within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). With more than 60 licenses worldwide, the company is becoming a trusted partner for institutions looking to adopt digital assets in a safe and regulated way. The UAE has a GDP of approximately $277 billion, indicating the significant potential for economic growth. With its latest significant strides, Dubai is positioning itself as a leader in financial innovation in the region.

""We've done a lot of work.” He added that BofA is still gauging how large the opportunity might be and how much customer demand exists. “We are still trying to figure out how big or small it is, because in some places there are not big amounts of money movement. So you would expect us all to move, our company to move on that,” he said. Moynihan said the bank would likely roll out a stablecoin in partnership with other firms, but only once there is clearer client demand — something he suggested is still emerging. His remarks come as Congress inches closer to passing legislation to regulate stablecoins. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, passed the Senate in June but stalled in the House earlier this week when two key provisions failed to advance. Most of Wall Street isn’t waiting.

Separately, the Commerce Ministry said it would impose new export rules on key battery technologies to safeguard China’s lead in the field. During the State Council meeting on July 16, officials pledged to rein in “ irrational competition ” across China’s EV industry. They vowed to enforce market order and to increase efforts to monitor prices, according to state media. The session stressed that firms should focus on innovation and product quality rather than resort to deep discounts. Authorities also said they would monitor the sector closely to maintain stability. State broadcaster China Central Television carried the report. CCTV noted officials offered no details about their plans to support innovation or quality improvements. The move follows top-party directives to temper aggressive price slashing among EV makers. While the world’s second-largest economy is on track to meet its official 5% goal for expansion in 2025, officials warned a steep drop in prices could slow the growth. In April, BYD Co. sold a higher number of EVs in Europe than Tesla, for the first time, according to industry figures. Due to this success, tensions increased with the United States and the European Union, which have cautioned that a flood of cheaper Chinese vehicles could harm their domestic auto sectors. Last month, Beijing summoned the chief executives of large EV companies, including BYD, and urged them to “self‑regulate” by avoiding unjust price reductions. China is making significant advances in vehicle battery technology In a separate announcement on July 15, the Commerce Ministry said any overseas transfer of eight key battery manufacturing technologies would require a government license. The rule applies to exports via trade, investment, or technical partnerships and takes effect immediately. Officials said the measure could cement China’s leading position in EV battery production and discourage Chinese automakers from establishing factories abroad. Chinese firms have made significant breakthroughs in battery design over the last 5 years, cutting costs while extending driving range. The latest generation of lithium‑ion cells relies on iron and phosphate, a cheaper and safer mix compared with nickel, cobalt, and manganese blends. These batteries sit at the heart of China’s ability to build electric vehicles at prices below those of many petrol and rival EV models overseas. The EU has pressed Chinese battery and car producers to establish factories within its borders, a condition for constant sales growth. The US is more cautious but is reviewing plans for two Chinese battery plants in Michigan. If approved, those plants would be among the first major Chinese battery facilities in the United States. These new battery export rules come almost 3 months after Beijing introduced export licenses for seven rare earths and magnets. This move has already shaken Western and Japanese firms that rely on those materials for robots, advanced electric motors, and cars. Shenzhen-based BYD, which overtook Tesla recently as the world’s largest electric car manufacturer, unveiled its lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery 5 years ago, replacing expensive NCM with phosphate and iron to reduce fire risks. Rival Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) in Ningde unveiled a similar design shortly after. In comparison, companies from South Korea, Germany, Japan, and the United States still mainly rely on NCM batteries.

Last month, I released a white paper explaining that conservative investors should allocate 10% to crypto, moderate clients should invest 25% and aggressive investors should place 40% of their portfolios into crypto. Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset class for 12 of the past 15 years , and it’s highly likely that it will continue to do so for years to come. Institutions are investing like never before. Congress and the administration now fully support crypto, and we’re beginning to get the regulatory clarity we’ve wanted. The SEC and FINRA’s prohibitions that blocked brokerage firms from trading or custodying crypto have been rescinded. The OCC and the Fed have revoked similar prohibitions against banks, and the Department of Labor has rescinded its objection that prevented 401(k) plans from offering bitcoin as an investment option. Despite the growth and performance of bitcoin, I keep seeing suggestions that people ought to allocate only 1 or 2 percent to crypto. In my opinion, that is no longer enough. Crypto is no longer speculative. It is no longer niche. It now deserves to be treated as a core allocation. Consider this hypothetical illustration, comparing a traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks/bonds to portfolios that hold 10 percent, 25 percent or 40 percent in bitcoin. Let’s assume we invest $100 for five years, earning 7 percent annually in the 60/40 allocation. Let’s also look at two extreme outcomes: bitcoin either becomes worthless, or it rises in five years to $1 million (roughly a 10x increase from today). As you see in the chart below, the $100 invested in the 60/40 portfolio rises to $140 after five years. Not bad. But the portfolio with a 25 percent bitcoin allocation could be worth more than 250 percent more. Even if bitcoin were to become worthless (and you held it all the way to zero), your portfolio would still be profitable – with a value above your original investment. Seems to me that the risk/reward ratio strongly favors a significant crypto allocation – and certainly one that’s far higher than a measly 1 or 2 percent. Potential Range of Portfolio Returns Based on Bitcoin Allocation Bitcoin’s price appreciation isn’t speculation – it’s just supply and demand. In Q1 2025, public companies purchased 95,000 bitcoins – more than double the new supply. And that’s from just one category of buyers – it ignores additional demand from retail investors, financial advisors, family offices, hedge funds, institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds. This massive imbalance between supply and demand is driving bitcoin’s price to all-time highs. I predict that bitcoin will reach $500,000 by 2030 – a 5x increase as of this writing. The adoption curve has tremendous room to run – supporting the thesis that there is substantial upside yet to come in bitcoin’s price.

Outset PR equips leaders with the tools to shape discussions, seize opportunities, and ensure ongoing market relevance. Bitcoin Shows Positive Momentum with Upward Growth Potential Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is currently moving between the low 111,000s to the high 122,000s, indicating a recent upward trend. Over the past week, Bitcoin has increased by over 8%, while the past month saw an upward shift of about 11%. In the last six months, it gained over 17%. The nearest resistance stands around 126,000, and if surpassed, it could aim for the upper 137,000s. This suggests room for substantial growth from today's levels. Investors are eyeing whether Bitcoin can break through these resistance points, which could drive the price higher. Monitoring support levels near 103,000 and 92,000 could also offer insights into potential pullbacks. Ethereum Eyes Growth with Recent Price Surge Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing promising movement in its current price range of just over two and a half thousand to over three thousand dollars. Recently, Ethereum's price has jumped by more than 18% in the past week alone. This could signal good news for investors. If it keeps climbing, it may face some challenges around the nearest resistance level, about ten percent higher than the current top range. But should it break through this point, the second resistance suggests the potential to rally much further, reaching nearly 23% from the present level. While it has dipped in the past months, this positive momentum hints that Ethereum could be bouncing back.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-and-stellar-xlm-now-align-with-swift-gpi-heres-how/,"Crypto investor Mr. Man has highlighted the evolving alignment between emerging blockchain technologies and the traditional financial infrastructure, drawing particular attention to assets and platforms that are positioning themselves to become integral to the next generation of payment systems. His analysis focuses on how projects like Ripple, Stellar, Stronghold, Quant, and Chainlink are no longer positioned at the margins of financial systems but are now integrating directly with regulated payment infrastructure through protocols such as ISO 20022 and SWIFT gpi. This observation coincides with institutional developments documented in a recent U.S. Federal Reserve report, which outlines the reasons for adopting ISO 20022 messaging standards for wire transfer systems. The report underscores the shift toward a unified, standardized data format, emphasizing benefits such as global momentum, interoperability, regulatory efficiency, and innovation. ISO 20022 Integration and Asset Positioning According to Mr. Man, both Ripple and Stellar have strategically aligned with SWIFT’s Global Payments Innovation (gpi) and ISO 20022 frameworks. These protocols are being adopted globally, especially by central banks and domestic clearing systems. Ripple’s architecture, for example, supports liquidity bridging across borders, while Stellar is optimized for remittance use cases with compliance requirements. He notes that Stronghold (SHX) already operates within the U.S. financial system as a registered participant under NACHA, the organization governing the ACH network. SHX facilitates token-to-bank routing over established rails, making it a practical solution for real-time asset conversion in compliance-focused environments. Ripple and Stellar in particular are now aligned with SWIFT gpi, ISO 20022, and central bank use cases. Stronghold (SHX) is already registered with NACHA and operates over ACH rails. Quant’s Overledger allows blockchains and banks to interoperate over common protocols. Chainlink… pic.twitter.com/mfPd8ZrRY2 — Mr. Man (@MrManXRP) July 13, 2025 These developments coincide with the Federal Reserve’s strategic reasoning to adopt ISO 20022 in the U.S. wire transfer system. One of the report’s key findings, highlighted in the section on interoperability, describes how a single open format simplifies transactions both domestically and globally. This approach reduces reliance on multiple proprietary standards, supporting the trend toward seamless integration of blockchain. Middleware and Interoperability Frameworks Mr. Man refers to technologies like Quant’s Overledger and Chainlink’s oracles as middleware infrastructure. These platforms enable data and transaction interoperability between traditional financial institutions and distributed ledger networks. Overledger connects disparate blockchains with banking systems, while Chainlink delivers real-time compliance data, price feeds, and identity confirmations into settlement processes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This middleware functionality aligns with ISO 20022’s promise of consistent and rich data formats. According to the Federal Reserve report, leveraging a universal data structure can unify disparate messaging systems under a global standard, facilitating smooth communication and integration across platforms. Mr. Man emphasizes that with Fedwire now adopting ISO 20022 natively, the blockchain networks mentioned no longer exist outside the regulatory perimeter. Instead, they serve as gateways, interoperating directly with regulated liquidity venues. Shift in Market Demand and Regulatory Alignment As key payment networks such as Fedwire, ACH, SWIFT, CHIPS, RTP, and even tokenized asset platforms like BlackRock’s BUIDL begin to converge into a unified, programmable liquidity network, Mr. Man argues that demand will favor assets and technologies capable of operating within this regulated framework. He adds that projects unable or unwilling to align with regulatory protocols will be excluded from institutional flows and access to liquidity. In contrast, assets such as XRP, XLM, SHX, QNT, and LINK, which support use cases ranging from liquidity bridging to compliance monitoring and network interoperability, are emerging as foundational components of the system. This view supports the U.S. Federal Reserve’s conclusion that adopting ISO 20022 will enable financial institutions to meet evolving regulatory requirements, reduce operational costs, and bring innovative products to market. A standardized infrastructure enables scalable, compliant innovation, which Mr. Man sees as essential for the next generation of financial networks.

The approval of a futures-based XRP ETF, growing network activity, and rising whale accumulation back the asset’s bullish momentum. Waiting for a New ATH Ripple’s XRP has been one of crypto’s rock stars in the past several weeks, with its price pumping to a five-month high of over $3. Currently, it trades just south of that milestone, representing a 32% increase on a 30-day scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Meanwhile, XRP’s market capitalization surged past $175 billion, thus surpassing Tether’s USDT and becoming the third-biggest cryptocurrency. Somewhat expected, crypto X is rammed with users who believe the asset’s rally is nowhere near its end. The popular analyst Ali Martinez, for instance, predicted that XRP could skyrocket to a new historic peak of $4.80 as long as it secures a weekly close above $3. A weekly close above $3 could send $XRP to a new all-time high of $4.80! pic.twitter.com/fvvq0EpW6j — Ali (@ali_charts) July 16, 2025 Other market observers who have laid their thoughts on the matter include the X users CRYPTOWZRD and Johnny. The former argued that XRP has flipped the old $2.8 resistance target and has turned it into support. “One more bullish daily close here would confirm that flip and set the stage for a move to a new all-time high. The next resistance target is $3.65,” they added. Johnny provided fewer details, simply noticing the token’s impressive performance and forecasting that this could be the move that triggers a new ATH. The Potential Catalysts One factor that may have positively influenced the asset’s price is the recent SEC approval of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF. The product is futures-based, will trade under the ticker UXPR, and is designed to provide twice the daily performance of the token’s price. A spot XRP ETF in the USA has yet to receive the green light from the securities regulator, but the chances for approval remain solid at around 86% (before the end of 2025). XRP ETF Approval, Source: Polymarket The recent growth of XRP’s network and the whales’ activity are also elements that could have contributed to the bull run.

According to Wang, legislative developments in the US, such as the Clarity Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Genius Act, which provide clarity on cryptocurrency regulations, are boosting confidence in Bitcoin. Furthermore, the White House's actions supporting these regulations and the expectation of falling interest rates, coupled with the depreciation of the dollar, will drive investors toward riskier assets. This, Wang argues, creates a strong foundation for Bitcoin's rise. Related News: Ripple's Dubai Landing: Announced Critical Collaboration Wang also stated that the adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset by some countries and the rise of stablecoin initiatives will also increase demand. “Digital assets are poised for growth in a more decentralized and regulated manner than ever before,” Wang said, adding that these developments will push prices higher. Wang made a striking prediction not only about the cryptocurrency market but also about tech giant Nvidia. He claimed that Nvidia shares, currently trading around $170, could reach $200 by the end of the year. He cited the lifting of the Chinese chip ban and the shift of countries toward Nvidia hardware for “sovereign AI” projects as key reasons for this. *This is not investment advice.

As Bitcoin gains momentum, it often influences the broader market, creating potential opportunities for other digital assets. This article delves into the possible ripple effect, examining which coins could be poised for substantial growth. This analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , a crypto-native firm that combines data analysis with communication strategy. It keenly observes trends and timing to help blockchain projects transform pivotal moments into lasting visibility. Ethereum Eyes Growth with Recent Price Surge Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing promising movement in its current price range of just over two and a half thousand to over three thousand dollars. Recently, Ethereum's price has jumped by more than 18% in the past week alone. This could signal good news for investors. If it keeps climbing, it may face some challenges around the nearest resistance level, about ten percent higher than the current top range. But should it break through this point, the second resistance suggests the potential to rally much further, reaching nearly 23% from the present level. While it has dipped in the past months, this positive momentum hints that Ethereum could be bouncing back. Cardano's Steady Climb: What’s Next for ADA? Source: tradingview Cardano's price has been moving between a little over sixty cents and just above eighty cents recently. It gained over 26% in the past week and nearly 17% for the month. The coin sits right above its ten and hundred-day simple moving averages, both at seventy-three cents. While its relative strength shows a balanced momentum, the nearest hurdle is at ninety cents. If Cardano breaks this level, it could target a dollar ten, meaning a potential climb of about 35% from current top levels. However, should it slip, the closest safety net lies around just under fifty cents. This mix of steady movements and promising growth potential keeps traders' eyes on ADA.

The token is on the brink of recovery just days after its explosive July 14 ICO on Solana , which sold out in 12 minutes and raised $600M. Source: CoinGecko Is $PUMP Set for a Major Breakout After $600M ICO? Pump.fun’s launch has positioned it as a transformational force in the memecoins and DeFi environment. Launched on the Solana blockchain, $PUMP is currently trading at $0.006463, representing an 18% gain in just 24 hours. On July 14, 2025, Pump.fun launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for $PUMP, selling 15% of the total supply at $0.004 per token. In just 12 minutes, the offering raised $600 million, instantly placing the token on the radar of traders and analysts alike. The future of capital formation is happening on Solana. $600M raised in 12 minutes. Zero bankers. All while Wall Street was closed.

The project has also seen a daily trading volume of $1.14 billion, has over 48,000 active on-chain holders, and has a total circulating supply of 354 billion tokens. Analysts believe $PUMP is headed for a milestone price of $0.10, indicating even more bullish momentum. If you like it or not $PUMP will trade at $0.10 soon With or without you… pic.twitter.com/rsDuBvMFIM — crypto bullet (@SilverBulletBTC) July 15, 2025 At its core, Pump.fun’s protocols make it radically easy for anyone to create and launch a memecoin, with no coding and no technical barriers. This inclusivity fuels mass participation and experimentation. Every token, including $PUMP, utilizes an automated market-making (AMM) and bonding curve model, allowing prices to auto-adjust based on supply and demand, thereby granting instant liquidity and real-time discovery. But more importantly, Pump.fun solves one of memecoin culture’s biggest problems: rug pulls. When a community-created token reaches a market cap of around $69,000, liquidity is automatically added to decentralized exchanges (such as Raydium), and the LP tokens are burned. This removes the creator’s ability to drain funds, protecting investors from sudden losses. Shortly after launch, Pump.fun received 187,770 $SOL (over $30 million) from fee wallets, generated from its over $700 million in total platform revenue, and still holds 69,420 $SOL worth $11.48 million, and is likely to buy additional $PUMP. In the past 8 hours, PumpFun has spent 118,350 $SOL to buy 2.99B $PUMP and has moved it to another wallet. It has received 187,770 $SOL ($30.59M) (from fee wallets) and still holds 69,420 $SOL worth $11.48M and is likely to buy further $PUMP . Addresses: -… pic.twitter.com/wkGH6bhSPg — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) July 16, 2025 118,350 $SOL was channeled into buying back 2.99 billion $PUMP tokens . This not only stabilized price action but also showed the team’s commitment to longer-term token sustainability and value growth. In a move to enhance passive earning opportunities and market exposure, $PUMP is now live on Bitget with a Launchpool event running from July 15–18, 2025. While the Bitget Launchpool and buybacks fuel bullish sentiment, traders are now closely watching key price levels for confirmation of a sustained rally. Inside PUMP’s Retracement Rally: Volume Exposes the Battle at $0.00670 The PUMP/USDT hourly structure shows a market steadily retracing into deeper Fibonacci levels after a pronounced decline from the $0.007159 high. The rebound from the $0.004796 low hasn’t been rushed—instead, it’s been a steady climb. Price first reclaimed the 0.382 Fib level near $0.005698, then pushed past the 0.5 pivot at $0.005977 before settling into the 0.618 zone around $0.006256. $PUMP/USDT price chart, July 16 (Source: TradingView) However, what is noticed here is that every attempt to push higher has stalled near the 0.786 resistance level ($0.006693). Repeated rejections there hint at a stubborn ceiling that buyers haven’t smashed through yet. Right now, price is caught between the upper barrier and mid-range supports, leaving the market in a tug-of-war. The question isn’t just about momentum; it’s whether bulls can actually hold this ground. The volume footprint on the 15-minute chart reflects this contest between the two sides. $PUMP/USDT volume footprint, July 16 (Source: TradingView) Large green clusters, such as the candle with 123.68 million buys against 74.6 million sells, and the strong thrust of 234.97 million buys over 78.44 million sells, reveal moments of heavy accumulation that drove the price upward. In contrast, intervals with net red deltas, such as -74.15 million and -64.32 million, show aggressive selling that absorbed momentum and checked the rally. These surges and rejections define liquidity zones that may serve as reference points for upcoming sessions, particularly when strong buying footprints coincide with prior price supports in the $0.00620–$0.00640 region. At this stage, the structure suggests a retracement rally operating inside a broader corrective phase, with price attempting to build higher lows against significant resistance. Until a decisive break above $0.00670 occurs, the market remains range‑bound within these Fibonacci markers. Momentum is present but tempered by visible supply overhead, and the volume data shows that buyers are active but not yet dominant enough to overwhelm the offers clustered around the 0.786 retracement. How price behaves on its next test of that resistance, and whether buying deltas remain firm or fade, will reveal whether this rally transitions into a larger impulsive leg or simply completes a retracement before further consolidation.

This listicle also highlights BlockDAG (BDAG) emerging as a breakout force. With over $340M raised, 23.9B coins sold, and 2M miners active on its revolutionary X1 app, it’s becoming hard to ignore. Coupled with the $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release entry, BlockDAG is this year’s most compelling crypto story. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): X1 Miner Tallies 2M Users Amidst $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH Release BlockDAG is shaking up the crypto space by transforming mining into a truly user-friendly experience. Its X1 Miner App has already attracted over 2 million users, proving there’s real demand for mining that doesn’t require expensive rigs or drain your battery. Instead, anyone can earn up to 20 BDAG coins daily, simply by tapping ‘Activate BlockDAG X1’ on their phone, a game-changer in bringing crypto to the masses. This innovative model is fueling explosive growth. BlockDAG’s presale has surged past $340M with 23.9B coins sold, and over 18,500 hardware miners have already been snapped up. These figures showcase a thriving community and signal growing confidence in BlockDAG’s technology and future potential. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release price still locked at $0.0016 until August 11, far below the $0.05 launch target, BlockDAG offers a potential ROI of up to 3,025%. It’s no wonder many analysts are calling it the best crypto to buy in 2025 for those seeking innovation and real user adoption. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Smart Contracts Fuel DeFi Revolution Ethereum remains the go-to network for developers, powering smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs. Its vast developer ecosystem and institutional backing make it the foundation of Web3 innovation, ensuring it maintains a leading role in the next phase of blockchain growth. With upcoming scaling upgrades and robust Layer‑2 adoption, it’s clear why many analysts name ETH the best crypto to buy in 2025. As gas fees drop and staking rewards accumulate, Ethereum offers long-term growth potential and resilience in a market where network effects and versatility count for everything. 3. VeChain (VET): Real‑World Supply Chain Blockchain Breakthrough VeChain stands out for its enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, integrating with global companies to increase transparency and streamline supply chains. The Thor 2.0 upgrade further boosts throughput and compliance, reinforcing its long-term viability in industries like automotive, pharmaceuticals, and food safety. These real-world applications give VeChain tangible utility beyond speculative hype and solidify its position as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025. Analysts highlight VeChain’s ability to enhance logistics, provenance tracking, and carbon analytics, offering a compelling case for investors seeking practical blockchain adoption. 4. Aave (AAVE): Lending Platform with Enduring Strength Aave remains a pillar of decentralized finance, offering non-custodial lending and borrowing across multiple chains. Phase-3 upgrades like Aave V3, cross-chain compatibility, and innovations such as the native GHO stablecoin enhance yield potential and user experience. This blend of innovation and stability makes AAVE stand out among contenders for the best crypto to buy in 2025. With audited smart contracts, deep liquidity, and a growing DAO, AAVE continues to attract both DeFi veterans and newcomers looking for scalable and sustainable financial solutions. Moving Ahead ETH, VET, and AAVE all demonstrate why crypto remains full of groundbreaking potential. ETH’s dominance in smart contracts and DeFi, VET’s enterprise-grade supply chain solutions, and AAVE’s stronghold in decentralized lending appeal to those seeking real-world use cases and steady growth. But BlockDAG is setting a new standard entirely. With over $340M raised, 23.9B coins sold, and 2M miners fueling its X1 app, its GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016 offers up to 3,025% ROI. Such momentum positions BDAG as a powerful contender for the best crypto to buy in 2025. The time window to lock in unprecedented gains might be fading faster than you think.

Explore 3 More Promising Coins,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/pudgy-penguins-pengu-skyrockets-128-meme-coin-mania-returns-explore-3-more-promising-coins,"The meme coin market is heating up again, led by Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), which has skyrocketed 128% in a stunning price surge. This explosive move signals renewed interest in meme coins, a sector that had seemingly cooled off. In this article, we explore the factors driving PENGU’s breakout and highlight three other meme coins — Popcat, Turbo, and Dogwifhat — that are gaining momentum and could be next in line for major gains. Pudgy Penguins' Current Surge: A Promising Rise Source: tradingview Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is experiencing an upward trend. The current price is around $2.50. It faced resistance near $2.80 but found support at about $2.20. The next potential resistance level is $3.00. If it breaks this, it could climb to roughly $3.50, signaling a 40% jump from its support level. Short-term momentum is positive, with a 10-day average over $2.30 compared to a longer-term average of $2.00. The RSI hints it could go higher, though it's still below the overbought zone. Recent price changes show a weekly rise of 12% and a monthly gain of approximately 25%. Pudgy Penguins seems to be on a promising path with these figures. Popcat (POPCAT) Gains Attention with Recent Price Surge Source: tradingview Popcat's price is moving between $0.30 and $0.42, showing strong recent growth. In the last week, it surged by over 36%, and it rose nearly 23% in the past month. These numbers indicate growing interest and potential. The coin could aim for the next level at $0.46 if momentum continues. The strong support near $0.23 suggests some stability. A significant climb could see it targeting around $0.58, which would be a substantial percentage increase from current levels. The coin’s strength is reflected in its relative index and moving averages, pointing to a lively market with potential for more upward moves. Turbo (TURBO) Eyes Potential Climb Amidst Mixed Signals Source: tradingview Turbo (TURBO) is trading just under half a cent, somewhere between $0.0039 and $0.0048. It recently saw a weekly rise of over 50%, hinting at potential growth. However, it still lags from its 6-month-benchmark with a fall of about 27%. The price might break the $0.0052 mark, its nearest resistance. If it surpasses this, it could aim for $0.0062, reflecting a noticeable jump from current levels. On the downside, it has support at $0.0033 and further at $0.0023. Overall, despite short-term gains, buyers remain cautious with the RSI just balanced at 51.67, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Dogwifhat (WIF) Shows Promise Amid Recent Price Jump Source: tradingview Dogwifhat (WIF) is currently trading between $0.85 and $1.10. It recently gained over 30% in a week, showing strong upward momentum. The resistance is at $1.21, and support is at $0.71. If it breaks through $1.21, WIF could climb to $1.46, marking an increase of over 30% from current levels. With a 10-day average slightly above the current price, it shows short-term strength. The RSI is near 65, hinting it's not overbought yet. Long-term performance lags, but recent moves suggest potential. The next weeks may reveal if WIF can maintain this upward rally and reach its targets. Conclusion Pudgy Penguins' breakout has reignited meme coin enthusiasm, with coins like Popcat, Turbo, and Dogwifhat also showing signs of strong growth potential. While the market remains volatile, current momentum suggests this wave may be far from over. For investors keeping an eye on early-stage runs, these four meme coins are worth watching as the trend gains fresh traction. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

To combat this, Jameson Lopp, CTO and co-founder of self-custody service Casa, has proposed a quantum-resistant upgrade to the cryptocurrency’s software. A Three-Phase Solution According to a July 15 Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIPs), approximately 4 million BTC, including the 1 million believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, are vulnerable to future quantum computer attacks. “Bitcoin’s current signatures (ECDSA/Schnorr) will be a tantalizing target: any UTXO that has ever exposed its public key on-chain (roughly 25% of all bitcoin) could be stolen by a cryptographically relevant quantum computer,” the post said. The plan outlines three steps to reduce this threat. The first phase would block users from sending BTC to quantum-vulnerable addresses and instead require the use of a new post-quantum address type called P2QRH. The second step, planned to begin two years later, would freeze any funds that have not been moved to a secure address. The final phase is still being studied and could allow people to recover frozen assets using a BIP-39 seed phrase. Lopp presented the initiative at the Quantum Bitcoin Summit in San Francisco, an invite-only gathering of experts focused on protecting BTC against such vulnerabilities. The plan, crafted in collaboration with five other developers, is built around an incentive mechanism that warns users they will lose access to their funds if they do not upgrade. The goal is to push holders toward safer storage methods that quantum computers cannot compromise. The Quantum Threat In the proposal, the authors stressed the enormity of the threat posed to the Bitcoin ecosystem by a potential quantum attack: “Never before has Bitcoin faced an existential threat to its cryptographic primitives,” they wrote. “A successful quantum attack on Bitcoin would result in significant economic disruption and damage across the entire ecosystem.” Their fear is backed by a past Deloitte study explaining how severe the damage could be. The research demonstrated that if the vulnerable BTC were unlocked and sold following a quantum attack, it would trigger heavy selling pressure on the market. Lopp described this situation as a “liquidation event.” Elsewhere, Project Eleven, a research group focused on quantum computing, recently announced a competition to measure the real-world risk such technology poses to the leading cryptocurrency’s security. The group reported that more than 10 million BTC addresses have exposed public keys. This puts about 6.2 million BTC, worth around $500 billion, at risk if quantum computing continues to improve. A separate analysis by CryptoQuant pointed out that these attacks could also affect mining operations.

This Toronto-listed company has just unveiled an ambitious plan to accumulate a staggering 6,000 Bitcoin (BTC) by 2027, with an initial goal of 1,000 BTC by 2026. Currently holding around 77 BTC, Matador Technologies is not just dabbling; it’s embedding Bitcoin as a core asset in its business strategy, signaling a bold new era for corporate treasury management. Matador Technologies’ Bold Bitcoin Accumulation Vision According to a recent GlobeNewswire press release, Matador Technologies’ significant Bitcoin accumulation goal positions it as a forward-thinking player in the digital asset space. Their commitment to reaching a BTC target of 1,000 by 2026 and then escalating to 6,000 by 2027 demonstrates a clear, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. It’s more than just an investment; it’s a fundamental reorientation of their financial outlook, transforming their balance sheet with a decentralized, deflationary asset. This strategic move highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies to explore alternative assets for treasury management, moving beyond traditional fiat holdings. Why is a Crypto Treasury Strategy Gaining Traction? The decision by Matador Technologies to pivot towards a robust crypto treasury strategy isn’t an isolated incident. Across industries, companies are re-evaluating traditional cash management in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ offers a compelling alternative to depreciating fiat currencies. Its fixed supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive hedge against inflation and a potential store of value for the long term. Companies are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential to: Hedge Against Inflation: Protect corporate reserves from the eroding effects of inflation. Diversify Assets: Add a non-correlated asset to their balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Capitalize on Growth: Participate in the potential long-term appreciation of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Signal Innovation: Position the company as forward-thinking and adaptable to new financial paradigms. How Will Matador Technologies Hit Its Ambitious BTC Target? Achieving such an ambitious BTC target requires meticulous financial planning and execution. Matador Technologies is reportedly exploring a range of financing options to fund its Bitcoin accumulation , aiming to align these methods with its broader business objectives. These options could include: Debt Financing: Securing loans, potentially collateralized by existing assets or even future Bitcoin holdings, to acquire more BTC without diluting equity. Equity Offerings: Issuing new shares to investors who are aligned with the company’s corporate Bitcoin strategy , raising capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases. Operational Cash Flow: Utilizing profits generated from their core business operations to steadily acquire Bitcoin over time. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with digital asset firms or institutional investors to facilitate large-scale acquisitions. However, this path is not without its hurdles. The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market presents significant risks, as does the evolving regulatory landscape. Managing these risks while maintaining shareholder confidence and operational stability will be crucial for Matador Technologies as it navigates this innovative strategy. The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy The pioneering corporate Bitcoin strategy adopted by companies like Matador Technologies sends a powerful signal to the broader financial world. It follows in the footsteps of firms like MicroStrategy, which has famously made Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC. This trend signifies a growing institutional acceptance of digital assets, moving them from the fringe to the mainstream of corporate finance. As more companies consider diversifying their balance sheets with Bitcoin, it could accelerate mainstream adoption, drive further innovation in financial products, and potentially stabilize Bitcoin’s price over the long term due to increased demand from sophisticated institutional buyers. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Assets? The commitment from Matador Technologies to such a substantial Bitcoin accumulation plan by 2027 is a testament to the enduring belief in digital assets as a foundational element of future economies. It underscores a strategic pivot that prioritizes long-term value creation over short-term market fluctuations. This move could inspire other mid-cap companies, particularly those listed on venture exchanges, to explore similar treasury strategies, further cementing Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate and valuable corporate asset. It points towards a future where digital assets are increasingly integrated into traditional financial frameworks, fostering a more robust and diversified global economy. In conclusion, Matador Technologies’ bold vision to accumulate 6,000 BTC by 2027 is more than just a financial target; it’s a declarative statement about the future of corporate finance. By aligning its core business strategy with Bitcoin, the company is not only seeking to enhance shareholder value but also contributing to the broader institutionalization of digital assets. This journey, while ambitious, highlights a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential to redefine corporate treasury management for years to come.

Despite this bearish signal, the RSI indicator shows no evidence of bearish divergence , suggesting the red candle formation may simply represent a temporary cooling-off period before the next upward movement phase. Bitcoin CME Gap Fill Provides Foundation for Next Rally Currently trading at $118,885 at the time of writing, market analysts have noted that Monday’s decline to $115,736 represented Bitcoin’s effort to close the daily CME Gap situated between $114,000 and $117,000 , which now serves as foundational support for a potential rally toward the $140,000 target. #BTC Looks like Bitcoin is finding support just above its Daily CME Gap $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/QcNm4fopm7 pic.twitter.com/FWyxwX0lir — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 16, 2025 The leading cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $2.36 trillion and daily trading volume surpassing $50 billion, is currently following a Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern of Accumulation → Expansion → Re-accumulation → Vertical breakout. Bitcoin’s current trendline positioning places it within the $136,000-$140,000 zone, which CryptoQuant data identifies as the upper resistance level, corresponding to the +1 standard deviation (STD) of Bitcoin holders who have maintained their positions over the past month. Source: CryptoQuant Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Bullish $136k – $140K Targets Remain Intact The BTC/USDT daily chart shows a robust uptrend continuation, with the price currently positioned around $118,883, following the successful penetration of previous resistance barriers. Despite the bearish candle formation, price action maintains a well-positioned stance above the dynamic short-term support provided by the 20, 50, 100, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), which display bullish stacking, confirming robust trend support. Source: TradingView As long as BTC maintains levels above the $113,000–$114,000 zone (the EMA cluster), the bullish market structure remains intact. A decisive breakout above $120,000 would likely catalyze movement toward the next major Fibonacci-derived target at $124,600, with the potential for an extension to $136,000. The overall trajectory remains bullish unless a strong closing below the 50-day EMA occurs. Bitcoin Hyper: Breakout Presale Gains Momentum as Altseason Heats Up Unlike previous market tops in March and December 2024, current on-chain data shows the market is far from overheated — giving altcoins and presales plenty of room to run. That’s exactly where Bitcoin Hyper is making waves. This standout presale is the first Bitcoin Layer-2 project built using Solana’s high-speed Virtual Machine, designed to bring lightning-fast smart contracts and lower fees to the Bitcoin network. With over $3 million already raised , Bitcoin Hyper is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities of this altseason. The project aims to reduce transaction fees to near-zero levels and decrease transaction completion times to seconds rather than the typical minutes required on the base layer. The utility token for Bitcoin Hyper is currently available for purchase and staking at the presale price of $0.012275, with staking rewards up to an attractive 297%. To participate in the presale, buyers can connect their wallets (such as Best Wallet ) on the Bitcoin Hyper website and make purchases using ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT, BNB, or credit card payment methods.

On July 16, the company announced that it had purchased an additional 325 BTC for £27.15 million, equivalent to approximately $36.45 million. This marks another significant step in the company’s bold shift from a traditional tech firm to a focused Bitcoin treasury company. From Web Design to Bitcoin Holdings The Smarter Web Company, listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange, has demonstrated a strong focus on holding its flagship cryptocurrency. In July alone, it acquired over 1,056 BTC, showing a pace faster than many of its global peers. The firm now holds a total of 1,600 BTC, acquired at an average price of £79,534, which is worth approximately $106,798 per coin. Its total investment amounts to £127.25 million, equivalent to $170.88 million. This recent purchase propels the company into the top 25 public Bitcoin treasury holders worldwide. This move places it ahead of other treasury firms, such as Fold and Phoenix Digital Assets, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Now, Smarter Web Company is among the top companies holding Bitcoin in the UK. Alongside its announcement, Smarter Web also introduced a new tool for evaluating Bitcoin treasury firms called the “P/BYD ratio.” This works similarly to the well-known P/E ratio used in stock markets. This is designed to help investors assess the value and performance of companies that hold the leading crypto asset. Rising Value and Strategic Positioning On July 14, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $123,000, but it has slightly pulled back. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,862, up by 1.14% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. This initial rise in the top coin boosted Smarter Web Company’s Bitcoin investment by over 11%, which was valued at approximately $19.26 million on paper. Along with its crypto assets, it still holds £4 million, equivalent to roughly $5.36 million in cash. CEO Andrew Webley has made it clear that Bitcoin is central to the company’s future . Since April, the company has followed a formal Bitcoin treasury strategy, aiming to create long-term value and support growth by holding BTC in its reserves. The firm’s 10-Year Plan focuses on growing its client base and acquiring more Bitcoin over time. With this strategy in place, Webley believes the company could break into the top 20 BTC holders within the month. Market Response and Stock Performance The company’s decision to focus on the flagship cryptocurrency has had a significant impact on its stock.

Donald Trump met with GOP holdouts, who now back the GENIUS Act after initially blocking it. Crypto Week resumes as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana rise amid renewed legislative progress. French Hill, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said the GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act now have enough support to pass. In a CNBC interview on July 16, he stated: “I believe that we do have the votes to advance the Senate’s GENIUS Act, which will create the first federally regulated dollar-backed stablecoins.” The House will reattempt a procedural vote after an earlier failure. The original motion collapsed when several Republican lawmakers objected to language they said might allow a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Hill confirmed the House Speaker is preparing to bring the bills back for consideration. He said support from both Republican and Democratic members has grown since the failed motion.

This marked an 81.1% increase over the last seven days, indicating a sharp reversal from the depths of early July and a resurgent bullish sentiment. Source: CoinGecko Over the last two years, $BONK has evolved from a playful Solana meme token into a robust community-driven asset with substantive integrations, clear tokenomics, and growing institutional interest. There is a total supply of 88.87 trillion $BONK tokens, with 50 trillion tokens allocated to airdrops targeting genuine Solana users—an approach lauded for prioritizing community over insiders. Its utility extends beyond tipping and trading: the Bonkbot Telegram tool facilitates SPL token trades that generate fees, having amassed $194.6 million in fees since launch. $BONK is growing its operational footprint by embedding into launchpads like LetsBonk and Bonkfun to increase its revenue streams and platform rankings.

(DFDV) in May, co‑managing a Solana node and sharing rewards. This move bolstered network security and broadened staking options. Is BONK’s Parabolic Advance Sustainable? Fib Levels and Volume Tell the Story The $BONK/$USDT 4‑hour chart shows a pronounced parabolic advance, with price climbing along an accelerating curve after a prolonged consolidation near $0.00001450–$0.00001800. $BONK/USDT Price Chart, July 16 (Source: TradingView) The move broke out from that base with increasing volume, suggesting fresh momentum. A parabolic curve is visible, supporting the idea that the rally has entered a steeper phase of ascent, where pullbacks tend to be shallow until momentum exhausts. A Fibonacci retracement drawn from the recent swing low ($0.00001165) to the current high shows key support zones in case of a retracement. The initial support, at the 0.236 level ($0.00002929), will likely attract buyers in shallow corrections. The 0.382 level ($0.00002590), which is a deeper but still bullish retracement level, aligns with prior resistance-turned-support. The strongest support zone is at the 0.618 level ($0.00002041), likely a consolidation area if a deeper correction unfolds. If profit-taking emerges, these levels may act as stepping stones for buyers, with $0.00002041 being a key area for sustaining the broader uptrend. On the short-term volume footprint (30‑minute data), the market shows a sequence of bullish imbalances, most evident around the $0.00003200–$0.00003280 range and again near $0.00003420–$0.00003440. These areas reflect aggressive buying where bid-side liquidity was insufficient to absorb demand, often leaving price gaps in the auction. Such imbalances tend to act as magnets or short-term support on retests. The current price action hints at a run toward $0.00003600, assuming the RSI cools off without collapsing. That’s the key—no violent rejection. However, if it fails to hold above $0.00003600, traders might see the $BONK token retesting $0.00003100, that old consolidation period when things got sticky in the past. Traders should watch the MACD closely. At press time, the momentum is weakening there. Anything is possible, but volume confirmation would still be critical.

A significant milestone has just been reached that could redefine how large-scale financial operations leverage blockchain technology. Lynq, a pioneering cryptocurrency payment platform for institutions, has successfully completed its inaugural transaction on the Avalanche (AVAX) network. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a powerful signal of growing institutional confidence in decentralized finance and a testament to Avalanche’s robust capabilities for enterprise-grade solutions. What Does the Lynq Transaction Mean for Institutional Payments? For years, the promise of blockchain technology for institutional finance remained largely theoretical. High volatility, scalability concerns, and regulatory uncertainties often kept traditional players on the sidelines. However, Lynq’s recent achievement on Avalanche marks a pivotal shift. This Lynq transaction demonstrates a tangible step towards real-world adoption of blockchain for complex financial operations. What makes this so significant for institutional payments ? Proof of Concept: It validates the feasibility of using public blockchains for high-value, secure institutional transfers. Efficiency Gains: Traditional cross-border payments can be slow and expensive. Blockchain offers near-instant settlement and reduced fees. Transparency and Auditability: Immutability of blockchain records provides unparalleled transparency and ease of auditing. Reduced Counterparty Risk: Smart contracts can automate settlement, reducing reliance on intermediaries. This move by Lynq isn’t just about moving money; it’s about building trust and demonstrating the operational viability of crypto rails for the world’s largest financial entities. Why Avalanche Crypto is Becoming a Go-To for Enterprises The choice of the AVAX Network by Lynq is far from arbitrary. Avalanche has strategically positioned itself as a blockchain of choice for enterprise and institutional applications, distinguishing itself through several key features that address the unique demands of traditional finance. Here’s why Avalanche Crypto is gaining traction in the institutional space: Scalability and Speed: Avalanche boasts impressive transaction throughput and near-instant finality, crucial for high-frequency financial operations. Its unique architecture, particularly the Subnet framework, allows for custom, application-specific blockchains that can handle massive loads without congesting the main network. Low Transaction Costs: Compared to some other major blockchains, Avalanche offers competitive transaction fees, making it economically viable for frequent institutional use. Security and Decentralization: Built with robust security mechanisms, Avalanche maintains a high degree of decentralization, which is paramount for safeguarding sensitive financial data and transactions. Customizable Subnets: This is a game-changer for institutions. Subnets allow organizations to launch their own custom blockchains with tailored permissions, validator sets, and even gas token economics. This means institutions can create private, permissioned environments that meet specific regulatory and compliance requirements while still leveraging the underlying security of the Avalanche mainnet. EVM Compatibility: Being compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) means developers can easily migrate existing decentralized applications (dApps) and tools, fostering a rich ecosystem and reducing development friction for institutions. These attributes collectively make the AVAX Network an attractive foundation for platforms like Lynq looking to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technology. The Future of Blockchain Payments: Beyond the First Step While Lynq’s successful transaction on the Avalanche Network is a significant first step, it’s merely the beginning of a much larger transformation in blockchain payments . The implications extend far beyond just faster transfers. We are entering an era where financial infrastructure could be entirely re-imagined. Consider the potential: Feature Traditional Payments Blockchain Payments (e.g., Avalanche) Settlement Time Days (cross-border) Seconds/Minutes Cost per Transaction High (intermediary fees) Low (network fees) Transparency Opaque High (on-chain record) Accessibility Limited (banking hours) 24/7/365 Innovation Potential Slow, siloed Rapid, interconnected The integration of digital assets and blockchain technology into mainstream financial operations is no longer a distant dream but a rapidly unfolding reality. Platforms like Lynq are paving the way for a future where tokenized assets, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and stablecoins can move seamlessly and securely across borders, facilitating global commerce and fostering new financial products. The Avalanche Network , with its robust architecture, is poised to play a crucial role in this evolution, supporting a new generation of financial services built on decentralized principles. Actionable Insights for the Evolving Financial Landscape For financial institutions, technology providers, and even individual investors, Lynq’s successful institutional payments transaction on Avalanche offers several key insights and potential avenues for action. For Financial Institutions: Explore Pilot Programs: Don’t wait. Investigate pilot programs with platforms like Lynq platform or other blockchain solution providers to understand the practicalities and benefits firsthand. Educate Your Teams: Blockchain literacy is becoming essential. Provide training for compliance, legal, and operations teams on the nuances of decentralized finance. Assess Infrastructure Needs: Evaluate how existing IT infrastructure can integrate with blockchain solutions. Consider the adoption of private subnets for specific use cases. For Technology Providers: Focus on Compliance: Develop solutions that inherently address regulatory requirements, KYC/AML, and data privacy. Build Interoperability: The future is multi-chain. Focus on solutions that can seamlessly interact with various blockchains and traditional financial systems. User Experience: While institutional, ease of use and robust support are critical for adoption. For Investors: Monitor Institutional Adoption: Keep an eye on projects and blockchains that are actively attracting institutional interest, as this often signals long-term viability and growth potential. Understand Underlying Technology: Research the fundamental technology behind platforms like Avalanche and the specific use cases they are targeting. The success of the Lynq platform in executing this transaction is a clear indicator that the tide is turning. Ignoring these developments is no longer an option; proactive engagement is key to staying competitive in the evolving financial ecosystem. Lynq’s successful first transaction on the Avalanche network is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a landmark event that underscores the growing maturity and readiness of blockchain technology for institutional adoption. It highlights Avalanche’s capabilities as a high-performance, secure, and customizable platform for enterprise-grade solutions. As the financial world continues its digital transformation, such pioneering steps by platforms like Lynq are crucial in demonstrating the immense potential of decentralized networks to deliver unprecedented efficiency, transparency, and innovation. This transaction isn’t the end of a journey, but rather a powerful beginning for a new era of institutional finance powered by blockchain.

Following procedural setbacks earlier this week, the US House of Representatives has resumed its efforts to advance landmark legislation on cryptocurrency regulation. In a vote today, House members voted 215-211 to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS), which would establish a framework for stablecoin regulation in the US. The GENIUS bill aims to establish a legal and regulatory foundation for stablecoins. It is expected to reach President Donald Trump's desk this week. The House of Representatives has also voted to vote on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (Clarity), which covers the crypto market as a whole. Clarity aims to provide a legal framework that will clarify the division of authority between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in regulating crypto assets. However, another bill is also up for a vote that would prevent the Fed from issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC) directly to individuals. No Democrat in the House voted “yes” on these bills. At a press conference this morning, Democrats reacted strongly to the bills. Maxine Waters, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, called Clarity and GENIUS “two of the most dangerous bills,” saying: “These bills are a gift-wrapped invitation for Trump to continue his crypto scam at full speed.” *This is not investment advice.

Stage 5 presale of Mutuum Finance is $0.03. The phase has already sold over 75%. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $12.5 million and over 13500 investors are already listed. Whispers across crypto circles suggest MUTM could be the next 50x token, and those who wait might be watching it moon from the sidelines. If you’re wondering what to buy before July ends, this might be your last chance to grab Mutuum Finance before it hits the mainstream. XRP: Calm Before a Possible Breakout XRP is currently trading around $2.93, bouncing between resistance at $2.92–$2.93 and institutional support near $2.85, a tight consolidation that shows corporate treasuries are actively positioning ahead of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF launch on July 18. Over the past week, XRP surged roughly 30%, buoyed by Bitcoin’s record run near $121,000 and growing momentum from ETF developments. While technical signals like higher lows and whale accumulation hint at potential upside, the key trigger will be whether price can finally trade above $2.93 with strong volume. Volume remains vibrant and regulatory background is improving, but the path to a breakout remains cautious and measured. Investor Interest Spurs Rapid Growth in Mutuum Presale More than 13500 investors have invested in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale that has raised over $12.5 million. There is a lot of buzz about the project and it is so widespread that it is very clearly an extremely good sign for the project moving in the right direction. MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03 during phase 5 and will increase by 16.67% during phase 6. Investors are already impatient to buy during this phase, which has sold over 75% of its sales. Demand is growing at an exponential rate and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a DeFi innovator is more priceless in view of the fact that it will be one of the best crypto investments of 2025. Mutuum’s $50K Bug Bounty Program with CertiK Security is Mutuum Finance’s number one concern. With CertiK, the platform has finally launched its Bug Bounty Program with a combined reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. The program has four tiers of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure that any potential weakness would be found and rewarded accordingly. This aligns with the vision of the team in creating a secure, transparent, and high-quality DeFi protocol. $100K Giveaway to Appreciate Early Backers In appreciation of its early community, Mutuum Finance has announced a $100,000 giveaway program. Ten lucky individuals will get $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. This is a strong gesture of appreciation and a motivation to establish a strong and active user base right from the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly climbing the ranks as one of the most anticipated DeFi projects of 2025. With over $12.5 million raised, more than 13,500 investors onboard, and Stage 5 nearly sold out at $0.03, the clock is ticking before the next price increase. As XRP eyes its ETF-fueled breakout, MUTM is gathering pace on its own track, powered by real-world lending utility, elite security measures, and growing community support. With market sentiment accelerating, now is the moment to explore what’s behind the buzz before this DeFi contender breaks into the mainstream.

While well-known names like PEPE continue to ride waves of community hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fueling a different kind of FOMO, one backed by real innovation and jaw-dropping growth forecasts. Stage 5 presale of Mutuum Finance is $0.03. The phase already sold over 70%. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $12.4 million and over 13400 investors are already listed. If you’re still wondering what to buy, Mutuum Finance might be your coin to offer generational wealth. Pepe Coin Price Action in July Signals Short-Term Momentum The market is seeking tokens that can generate high returns in 2025, and PEPE has once again entered the discussion because of a surge of interest among traders. Today PEPE price is hovering at around 0.000012 being up by more than 20 percent over the past week following hyped inflows and meme coin action ostensibly across markets. Short term volatility still exists but with such large holders redistributing, PEPE has been able to maintain support lines and briefly tested resistance at around $0.000015 late last month. Its 2025 prospects are divided among analysts, with some giving it less than $0.00001 with the current consolidation, others predicting it to be booming again due to a social media trend or a meme cycle passing through. In contrast, PEPE keeps attracting the attention of retail traders, whereas Mutuum Finance is receiving a different type of interest that is based on long-term fundamentals and DeFi utility. Mutuum Finance Presale Grabs Sizzling Pace More than 13400 investors have invested in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale that has raised over $12.4 million. There is a lot of buzz about the project and it is so widespread that it is very clearly an extremely good sign for the project moving in the right direction.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be one of the best looking DeFi opportunities of 2025 with the project already resorting to over 13,400 investors who collectively invested an amount totaling over $12.4 million in its presale. Phase 5 is 70% already sold with a unit price of $0.03 and the demand has already gained pace before the next said increment of the price. MUTM is founded on long-term principles, where short-time trendy meme coins vanish, unlike MUTM, which has a bug bounty program of 50,000 USDT with CertiK and a giveaway of $100,000 to early followers. With the generational wealth hunt in the crypto transformation gaining momentum, Mutuum Finance is arguably one of the high conviction plays that focus on being both secure and scalable.

In a significant leap forward, Midas , a pioneering financial tokenization platform, has just announced the launch of two groundbreaking tokenized investment products : mMEV and mRe7YIELD. These innovative offerings are now live on Etherlink, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 platform, promising to democratize access to sophisticated DeFi strategies while minimizing traditional barriers. What Are Midas’s New Tokenized Investment Products? Midas’s entry into the Etherlink ecosystem marks a pivotal moment for investors seeking exposure to the dynamic world of DeFi. The two new products, mMEV and mRe7YIELD, are designed to offer streamlined access to complex decentralized finance strategies without the high overheads typically associated with direct participation. This initiative leverages Etherlink’s robust, low-fee, and high-speed network, ensuring an efficient and cost-effective investment experience. Here’s a closer look at what these products entail: mMEV: This product is designed to capture value from Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem. MEV refers to the profit that can be extracted by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block. Investing in mMEV allows users to gain exposure to strategies that aim to capitalize on these often opaque and complex market dynamics, managed by experienced professionals. mRe7YIELD: Focused on yield-generating strategies, mRe7YIELD aims to provide investors with a stable return by participating in various DeFi protocols such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision. It’s tailored for those looking for consistent yield in the volatile crypto market, with the underlying strategies expertly managed to optimize returns and mitigate risks. Both products are tokenized, meaning they are represented by digital tokens on the blockchain. This tokenization brings several advantages, including fractional ownership, enhanced liquidity, and greater transparency, making these sophisticated investment opportunities accessible to a broader audience. The Strategic Role of MEV Capital and Re7 Capital in Risk Management One of the most critical aspects of engaging with DeFi is managing the inherent risks. Midas has strategically partnered with two reputable entities, MEV Capital and Re7 Capital, to oversee the risk management for mMEV and mRe7YIELD, respectively. This professional oversight is a game-changer, providing an essential layer of security and expertise that is often missing for individual investors navigating the DeFi landscape. Why is this partnership so crucial? Expertise in Complex Strategies: DeFi strategies, especially those involving MEV, can be incredibly intricate and require deep technical understanding and constant monitoring. MEV Capital brings specialized knowledge to navigate these complex waters. Mitigating Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Re7 Capital’s role in managing mRe7YIELD involves implementing strategies to optimize yield while minimizing exposure to sudden market swings and impermanent loss, a common risk in liquidity provision. Enhanced Security: Professional risk management includes robust security protocols to protect against smart contract vulnerabilities, flash loan attacks, and other common DeFi exploits. This adds a significant layer of trust and reliability to the products. Compliance and Due Diligence: While DeFi operates in a largely unregulated space, professional asset managers often adhere to internal best practices and due diligence processes that enhance the credibility and safety of the investment. This collaboration underscores Midas’s commitment to offering not just innovative products but also secure and professionally managed investment avenues within the DeFi ecosystem. Why Etherlink? The Power of Layer-2 for Tokenized Investment Products The choice of Etherlink as the foundational Layer-2 platform for these new tokenized investment products is a strategic one, directly addressing some of the long-standing challenges of the Ethereum mainnet. Etherlink, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 solution, provides a robust environment that is perfectly suited for high-frequency, low-cost financial transactions. Here’s how Etherlink empowers Midas’s new offerings: Feature Benefit for Midas Products on Etherlink Low Transaction Fees Significantly reduces the cost of entering, exiting, and managing positions within the tokenized products, making them more economically viable for a wider range of investors. High Transaction Speed Enables faster execution of trades and strategy adjustments, crucial for capitalizing on fleeting market opportunities in DeFi and improving the overall user experience. Ethereum Compatibility Leverages the security and established developer ecosystem of Ethereum, ensuring seamless integration with existing DeFi protocols and tools, while offering the scalability of a Layer-2. Scalability Supports a higher volume of transactions than the Ethereum mainnet, allowing Midas to scale its offerings and accommodate a growing user base without network congestion issues. By building on Etherlink, Midas is not only making these advanced DeFi strategies more accessible but also more efficient and cost-effective for everyday investors, truly democratizing the investment landscape. Understanding DeFi Strategies: Beyond the Hype The term “DeFi strategies” often sounds complex, but at its core, it refers to a set of financial operations performed on decentralized blockchain networks. Midas ‘s new products abstract away this complexity, allowing investors to gain exposure without needing to understand the intricate mechanics of each strategy. However, a basic understanding can help appreciate the value these products offer. Common DeFi strategies include: Yield Farming: Providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or lending protocols to earn rewards (yield) in the form of transaction fees and governance tokens. Staking: Locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network and earn staking rewards. Lending and Borrowing: Participating in decentralized money markets where users can lend out their crypto for interest or borrow against their assets. Arbitrage: Profiting from price differences of the same asset across different exchanges. Maximal Extractable Value (MEV): As mentioned, this involves advanced strategies to capture value from transaction ordering on the blockchain. The beauty of Midas’s mMEV and mRe7YIELD is that they package these sophisticated strategies into easily tradable tokens. This means you don’t need to be a DeFi expert or manage multiple smart contract interactions. Instead, you can invest in a product managed by specialists like MEV Capital and Re7 Capital, who handle the underlying complexities and risks, striving to deliver optimized returns. The Future is Tokenized: What This Means for Investors The launch of Midas’s tokenized investment products on Etherlink is more than just a new offering; it’s a testament to the evolving future of finance. Asset tokenization is rapidly gaining traction, transforming how traditional and digital assets are owned, traded, and managed. This development signifies a major step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world. For investors, this brings several exciting implications: Increased Accessibility: Sophisticated investment strategies, once reserved for institutional investors or crypto-savvy individuals, are now within reach for a broader audience. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows assets to be divided into smaller, more affordable units, making high-value investments accessible to those with limited capital. Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7 on global blockchain networks, potentially offering greater liquidity compared to traditional illiquid assets. Transparency: All transactions on the blockchain are immutable and verifiable, providing a high degree of transparency that can build trust in the investment process. Diversification: These products offer a new avenue for portfolio diversification, allowing investors to gain exposure to cutting-edge DeFi strategies without direct management. As the tokenization trend continues, we can expect to see more traditional assets, from real estate to equities, being represented on the blockchain, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. Midas is at the forefront of this transformative wave, offering a glimpse into a more inclusive and efficient financial future. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the New Frontier While the benefits of tokenized investment products are compelling, it’s crucial for investors to be aware of the challenges and considerations. The crypto space, despite its innovations, is not without risks. Key challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets and DeFi is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the legality and operation of these products. Smart Contract Risk: While audits and professional management reduce risk, smart contracts are not entirely immune to bugs or exploits. Market Volatility: The underlying assets and strategies are still exposed to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Education: Even with simplified access, investors should strive to understand the basic principles of DeFi and tokenization to make informed decisions. Midas’s partnership with MEV Capital and Re7 Capital addresses many of these risks through professional management, but investors should always conduct their own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before investing in any crypto-related product. Conclusion: A New Era for DeFi Investment The launch of mMEV and mRe7YIELD by Midas on Etherlink represents a significant milestone in the journey towards mainstream adoption of decentralized finance. By offering professionally managed, tokenized investment products that leverage the efficiency of a Layer-2 solution, Midas is not just creating new investment opportunities; it’s redefining accessibility and security in the DeFi space. With expert risk management from MEV Capital and Re7 Capital, these products offer a compelling pathway for both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers to engage with advanced DeFi strategies with minimal overhead. This initiative underscores the transformative power of blockchain technology to create a more inclusive, transparent, and efficient financial ecosystem. As Midas continues to innovate, it paves the way for a future where sophisticated investment opportunities are truly within everyone’s reach.

I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk’s Tech & Protocols reporter. In this issue: Eclipse Launches $ES Airdrop, Distributing 15% of Token Supply Risc Zero’s 'Boundless' Incentivized Testnet Goes Live Bitcoin Devs Float Proposal to Freeze Quantum-Vulnerable Addresses — Even Satoshi Nakamoto’s Aethir and Credible Introduce First DePIN-Powered Credit Card Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network News ECLIPSE TOKEN GENERATION EVENT : Eclipse, the layer-2 that combines technology from the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, shared that it has gone live with an airdorp of its $ES token. The team behind the network shared that the initial distribution will occur over the next 30 days, and a total of 1 billion $ES tokens have been minted, with distribution structured to go to community incentives and long-term protocol sustainability. Of the supply, 15% is allocated to an airdrop and liquidity provisions for core community members and developers who have supported the network from the start. 35% will support ecosystem growth and research and development, aimed to help scale the network. Contributors will receive 19% of the supply, including team members, with a four year vesting period and three year lockup schedule. The remaining 31% is for early supporters and investors, who are subject to a three year lockup schedule to commit to Eclipse’s roadmap long-term. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . RISC-ZERO “BOUNDLESS” INCENTIVIZED TESTNET GOES LIVE : Boundless, the decentralized zero-knowledge (ZK) compute marketplace powered by RISC Zero, has launched its incentivized testnet (which it is calling “Mainnet Beta”) on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network. With Boundless’ incentivized testnet, developers can build and test applications in an environment as if the protocol is in fully live format. The network has already landed early support from industry heavyweights like the Ethereum Foundation, Wormhole and EigenLayer. A decentralized marketplace for zero-knowledge compute connects those who need zero-knowledge proofs — such as developers building rollups, bridges, or privacy-preserving applications — with a distributed network of independent “ZK provers or miners” who generate and verify those proofs. Instead of relying on centralized parties, this model allows anyone with the right hardware to contribute computing power and be rewarded for doing that cryptographic work. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . NEW BITCOIN PROPOSAL TO FREEZE QUANTAM-VULNERABLE ADDRESSES: A new Bitcoin draft proposal wants to do what’s long been unthinkable: Freeze coins secured by legacy cryptography — including those in Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallets — before quantum computers can crack them. That’s according to a new draft proposal co-authored by Jameson Lopp and other crypto security researchers, which introduces a phased soft fork that turns quantum migration into a ticking clock. Fail to upgrade, and your coins become unspendable. That includes the roughly 1.1 million BTC tied to early pay-to-pubkey addresses , like those of Satoshi’s and other early miners. “This proposal is radically different from any in Bitcoin's history just as the threat posed by quantum computing is radically different from any other threat in Bitcoin's history,” the authors explained as a motivation for the proposal. “Never before has Bitcoin faced an existential threat to its cryptographic primitives.” — Shaurya Malwa Read more . THE FIRST DEPIN POWERED CREDIT CARD : Aethir, a decentralized GPU cloud network, has teamed up with Credible Finance, a lending protocol, to introduce what they call the first credit card and loan product powered by a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN). The move is designed to give Aethir’s native ATH token holders and node operators access to stablecoin credit without liquidating their tokens — a step toward blending on-chain infrastructure with real-world financial capital. The product, which debuted on Wednesday, lets eligible users collateralize their ATH tokens to access a revolving credit line or preload a no-fee card with ATH or stablecoins on Solana. Loan approvals and limits are determined by Credible’s AI-driven credit engine, which evaluates a user’s on-chain activity, asset holdings and transaction history. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more .

As it sped into its crypto-focused week on Tuesday, the U.S. House's process toward passing digital assets bills ground to a sudden halt over a procedural vote as members of the House Freedom Caucus objected to the way some of the legislation has developed under Senate dominance. The legislation still has strong, bipartisan support, suggesting the procedural mishap may be overcome as a further vote was scheduled for later Tuesday afternoon.

With Pi Coin hovering near its all-time low, this high-profile token movement has triggered new debates about possible buybacks, centralisation risks, and the future of the network. The 2.8M PI coin acquisition has fueled fresh rumours On-chain data from PiScan shows that the ODM wallet acquisition (withdrawal) of 2.8 million PI tokens from OKX followed an earlier withdrawal of 3.5 million tokens from the same platform. This now places the ODM wallet’s total holdings at more than 315 million PI, making it one of the largest known accumulators within the Pi Network ecosystem. The size and timing of this accumulation have fueled rumours that the wallet may be controlled by the Pi Core Team as part of a broader buyback strategy or preparation for a major exchange listing. Despite the growing speculation, there has been no official confirmation from the Pi Core Team, leaving the true nature of the wallet’s activity up for debate among users, developers, and investors. Pi Network community split between hope and concern Some community members have welcomed the possibility that the wallet is supporting price stabilisation efforts, especially at a time when the network faces downward pressure from large-scale token unlocks. Others, however, are raising alarms about transparency and the potential centralisation of token control, likening the situation to early Bitcoin wallet activity associated with Satoshi Nakamoto. The lack of clear communication from the Pi Network team has only deepened concerns, with calls for greater transparency growing louder across social media platforms and community forums. Pi Coin price volatility mounts Notably, the timing of the wallet’s acquisition comes as Pi Coin continues to face heavy selling pressure, declining by more than 26% over the past month and underperforming against most altcoins. Data shows that over 100 million tokens were unlocked between July 8 and July 15, with an additional 137.85 million scheduled to enter circulation by the end of the month. Recent movements have seen nearly 6 million tokens transferred to exchanges in just 24 hours, signalling a wave of sell-side activity that threatens to push prices lower. Some of these transfers were linked to wallets believed to be associated with the Pi Foundation, further intensifying anxiety about a potential collapse in price. Technical analysis of the PI coin price chart suggests a descending triangle breakout, with the price slipping below the key support of $0.44. If this breakdown is confirmed, Pi Coin could crash as much as 40%, potentially reaching new all-time lows near $0.26. However, some bullish indicators remain in play, including a double-bottom pattern around the $0.4087 level and a bullish divergence on the MACD, which could signal a rebound if the market finds support. Additionally, the recent launch of Pi AI Studio and the Pi2Day staking mechanism offers long-term value prospects, helping to position Pi Network as a platform with growing developer interest.

In 2027, it will range between $128.38 and $152.46, with an average price of $140.42. In 2031, it will range between $288.87 and $312.94, with an average price of $300.90. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

According to an overall analysis, the currency has gained up to 1.39% of its value today. Technical indicators give buy signals, and the price charts also showcase a bullish market scenario at the time of writing. Why is Hyperliquid up? The cryptocurrency market is gaining, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE marked a new ATH on June 16, 2025. From a larger picture, the HYPE price increased to $47.91, gaining 1.39% of its total value in the last few hours as it is still trending near its ATH. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by June 2025. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $112.34. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $312.94, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading a bit lower than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $312.94 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached an all-time high of $45.57 and is trading near the $40 range at the start of July.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-16 17:39:34

The crypto sphere is buzzing with news that Aethir , the cutting-edge decentralized cloud GPU network, has joined forces with the innovative lending protocol, Credible Finance , to launch a groundbreaking DePIN -backed credit card and loan product. This collaboration is not just another development; it’s a significant leap forward, poised to redefine how we interact with our digital assets and access real-world credit. Imagine being able to leverage your valuable ATH tokens as collateral for stablecoin credit without the need to sell them – this is the powerful utility this new crypto credit card brings to the forefront, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of decentralized lending . Understanding DePIN: The Backbone of Future Finance Before diving deeper into the specifics of this new product, let’s unpack what DePIN truly means and why it’s such a critical component of this innovation. DePIN , or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, represents a paradigm shift in how physical infrastructure is built, maintained, and accessed. Instead of relying on centralized entities, DePIN projects leverage blockchain technology to coordinate and incentivize a global network of individuals or entities contributing physical resources. These resources can range from Wi-Fi hotspots and sensor networks to, in Aethir ‘s case, high-performance GPUs. Decentralization: Ownership and operation are distributed across many participants, reducing single points of failure and increasing resilience. Token Incentives: Participants are rewarded with cryptocurrency tokens for contributing their resources, creating a robust and self-sustaining ecosystem. Real-World Utility: DePIN projects provide tangible services that impact our daily lives, moving blockchain beyond purely speculative assets. This integration of physical infrastructure with blockchain technology opens up vast possibilities, especially in finance. By backing financial products with the utility and value generated by a decentralized network, we begin to see a tangible link between digital assets and real-world economic activity. Aethir’s Vision: Powering the Decentralized Cloud GPU Network At the heart of this groundbreaking initiative is Aethir , a project that has rapidly gained traction for its ambitious goal: to build a decentralized cloud GPU infrastructure. In an era where AI, gaming, and the metaverse demand ever-increasing computational power, Aethir offers a scalable, efficient, and decentralized alternative to traditional cloud providers. By aggregating idle GPU resources from around the world, Aethir creates a powerful network accessible to anyone, anywhere. The ATH token is the native utility token of the Aethir network, used for various purposes including: Payments: Users pay for GPU services using ATH tokens. Staking: Node operators stake ATH to participate in the network and earn rewards. Governance: ATH holders may participate in future governance decisions of the network. The inherent value and utility of the ATH token, derived from its role in powering this essential decentralized infrastructure, make it an ideal candidate for collateral in financial products. This deep utility is what makes the partnership with Credible Finance so impactful, providing a new layer of financial functionality to the Aethir ecosystem. Credible Finance: Revolutionizing On-Chain Credit Evaluation The other crucial player in this partnership is Credible Finance , a lending protocol that specializes in leveraging on-chain data to assess creditworthiness. Unlike traditional finance, which relies on credit scores and historical financial records, Credible Finance utilizes an AI-driven system to evaluate a user’s blockchain activity. This innovative approach allows for a more dynamic and inclusive credit assessment, opening up financial opportunities for a broader audience within the crypto space. Credible Finance ‘s expertise in decentralized lending is paramount to the success of this new product. Their system can analyze various on-chain metrics, such as: Transaction history: Frequency, volume, and consistency of transactions. Wallet age and activity: Longevity and engagement with decentralized applications. Collateral stability: Evaluation of the collateral’s market behavior and liquidity. This sophisticated AI-driven approach ensures that credit limits are set appropriately, balancing risk for the protocol with access to liquidity for the borrower. It’s a testament to how advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are becoming, moving beyond simple collateralized loans to more nuanced and intelligent financial instruments. The Revolutionary Crypto Credit Card and Loan Product: How It Works So, how exactly does this groundbreaking DePIN -backed crypto credit card and loan product function? The core concept is elegant in its simplicity and powerful in its utility: ATH token holders and node operators can use their tokens as collateral to secure stablecoin credit without the need to sell their underlying assets. Here’s a breakdown of the mechanics: Collateralization: Users deposit their ATH tokens into a smart contract managed by Credible Finance . These tokens serve as collateral for the loan. AI-Driven Credit Assessment: Credible Finance’s AI system analyzes the user’s on-chain activity and the value of the deposited ATH collateral to determine a credit limit and loan terms. This process is transparent and based on immutable blockchain data. Stablecoin Loans: Once approved, users can draw stablecoin loans (e.g., USDC, USDT) against their collateral. These stablecoins can then be used for real-world expenses, investments, or other financial needs. Credit Card Functionality: The product extends beyond simple loans to include a credit card, allowing users to spend their stablecoin credit directly in everyday transactions, effectively bridging their crypto holdings with traditional payment systems. This mechanism is particularly beneficial because it allows users to maintain exposure to their ATH tokens – and thus, to the growth of the Aethir network – while still accessing liquidity. It eliminates the need to sell tokens during market dips or when immediate funds are required, preventing potential losses from price fluctuations and preserving long-term investment strategies. It’s a true manifestation of decentralized lending, offering financial flexibility previously unavailable to many crypto asset holders. Unlocking New Possibilities with Decentralized Lending The implications of this product extend far beyond just Aethir token holders. It represents a significant step towards the mainstream adoption and utility of decentralized finance. Here are some key benefits: Enhanced Liquidity for Token Holders: ATH token holders no longer need to sell their assets to cover short-term expenses or seize new investment opportunities. They can unlock liquidity while retaining their long-term position in the Aethir ecosystem. Real-World Utility for DePIN Assets: This product directly links the value generated by a DePIN (Aethir’s GPU network) to tangible financial services. It demonstrates how decentralized infrastructure can support real-world economic activity. Reduced Market Impact: By providing an alternative to selling, the product can help reduce selling pressure on the ATH token during periods of user liquidity needs, potentially contributing to price stability. Inclusive Financial Access: For individuals with significant crypto holdings but limited access to traditional credit, this product offers a new pathway to financial services based on their on-chain activity, not just traditional credit scores. Pioneering the Crypto Credit Card Frontier: This initiative pushes the boundaries of what a crypto credit card can be, moving beyond simple crypto-to-fiat conversion to a model backed by decentralized infrastructure and intelligent credit assessment. This is a testament to how decentralized lending is maturing, offering sophisticated financial tools that empower users and integrate seamlessly with both digital and traditional economies. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities for DePIN Integration While the launch of this DePIN -backed credit card is undoubtedly exciting, it’s also important to consider the challenges and opportunities inherent in such a novel product. Like any innovation in the crypto space, there are factors that will influence its widespread adoption and long-term success. Challenges: Volatility of Collateral: While ATH tokens have utility, their market price can still be volatile. Significant price drops could lead to collateral liquidation, a risk inherent in all crypto-backed loans. Users must understand and manage this risk. Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for crypto-backed loans and credit cards is still evolving globally. Clearer regulations will be crucial for broader institutional adoption and user confidence. User Education and Adoption: Explaining the nuances of DePIN, decentralized lending, and AI-driven credit to a mass audience requires significant educational efforts. Scalability and Network Stability: The reliability and scalability of the underlying Aethir DePIN will be vital to maintain the perceived value and stability of the ATH token used as collateral. Opportunities: Blueprint for Other DePINs: This product could serve as a blueprint for other DePIN projects looking to add financial utility to their native tokens and infrastructure. Innovation in Credit Scoring: The AI-driven on-chain credit assessment by Credible Finance could lead to more equitable and efficient credit systems globally, especially for the unbanked or underbanked. Deepening DeFi-TradFi Integration: Products like this accelerate the convergence of decentralized finance and traditional finance, creating hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both. Addressing these challenges while capitalizing on the opportunities will be key to the enduring success of this innovative financial product. The Future of Finance: Blending Blockchain and Real-World Utility The collaboration between Aethir and Credible Finance is more than just a new product; it’s a powerful statement about the future of finance. It exemplifies how blockchain technology, specifically through the lens of DePIN , can create tangible, real-world utility that extends beyond speculative trading. This initiative pushes the boundaries of what a crypto credit card can achieve, moving from a simple conversion tool to a sophisticated financial instrument backed by a decentralized network. It’s a clear signal that the industry is maturing, focusing on building sustainable ecosystems that provide genuine value to users. As decentralized lending protocols continue to innovate, we can expect to see more bespoke financial products emerge, tailored to the unique characteristics of various decentralized networks and their native tokens. The blending of blockchain infrastructure with real-world finance is not just a concept anymore; it’s becoming a reality, one groundbreaking product at a time.

Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennie s Grow Into Millions! Dogecoin: ​​Dogecoin: The Meme That Became a $50 Billion Crypto The idea for Dogecoin came about in 2013 as a joke. Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer made it to be a fun alternative to Bitcoin. They used the well-known Shiba Inu meme as their logo. Dogecoin is plentiful, while Bitcoin is not. There is no limit on the number of coins that can be mined, and every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined. This made Dogecoin cheap and easy to get. Dogecoin shocked everyone in 2021. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies because its value went up so much. At one point, it was worth more than $50 billion on the market. A lot of it had to do with social media, especially tweets from Elon Musk. Dogecoin reached new heights because of the strength of the community. People are now wondering if Dogecoin is still a good investment. Some people think it has potential because it has a strong community and is well-known. Some people are worried about its unlimited supply and lack of unique technology. Dogecoin is still a wild card in the current market. It shows how a meme can change the world of finance. Shiba Inu Coin: From Meme to Marvel – Is SHIB the Crypto to Watch? Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by the popular Dogecoin but with a twist. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, making it compatible with a vast array of decentralized applications. Created by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB began with a staggering one quadrillion tokens. In a bold move, half of these were sent to Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Relief Fund and burning of 40% of the total supply catapulted SHIB into the spotlight. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting developments. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, are already live. There’s also talk of launching a platform for NFTs and implementing a governance system where holders have a say in decisions. This sets SHIB apart from other meme coins by offering real utility. In today’s market, where investors are looking beyond memes to coins with potential applications, SHIB stands out. While it started as a fun experiment, SHIB’s evolution shows it might be more than just a meme. Compared to other coins, its ambitious plans and active community make SHIB an interesting option in the current market cycle. PEPE: The Frog That Jumped Into the Crypto Spotlight PEPE is a new memecoin that has taken the crypto world by storm. Launched on Ethereum, it pays tribute to Pepe the Frog, a meme character created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Like other famous memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE embraces its humorous roots. But what sets it apart is its no-tax policy and clear focus on being a pure memecoin without complex utilities or hidden agendas. In just a short time, PEPE’s market cap soared to $1.6 billion, making early investors millionaires and sparking a frenzy in the memecoin space. This surge has led some to call it the start of a “memecoin season,” with many new coins popping up and experiencing wild price swings. While the crypto market is unpredictable, PEPE’s rapid rise shows the power of community and viral trends. As the next Bitcoin halving approaches, many hope that PEPE and other memecoins will reach new heights. For those looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities, PEPE might be an attractive option in the current market cycle. BONK: The Memecoin That Brings the Solana Community Together A lot of people are talking about a new cryptocurrency. BONK is a memecoin that runs on the Solana blockchain. A cute Shiba Inu is its mascot. BONK isn’t just a cool picture; it also wants to give the Solana community more power. It takes power away from big venture capital firms by giving away half of its tokens to people who use Solana’s NFT and DeFi platforms. When BONK was added to Coinbase, its value went up by more than 100%. This shows how fast it has grown and become well-known. BONK started off well, but it has problems like a high total supply and the ups and downs that come with memecoins. But its close ties to the growing Solana ecosystem give it a unique advantage. The launch of decentralized exchanges like BonkSwap shows that BONK could be useful in the real world. Unlike other coins, BONK is focused on community and being used in apps that aren’t run by one company. It seems that BONK is doing well right now because projects that are run by the community are getting a lot of attention. It’s always a good idea to watch market trends and do a lot of research before you buy a new cryptocurrency. Conclusion While DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a leading memecoin, uniting sports fans in the innovative XYZverse ecosystem.

With excitement returning, many are speculating whether SHIB is preparing for another major breakout. Yet, behind the noise, an emerging DeFi token named Remittix is stealing the spotlight, and some are calling it the real winner of this cycle. Let’s look at what’s driving SHIB’s momentum and why RTX might be the one investors won’t want to miss. SHIB’s Revival Is Built On Utility SHIB is no longer just a meme coin. With the rollout of Shibarium, its fast and cheap Layer 2 network, the project is positioning itself for real-world use cases. The network now hosts DeFi apps, games, and community tools, showing that SHIB is aiming to be more than just hype. This expansion is backed by its growing ecosystem tokens designed to create a full SHIB economy. Plans for a SHI stablecoin and 24/7 token burns are also helping fuel scarcity, adding strength to long-term value. Still, despite all this progress, some analysts feel SHIB’s upside is limited compared to newer low-cap gems. Source: Tradingview Remittix (RTX) Quietly Gains Ground With Real-World Demand While SHIB grabs headlines, a rising PayFi project is quietly turning heads. Remittix is being dubbed “XRP 2.0” for its sharp focus on global payments, but with more user-friendly tools for the average crypto holder. Its wallet lets users swap and send crypto directly to bank accounts, with no IP tracking and support for ETH, BTC, XRP, and more. Now past $16.2 million in raised funds, the Remittix token launch is nearing sellout, with over 553 million tokens gone at $0.0811 each. Analysts say it could 4–5x shortly after its Q3 beta wallet drops. Here’s why RTX is quickly becoming a favorite among smart investors: Seamless crypto-to-bank payments on multiple chains Built-in wallet privacy—no tracking or IP logging Strong cross-chain support: ETH, BTC, DOGE, XRP, and SOL 50% bonus tokens still live for early buyers $18M soft cap target, pushing rapid presale momentum With real users, real payments, and real DeFi value, it’s no surprise traders are rotating out of memecoins and into utility. The Final Say: DeFi With Direction Wins Cycles SHIB might be staging a smart comeback, but Remittix is offering something far more powerful: crypto with purpose. While SHIB fine-tunes its ecosystem, RTX is already solving global payment problems—and earning serious community trust doing it.

A new report from TokenInsight reveals a startling downturn: crypto spot trading volumes plummeted by a staggering 22% in the second quarter of the year. This dramatic drop from $4.6 trillion in Q1 to $3.6 trillion in Q2 has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, raising questions about market health and investor sentiment. What exactly drove this substantial decline, and what does it mean for the future of your crypto investments? Crypto Spot Trading: A Shocking Plunge Unpacked When we talk about crypto spot trading , we’re referring to the immediate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for instant delivery. It’s the most common way retail investors interact with the market, exchanging one asset for another at the current market price. Think of it like buying Bitcoin directly with US dollars or trading Ethereum for Solana on an exchange. This direct interaction forms the backbone of market liquidity and price discovery. According to the TokenInsight report, validated by insights from CoinDesk, the second quarter witnessed a significant retraction in this fundamental activity. The raw numbers paint a stark picture: a colossal $1 trillion vanished from the spot market’s total volume quarter-over-quarter. This isn’t just a minor blip; it represents a substantial shift in how much capital is flowing through the immediate buy-and-sell channels of the crypto world. Such a significant reduction in trading activity often signals a cooling of investor enthusiasm and a potential shift towards more cautious strategies. What Drove the Decline in Trading Volumes? Understanding the root causes behind this dramatic fall in trading volumes is crucial for any market participant. The report points to two primary culprits: poor altcoin trading performance and a general reduction in market liquidity. But let’s break these down further to grasp their full impact: Altcoin Underperformance: While Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate headlines, the broader market is filled with thousands of ‘altcoins’ – alternative cryptocurrencies. Q2 saw many of these altcoins struggle significantly. As market sentiment turned bearish, investors often rotate out of riskier, smaller-cap altcoins and consolidate their holdings into more established assets like Bitcoin or stablecoins. This lack of interest and capital flow into altcoins directly impacts overall spot trading volumes, as there’s simply less activity across a vast segment of the market. Reduced Liquidity: Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. When liquidity is reduced, it means there are fewer buyers and sellers in the market, leading to wider bid-ask spreads and potentially larger price swings for trades. This makes it harder and more expensive to execute large orders, discouraging active trading and contributing to lower overall volumes. Reduced liquidity can be a vicious cycle, as lower activity further discourages market makers and large traders. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Beyond crypto-specific factors, the broader global economic climate also played a role. Rising inflation, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical uncertainties often lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, pulling capital from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. This cautious approach naturally translates to less active trading in the spot market. These combined factors created a challenging environment for spot traders, making it less attractive to engage in frequent transactions and contributing to the overall slowdown. The Altcoin Trading Conundrum: Why the Struggle? The specific mention of poor altcoin trading as a key driver of the volume decline deserves a closer look. Altcoins, while offering explosive growth potential during bull markets, are also highly susceptible to market downturns. In a bear or consolidation market, investors often prioritize capital preservation. This leads to a ‘flight to quality,’ where capital flows out of riskier, less established altcoins and into Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are perceived as more stable and resilient assets. Several factors contribute to the altcoin struggle: Lack of New Narratives: Bull markets are often fueled by exciting new narratives (e.g., DeFi summer, NFTs, metaverse). Q2 saw a lull in compelling new narratives that could attract fresh capital into the altcoin space. Project Failures and Scams: Unfortunately, bear markets expose projects with weak fundamentals or even outright scams, leading to significant losses for investors and eroding trust in the broader altcoin ecosystem. Dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum: As the market matured, Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to solidify their positions as the foundational layers of the crypto economy. This often means that even when the market shows signs of life, these two giants capture most of the incoming capital, leaving altcoins to languish. The reduced activity in altcoins means fewer trading pairs, less depth in order books, and ultimately, a significant chunk of the market becoming less active, directly impacting the overall spot trading volume figures. Derivatives Market Resilience: A Beacon in the Storm? Amidst the gloom of falling spot volumes, the report highlights a fascinating counter-trend: the continued strength of the derivatives market . Unlike spot trading, derivatives involve contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, without actually owning the asset itself. This includes futures, options, and perpetual swaps. Why did the derivatives market remain robust when spot trading faltered? The answer lies in its utility, especially during volatile periods: Risk Hedging: Derivatives allow traders to ‘hedge’ or protect their existing spot holdings against price fluctuations. For instance, if you own Bitcoin and are worried about a short-term price drop, you could open a short futures position to offset potential losses. This is a crucial tool for institutional investors and sophisticated traders. Volatility Trading: Derivatives thrive on volatility. Whether prices are going up or down, traders can profit from price movements using derivatives. This contrasts with spot trading, which typically profits from assets increasing in value. In a volatile Q2, traders actively used derivatives to speculate on price swings in both directions. The strength of the derivatives market suggests that while direct buying and selling for immediate ownership slowed down, sophisticated trading activity focused on managing risk and capitalizing on market fluctuations remained vibrant. This indicates a maturing market where participants are utilizing more complex tools to navigate uncertainty, rather than simply exiting altogether. Navigating Future Crypto Market Trends: What’s Next for Investors? The Q2 report offers critical insights into current crypto market trends and prompts us to consider what lies ahead. While the drop in spot trading volumes is a clear challenge, it’s also a signal for investors to adapt their strategies. What can we expect, and how can you position yourself? Potential for Consolidation: Lower trading volumes can sometimes precede periods of price consolidation or even further declines if demand doesn’t pick up. However, they can also indicate a ‘washout’ period, where weaker hands are shaken out, potentially setting the stage for future recovery. Increased Focus on Fundamentals: In a market with reduced speculative fervor, projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, and robust development teams are more likely to stand out. Investors may shift from chasing hype to researching underlying value. Growth of Institutional Interest (via Derivatives): The sustained strength of the derivatives market hints at continued institutional engagement. Large players often prefer derivatives for their flexibility, leverage, and risk management capabilities. This could be a long-term positive for market infrastructure and liquidity. Importance of Risk Management: For individual investors, the report underscores the paramount importance of robust risk management. Diversification, setting stop-loss orders, and understanding your risk tolerance become even more critical in a less liquid and more volatile market. Don’t put all your eggs in one altcoin basket! Looking for Catalysts: Future recovery in spot volumes will likely depend on significant catalysts. These could include clearer regulatory frameworks, a more favorable macroeconomic environment, major technological breakthroughs, or renewed institutional adoption of spot assets. While the Q2 figures present a challenging picture, they also highlight the dynamic and evolving nature of the crypto market. It’s a reminder that not all market segments behave the same, and understanding these nuances is key to navigating the future. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto Trading The 22% plunge in crypto spot trading volumes in Q2, primarily driven by faltering altcoin trading and reduced liquidity, marks a significant moment for the digital asset space. It reflects a period of heightened caution among retail investors and a market grappling with broader economic uncertainties. While the resilience of the derivatives market offers a glimmer of maturity and sophisticated risk management, the core engine of spot trading has clearly cooled. This report serves as a crucial wake-up call, urging investors to remain informed, adapt their strategies, and understand the intricate forces at play. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and while downturns can be unsettling, they also present opportunities for growth and refinement. Staying abreast of these trends and understanding the ‘why’ behind the numbers will be your greatest asset in the quarters to come.

As announced by RippleXity on X, the entity is now “official, verified, and fully compliant.” This development marks Ripple’s growing presence in regulated jurisdictions as it strengthens its foothold in global digital payments infrastructure. A Strategic European Expansion Registered under the entity name Ripple Payments Europe S.A., the company secured its LEI—2549000KEHDV2LWRRZ45 on April 21, 2025. The registration is active, verified, and compliant, with renewal scheduled for April 21, 2026. This move positions Ripple to operate seamlessly within the European Economic Area (EEA), aligning with international financial standards and paving the way for broader service offerings across the EU’s single market. This milestone supports Ripple’s ambition to establish a strong operational base in Europe, enabling it to expand regulated digital payment services across borders. #Ripple Payments Europe SA just went LIVE with an active LEI in Luxembourg!

Ripple continues to lock in its global presence, expanding digital payments infrastructure across Europe. pic.twitter.com/vOh9o2UvOp — RippleXity (@RippleXity) July 16, 2025 Targeting MiCA Compliance and EMI Licensing The LEI registration is part of Ripple’s broader regulatory strategy in Europe. The company has confirmed it is seeking an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license in Luxembourg to operate under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework . This license would allow Ripple to issue digital assets, such as its RLUSD stablecoin, and offer payment services legally across all 30 EEA countries. Ripple representatives have publicly affirmed their intention to be fully MiCA-compliant, underscoring the firm’s commitment to operating transparently within Europe’s evolving digital finance environment. Why Luxembourg Matters Luxembourg is emerging as a top destination for crypto and fintech firms due to its strong regulatory clarity and access to major global banking institutions. Ripple joins the ranks of major players like Coinbase and Bitstamp that have pursued MiCA licensing in the country. The Grand Duchy offers unique advantages, including the ability to meet strict stablecoin reserve requirements, such as maintaining 30% to 60% of reserves in bank deposits and ensuring diversification among banking partners. Ripple has also tapped BNY Mellon to safeguard the USD reserves backing RLUSD, adding another layer of institutional-grade trust to its operations.

The company established its Luxembourg entity, expanded its offices, and brought on senior legal and compliance personnel, including a new EMEA counsel. These moves align with Ripple’s partnerships across the continent, including collaborations in the UK and Portugal for EUR, GBP, and XRP-based payment services. Ripple’s blockchain-based infrastructure, combined with initiatives like RLUSD, is designed to support faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments, a core priority of the EU’s digital finance strategy. A Foundation for the Future Ripple’s activation of its LEI in Luxembourg signals more than regulatory progress; it lays the foundation for its full integration into Europe’s financial system. As the company moves closer to securing an EMI license, it stands poised to transform digital payments across the EU with compliant, enterprise-grade solutions. Ripple’s European momentum continues to build, and this latest move confirms that the company is not just expanding; it’s embedding itself into the regulatory and operational core of the global financial system.

For high-net-worth individuals and institutions, accessing this burgeoning market securely and compliantly has often been a hurdle. This is precisely where the recent announcement from VCI Global comes into play, signaling a pivotal moment for institutional crypto investment, particularly in the vibrant Asian market. What is the VCIG Bitcoin Fund and Why Now? In a significant move, Nasdaq-listed VCI Global has revealed its intent to acquire Malaysia’s V Capital Fund Management. This strategic acquisition is more than just a corporate takeover; it’s a calculated step to gain a regulated license through Labuan’s offshore financial hub. With this crucial regulatory approval in hand, VCI Global plans to launch the VCIG Bitcoin Fund . This fund is specifically designed to cater to high-net-worth and institutional investors across Asia, offering them a compliant and secure avenue for Bitcoin exposure. The timing of this launch is critical. As Bitcoin continues to mature as an asset class, the demand from sophisticated investors for structured, regulated products has surged. Many traditional financial institutions and wealthy individuals are keen to diversify their portfolios with digital assets but are wary of the unregulated and often complex nature of direct crypto investments. A regulated Bitcoin Fund addresses these concerns directly, providing: Regulatory Clarity: Operating under a recognized license, the fund adheres to established financial regulations, offering peace of mind. Enhanced Security: Professional custody solutions mitigate risks associated with managing private keys and digital asset security. Accessibility: Simplifies the process of gaining Bitcoin exposure without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases and storage. Professional Management: The fund will be managed by experts, leveraging their insights into the crypto market. Who is VCI Global and Their Strategic Vision? VCI Global is not a new player in the financial arena. As a Nasdaq-listed entity, it operates with a degree of transparency and scrutiny not always present in the broader crypto space. Their decision to venture into the digital asset management sector, starting with a Bitcoin Fund , underscores a forward-thinking approach to meet evolving investor demands. The acquisition of V Capital Fund Management is a testament to VCI Global ‘s strategic foresight. By acquiring an existing regulated entity, they bypass the lengthy and often complex process of obtaining a new license from scratch. This expedited entry allows them to capitalize on the current market appetite for regulated crypto products. Their vision extends beyond simply offering a fund; it’s about building a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset economy, particularly for a region ripe with growth potential. This move positions VCI Global as an early mover in providing regulated crypto investment vehicles in a region where such offerings are still relatively nascent but highly sought after. It reflects a broader trend of established financial players recognizing the permanence and potential of digital assets. Unlocking Institutional Crypto Investment in Asia: A Game Changer? The concept of institutional crypto investment is rapidly gaining traction globally, and Asia is no exception. The region boasts a significant concentration of high-net-worth individuals and a burgeoning institutional investor base keen on exploring new investment frontiers. However, until recently, the options for compliant and secure crypto exposure were limited. VCI Global’s initiative could indeed be a game changer for institutional crypto investment in Asia for several reasons: Legitimization: A Nasdaq-listed company launching a regulated Bitcoin fund lends significant credibility to the digital asset space within traditional finance circles. Setting a Precedent: This move could encourage other traditional financial institutions in Asia to explore similar offerings, leading to broader adoption. Meeting Untapped Demand: There’s a substantial pool of capital from institutions and wealthy individuals waiting for compliant entry points into the crypto market. Enhanced Trust: The regulatory framework ensures a level of oversight and investor protection that is crucial for institutional confidence. The shift towards institutional participation is vital for the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency market. It brings in larger capital flows, reduces volatility over time, and fosters greater market maturity. VCI Global is positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution in one of the world’s most dynamic economic regions. The Power of the Labuan License: A Gateway to Regulated Crypto The decision to leverage Labuan’s offshore hub for the regulated license is a critical aspect of VCI Global’s strategy. The Labuan license , issued by the Labuan Financial Services Authority (LFSA), provides a robust regulatory framework for various financial activities, including fund management. For digital asset businesses, it offers a pathway to operate compliantly within a recognized jurisdiction. What makes the Labuan license particularly attractive for a crypto fund? It provides: International Recognition: Labuan IBFC (International Business and Financial Centre) is a well-established international financial hub, lending credibility to its licensed entities. Clear Regulatory Guidelines: The LFSA has been proactive in developing regulations for digital asset businesses, offering clarity in an often ambiguous space. Flexibility: While robust, the framework offers sufficient flexibility to innovate within the digital asset sector. Tax Efficiency: Labuan offers a favorable tax environment, which can be beneficial for fund operations. By operating under a Labuan license , the VCIG Bitcoin Fund aims to assure investors of its adherence to international best practices in anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, alongside stringent operational and risk management standards. This is a significant differentiator in a market still grappling with perceptions of regulatory uncertainty. What Does This Mean for the Asia Bitcoin Fund Landscape? The launch of the VCIG Asia Bitcoin Fund is poised to have a ripple effect across the region’s financial ecosystem. Currently, regulated crypto investment products, particularly those targeting institutions, are not as widespread in Asia as they are in some Western markets. This initiative by VCI Global could catalyze significant changes: Increased Competition: Success of the VCIG fund could spur other financial institutions in Asia to launch their own Bitcoin or broader crypto funds, leading to a more competitive and innovative landscape. Greater Investor Confidence: The availability of regulated options will likely draw in more conservative investors who have been on the sidelines, boosting overall market liquidity and depth. Regulatory Evolution: As more regulated products emerge, it could encourage regional regulators to further refine and expand their frameworks for digital assets. Deepening Market Infrastructure: The need for robust custody, trading, and reporting solutions will grow, leading to a more sophisticated crypto financial infrastructure in Asia. The VCIG Asia Bitcoin Fund represents a significant step towards mainstreaming Bitcoin investment for a powerful investor segment. It acknowledges the growing demand for digital assets while providing the security and compliance frameworks that institutions require. This move is not just about VCI Global; it’s about the continued maturation of the crypto market and its deeper integration into global finance, with Asia at the forefront of this exciting evolution. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investment VCI Global’s strategic acquisition of V Capital and the subsequent launch of the VCIG Bitcoin Fund mark a crucial milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. By leveraging a regulated Labuan license, VCI Global is poised to offer high-net-worth and institutional investors in Asia a secure, compliant, and professionally managed pathway to Bitcoin exposure. This initiative not only meets a significant market demand but also underscores the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. As more established players like VCI Global enter the fray with regulated products, the landscape for institutional crypto investment will continue to mature, fostering greater trust, liquidity, and innovation across the global financial markets.

Van de Poppe tells his 795,600 followers on the social media platform X that when Ethereum ( ETH ) prints a new all-time high (ATH), retail traders will enter the market in droves. “Retail might not be here, but they will be when ETH goes to an ATH and altcoins are already up 200-400%. They are always late jumping into the markets. Right now is the best time to accumulate altcoins.” The analyst also believes that altcoins built on the Ethereum network are on the verge of explosive moves after ETH’s reclaim of the $3,000 range. “Ethereum erasing six months of pain in a matter of weeks and is above $3,250. We all know what’s next when ETH and BTC stabilize: altcoins in the ecosystem of ETH will follow through.” The analyst predicts ETH has more upside potential and will soon increase more than 23% of its current value. “I think that ETH is on the path towards $4,000. That means, if there are any corrections taking place, it would be great to be using those to buy the dips in.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X ETH is trading for $3,234 at time of writing, up 6.7% in the last 24 hours.

This critical piece of inflation data could signal a significant shift in the economic landscape, potentially influencing the future stance of the Federal Reserve and, by extension, the volatile yet captivating cryptocurrency market . For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the nuances of this report is paramount to navigating the evolving economic tides. What Did the Latest US PPI Report Reveal? On a day when analysts were bracing for a slight increase, the U.S. Department of Labor delivered news that caught many off guard. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as shared by Investing.com, the Producer Price Index (PPI) remained unchanged in June from the previous month. This flat reading sharply contrasts with the consensus market expectations of a 0.2% increase, suggesting that inflationary pressures at the producer level might be cooling more rapidly than anticipated. Delving deeper into the numbers, the year-over-year PPI also painted a picture of moderating inflation. It rose by 2.3% on an annual basis, falling below the forecast of 2.5% and notably declining from the 2.7% recorded in May. This deceleration in producer prices is a welcome sign for policymakers battling persistent inflation, as it often foreshadows a similar trend in consumer prices. Here’s a quick snapshot of the key figures: Monthly PPI (June): 0.0% (vs. 0.2% expected) Annual PPI (June): 2.3% (vs. 2.5% expected, 2.7% in May) This data point is not just a statistical anomaly; it’s a crucial indicator that can influence everything from corporate earnings to the purchasing power of the average consumer. Its immediate impact on bond yields and equity markets was palpable, and its delayed effect on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) makes it a closely watched figure for economists and investors. Why is This Inflation Data So Important? Understanding PPI’s Role To fully grasp the significance of the flat US PPI , it’s essential to understand what the index represents and its relationship with broader economic indicators. The Producer Price Index measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. In simpler terms, it tracks the prices that businesses receive for the goods and services they produce. Think of it as a leading indicator for consumer inflation. When producers face higher costs for raw materials, labor, or transportation, they often pass those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Conversely, if producer prices remain flat or decline, it suggests that the cost burden on businesses is easing, which can eventually translate to stable or even lower prices for consumers. The PPI is intricately linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The relationship is often described as a pipeline: changes in PPI tend to be reflected in CPI with a lag. Therefore, a flat PPI reading offers a glimmer of hope that the persistent consumer inflation, which has plagued economies worldwide, might finally be losing its grip. How Does This Impact the Federal Reserve ‘s Strategy? The Federal Reserve , the central bank of the United States, has a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability. For the past year, their primary focus has been taming rampant inflation through aggressive interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which slows down economic activity and, in theory, reduces demand, thereby bringing down prices. The flat June US PPI report introduces a fascinating dilemma for the Fed. On one hand, it provides evidence that their monetary tightening policies might be working, giving them reason to consider pausing or slowing down the pace of future rate hikes. A less aggressive Fed could mean a softer landing for the economy, avoiding a deep recession while still bringing inflation under control. On the other hand, the Fed remains cautious. They have repeatedly stated their commitment to bringing inflation down to their 2% target. While PPI is a positive sign, they will also be closely scrutinizing other indicators, particularly the upcoming CPI report and employment data, before making definitive decisions. The challenge for the Federal Reserve is to strike a delicate balance: tighten enough to quell inflation without stifling economic growth entirely. Did Market Expectations Miss the Mark? Unpacking the Discrepancy The fact that the US PPI came in flat, defying the consensus forecast of a 0.2% increase, highlights a significant disconnect between market expectations and economic reality. Why did analysts anticipate a rise, and what does this miss imply? Typically, market forecasts are based on a myriad of factors, including previous economic data, global supply chain conditions, energy prices, and geopolitical events. Many economists likely factored in the lingering effects of past inflation, potential supply disruptions, and perhaps a more resilient demand environment. The flat reading, however, suggests that disinflationary forces are stronger than previously modeled or that businesses are absorbing costs rather than passing them on. This discrepancy between expectation and reality can trigger significant market reactions. When a key economic indicator deviates sharply from forecasts, it forces investors to re-evaluate their positions and adjust their strategies. For instance, a flat PPI might be interpreted as a sign that the economy is indeed slowing down, which could lead to a reassessment of corporate earnings outlooks and investment flows. What Does This Mean for the Cryptocurrency Market ? The relationship between traditional economic indicators and the cryptocurrency market has become increasingly pronounced. As digital assets mature and attract institutional investment, they are more susceptible to macro-economic forces, particularly those driven by central bank policy and inflation. Here’s how the flat US PPI could influence the crypto landscape: Reduced Interest Rate Pressure: If the flat PPI signals a cooling of inflation, it lessens the pressure on the Federal Reserve to continue aggressive interest rate hikes. Lower interest rates generally make traditional safe-haven assets (like bonds) less attractive and increase the appeal of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. This could provide a much-needed tailwind for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. Increased Investor Confidence: A perception that inflation is under control and that a severe recession might be avoided can boost overall investor confidence. This renewed optimism often translates into increased capital flows into speculative assets like crypto, as investors seek higher returns. Correlation with Traditional Markets: The crypto market often mirrors the sentiment in equity markets, particularly tech stocks. If the flat PPI leads to a rally in tech stocks due to reduced rate hike fears, crypto assets might follow suit, demonstrating their growing correlation with broader financial instruments. Volatility Remains: While the flat PPI is a positive signal, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile. Geopolitical events, regulatory changes, and specific blockchain developments will continue to play significant roles in price action. Investors should remain vigilant and not solely rely on macro-economic indicators. For the crypto community, this data offers a cautious dose of optimism. It suggests that the macroeconomic headwinds that have suppressed crypto prices over the past year might be starting to abate. However, the path forward is rarely linear, and market participants should prepare for continued fluctuations. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Economic Landscape For investors, both seasoned and novice, the flat US PPI report underscores the importance of staying informed and adaptable. Here are a few actionable insights: Monitor the Fed Closely: The upcoming CPI report and subsequent Federal Reserve meetings will be critical. Pay attention to statements from Fed officials for clues about their future policy decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the news might be positive for risk assets, diversification remains key. Do not put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto or traditional investments. Understand the Macro Landscape: Recognize that crypto is no longer an isolated market. Its performance is increasingly tied to global macroeconomics. Educate yourself on indicators like PPI, CPI, and employment data. Practice Risk Management: Given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market , always invest what you can afford to lose and set clear entry and exit strategies. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Risk Assets? The flat US PPI for June is undoubtedly a significant development, offering a powerful signal that inflationary pressures at the producer level are indeed subsiding. This unexpected moderation in inflation data provides the Federal Reserve with more flexibility, potentially paving the way for a less aggressive monetary policy and a softer economic landing. While the journey to complete price stability is far from over, this report offers a glimmer of hope for risk assets, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market , which often thrives in an environment of lower interest rates and increased liquidity. As we move forward, vigilance and informed decision-making will be paramount for all participants in this interconnected global economy.

New Elliptic report: The state of cross-chain crime 2025 Great news! Our latest report, The state of cross-chain crime 2025, is now available. Cross-chain crime, the anonymous movement of illicit crypto through DEXs, cross-chain bridges and no-KYC swap services, has… pic.twitter.com/7jjIvE8NhB — Elliptic (@elliptic) July 16, 2025 The figure marks a threefold increase from $7 billion in 2023, showing how criminals are taking advantage of decentralized financial tools to move and conceal stolen assets. Elliptic’s 2025 Cross-Chain Crime Report outlines how criminals are increasingly using decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and token swap services to obscure the origin of funds linked to scams, hacks, and sanctioned entities. The data points to a sharp rise in chain-hopping tactics, where bad actors rapidly move funds across multiple blockchains to make detection more difficult. The report shows that 33% of crypto crime investigations now involve activity on more than three blockchains; 27% span over five, and one in five extends across ten or more. Among the most high-profile incidents this year was the Bybit hack —the largest crypto heist on record—where stolen funds were rapidly laundered through multi-chain paths. Elliptic helped trace the assets and continues to support global investigations into the breach. State-Backed Threats and Sanctioned Platforms The report attributes around 12% of the total $21 billion to North Korean-linked activity, primarily driven by the Lazarus Group . These state-backed hackers have been at the forefront of using advanced chain obfuscation techniques, making the recovery of stolen assets increasingly complex. Their tactics now include swift coin swaps across multiple chains and using anonymizing services to cash out funds. Elliptic also flagged $300 million in cross-chain transfers originating from Iranian crypto services currently under U.S. sectoral sanctions. In Russia, the Garantex exchange—seized in March 2025 with the help of Elliptic’s data and the U.S. Secret Service—had been using cross-chain tools to hide fund flows and bypass international restrictions. The company’s findings reflect how sanctioned nations are leaning on blockchain infrastructure to bypass traditional financial barriers. Beyond these cases, Elliptic identified a growing number of scams that operate in real-time and use cross-chain strategies to siphon money before authorities can react. Platforms like CBEX, which stole nearly $1 billion from users while appearing legitimate, relied on this multi-chain laundering to stay operational while defrauding investors. Scams, Rug Pulls, and Real-Time Laundering The 2024–2025 memecoin boom created fertile ground for fraud. One example was the collapse of the $LIBRA token, which saw $100 million vanish in a rug pull just days after Argentine President Javier Milei tweeted support. The endorsement sent prices soaring before the anonymous developers drained liquidity and disappeared. Elliptic’s lead crypto threat researcher, Dr. Arda Akartuna, stressed that while criminals are using more complex methods, they are not beyond reach. “Our ability to automatically trace transactions across 55 blockchains and over 300 bridge routes means we can follow the money, no matter how it moves,” he said.

By Elior Manier A month ago, one of our crypto market analysis had mentioned the scenario of Ethereum retaking some of the relative strength it had heavily lost in the beginning of 2025, notably leaving some space for Solana to outperform the second largest cryptocurrency. Now, since its War lows, Ether ( ETH-USD ) has had a stellar run – Since its 2,174 lows on June 21st, the crypto rallied back close to 50% , leading to the ETH/BTC ratio looking poised for a decent breakout. The ratio has just broken out to the upside of its range which calls for an ETH Technical Analysis. ETH/BTC Breaks out of its 3 month-long Consolidation The second-to-first-crypto ratio is essential to track the appetite for altcoins, key to signs of depth in digital assets as Bitcoin had taken a significant advantage since it started rallying to its first $100,000 trip – The rally in BTC had started in October 2024 and started to put a top in the ratio. Yesterday marked the breaching of the 2.64% top of range, which had stuck the altcoins in lesser demand, particularly since the start of the Israel-Iran War had dampened appetite.The altcoin market is currently looking good, and few potential measured moves targets point towards the ongoing move in the ratio to stall between 2.90% and 3.1% in ETH/BTC – This would give Ether some considerable upside, particularly if Bitcoin consolidates at current levels. Ethereum Technical Analysis ETH Weekly Timeframe Ethereum Weekly Chart, July 16, 2025 – Source: TradingView Looking out to the Weekly timeframe serves to show how the 3 year action in the second biggest crypto has been rangebound overall. But with the major rally in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the expansion of the democratization of what was a niche-financial market, there is potential to retest at least December 2024 highs as long as the crypto market maintains its bullish tone. Looking at fibonacci extensions of the 2022 $1,000 lows to December 2024 highs, any All-time high breakout (still far from current levels) could stall between $4,915 to $5,250 (127.8% to 138.2% Fibs) and further rally towards $5,970 161.8% targets.Many things may happen before these levels get hit; however, in technical analysis, all scnearios must be explored.

Recently, the spotlight turned to Binance Alpha , an exclusive platform nestled within the expansive Binance Wallet ecosystem. This dedicated space, designed to showcase groundbreaking early-stage crypto projects, has officially added Hyperion (RION) to its growing roster. This move, initially brought to light by an X post from New Listings Feed, signals a significant moment for both Hyperion and the broader landscape of emerging digital assets. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for Early-Stage Crypto Projects ? Binance Alpha isn’t just another section within a crypto wallet; it’s a meticulously curated showcase for innovation. Imagine a high-profile gallery where promising, nascent blockchain ventures get their first significant exposure to a vast, engaged audience. That’s precisely what Binance Alpha offers. It serves as a vital bridge between cutting-edge, yet unproven, projects and potential early adopters, investors, and developers who are constantly on the lookout for the next big thing in the decentralized space. The platform’s existence underscores Binance’s commitment not only to established cryptocurrencies but also to fostering growth and discovery within the nascent stages of the industry. For early-stage crypto projects , inclusion on Binance Alpha is more than just a mention; it’s a stamp of initial recognition, hinting at potential and opening doors to increased visibility. While it’s crucial to remember that this inclusion does not guarantee a future listing on the main Binance exchange, it certainly places the spotlight on projects that meet certain rigorous criteria for community engagement and market relevance. Understanding Hyperion RION : The New Addition With the announcement of its addition to Binance Alpha , many in the crypto community are now turning their attention to Hyperion (RION). But what exactly is RION, and what makes it stand out among the multitude of projects vying for attention? Hyperion aims to revolutionize the way we interact with and utilize geospatial data through blockchain technology. Its vision is to build a decentralized mapping ecosystem, empowering users with data ownership, privacy, and economic incentives for contributing to and utilizing map services. At its core, Hyperion seeks to address the centralized nature of traditional mapping services, offering a more democratic and transparent alternative. The RION token serves as the native utility token within this ecosystem, facilitating transactions, rewarding data contributors, and enabling governance participation. This focus on decentralization, data privacy, and community-driven mapping resonates strongly with the core tenets of blockchain technology, positioning Hyperion as a potentially transformative force in the geospatial industry. Key Aspects of Hyperion (RION): Decentralized Mapping: Building a global, community-driven map free from centralized control. Data Ownership & Privacy: Empowering users with control over their location data. Economic Incentives: Rewarding users for contributing map data and participating in the network. Blockchain Foundation: Leveraging distributed ledger technology for transparency and security. The Intricate Process of Crypto Token Selection for Binance Alpha One of the most intriguing aspects of Binance Alpha is its selective process for adding new tokens. Unlike a typical exchange listing, which involves extensive due diligence for full compliance and liquidity, Alpha’s selection focuses on identifying projects with strong foundational elements and promising trajectories. The official announcement highlighted two primary criteria: community engagement and market trends among emerging projects . This approach reflects a nuanced understanding of the crypto landscape, where grassroots support and alignment with evolving market narratives can often be early indicators of long-term success. Let’s break down what these criteria likely entail: Selection Criterion What it Means for Projects Why it Matters Community Engagement Active social media presence, vibrant Telegram/Discord channels, consistent developer updates, strong user base interaction, and community-driven initiatives. A strong community indicates organic interest, resilience, and a solid foundation for future growth and adoption. It shows real-world utility and user buy-in. Market Trends Among Emerging Projects Alignment with current industry narratives (e.g., AI, DePIN, GameFi, RWA, ZK-proofs), innovative technology, clear problem-solving utility, and a viable business model. Projects that ride the wave of current market trends often find easier adoption and attract more capital. Innovation and utility are key to long-term relevance. For Hyperion RION , its addition suggests that the project has demonstrated a compelling combination of a dedicated community and a solution that resonates with current market demands for decentralized infrastructure and data ownership. This rigorous crypto token selection process helps filter out less serious projects, offering users of Binance Wallet a glimpse into potentially impactful innovations. The Broader Impact: What Does RION’s Inclusion Mean for Binance Wallet Users and the Crypto Ecosystem? The inclusion of Hyperion (RION) on Binance Alpha holds multiple layers of significance. For Hyperion itself, it provides an invaluable boost in visibility and credibility. Being showcased on a platform associated with Binance, even if not the main exchange, brings it to the attention of millions of users who trust the Binance brand. This exposure can translate into increased community participation, developer interest, and potentially, greater liquidity in secondary markets. For users of Binance Wallet , it offers an exclusive early look at projects that have passed an initial vetting process. It’s an opportunity to discover and potentially engage with promising ventures before they hit mainstream exchanges, often at an earlier stage of their development. This aligns with the ethos of many crypto enthusiasts who enjoy being at the forefront of technological innovation and supporting projects from the ground up. Navigating Early-Stage Crypto Investments: Actionable Insights While the excitement around new projects on Binance Alpha is palpable, it’s paramount for enthusiasts and potential investors to approach these opportunities with a balanced perspective. The caveat, ‘inclusion does not guarantee a future listing on the exchange,’ is a critical reminder of the inherent risks in early-stage crypto projects . Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on an announcement. Deep dive into Hyperion’s whitepaper, team, technology, roadmap, and community activity. Understand its tokenomics and competitive landscape. Understand the Risk Profile: Early-stage projects are inherently high-risk, high-reward. Many may not succeed. Only invest what you are prepared to lose. Monitor Progress: Follow Hyperion’s development updates, community discussions, and partnerships. See if they are meeting their roadmap milestones. Distinguish Alpha from Main Exchange: Remember, Binance Alpha is a showcase, not a listing. Liquidity and accessibility will be different from a main exchange listing. Consider Long-Term Vision: Does the project solve a real problem? Does it have a sustainable economic model? This addition serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market is dynamic, constantly evolving, and ripe with opportunities for those willing to explore beyond the most established assets. Platforms like Binance Alpha are instrumental in this discovery process, acting as launchpads for the next generation of decentralized innovation. The Future Horizon: What’s Next for Binance Alpha and the Ecosystem? The continuous addition of projects like Hyperion (RION) to Binance Alpha signals a clear strategy from Binance: to remain at the forefront of crypto innovation by nurturing and showcasing promising ventures. This proactive approach benefits the entire ecosystem. It provides much-needed visibility for nascent projects, offers unique discovery opportunities for users, and reinforces Binance’s position as a comprehensive gateway to the decentralized world. As the crypto space matures, the role of platforms that bridge the gap between groundbreaking ideas and broader adoption becomes increasingly critical. Binance Alpha , with its focus on robust crypto token selection criteria like community engagement and market trends, is poised to play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of early-stage crypto projects . We can anticipate more exciting additions and continued evolution of this platform, making Binance Wallet an even more indispensable tool for crypto enthusiasts. In Conclusion: A Glimpse into Tomorrow’s Innovations The inclusion of Hyperion (RION) on Binance Alpha is more than just a news item; it’s a testament to the vibrant and ever-expanding world of decentralized technology. It highlights Binance’s strategic vision in supporting early-stage crypto projects and offers Binance Wallet users an exclusive window into potential future leaders in the blockchain space.

This trend mirrors the growing optimism that $WIF may soon break key resistance zones and target new highs. Adding to the bullish narrative, DeFi Dev Corp partnered on June 24 to launch a dedicated $WIF validator on Solana . This move allows $WIF holders to earn staking rewards, ushering in an actual DeFi use case for what was once considered just another meme coin. In February, another sign emerged when an on-chain wallet withdrew 14 million $WIF (over $15 million) from Binance for vesting purposes. Rather than indicating a selloff, this pointed to structured, long-term token management, often a sign of healthy project fundamentals.

On the hourly price chart, $WIF has been tracing a steady recovery since breaking out from below $0.90 levels earlier in the week. $WIF price action has formed a clear series of higher lows and higher highs, pushing into an ascending channel that has carried it toward the $1.10–$1.12 region. When analyzed closely, investors will notice that each upward leg has been driven by expanding volume. $WIF price chart, July 16 (Source: TradingView) At the same time, pullbacks have seen lighter turnover, a sign of dip absorption rather than broad-based selling. The most recent rally touched $1.1197 before supply emerged, leaving upper wicks and indicating that sellers are actively defending that zone. Even so, the structure remains intact above prior pivot supports around $1.04 and $1.00, areas that now serve as key bases in the trend. The intraday volume footprint adds clarity to this behavior. Bars with heavy positive delta, such as a 799.55K delta with over 16.1 million in buying versus 15.3 million in selling, show where aggressive buyers stepped in and drove the asset’s price higher. $WIF volume chart, July 16 (Source: TradingView) Another strong footprint reading at 1.01 million positive delta shows continued buying interest. However, the chart also displays moments of resistance, including a –400.91K delta bar, where sellers absorbed demand and capped the move. The back‑and‑forth between strong buying and strong selling in the footprint lines up with the areas on the price chart where price paused or struggled, such as around $1.12 resistance and the $1.08–$1.09 pullback zones. The data from Coinglass on derivatives ties this together. Open interest jumped by over 14% to $508 million, while long/short ratios skewed firmly long, particularly on Binance, where top traders show a 2.1573 ratio, which is a clear bullish position. $WIF derivatives data page (Source: Coinglass) Liquidation metrics show more pressure on shorts, with $1.59 million liquidated compared to $945K on longs, indicating bullish positioning has so far been rewarded. That bullish tilt, however, also makes the market sensitive to failure at resistance, as crowded longs can unwind quickly. If buyers manage to sustain momentum and push through the $1.12 barrier on strong volume and positive delta footprints, a breakout toward $1.15–$1.18 becomes likely. Should price instead lose grip on $1.04 support with selling pressure accelerating in the footprint, it would indicate a breakdown and open the door for a deeper retracement toward $1.00 or below. The $1.12 resistance and $1.04 support now define the key levels that will decide the next decisive move.

The milestone follows earlier highs of $112,000 on July 9 and $118,000 on July 11, marking a series of sharp moves within days. However, unlike previous rallies, the current surge appears to be supported by healthier market conditions. On-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests the market is not overheating – a notable contrast to past cycles where similar price spikes led to short-term corrections. Bitcoin Positioned for Sustained Upside as Market Cools CryptoQuant’s analysis focuses on a key metric known as the UTXO Age Bands, particularly the 1-day to 1-week range. Spikes in this range typically indicate short-term selling pressure and profit-taking behavior. In March and December 2024, it showed strong activity, signaling overheated market conditions. In contrast, the current cycle shows smaller spikes, even as the apex coin trades at higher prices. Notably, the reduced movement suggests that holders are less eager to sell quickly. Many now appear to be treating Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than chasing short-term profits. According to CryptoQuant, this shift in sentiment could support a more sustained rally through the second half of 2025. With the market showing fewer signs of fast-paced speculation, the absence of aggressive selling pressure may allow prices to climb further without immediate pullbacks. Institutional Demand Builds Momentum Alongside this behavior change is a noticeable rise in institutional interest. Between July 7 and 12, 29 companies added a combined 4,209 BTC to their balance sheets, with 80 treasury-related announcements logged in just five days. Institutional demand is also surging through U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , which saw over $2.7 billion in inflows last week, far outpacing the number of new Bitcoins mined. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which recently surpassed $80 billion in assets under management, achieving this milestone faster than any ETF in history. Consequently, the combination of strong institutional inflows and subdued short-term selling could offer more price stability. With retail speculation slowing and larger players stepping in, Bitcoin’s path to higher prices may remain wide open.

The city council unanimously approved the ordinance on Tuesday, following a case where a resident was scammed at a crypto ATM in neighboring St. Clair Shores. Officials say fraudsters instructed the victim to withdraw cash and deposit it into a crypto kiosk under false pretenses. This incident mirrors a growing trend across Michigan. In April, the state attorney general issued a warning about increasing crypto ATM-related scams, urging the public to stay cautious. Around the same time, the Detroit Free Press reported that several victims had lost thousands of dollars in irreversible cryptocurrency transactions. City cracks down on crypto ATMs to curb scams and protect users As cryptocurrency fraud continues to rise, the Grosse Pointe Farms city council has voted to introduce a new, stricter regulation about crypto ATMs nationwide . The goal is to increase transparency and discourage abuse of the machines. Council debated the ordinance, in which City Attorney Bill Burgess highlighted the ordinance’s primary components at the meeting. Michigan will also require that any crypto ATM placed there be registered with the Department of Public Safety. Operators are supposed to acquire a bona fide business license before placing their machines. To safeguard users, the machines must also present fraud warnings and consumer protection messages explicitly informing users about the dangers of making irrevocable transactions. The ordinance also restricts new users to transactions of $1,000 a day and $5,000 within the first 14 days. These restrictions are automatically removed after 14 days. Burgess said the idea was that, by that point, a person would become familiar with using the machine and understand how it works, making them less vulnerable to scams. Council member Lev Wood said such protections are necessary because scammers frequently target people who don’t understand what they are doing, causing them to deposit big chunks of their cash into crypto ATMs. “The crooks tell people to go and put money into these machines, and it’s a very untransparent situation,” Council member Lev Wood said at the meeting. “What we want to do with our ordinance tonight is to enhance transparency and provide some help to our residents.” The council unanimously approved the ordinance, a sign of widespread support for proactive action on digital safety. Crypto operators welcome oversight measures The ordinance had the backing of local officials and players in the crypto industry. Coinflip, a Chicago-based digital currency business that operates crypto ATMs in the US, sent a representative, Carson Gat, to provide insight on the industry side. He described how he intervened to prevent an older woman from being swindled at a kiosk. Gat said that first-time users were the most vulnerable, noting that most scam attempts occurred when people were unfamiliar with cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinflip, which has operated in Michigan since 2019, was granted a money transmitter license in April. Limits and holds, at least for new users, are good since they also deter bad actors and protect users. The new regulations in Grosse Pointe Farms could set a template for other communities across Michigan and the nation. Regulators are not surprised by the surge of crypto-related fraud. Crypto payments, unlike bank transactions, are all but irretrievable once made. This has made crypto ATMs an easy mark for scammers who use high-pressure tactics to get victims to send money in a hurry. Crypto kiosks are commonly located in gas stations, convenience stores, and shopping malls. Operators often leave these spots, making them easy targets for scams. Experts say that victims may feel isolated, unsure how to seek help, or unable to involve a friend or family member.

The bank launched a USD deposit token and underwrote Circle’s IPO. Global regulators are calling for consistent stablecoin rules as cross-border use expands. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank will continue exploring stablecoins and deposit tokens to deepen its understanding of digital payments, even as he questioned their practical advantages. According to a report by MarketWatch , Dimon‘s statement was made during the company’s post-earnings call with analysts on Tuesday, covering several topics, including stablecoins. Stablecoins and Traditional Finance “We’re going to be involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it,” Dimon said. “We don’t know exactly—I think they’re real, but I don’t know why you’d want a stablecoin as opposed to just payment.” In June, JPMorgan launched JPMD, a U.S. dollar deposit token designed for institutional clients to make payments on public blockchains. Dimon said the bank’s involvement reflects a need to stay informed as fintech companies continue pushing into the stablecoin sector. He admitted that these firms are “very smart,” adding that they’re looking for ways to create bank accounts and get into payment systems and rewards programs. “We have to be cognizant of that,” Dimon said, according to an AlphaSense transcript. “The way to be cognizant is to be involved. So, we’re going to be in it and learning a lot, and [a] player.” The bank was a lead underwriter for the June IPO of Circle Internet Group, a major stablecoin issuer. Circle’s stock has climbed more than 500% since its $31 offering price, and the company recently filed to become a digital-currency trust bank. Crypto Week for Digital Asset Regulation Dimon’s comments come as the U.S. House of Representatives moves forward with several crypto-focused bills during what industry observers have labeled “ Crypto Week ,” including the GENIUS Act focused on stablecoins. Crypto week’s developments could reset how U.S. approaches crypto regulation—from compliance and custody to digital dollars. #genius #crypto https://t.co/z5HeNKVNjU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 14, 2025 Regulators worldwide are working to unify standards for digital tokens used in payments. Groups like the Financial Stability Board and the IMF have urged clearer rules for stablecoins to prevent risks from fragmented oversight and rising adoption. Outside the U.S., banks and fintechs in Asia and Latin America are launching stablecoins tied to local currencies. These efforts seek to improve payment flows, especially across borders, and may shape new payment models even before their long-term role is fully defined. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could JPMorgan’s stablecoin activity influence other major banks? While JPMorgan remains cautious, its active development of payment tokens may pressure peer institutions to explore similar tools to remain competitive in institutional settlement and global treasury operations. Is there a risk of regulatory overlap between stablecoins and deposit tokens? Yes. Deposit tokens and stablecoins may fall under different legal definitions depending on issuer type, backing, and use case. Without clear delineation, compliance burdens could increase for institutions operating both. What infrastructure challenges exist for integrating stablecoins into traditional banking? Stablecoin use on public blockchains raises concerns around KYC, AML compliance, and transaction finality. Banks will need scalable monitoring tools and secure bridges between legacy systems and digital asset networks. Why are stablecoins gaining traction outside the U.S.? In regions with less reliable banking access or volatile local currencies, stablecoins offer quicker and cheaper remittance and settlement tools. These practical uses are driving real-world adoption despite unclear regulation.

Today brought a wave of positive news as major U.S. stock indices opened higher, signaling a potentially robust day for investors. But what does this uptick in traditional markets truly signify for the often-volatile crypto space? Let’s dive into the details and uncover the ripple effects. The US Stock Market Sees a Promising Market Open The trading day kicked off with an optimistic tone across Wall Street, as all three major U.S. stock indices registered gains right out of the gate. This immediate positive momentum suggests a prevailing sense of optimism among traders and investors, eager to capitalize on potential opportunities. Here’s a quick snapshot of the opening performance: S&P500: +0.17% NASDAQ: +0.05% Dow: +0.29% These early gains, while modest, set a positive precedent for the day. The S&P 500, widely regarded as one of the best gauges of large-cap U.S. equities, showing green is often a good sign for overall market health. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant U.S. companies, and the technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite, both starting strong, reinforce this positive sentiment. What’s Driving This Investor Confidence ? When markets open higher, it’s rarely due to a single factor. Instead, it’s often a confluence of various macroeconomic indicators, corporate news, and prevailing sentiment. So, what might be fueling this initial burst of investor confidence today? Several elements typically contribute to such positive openings: Favorable Economic Data: Recent releases concerning inflation, employment, or consumer spending might have painted a more optimistic picture of the economy, alleviating fears of a slowdown or recession. Positive Corporate Earnings: Strong earnings reports from bellwether companies can often lift the entire market, as they signal robust business health and future growth potential. Even if no major reports were out this morning, positive pre-market news or analyst upgrades could have set the tone. Anticipation of Monetary Policy: Expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates or quantitative easing can significantly impact market sentiment. A perceived dovish tilt or stability in policy can encourage risk-taking. Geopolitical Stability: A period of reduced geopolitical tension or positive diplomatic developments can also contribute to a more stable and confident market environment. Technical Rebound: Sometimes, a positive open is simply a technical rebound after a period of consolidation or minor correction, as investors look to buy the dip or re-enter positions. Understanding these underlying drivers is crucial, as they provide context not just for the stock market, but also for how other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, might behave. Analyzing NASDAQ Performance and Broader Market Trends The NASDAQ Performance , while showing a modest gain of +0.05% at the open, is particularly noteworthy for crypto enthusiasts. The NASDAQ Composite is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, many of which are seen as more sensitive to interest rate changes and broader economic shifts than their value counterparts. In recent years, the correlation between tech stocks and cryptocurrencies has become increasingly apparent, with both often reacting similarly to macro-economic news. Why is NASDAQ’s performance so relevant? Risk-On Appetite: A positive NASDAQ suggests that investors are willing to take on more risk, favoring growth-oriented assets. This ‘risk-on’ sentiment often spills over into the crypto market, as digital assets are generally considered higher-risk, higher-reward investments. Innovation and Disruption: Both the tech sector and the crypto industry are built on innovation and disruption. Positive sentiment in one often indicates a broader belief in the power of technology to drive future economic growth. Liquidity Flows: When large institutional investors see opportunities in the tech sector, it can free up capital or create a positive feedback loop that eventually finds its way into other speculative assets, including Bitcoin and altcoins. Monitoring the NASDAQ throughout the day will provide further clues about the sustained appetite for growth and innovation, which could indirectly bolster crypto prices. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones: Barometers of Economic Health While the NASDAQ captures the tech pulse, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average offer a broader perspective on the health of the U.S. economy. The S&P 500, comprising 500 of the largest U.S. companies across various sectors, is often considered the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Its positive open of +0.17% indicates broad-based optimism, not just confined to the tech sector. The Dow Jones, though less diversified, represents established industrial giants and blue-chip companies. Its +0.29% gain suggests that even traditional sectors are experiencing a positive start, hinting at a robust economic environment. When these major indices move in unison, it often signals a strong underlying sentiment that transcends specific industries. This synchronized positive movement across the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow is crucial because it paints a picture of: Broad Market Confidence: It’s not just one sector or a few companies doing well; the optimism is more widespread. Reduced Systemic Risk Fears: When major indices are up, it often means that immediate systemic risks (like a financial crisis or major economic downturn) are perceived as low. Capital Allocation: A healthy stock market can encourage capital to flow into other asset classes, including those perceived as riskier, like cryptocurrencies. Implications of Today’s Market Open for Crypto Investors The positive market open in traditional equities holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. Historically, there has been a notable correlation between the performance of major stock indices, particularly the NASDAQ, and the price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here’s how today’s stock market performance could influence your crypto portfolio: Factor Impact on Crypto Explanation Risk-On Sentiment Positive When investors feel confident in traditional markets, they are more likely to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Increased Liquidity Positive A rising stock market can free up capital or generate profits that investors might re-invest into crypto, seeking higher returns. Institutional Interest Positive Large institutions often manage diversified portfolios. A strong stock market performance might make them more comfortable with crypto exposure. Macroeconomic Stability Positive A perception of stable economic conditions reduces the need for ‘safe haven’ assets, allowing more speculative investments to thrive. Potential Decoupling Neutral/Negative (Less Likely) While correlation is common, some argue for a future ‘decoupling.’ However, today’s open suggests continued linkage. While cryptocurrencies are known for their unique market dynamics and often react to their own set of news (e.g., regulatory developments, technological upgrades, specific project news), they are not entirely insulated from broader macroeconomic trends. A rising tide in the stock market often lifts many boats, and crypto has increasingly become one of those boats. Challenges and Considerations Amidst the Gains Despite the positive open, it’s crucial for investors to maintain a balanced perspective. The financial markets are complex, and short-term gains do not guarantee long-term stability. Several challenges could still impact the trajectory of both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies: Inflationary Pressures: Persistent high inflation could still prompt central banks to adopt more aggressive monetary policies, which typically dampen market enthusiasm. Interest Rate Hikes: Further rate hikes, if deemed necessary to combat inflation, could increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth and impacting corporate earnings. Geopolitical Risks: Unforeseen geopolitical events can quickly shift market sentiment from ‘risk-on’ to ‘risk-off,’ leading to sell-offs across asset classes. Regulatory Scrutiny: For the crypto market specifically, increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide remains a significant overhang that can introduce volatility regardless of traditional market performance. Market Volatility: Both stock and crypto markets are inherently volatile. A positive open can quickly reverse course due to unexpected news or a shift in sentiment. Therefore, while today’s start is encouraging, it serves as a reminder to stay informed and agile in your investment strategy. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility For investors, particularly those with exposure to both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies, today’s positive market open offers several actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor economic data releases, corporate earnings, and central bank communications. These are the fundamental drivers of market sentiment. Diversify Your Portfolio: While correlation exists, diversification across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, crypto, real estate) can help mitigate risks during periods of high volatility. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any investment decisions, assess your personal risk tolerance. A positive market day might encourage aggressive moves, but it’s important to stick to a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and comfort level. Look Beyond Daily Swings: Focus on long-term trends rather than reacting to every daily fluctuation. A strong long-term investment thesis is often more resilient than short-term trading strategies. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: For crypto investors, dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price) can be an effective strategy to navigate market ups and downs, taking advantage of both dips and rallies. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope in Dynamic Markets Today’s higher open for the U.S. stock markets – with the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow all in positive territory – is a welcome sight for investors globally. It signals a moment of renewed investor confidence , potentially driven by a mix of favorable economic conditions and a willingness to embrace risk. For the cryptocurrency market, this positive momentum in traditional finance often acts as a tailwind, fostering a ‘risk-on’ environment that can encourage capital flows into digital assets. While challenges and uncertainties always loom, today’s strong start offers a glimmer of hope and reinforces the interconnectedness of global financial markets. Staying informed, maintaining a diversified approach, and understanding the broader macroeconomic landscape will be key to navigating the dynamic interplay between traditional stocks and the ever-evolving world of crypto.

Then he added, “I don’t rule out anything, but I think it’s highly unlikely, unless he has to leave for fraud.” That walk-back came less than 24 hours after a very different message from the Oval. On Tuesday evening, Trump met with a group of GOP lawmakers to talk about crypto bills stuck in Congress. During that meeting, Trump asked them straight-up whether he should go ahead and remove Powell. According to a senior White House official who allegedly spoke anonymously to CNBC, lawmakers supported the idea. “The President asked lawmakers how they felt about firing the Fed Chair. They expressed approval. The President indicated he likely will soon,” the official said. Trump drafted a letter to fire Powell and showed it off during crypto meeting It didn’t stop there. While they were all still gathered in the White House, Trump reportedly showed the group a draft termination letter addressed to Powell. That was confirmed by The New York Times, which said Trump had already written it and brought it to the crypto meeting. This whole exchange happened during a conversation that was supposed to be about blockchain legislation. So far, Federal Reserve officials have completely refused to comment on what was said that night behind closed doors. Powell himself has always stood firm, repeating in public that removing him from his job is “not permitted under the law.” Technically, no U.S. president has ever actually fired the head of the central bank, even though many have publicly criticized them. Meanwhile, when the initial reports broke that Trump was considering firing Powell, the markets took a dive. But those losses reversed quickly after Trump denied it to reporters. That’s the level of impact this issue had. Inside the White House, however, attacks on Powell haven’t stopped. Several top Trump aides are still pushing to get the Fed to lower its main interest rate. Lately, they’ve started going after Powell for something totally unrelated to monetary policy; renovations at the Fed’s Washington, D.C., headquarters. Trump uses Fed renovation as ammo, floats “fraud” angle That’s right, the latest angle is about a $2.5 billion remodel of the Federal Reserve’s building. It’s been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and Powell has asked the inspector general to open a review. But Trump isn’t letting that go quietly. “Fraud is possible,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “So there could be something to that. But I think he’s not doing a good job. He’s got a very easy job to do. You know what he has to do? Lower interest rates.” Let’s be clear: Powell has kept interest rates flat since cutting them in late 2024. Trump, on the other hand, wants major action, as in 3 percentage points of cuts . Right now, the federal funds rate is between 4.25% and 4.5%. That means Trump wants it somewhere near 1.25%. And he’s not exactly being subtle about it. On Wednesday, Arkansas Rep. French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, told CNBC that “I don’t see” the firing happening. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave a similar answer to Bloomberg a day earlier, saying he didn’t expect any action from the president. So there’s clearly division inside the party about how far this will go. But then came Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, who posted on X, “Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source.” She followed that with another post: “I’m 99% sure firing is imminent.” Let’s not forget, Trump is the one who picked Powell in the first place. He nominated him in November 2018, replacing Janet Yellen, who later joined the Biden administration as Treasury Secretary. Powell got confirmed by the Senate in February 2019, but it’s been rocky ever since. Trump has criticized him repeatedly , both during his first term and now during his second. And it’s not just Powell. On Wednesday, Trump also took aim at the rest of the Fed Board. “That goes for his board too, because his board is not doing the job as they should,” he said. Funny thing is, he picked them too. That includes Michelle Bowman, now vice chair of bank supervision, and Christopher Waller, both of whom were Trump’s own appointees.

Token holders voted 99% in favor for the proposal to allow WLFI tokens to trade on secondary markets and transfer peer-to-peer, a Snapshot vote shows. The decision comes after the protocol raised around $590 million last year in a pre-sale where investors could buy WLFI tokens. For example, Tron founder Justin Sun also purchased $30 million of the asset. World Liberty Financial is developing a DeFi lending and borrowing platform, and also issues a U.S. dollar stablecoin named USD1. The WLFI token was designed to give holders the right to participate in the protocol's governance and decision-making. However, those tokens that were sold to early supporters have been locked-up since then, without the ability to sell, buy or transfer them. The proposal that passed sets a phased token unlock plan. Some tokens that were sold during the presale will unlock at trading launch, while the rest await a second community vote to decide their release schedule. Tokens held by founders, the team and advisors will remain locked longer than early supporter allocations to underscore long-term commitment to the project, the proposal said. Final unlock timing and eligibility criteria will be determined later, it added.

If finalized, it would mark the first direct BNB holding by a Nasdaq-listed company. The initiative includes acquiring BNB, Osprey BNB Chain Trust shares, and integrating yield and custody infrastructure. Windtree Therapeutics has signed a securities purchase agreement for $60 million to support a crypto treasury strategy centered on BNB, the native token of Binance Smart Chain . Subject to shareholder approval & the satisfaction of other closing conditions, $WINT will become the first NASDAQ-listed company offering direct exposure to the BNB token, the fifth-largest blockchain by market capitalization (over $95 billion). https://t.co/ncoR3W1Nh8 pic.twitter.com/iEB0oaQ9Qw — Windtreetx (@windtreetx) July 16, 2025 According to a press release issued on July 16, the agreement, led by Build and Build Corp, includes an option for an additional $140 million in future subscriptions, subject to shareholder approval and other closing conditions. Potential Subscriptions of up to $200 Million If completed, Windtree would become the first Nasdaq-listed firm with direct BNB holdings. “This transaction secures up to $200 million from institutional investors, offering our shareholders a unique opportunity to gain exposure to a BNB-focused crypto treasury strategy,” said Windtree CEO Jed Latkin. Windtree said proceeds from the deal would be used to acquire tokens, shares of Osprey BNB Chain Trust, and cash to implement its digital-asset plan. The strategy includes custody, security protocols, and potential yield activities. Build and Build Corp director Patrick Horsman called the deal “a BNB strategy for the U.S. market,” adding that it will offer investors access to Binance and BNB through a regulated structure. The crypto ranks as the fifth-largest token by market cap, with an average daily trading volume of more than $2 billion. It is used across Binance’s exchange and Binance Smart Chain applications. BNB and Altcoins for Crypto Treasury Windtree’s investment is positioned to capitalize on increasing institutional interest in BNB-linked infrastructure, particularly as regulated channels for exposure in the U.S. remain limited. According to the release, the current agreement does not constitute an offer to sell securities and is pending standard legal and regulatory review. With Bitcoin and Ethereum dominating corporate adoption , BNB has seen comparatively limited direct exposure from publicly listed firms. Windtree’s announcement may test whether investor appetite extends beyond the largest tokens, especially for assets linked to centralized platforms like Binance. Rather than focusing solely on asset appreciation, firms may also begin to view token holdings as part of broader infrastructure engagement, including payment rails, on-chain applications, or staking ecosystems tied to specific chains. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Osprey BNB Chain Trust? The Osprey BNB Chain Trust is an investment vehicle designed to offer exposure to BNB through a regulated structure. Could Windtree’s model be replicated by other public companies? If Windtree’s approach gains regulatory approval and market support, it could create a model for other firms to pursue token-specific treasury strategies involving altcoins beyond Bitcoin or Ethereum. How does BNB’s link to Binance affect its institutional acceptance? BNB’s ties to Binance may complicate adoption among some firms, given regulatory scrutiny of the exchange. However, BNB’s utility across DeFi and payments could make it attractive to companies seeking broader blockchain integration.

In a conference call with analysts, Bank CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted the improvement in the market environment in the last quarter, stating that this allowed BoA's strong research team to maintain their prediction that there would be no recession in the US. Moynihan noted that individual and corporate customers continue to spend, and that, particularly with the passage of the latest trade agreement and tax law, customers have developed clearer expectations about the future and are beginning to shape their behavior accordingly. He also noted that the Fed is not expected to cut interest rates this year, with the first cut unlikely to occur until early 2026. Related News: BREAKING: FED's Highly Anticipated Beige Book Document Published - Here Are The Details Meanwhile, President Donald Trump called on the Fed to lower interest rates, arguing that inflation rates are low. In a statement on Truth Social Tuesday morning, Trump declared, “Consumer prices are low.

Here’s why: Powell, who hurriedly cut federal interest rates by 75 basis points ahead of the 2024 election, has been reluctant to ease monetary conditions further, citing potentially inflationary effects of the White House’s new tariff policies. Trump has been floating the idea of firing him for a while now. The regulator, for his part, has maintained since November that Trump lacks the legal authority to do so. Powell’s term is slated to end in May 2026 in any case. ""Jerome Powell has been very bad for our country,"" Trump said over the weekend. ""We should have the lowest interest rate on Earth, and we don’t. He just refuses to do it."" The coalition against Powell appears to be growing by the day. The director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Bill Pulte, has accused the chairman of political bias and called for a congressional investigation into his leadership. Republican members of Congress (such Senators Rick Scott and Tommy Tuberville, and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan) have, too, criticized Powell’s actions over the past few months. Then there’s Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor — and potential Powell replacement — who says that it’s time for “regime change” at the Fed. (I’m only naming a few people, but the list is long.) Now, the Federal Reserve is technically independent, so Powell is protected from arbitrary dismissal and can only be removed “for cause,” meaning there needs to be a serious, legally justified reason to fire him. Powell’s critics are now using the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion headquarters renovation as a new angle of attack , alleging potential misconduct or that Powell misled Congress in his testimony regarding the renovation. (The project was set in motion years before Trump appointed Powell in 2018.) The pressure has increased even more in the last couple of days. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday that a “formal process” to replace Powell was underway. A few hours later, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna tweeted that Powell’s firing was “imminent,” sending Polymarket odds of the event to 27%. The rumors did not abate on Wednesday. Bloomberg and CBS reported today that Trump was looking to pull the trigger soon, while The New York Times claimed that the president had already drafted a letter to the effect. Trump, however, immediately said he wasn’t planning on firing the Fed chairman, and even downplayed accusations of fraud about the $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. Where does that leave us? Let’s keep our eyes on the prize: CME FedWatch indicates there’s only a 2.6% chance of rates coming down at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, scheduled for July 30. However, those odds jump to almost 60% for September.",Opinion|Federal Reserve|Jerome Powell|The Node|Opinion,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 19:38:07

By 2028, the minimum WLD price might drop to $3.37 while its maximum can reach $4.01. The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $6.55 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the world’s prediction. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

Higher lows confirm an uptrend, and consistent higher lows on multiple timeframes signal continued bullish strength. On July 16, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) is trading at $1.08, marking an 8.18% increase in the last 24 hours. The digital asset rebounded strongly after briefly touching a low of $0.9974, showing signs of increasing bullish momentum throughout the trading day. With price action nearing the short-term resistance of $1.09, the current trend suggests active accumulation by traders and possible breakout scenarios ahead. Market data shows WLD recovered steadily, forming a clear uptrend after testing the **\$1.00** level. Despite no significant news from the Worldcoin Foundation, sentiment remains positive, with analysts watching its performance against other altcoins. Activity is tracked on Ethereum and Optimism, excluding World Chain data. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD strong bullish structure developing Worldcoin’s daily chart shows a strong recovery after testing support at $0.9974.

Worldcoin is trading at $1.08, up 8.18%, and is nearing key resistance at $1.09. If bullish momentum continues, a breakout could push the price toward $1.12. Strong support at $1.00 and consistently higher lows on both daily and 4H charts confirm an uptrend. If $1.09 is rejected, minor pullbacks to $1.06 or $1.03 are likely before another move higher. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin (WLD) is showing strong short-term bullish momentum, gaining 8.18% on July 16, 2025, and forming higher lows across multiple timeframes. The price is holding above the psychological $1.00 support and is approaching a key resistance at $1.09—a breakout here could extend the rally toward $1.12. From a technical perspective, the trend is positive. However, no major fundamental updates have been released from the Worldcoin Foundation, and long-term investment decisions should consider project fundamentals, regulatory factors, and market conditions beyond price action alone. Traders may find short-term opportunities, but investors should evaluate the broader risk-reward profile. Why is WLD Price up today Worldcoin (WLD) is up 8.18% on July 16, 2025, trading at $1.08 after rebounding from a low of $0.9974. The price surge is primarily driven by technical buying momentum, as the token held firm above the key $1.00 support and formed a strong uptrend across daily and 4-hour charts. There have been no significant news announcements from the Worldcoin Foundation, but market sentiment remains positive. The current move is fueled by short-term accumulation, dip buying, and bullish technical structure, with traders targeting a breakout above the $1.09 resistance. Increased trading activity on the Ethereum and Optimism networks is also contributing to the upward move. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, requiring substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. What will be the value of Worldcoin in 2025? Based on current trends and market conditions, Worldcoin’s average value is predicted to be $1.86, with the potential to reach a high of $1.92 by 2025. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

One victim, a Taiwan-born Georgia woman who said she lost nearly $250,000 to a wrong-number pig butchering scam — with a portion of the proceeds laundered through Tornado Cash — said her request for help went unanswered. Another witness, a lawyer for crypto exchange BitMart, which was hacked for nearly $200 million in 2021, said that Storm told his team that there was nothing he or his fellow developers could do to retrieve the funds given the decentralized nature of the protocol. A third witness, Andy Ho — CTO and co-founder at Sky Mavis, the blockchain gaming company behind Axie Infinity and the Ronin Network — detailed how hackers stole over $625 million in an exploit of Ronin Bridge in 2022, in effect fully looting the protocol’s coffers. Though Ho himself didn’t mention it during his testimony, the group behind the exploit was later revealed to be the Lazarus Group , North Korea’s state-sponsored hacking organization, which used Tornado Cash to launder a portion of the stolen funds. During their examination of the three witnesses, prosecutors attempted to paint a portrait of Storm as someone who refused to lift a finger to help hack victims, or to make changes to the Tornado Cash protocol to dissuade future use of the protocol by criminals. Storm’s lawyers, when they had the chance to cross-examine the ""victim"" witnesses, cast their client’s lack of action in another light: he was, they insinuated, unable to help retrieve funds, because Tornado Cash was decentralized. Storm told BitMart’s lawyer — New York-based Joseph Evans, a partner at law firm McDermott, Will and Emery — so himself in an email on Dec. 15, 2021, according to an exhibit introduced by the government. Evans also admitted on cross-examination that Tornado Cash wasn’t the only place BitMart’s hacked funds went after the exploit: his firm also reached out to 1inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator, which told them to come back with a warrant, as well as Cloudflare — a major website infrastructure provider — and Binance. Evans said he received no response from the latter two companies. Brian Klein, a partner at Waymaker LLP and a lawyer for Roman Storm, asked Evans if it was true that the only person who had ever directly responded to Evans’ inquiries in the wake of BitMart’s hack was Roman Storm. “That’s correct,” Evans said. Storm’s lawyers asked Ho, the CTO of Sky Mavis, a similar line of questions when he was on the stand, though Ho — who said he had been subpoenaed by the government and asked to travel to New York from his hometown of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to testify — was less forthcoming. Keri Axel, another Waymaker partner and member of Storm’s defense team, asked Ho if he remembered the findings presented to Sky Mavis by Crowdstrike after the exploit, including that the stolen funds had filtered through a number of protocols and exchanges besides Tornado Cash, including FTX, Huobi, and Crypto.com . “I don’t recall,” Ho said to each. Axel asked how much, if any, of the stolen money was able to ultimately be recovered. Ho said that $6 million was returned by Norwegian police. “Did you understand that that $6 million had gone through Tornado Cash?” Axel asked Ho. “I don’t have that knowledge,"" Ho said.

Major appointments can signal a pivotal shift, propelling organizations toward new heights of adoption and innovation. That’s precisely the sentiment surrounding the recent announcements from the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth and development of the Stellar network. The foundation has just made two groundbreaking hires that are set to redefine its strategic direction and accelerate its mission. A New Era for the Stellar Development Foundation : What These Hires Mean The Stellar Development Foundation stands at a critical juncture in its journey. As a network designed to connect the world’s financial systems, Stellar has always prioritized accessibility, low-cost transactions, and utility for real-world applications. To achieve its ambitious goals of fostering financial inclusion and enabling efficient cross-border payments, the SDF requires visionary leadership with a deep understanding of both traditional finance and the nascent blockchain space. The foundation recently announced the appointment of José Fernández da Ponte, formerly a key figure at PayPal, as its new President and Chief Growth Officer (CGO). This move is significant. PayPal, a titan in digital payments, has been cautiously exploring blockchain and cryptocurrencies for years. Da Ponte’s experience at the forefront of these initiatives brings invaluable insights and a proven track record of navigating complex financial landscapes. Joining him is Jason Karsh, an executive with impressive stints at Block (formerly Square) and Blockchain.com, who steps in as the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Together, these appointments signal a clear intent: the Stellar Development Foundation is gearing up for a substantial push towards mainstream adoption and ecosystem expansion. They represent not just new personnel, but a renewed strategic focus on scaling operations, enhancing partnerships, and communicating Stellar’s value proposition more effectively to a global audience. José Fernández da Ponte : A Proven Blockchain Leadership Track Record When an organization like the Stellar Development Foundation brings in talent from a global payments giant like PayPal, it sends a powerful message. José Fernández da Ponte is not just any executive; he was the head of PayPal’s blockchain and crypto efforts. His tenure there involved steering the company’s foray into offering cryptocurrency services, a move that significantly validated the digital asset space for millions of users worldwide. As President and CGO, da Ponte’s responsibilities at SDF will be extensive. His role is fundamentally about driving growth – identifying new opportunities, forging strategic partnerships, and expanding the Stellar network’s utility. This includes working closely with existing partners, attracting new developers and businesses to build on Stellar, and exploring innovative use cases that leverage Stellar’s unique capabilities, such as its speed, low transaction costs, and built-in compliance features. What does his background bring to the table? Consider these points: Scalability Expertise: PayPal operates at an immense scale. Da Ponte’s experience in managing and growing large-scale financial products will be crucial as Stellar aims for broader adoption. Regulatory Acumen: Navigating the complex regulatory environment of digital assets is one of the biggest challenges in the crypto space. His experience at a regulated entity like PayPal provides a deep understanding of compliance and risk management. Strategic Vision: Leading PayPal’s blockchain initiatives required foresight and the ability to identify emerging trends. This strategic vision will be vital for Stellar’s long-term development and market positioning. Traditional Finance Bridge: His background bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technologies, making him an ideal leader to onboard financial institutions and enterprises onto the Stellar network. The appointment of José Fernández da Ponte underscores SDF’s commitment to pragmatic growth and leveraging seasoned expertise to achieve its ambitious goals. Strengthening the Ranks: The Impact of Key Crypto Executive Appointments While José Fernández da Ponte ‘s appointment captures headlines, the simultaneous arrival of Jason Karsh as Chief Marketing Officer is equally strategic for the Stellar Development Foundation . Karsh’s background includes significant roles at Block (formerly Square), a company known for its innovative payment solutions, and Blockchain.com, a leading crypto platform. His expertise in marketing and brand building within the fintech and crypto sectors is precisely what Stellar needs to elevate its presence. Think about it: even the most robust technology needs effective communication to achieve mass adoption. Karsh’s role will involve: Brand Storytelling: Articulating Stellar’s unique value proposition and mission to diverse audiences, from developers to financial institutions and end-users. Community Engagement: Fostering a vibrant and informed community around the Stellar ecosystem. Market Penetration: Developing and executing marketing strategies to expand Stellar’s reach into new markets and demographics. Partnership Amplification: Working with existing and new partners to highlight successful implementations and use cases of the Stellar network. The combined force of a President and CGO focused on growth strategy and a CMO dedicated to market penetration creates a powerful synergy. These are not just any crypto executive hires; they are highly experienced professionals brought in to tackle specific, critical challenges for Stellar’s next phase of expansion. Their appointments reflect a growing maturity in the blockchain space, where foundational technology is now complemented by sophisticated business development and marketing efforts. Navigating the Future: The Importance of Experienced Blockchain Leadership The cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is notoriously volatile and complex. It’s a landscape constantly shifting due to technological advancements, evolving regulations, and fluctuating market sentiments. In such an environment, experienced blockchain leadership is not just beneficial; it’s essential for survival and success. Why does seasoned leadership matter so much in this space? Consider these factors: Strategic Direction: Leaders with a proven track record can set clear, achievable goals amidst uncertainty, guiding the organization through turbulent times. Risk Management: They bring an understanding of potential pitfalls, from regulatory crackdowns to market downturns, and can implement strategies to mitigate these risks. Ecosystem Development: Experienced leaders know how to foster strong relationships with developers, businesses, and regulatory bodies, which are crucial for building a robust ecosystem. Talent Attraction: Top-tier leadership attracts other top talent, creating a virtuous cycle of expertise within the organization. The appointments at the Stellar Development Foundation exemplify this principle. By bringing in leaders from established financial and tech giants, SDF is not just acquiring individual skills; it’s importing a wealth of institutional knowledge, strategic foresight, and operational excellence that is critical for navigating the complexities of the global financial landscape and the burgeoning digital economy. This move positions Stellar to not only react to market changes but to proactively shape its future. Accelerating Web3 Innovation : Stellar’s Path Forward The Stellar network has always been a quiet powerhouse in the blockchain space, focusing on real-world utility and interoperability. With these strategic hires, the Stellar Development Foundation is poised to significantly accelerate its contributions to Web3 innovation . Web3, the next iteration of the internet, envisions a decentralized, user-owned future. Stellar, with its focus on payments, tokenization, and cross-border transactions, is a vital piece of this puzzle. The network’s ability to handle high transaction volumes at low costs makes it an ideal infrastructure for various Web3 applications, from stablecoins and CBDCs to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that require efficient value transfer. With José Fernández da Ponte leading growth and Jason Karsh spearheading marketing, we can expect a renewed focus on: Enterprise Adoption: Attracting more large-scale businesses and financial institutions to leverage Stellar for their operations. Developer Tools & Support: Enhancing resources for developers to build innovative Web3 applications on Stellar. Global Outreach: Expanding Stellar’s footprint in emerging markets, where its low-cost, high-speed transactions can have the most profound impact on financial inclusion. Partnership Ecosystem: Cultivating a robust network of collaborations that drive new use cases and expand the utility of the XLM token. The future for Stellar looks bright. These strategic appointments are not merely personnel changes; they are a clear indication of the Stellar Development Foundation ‘s ambition to solidify its position as a foundational layer for global payments and a key enabler of mainstream Web3 innovation . It’s an exciting time to watch how these experienced leaders will steer Stellar into its next chapter of growth and impact. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Mainstream Adoption The recent executive appointments at the Stellar Development Foundation mark a significant turning point for the organization and the Stellar network. By bringing in heavyweights like José Fernández da Ponte from PayPal and Jason Karsh from Block and Blockchain.com, SDF is signaling a robust commitment to strategic growth, market expansion, and enhanced visibility. These leaders possess the unique blend of traditional finance acumen and cutting-edge blockchain expertise required to navigate the complexities of the digital asset landscape and drive real-world utility. Their collective experience will be instrumental in scaling Stellar’s operations, forging critical partnerships, and effectively communicating the network’s immense potential to a global audience. As the blockchain industry matures and moves towards mainstream adoption, organizations like the Stellar Development Foundation, backed by such formidable leadership, are perfectly positioned to lead the charge. Keep an eye on Stellar; its journey to connect the world’s financial systems just got a powerful boost.

With Early Entry Bonuses, Experts Favor Ruvi AI's (RUVI) Audited Token For 104x Returns",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/will-cardano-ada-rally-again-with-early-entry-bonuses-experts-favor-ruvi-ais-ruvi-audited-token-for-104x-returns,"Cardano (ADA) has solidified its place as one of the most innovative blockchains in the crypto space, garnering attention for its scientific approach and strong development foundation. However, as Cardano continues its upward trajectory, experts are turning their gaze to Ruvi AI (RUVI), a new utility-driven token that has already demonstrated massive growth potential. Comparisons between the established Cardano and early-stage Ruvi AI reveal that Ruvi AI’s structured presale, transparency, and utility could position it as a game-changer for investors seeking exponential returns. Transparency and Security Lay the Foundation One of Ruvi AI's biggest strengths is its unwavering commitment to investor security and transparency. The project has passed a third-party audit by CyberScope, a trusted blockchain security firm. This audit validates Ruvi AI's smart contracts, ensuring they are secure and scalable, mitigating concerns common in early-stage crypto projects. Ruvi AI has also partnered with WEEX Exchange, a globally recognized trading platform. This guarantees post-presale liquidity, providing investors with seamless trading opportunities as soon as the token lists publicly. These measures demonstrate Ruvi AI’s dedication to building trust and reducing risk, setting it apart from the speculative projects flooding the market. Ruvi AI’s Presale Breaks Records Cardano’s earlier success garnered significant attention during its development phases, but Ruvi AI’s ongoing presale is shaping up to be equally impressive. The project has already achieved the following milestones: $2.3 million raised, convincing investors of its potential. Over 190 million tokens sold, proving strong demand. A rapidly growing community of 2,300 holders, reflecting rising market confidence. At its Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI remains an affordable entry point. By the end of the presale, the price will increase to $0.07, translating to an almost 5x ROI even before public trading begins.

For businesses, it opens up new avenues for innovation, reducing reliance on centralized AI providers and fostering a more competitive market. Boosting Crypto Liquidity for AI Applications One of the most critical aspects of this partnership is the commitment to increase crypto liquidity for Infinity Ground’s ecosystem. Liquidity, in the context of cryptocurrencies, refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. It is the lifeblood of any thriving tokenized economy. Why is liquidity so vital for AI applications, especially in a decentralized context? Stable Token Price: Good liquidity helps maintain a stable price for Infinity Ground’s native token, reducing volatility and making it more attractive for long-term holders, developers, and users. Efficient Trading: It ensures that participants can easily buy or sell tokens without significant slippage, which is crucial for smooth operations within the ecosystem, such as paying for AI services or rewarding AI agent performance.

In a new analysis posted to the social media platform X, Swissblock says that the BTC Fundamental Index can answer that question. “If you’re questioning whether Bitcoin still has upside — this is the only chart you need to see: On-chain fundamentals have flipped back to strength. This move isn’t just speculation. Sustained upside is now structurally supported. Higher.” Source: Swissblock/X BTC is worth $119,154 at time of writing, up nearly 10% in the last week. Moving on to altcoins, Swissblock dares to answer another question on traders’ minds — how close is altseason? “Altseason in Sight: Wave 5 Has Begun? The altcoin market just broke out of a multi-month consolidation. Structure suggests a classic 5-wave move — and Wave 5 may be underway. Historically, Wave 5s in crypto unfold fast and vertical — this could mirror 2017 or 2021. Target: $1.79 trillion – $3.37 trillion Altseason may be here — but it could also be the last leg before the cycle peaks.” Source: Swissblock/X Swissblock’s “waves” refer to the Elliot Wave Theory, a financial analysis framework that views markets as moving in repeating wave patterns driven by investor psychology.

Well over $12.4 million has been raised and more than 13,400 early-stage investors. The token will be listed in presale Phase 6 at $0.035, and that is 16.67% return on investments done in Phase 5. As Bitcoin dominates headlines, Mutuum Finance remains the storyline worth watching. Solana Outlook as Bitcoin Eyes $130K With Bitcoin eyeing the $130,000 milestone, Solana (SOL) has recently traded around $159, down slightly from its mid‑$160s range but still buoyed by strong on‑chain activity and sector-wide momentum. Its price has rallied roughly 6% over the past week, following an 11 % surge that coincided with Bitcoin breaking the $120K barrier. Market structure shows SOL consolidating between $150–$160, sitting above key support levels around $145 while testing resistance near $160–$165. As BTC’s ascent draws capital into the broader crypto ecosystem, Solana’s technical setup suggests it could remain range-bound near current levels until a decisive breakout or breakdown. Mutuum Finance continues its progression in parallel, quietly attracting interest as BTC’s rally influences overall DeFi sentiment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Reaches $12.4M Presale Milestone Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13400 investors and is more than $12.4 million in funds. Investors have put over 70% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence by the investors in the project’s near-term success as well as its better future. Mutuum Finance Announces Huge Token Giveaway Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , distributed among 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Otherwise, the first 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded based on its new leaderboard system. The bonus tokens will be given to the users when they level up. The Mutuum Finance Model: Revolutionizing DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is innovating the DeFi lending with the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole proprietor of their own assets. It is a functional double-lending multifunctional platform, combining the synergy of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, smart contracts are used to access lending pools. The platform responds to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes lenders’ returns less volatile and the borrower financially stable. With the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is very convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surpassed $12.4 million raised with over 13,400 participants, as Phase 5 of the presale nears full sellout. Current pricing at $0.03 offers investors a guaranteed 100% return at the confirmed listing price of $0.06, with an additional 16.67% gain already locked in for Phase 6. As Bitcoin surges above $123,000 and Solana holds steady, attention is rapidly turning toward high-potential DeFi plays like MUTM. Its dual lending model, real-time market responsiveness, and active community incentives, including a $100,000 token giveaway, position it as a breakout contender in the current bull cycle. Explore the presale today and be part of the next wave of decentralized finance innovation.

Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, says on the social media platform X that BTC is now up 30% year-to-date, outpacing gold (+27%), the MSCI ACWI (+11%) and the S&P 500 (+7%). “This rally reflects deepening institutional engagement, favorable macro conditions, and emerging policy clarity.” Sigel notes that corporate treasuries are driving net demand, having bought more than 300,000 BTC this year, more than double the amount absorbed by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “MicroStrategy and MetaPlanet remain the largest accumulators, but a surge in shells, reverse mergers, and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), often backed by global investment banks, has fueled fresh capital formation in the sector. This dynamic marks a shift. Bitcoin is moving from speculative trading desks to strategic balance sheets.” The digital assets researcher also notes that Bitcoin volatility dropped to around 23% in early July, one of the lowest levels in a decade. “Lower volatility is making Bitcoin easier to size within institutional portfolios, particularly for allocators focused on Sharpe ratios and downside risk.” Sigel says spot Bitcoin ETFs have picked up and brought in $3.7 billion in net inflows so far this month, with year-to-date inflows hovering around $16 billion. “Participation is growing across retail, RIAs (registered investment advisors) and wirehouse platforms such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, reflecting broader institutional acceptance.” The researcher also points to “policy tailwinds” in Washington, DC. “Crypto Week began July 15th, with three key bills under review: the GENIUS Act (stablecoins), the CLARITY Act (market structure), and the Anti-CBDC Act. Polymarket odds place an 89% probability on passage of the GENIUS Act this year, signaling bipartisan appetite to legitimize fiat-backed stablecoins and potentially unlock a wave of new issuance and payment infrastructure.” Sigel says the potential for two interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve later this year could support flows into Bitcoin and gold. He also notes miners continue to remain net holders following the April 2024 BTC halving, with their balances recently reaching a 12-month high. “Only approximately 5.2% of Bitcoin supply has moved in the last 30 days, according to IntoTheBlock, indicating strong holder conviction and reduced available float.” BTC is trading at $116,524 at time of writing and is down more than 3% in the past 24 hours.

The move up to $123,000 shows real buying power. According to EliteOptionsTrader, a crypto expert, many investors see this as the start of something bigger. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions—Is Real-World Use Finally Here? Key Catalysts Driving The Surge Based on examination by EliteOptionsTrader, one of the biggest factors is the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Bitcoin’s own ETFs have pulled in billions from major institutions, and a greenlight for Ethereum could send more money into crypto overall, lifting Bitcoin further. The US election is now behind us, and talk of Federal Reserve rate cuts in late 2025 is fueling bets on a weaker dollar. Many traders view Bitcoin as a shield against political or economic swings. At the same time, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and pension plans hold only small slices of Bitcoin so far. If they decide to jump in, that could push prices even higher.

One thing to note, after something bases for such… pic.twitter.com/GGUrcUcp0D — EliteOptionsTrader (@EliteOptions2) July 15, 2025 Long Base Could Support Further Gains Bitcoin’s lengthy base under $110K sets a solid foundation. Breakouts after long periods of sideways action often lead to steep rallies. Still, it’s normal for prices to dip back toward the breakout zone. A pullback to around $115K–$118K could happen before any major surge. Traders will be watching support at $118K and resistance near $125K. Brewing Institutional FOMO Even after the rally, big players have only dipped their toes in. EliteOptionsTrader notes that a major allocation wave—from a large pension fund or insurance giant—could trigger fresh price discovery. And let’s not forget the April 2024 halving, which cut Bitcoin’s daily issuance by half. That supply shock often takes several months to show its full effect, but we’re seeing demand tick up already. Even with a strong start, the path up isn’t without hazards. Sharp corrections of 10%–20% are part of crypto’s genes. Any surprise rules from major markets could stall this run.

That said, aiming for $250K by year end will require all these factors to line up without a single major setback.

Tesla Inc. is introducing a longer, six-seat version of its popular Model Y SUV in China. This move is widely seen as the company’s attempt to regain market share in the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market. The new variant, called the Model Y L, will be about 150 centimeters (5.9 inches) longer than the standard version, according to details published Wednesday by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). While the company has not disclosed the price or release date, Tesla confirmed the vehicle’s launch on its official Weibo account. “Model Y L, see you in the autumn!” The post read. It also included two teaser images. The company also confirmed that LG New Energy will be supplying the batteries for the vehicle. Tesla is expanding its Model Y in China The Model Y is Tesla’s top-selling car globally, and its performance in China is critical to Tesla’s overall success. The company’s Shanghai gigafactory is a major export hub and production center. In recent months, Tesla has faced mounting pressure in China from increasingly competitive local brands that offer a wider variety of EVs with more features and lower price points. Chinese consumers have shown growing interest in multi-seat electric SUVs, especially those with tech-enhanced driving experiences, entertainment systems, and autonomous driving support. Tesla’s new design may aim to close that gap. The competition in China’s EV market Tesla’s decision to update the Model Y is due to the recent downturn in its sales in China. The EV maker recently broke an eight-month streak of declining shipments from its Shanghai factory, but it is still lagging in the EV industry in terms of wholesale growth. Xiaomi, best known as a smartphone manufacturer, recently entered the EV space with models targeting Tesla’s market share, emphasizing smart connectivity, competitive pricing, and stylish designs. BYD, in particular, has dominated the local EV scene, offering a broader portfolio of options ranging from compact electric sedans to high-end SUVs. Tesla has not confirmed whether the bigger SUV will include localized features or software upgrades to match competitors’ smart cabin functions. The company is also yet to clarify if the longer model will retain the same driving range, performance, or price efficiency as the base SUV, which starts at 263,500 yuan, about $36,700. Industry watchers have also noted that Tesla has recently been relying on price cuts and discounts to maintain demand in China, which could affect the Model Y L’s pricing strategy.

Here’s What Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-has-completely-cleared-liquidation-clusters-heres-what-is-next/,"XRP has reached a pivotal moment in its price journey. In a bold update shared by crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, XRP has “completely cleared liquidation clusters,” signaling the removal of a major barrier that has long hindered upward momentum. With those resistance levels now behind, analysts believe the stage is set for an aggressive rally, and the sky may truly be the limit. What Clearing Liquidation Clusters Mean for XRP Liquidation clusters are zones where large numbers of leveraged positions, especially short positions, are forced to close. These areas typically act as resistance zones, where price surges trigger a wave of liquidations that momentarily cap momentum. XRP clearing these clusters means that sell pressure from these forced closures has been absorbed, leaving little resistance ahead. According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, this development opens the door for XRP to push past $3 with conviction. Market analysts agree: now that these clusters are behind, XRP is primed to move freely and possibly accelerate toward new highs. BREAKING: #XRP HAS COMPLETELY CLEARED LIQUIDATION CLUSTERS. THE SKY IS THE LIMIT NOW. pic.twitter.com/2r4RvSPz27 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 16, 2025 XRP Price Update: Poised Near Breakout As of report time, XRP is trading around $2.98, with intraday highs touching the $3.00 mark. This comes after weeks of building bullish momentum and increasing trade volume, suggesting growing institutional interest. Analysts are closely watching the $3.04 to $3.14 zone. A strong break and hold above this range could ignite a short squeeze, where short sellers rapidly buy back positions, fueling a fast climb to $3.40 and potentially higher. Technical forecasters like Peter Brandt have already predicted a 60% surge for XRP, placing a mid-term target in the $4–$5 range, provided momentum continues and macro conditions remain favorable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Catalysts Behind XRP’s Strength Several factors beyond price charts are reinforcing XRP’s bullish setup. Anticipation for a U.S.-based XRP futures ETF is driving fresh interest, as such a product would open the asset to broader institutional flows. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to expand globally, securing licensing wins and forming strategic partnerships in Europe and the Middle East. Additionally, the recent resolution of key legal matters with the SEC, while still open to final appeals, has significantly reduced regulatory uncertainty. Ripple’s push for a U.S. banking charter is also seen as a move to cement its legitimacy in traditional finance, potentially boosting XRP adoption across compliant platforms. What’s Next for XRP? Now that liquidation clusters are cleared, all eyes are on XRP’s ability to break and sustain above $3. If successful, momentum could push the price toward $3.40, $3.75, and even challenge its all-time high in the weeks ahead. However, if bulls fail to hold above $2.95, a short-term correction to $2.80 or even $2.60 remains possible. In the bigger picture, XRP appears to be entering a new phase. With major resistance levels behind it, institutional interest rising, and market sentiment improving, the digital asset may be on the verge of its most significant rally in years. For now, XRP holders have reason to be optimistic. As STEPH IS CRYPTO put it: “The sky is the limit now.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This significant event is more than just a number; it carries profound implications for the broader crypto market , liquidity, and the evolving landscape of digital finance. For anyone tracking the pulse of digital assets, understanding the ripple effects of such a large-scale minting operation is crucial. Let us delve into what this means for investors, traders, and the future of decentralized finance. What Does a 250 Million USDC Mint Truly Mean? When 250 million USDC is minted, it signifies a substantial injection of new stablecoin supply into the ecosystem. USDC, or USD Coin, is a digital stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis, meaning one USDC is always intended to be worth one U.S. dollar. It is issued by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. The minting process involves Circle receiving fiat currency (U.S. dollars) from institutional clients or large entities, and in return, issuing an equivalent amount of USDC tokens. This process increases the total supply of USDC in circulation. But why is this important? The minting of a large sum of USDC typically indicates a significant demand for stablecoin liquidity within the crypto space. This demand can stem from various sources: Institutional Inflow: Large institutions or high-net-worth individuals might be looking to enter the crypto market, using USDC as their preferred on-ramp. They convert fiat into USDC to facilitate large trades without dealing with the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. DeFi Activity: Increased activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols often drives demand for stablecoins. USDC is a cornerstone of many DeFi applications, including lending, borrowing, and yield farming. More USDC means more capital available for these activities. Exchange Demand: Centralized exchanges might request more USDC to meet user demand for trading pairs or to facilitate withdrawals. Market Stability: In times of market uncertainty, traders often convert volatile assets into stablecoins like USDC to preserve capital, increasing demand for its supply. Conversely, large mints can precede bullish moves if new capital is flowing in to buy other cryptocurrencies. This particular mint suggests that significant capital is either entering the crypto space or repositioning within it, seeking the stability that USDC offers while preparing for potential future moves. It reflects confidence in the underlying digital asset infrastructure. Why Are Stablecoins Like USDC Essential for the Crypto Market? Stablecoins are the backbone of the modern crypto economy, acting as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. They address the primary challenge of price instability that often plagues cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Without stablecoins, conducting everyday transactions or even complex financial operations within the crypto space would be incredibly difficult due to constant price fluctuations. Here are several reasons why stablecoins are indispensable: Volatility Hedge: Traders use stablecoins to ‘park’ their funds during periods of high market volatility, protecting their capital from sudden price drops. It is the digital equivalent of moving money into a savings account during a stock market downturn. Trading Pairs: Most cryptocurrency exchanges offer trading pairs against stablecoins (e.g., BTC/USDC, ETH/USDC). This provides a stable reference point for valuing other digital assets and facilitates easier entry and exit from positions. Global Remittances and Payments: Stablecoins enable fast, low-cost cross-border transactions, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries and their associated fees and delays. This makes them a powerful tool for global commerce and remittances. DeFi Foundation: The decentralized finance ecosystem heavily relies on stablecoins. They are used as collateral for loans, as liquidity in automated market makers (AMMs), and as a basis for yield-generating strategies. Without stablecoins, the functionality and stability of DeFi would be severely limited. Accessibility: Stablecoins make it easier for individuals and businesses, especially in regions with unstable local currencies or limited access to traditional banking services, to access a stable digital asset pegged to a major fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. The consistent demand for stablecoins , evidenced by large mints like the recent 250 million USDC, underscores their fundamental role in providing liquidity, stability, and utility across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. They are not just a temporary phenomenon but a critical component of a maturing financial landscape. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market ? The minting of 250 million USDC can have several direct and indirect impacts on the broader crypto market . Understanding these potential effects helps in gauging market sentiment and predicting future trends. Increased Liquidity The most immediate effect is an increase in liquidity. More USDC means more capital available to trade into other cryptocurrencies. This can: Boost Trading Volume: With more stablecoin available, exchanges can facilitate higher trading volumes for various crypto assets. Support Price Action: If the newly minted USDC is used to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins, it can contribute to upward price pressure. This is often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating new capital inflow. Facilitate Large Trades: Whales and institutional players can execute larger trades without causing significant slippage, thanks to deeper liquidity pools. Investor Sentiment Large stablecoin mints are often seen as a precursor to positive market movements. The rationale is that new money is entering the system, poised to be deployed into riskier assets. This can: Fuel Optimism: News of significant mints can instill confidence among investors, suggesting that smart money is accumulating stablecoins to buy dips or participate in an anticipated rally. Reduce Volatility (in some cases): Paradoxically, while new capital can fuel price swings, the availability of stablecoins also provides a safer haven during downturns, potentially reducing panic selling if traders can quickly convert to USDC. DeFi Ecosystem Growth As mentioned, DeFi relies heavily on stablecoins. A surge in USDC supply can: Lower Lending Rates: More available capital in lending protocols can lead to lower interest rates for borrowers, making DeFi more attractive. Increase Yield Opportunities: While lower lending rates might seem counterintuitive for yield farmers, increased liquidity can also lead to new and innovative yield strategies emerging, absorbing the excess capital. Support New Projects: New DeFi projects and protocols can launch with greater confidence, knowing there is ample stablecoin liquidity to support their ecosystems. While a single mint does not guarantee a bull run, a consistent pattern of large stablecoin mints often precedes or accompanies periods of growth in the crypto market . It is a key indicator that sophisticated investors are positioning themselves for action. The Growing Dominance of Digital Currency and USDC’s Role The minting of 250 million USDC is not just an isolated event within the crypto sphere; it is a testament to the accelerating shift towards a world dominated by digital currency . As technology advances and global economies become increasingly interconnected, the demand for efficient, borderless, and programmable money grows. USDC stands at the forefront of this evolution, serving as a pivotal example of how a private sector-led digital asset can achieve widespread adoption and utility. The concept of digital currency extends beyond cryptocurrencies to include central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and tokenized traditional assets. However, stablecoins like USDC are currently leading the charge in practical, real-world applications. Their ability to combine the stability of fiat money with the efficiency of blockchain technology makes them ideal for: E-commerce and Online Payments: Facilitating instant settlements and reducing transaction fees for online businesses and consumers. Cross-Border Trade and Finance: Streamlining international payments, making them faster and cheaper for businesses and individuals alike, particularly important in emerging markets. Financial Inclusion: Providing access to financial services for the unbanked or underbanked populations globally, requiring only a smartphone and internet access. Programmable Money: Enabling smart contracts and automated financial operations, paving the way for innovative business models and financial products. USDC’s transparent reserve backing and regulatory compliance efforts have positioned it as a trusted player in the nascent digital currency landscape. As governments and central banks explore their own CBDCs, stablecoins like USDC are demonstrating the immense potential and practical benefits of digital money today. This large minting event simply reinforces the growing trust and utility of USDC as a preferred medium for value transfer in the digital age. Circle ‘s Strategic Move: Powering the Future of Finance At the heart of the USDC ecosystem is Circle , a global financial technology firm and one of the co-founders of Centre. The recent 250 million USDC mint is a direct action taken by Circle to meet market demand, highlighting their strategic position in the evolving financial landscape. Circle ‘s vision extends beyond simply issuing a stablecoin; they aim to build an internet of value where money can flow as freely and instantly as information. Circle ‘s strategy revolves around several key pillars: Transparency and Trust: Circle regularly publishes audited attestations of USDC reserves, ensuring that every USDC token in circulation is backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds. This commitment to transparency is crucial for building user confidence and attracting institutional adoption. Regulatory Compliance: As a regulated entity, Circle adheres to strict financial regulations, which differentiates USDC from some other stablecoins. This approach makes USDC more palatable for traditional financial institutions and corporations looking to engage with digital assets. Global Expansion: Circle is actively expanding its global reach, forging partnerships with banks, payment providers, and businesses worldwide to facilitate the broader adoption of USDC for payments, remittances, and treasury management. Innovation in Web3: Beyond being a stablecoin issuer, Circle is investing in and supporting the broader Web3 ecosystem, providing developer tools and infrastructure to build new applications and services leveraging USDC. The minting of such a large sum of USDC reflects Circle ‘s responsiveness to market needs and their ongoing commitment to providing robust financial infrastructure for the digital economy. It underscores their role as a key player in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future, actively shaping how value is transferred and managed globally. Their strategic moves are not just about stablecoins; they are about laying the groundwork for a new era of financial services. Challenges and Considerations for Stablecoins While the benefits of stablecoins like USDC are clear, it is important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are increasing their scrutiny of stablecoins, with discussions around requiring them to be issued by regulated banks or adhere to stricter capital requirements. This evolving regulatory landscape could impact their operations. Centralization Concerns: Fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC rely on centralized entities (like Circle) to hold reserves and issue tokens. This introduces a point of centralization, which some in the decentralized community view with caution. Auditing and Transparency: While Circle provides attestations, the depth and frequency of audits are continuously debated within the community, with calls for real-time, comprehensive audits to ensure full backing. Systemic Risk: As stablecoins grow in size and importance, their potential impact on the broader financial system becomes a concern for regulators, particularly regarding potential runs or liquidity crises. These challenges highlight the need for continued vigilance, robust risk management, and ongoing dialogue between innovators and policymakers to ensure stablecoins can continue to grow responsibly. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast For individuals and institutions navigating the crypto space, the recent 250 million USDC mint offers several actionable insights: Monitor Stablecoin Activity: Keep an eye on large stablecoin mints and burns. They often provide leading indicators for market sentiment and potential capital flows. Understand Liquidity: Recognize that increased stablecoin supply contributes to overall market liquidity, which can facilitate smoother trading and potentially larger price movements. Diversify Your Holdings: While stablecoins offer stability, remember they are still digital assets. Consider a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stablecoins, major cryptocurrencies, and potentially other digital assets. Stay Informed on Regulations: The regulatory environment for stablecoins is dynamic. Staying updated on new laws and guidelines can help you understand potential impacts on your holdings and activities. Explore DeFi Opportunities: With ample USDC liquidity, the DeFi ecosystem often presents attractive opportunities for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Research protocols carefully and understand the associated risks. A Future Powered by Digital Value The minting of 250 million USDC is more than just a transaction; it is a powerful signal of the ongoing maturation and expansion of the digital asset economy. It underscores the critical role that stablecoins play in providing liquidity and stability, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. As demand for efficient, borderless, and transparent financial tools continues to surge, USDC, backed by the strategic vision of Circle, is poised to remain a cornerstone of the burgeoning digital currency landscape. This event is a clear indicator that capital is flowing into the ecosystem, positioning the market for continued growth and innovation.

That single comment kicked off chaos. The S&P 500 dropped hard at first, down 0.6%, before clawing its way back into the green once Trump denied the whole thing . By the Closing Bell, the S&P 500 scraped out a tiny 0.1% gain. Nasdaq also managed to add 0.1% after tanking nearly 0.8% during the day. The Dow Jones did slightly better, up 162 points, or 0.3%, but that’s only after it was down more than 260 points earlier. Traders were stuck in limbo. Nobody knew whether to trust the official denial or brace for another bombshell. “The markets would not like it if Powell was fired,” said Larry Tentarelli from Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. “It’s obviously a political hotbed… but overall, most of the big market participants that I know of think Powell has done a very good job.” Translation? If Trump pulls the trigger, stocks could get wrecked. Semiconductor names drag down tech sector Tech wasn’t safe either. Chip stocks started bleeding, and it wasn’t subtle. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF is now down 0.6% for the week and could snap a seven-week win streak. That would be its worst performance since its eight-week rally ended in March 2019. ASML took the biggest hit. Shares were down 9.5% by midday Wednesday, already sitting 7% lower on the week. That’s ASML’s worst day since October 15, 2024, and its worst week since April. And the kicker? This came after the company beat both top- and bottom-line expectations in its second-quarter results. But the problem is what they said next: They don’t know if they’ll grow in 2026. Uncertainty like that makes investors run for the hills. Other chip names got slammed too. Micron Technology, Marvell Technology, Monolithic Power Systems, Teradyne, and NXP Semiconductor all ended the day in the red. Nvidia, after printing an all-time high on Tuesday, cooled off a bit. Shares slipped slightly, but the company is still pacing for its eighth straight weekly gain, up 3.4% this week. AMD followed suit with a strong 5% gain for the week so far, looking good for a second solid green close. Meanwhile, bank earnings came in Tuesday , and they looked decent on paper. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America all beat expectations. But their stocks didn’t care. Every single one traded lower. The market clearly isn’t buying the narrative, or maybe it just didn’t matter with the Fed drama stealing the spotlight. Bitcoin recovers, Ether starts to break out While stocks whiplashed, crypto made a nasty dip before bouncing right back. Bitcoin crashed to $115,000 late Tuesday night after the House shot down a set of crypto bills. That vote was a slap to the face for anyone expecting clear rules in the near term. But by Wednesday, BTC was back at $122K. Traders didn’t wait around; they bought the dip instantly. Ether, on the other hand, actually looked stronger than Bitcoin. It’s now broken out of a long-standing inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which had been forming all year. Holding above the $2,870 breakout level gives it a target of $4,375. And it’s not just chart theory here. Momentum is blasting higher. ETH’s 14-day RSI jumped from the low 30s to the mid-70s in four weeks. In May, that number hit nearly 90 before things cooled down. So the move we’re seeing right now is sharp—and it’s real. If ether keeps pushing and hits that $4,375 target, it’ll blow past its December 2023 highs and start testing the top of the 2021 cycle. That would complete a multi-year bullish base that’s been building on the monthly log chart. Even more interesting? Ether’s been outperforming Bitcoin. Since the lows in April, BTC has climbed 60%. ETH? Up 130%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $304 billion, reached the highest level in 24 weeks, thus flipping Tether (USDT) as the third-largest crypto asset. As a result, XRP price has regained all the losses registered after President Donald Trump took office for the second term earlier this year. According to aggregate market data from Coingecko, XRP price gained over 26 percent in the past seven days, thus outshining the majority of large-cap altcoins. XRP Bulls Bolstered by Robust Fundamentals The ongoing XRP pump is largely backed by robust fundamentals both from Ripple and external factors. For instance, Ripple Labs is almost concluding the four-year lawsuit filed by the U.S. SEC, which will give XRP much-needed regulatory clarity. The crypto payment company announced earlier on Wednesday that it partnered with Ctrl Alt and the Dubai Land Department to tokenize the country’s title deeds on the XRPL network. The bullish sentiment for XRP has also been influenced by the procedural passage of the crypto bills on Wednesday including the GENIUS Act. What Next? The XRP bullish breakout above $3 in 2025 has coincided with the rising calls for an altseason. Furthermore, on-chain data analysis reveals that whale investors have been accumulating more altcoins compared to Bitcoin in the recent past. #XRP bull flags..

The stablecoin-focused legislation could reach President Trump’s desk later this week, representing the first major cryptocurrency legislation to clear both chambers of Congress. Trump’s late-evening meeting with 11 GOP holdouts Tuesday night proved decisive in securing the commitments needed to advance all three bills. The president announced on Truth Social that the Republicans “have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule” after their Oval Office discussion.

The revolt included prominent conservatives such as Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Chip Roy (Texas), and Andy Biggs (Ariz.). The Republican resistance occurred despite the House leadership’s strategy to advance the Senate version without amendments, seeking to expedite delivery to Trump’s desk. This approach was designed to avoid potential complications from extended congressional negotiations or bundling with more contentious crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act establishes federal licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers and mandates full backing with U.S. dollars or equivalent liquid assets. Consumer protections are included for bankruptcy scenarios, with stablecoin holders receiving priority payments over other creditors. The timing coincided with the final push for crypto legislation during the administration’s designated “Crypto Week.” The guidance removes “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision, creating major opportunities for traditional financial institutions to engage with digital assets. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act explicitly prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency, while the CLARITY Act establishes comprehensive market structure regulations for digital assets.

Recently, a notable event involving Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest captured headlines: a substantial sale of its Bitcoin ETF shares. This strategic move, valued at $8.7 million, marks ARK Invest’s largest sale since a pivotal stock split in mid-June, prompting many to ask: what does this mean for the future of Bitcoin ETF holdings and the broader crypto investment landscape? What’s Behind ARK Invest’s Latest Bitcoin ETF Sale? On July 16, Cathie Wood’s renowned investment management firm, ARK Invest, executed a significant transaction, selling 225,742 shares of its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This sale amounted to a remarkable $8.7 million, making it the largest divestment by the firm in this particular ETF since a 3-for-1 stock split occurred in mid-June. ARK Invest, known for its focus on disruptive innovation, has been a prominent player in the digital asset space, often making bold moves that reflect its long-term conviction in technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence. This recent sale naturally raises questions. Is it a strategic rebalancing of their portfolio? A move to lock in profits after a period of Bitcoin’s price appreciation? Or perhaps a reflection of a broader shift in their tactical allocation? Understanding the nuances of such institutional actions is crucial for anyone monitoring the market, as firms like ARK Invest often set precedents or signal trends. Understanding the Dynamics of Bitcoin ETF and ARKB For many investors, a Bitcoin ETF offers a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) is one such instrument, launched after years of anticipation for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. These ETFs aim to track the real-time price of Bitcoin, providing institutional and retail investors with a familiar investment vehicle. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was hailed as a landmark event, signifying growing mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption of digital assets. Funds like ARKB have seen considerable inflows, demonstrating a strong appetite for this new investment avenue. However, like any financial product, Bitcoin ETFs are subject to market dynamics, including inflows, outflows, and the strategic decisions of major holders like ARK Invest. Key characteristics of ARKB and similar Bitcoin ETFs: Accessibility: Traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easy to buy and sell through standard brokerage accounts. Regulation: Subject to regulatory oversight, offering a layer of investor protection not always present in direct crypto purchases. Price Tracking: Designed to closely track the price of Bitcoin, providing indirect exposure. Liquidity: Generally offer good liquidity, allowing for efficient entry and exit points. The Impact of a Stock Split: Why Did ARKB Adjust Its Shares? The ARK Invest sale followed a 3-for-1 stock split for ARKB in mid-June. A stock split is a corporate action where a company increases the number of its outstanding shares by dividing each existing share into multiple shares. In a 3-for-1 split, one share becomes three shares, and the price per share is proportionally reduced. For example, if a share was trading at $100 before the split, it would trade at approximately $33.33 after the split. Why do companies perform stock splits, especially for an ETF like ARKB? Increased Accessibility: A lower per-share price can make the ETF more appealing to a broader range of investors, particularly retail investors who might perceive a lower price as more affordable. Enhanced Liquidity: With more shares outstanding, the trading volume often increases, leading to greater liquidity in the market. Psychological Effect: A lower share price can create a perception of being ‘cheaper’ or more ‘affordable,’ even though the total value of an investor’s holding remains unchanged. It’s crucial to understand that a stock split does not change the fundamental value of the ETF or the total value of an investor’s holdings. If an investor owned 100 shares at $100 each (totaling $10,000) before a 3-for-1 split, they would own 300 shares at approximately $33.33 each (still totaling $10,000) after the split. The recent sale by ARK Invest, therefore, needs to be viewed in the context of these adjusted share prices, but the dollar value of the sale remains the key metric. Decoding Cathie Wood’s Investment Philosophy: A Strategic Shift or Portfolio Rebalancing? Cathie Wood , CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, is renowned for her high-conviction, long-term investment strategy focused on disruptive innovation. Her firm’s portfolios often include companies at the forefront of technologies like artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, and, notably, blockchain. ARK Invest’s consistent belief in Bitcoin as a transformative technology and a potential hedge against inflation has been a cornerstone of their digital asset strategy. Given this philosophy, a significant sale of ARKB shares by ARK Invest warrants closer examination. It could be interpreted in several ways: Profit-Taking: After a period of strong performance in the crypto market, it’s a common strategy for institutional investors to take some profits off the table to manage risk or reallocate capital. Portfolio Rebalancing: ARK Invest manages multiple funds, and this sale might be part of a broader rebalancing effort across their diverse portfolios to maintain desired asset allocations or to fund new investment opportunities in other high-conviction areas. Tactical Adjustment: While ARK is known for long-term views, they also make tactical adjustments based on market conditions, liquidity needs, or specific fund mandates. This could be a tactical move in response to current market sentiment or anticipated shifts. It is less likely to signal a fundamental change in ARK Invest’s long-term bullish stance on Bitcoin itself, given their consistent advocacy and continued involvement in the crypto ecosystem. However, it underscores the dynamic nature of institutional investment strategies, even among those with strong thematic convictions. Navigating the Broader Crypto Investment Landscape: What Does This Mean for Investors? The sale by ARK Invest, while significant, should be viewed within the broader crypto investment landscape. Institutional participation in Bitcoin and other digital assets has grown exponentially, bringing both stability and new dynamics to the market. While a large sale can sometimes trigger short-term market reactions, it’s essential for investors to look beyond immediate headlines and consider the larger trends. For individual investors, this event offers several actionable insights: Don’t Panic: A single institutional sale, even a large one, does not necessarily signal a collapse or a negative long-term outlook for Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs. Markets are complex, and institutional decisions are often multifaceted. Understand Institutional Strategy: Recognize that large firms like ARK Invest have complex portfolio management strategies, including risk management, rebalancing, and profit-taking. Their moves are not always direct indicators of their long-term conviction. Focus on Fundamentals: Continue to evaluate the underlying fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, such as adoption rates, technological developments, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic factors. Diversify: As always, diversification remains a key principle in investing. Do not put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s a single crypto asset or a single ETF. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news from reputable sources and analyze it critically. Understand the context behind major institutional moves. The ongoing evolution of the crypto investment space, with increasing institutional involvement, means that market participants need to be more sophisticated in their analysis. Events like ARK Invest’s ARKB sale serve as important reminders that even pioneers in the space actively manage their positions. Conclusion: Navigating Institutional Waves in the Crypto Market ARK Invest’s $8.7 million sale of its Bitcoin ETF shares, following a strategic stock split, is a significant event that highlights the dynamic nature of institutional crypto investment. While the immediate reaction might be to speculate on its implications, a deeper dive reveals it’s likely a combination of profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, and tactical adjustments within Cathie Wood’s overarching investment philosophy. This move underscores the growing maturity of the Bitcoin ETF market and the complex strategies employed by major players. For investors, the key takeaway is to remain informed, understand the multi-faceted reasons behind institutional actions, and focus on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term fluctuations caused by individual transactions. The journey of crypto into mainstream finance continues, marked by such strategic maneuvers that shape its path forward.

This move, approved today, will now allow the platform's tokens to be traded on exchanges, potentially significantly increasing the value of the Trump family's holdings. World Liberty, a “decentralized finance” (DeFi) initiative launched by the Trump family and their associates last fall, offered investors digital tokens called WLFI and a stablecoin. However, these tokens were initially non-tradable, with token holders only given the right to vote on changes such as the platform's underlying code structure. The biggest draw for investors was the direct connection to Trump's name. This connection had fueled expectations that the tokens would appreciate in value over time. Now, the tokens' ability to be traded on the open market could increase speculative interest and potentially earn trading fees for crypto exchanges where they are listed. Once the tokens become available for trading, the value of the Trump family's holdings could increase. While the exact amount of tokens held by the family has not been disclosed, Trump's company, DT Marks DEFI LLC, was scheduled to receive 22.5 billion of the 100 billion tokens, according to the project's launch documents. According to publicly released financial reports, President Trump held 15.75 billion WLFI tokens as of the end of 2024. Related News: BREAKING: FED's Highly Anticipated Beige Book Document Published - Here Are The Details The Trump family has earned approximately $500 million to date through the World Liberty platform. However, this development also raises ethical questions. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters wrote in a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the Trump family's financial interests in World Liberty pose an “unprecedented conflict of interest.” The letter stated that these interests could influence the Trump administration's regulatory stance toward the crypto sector. The SEC has not yet classified WLFI tokens as securities, which exempts them from the same stringent regulatory oversight as stocks. The White House has maintained that all of Trump's assets are held in a trust managed by his children and that there is no conflict of interest. However, details of the trust structure have not been made public. The trust's sole beneficiary designation of President Trump means that hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency transactions made during his term could be used personally at any time. World Liberty published its proposal to open trading for WLFI tokens on its website on July 9. Of the approximately 20,900 votes cast, 99.94% voted “yes.” A World Liberty spokesperson told Reuters that details of how the tokens would be traded would be released soon. *This is not investment advice.
