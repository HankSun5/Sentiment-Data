Bitcoin, the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, has long been lauded for its robust cryptographic foundations. Yet, as technological advancements accelerate, new challenges emerge on the horizon. One such formidable challenge is the advent of quantum computing. Imagine a machine so powerful it could potentially unravel the very cryptographic algorithms that secure our digital lives. It sounds like science fiction, but the threat is real, and proactive minds are already at work. This is precisely why Jameson Lopp, a highly respected co-founder of Casa and a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community, has unveiled a groundbreaking proposal aimed at fortifying Bitcoin against this looming quantum threat. His vision outlines a strategic Bitcoin upgrade , ensuring the network’s resilience for generations to come. Understanding the Quantum Computing Threat to Bitcoin’s Security Before diving into Lopp’s innovative solution, it’s essential to grasp the nature of the threat posed by quantum computing . Bitcoin’s security fundamentally relies on public-key cryptography, specifically the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). When you send Bitcoin, you sign the transaction with your private key, and anyone on the network can verify this signature using your public key. The security relies on the mathematical difficulty of deriving the private key from the public key. Here’s where quantum computers enter the picture. Unlike classical computers that process information using bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers use ‘qubits’ which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously. This allows them to perform certain computations exponentially faster. Specifically, algorithms like Shor’s algorithm, if run on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, could efficiently factor large numbers and solve the discrete logarithm problem, which underpins ECDSA. This means: Private Key Derivation: A quantum computer could potentially derive your private key from your public key, especially if your public key has been exposed (e.g., after spending UTXOs). This would allow an attacker to spend your funds. Signature Forgery: With a derived private key, an attacker could forge signatures for new transactions, effectively stealing your Bitcoin. While the full-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is still a hypothetical future, the scientific community acknowledges its potential emergence within decades. The time to prepare is now, given the slow and deliberate nature of Bitcoin protocol changes. Jameson Lopp’s Vision: A Proactive BIP for Post-Quantum Cryptography Recognizing the urgency, Jameson Lopp has taken a significant step forward by sharing a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) . This isn’t a panicked reaction but a meticulously planned, forward-looking strategy. Lopp’s proposal, shared on X (formerly Twitter), outlines a comprehensive migration roadmap for transitioning Bitcoin to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The core idea is to implement a mechanism that allows Bitcoin users and the network itself to gradually adopt new, quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms without disrupting the existing system. This proactive approach ensures that Bitcoin’s foundational security remains uncompromised even as quantum technology advances. Key aspects of Lopp’s BIP include: Migration Roadmap: A phased approach that would be triggered by the emergence of credible quantum computing threats. This isn’t an immediate, forced upgrade, but a prepared pathway. Incentive Mechanisms: Ways to encourage users to transition their funds to PQC-secured addresses. Security Considerations: Mechanisms for protecting assets during the transition, even in emergency scenarios. This proposal highlights the Bitcoin community’s commitment to long-term security and adaptability, demonstrating that even foundational protocols can evolve to meet future challenges. What is Post-Quantum Cryptography and How Does it Secure Bitcoin? Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), also known as quantum-resistant cryptography, refers to cryptographic algorithms that are designed to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. Research in this field has been ongoing for years, with various promising candidates emerging. Unlike current algorithms that rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or discrete logarithms, PQC algorithms often leverage different mathematical problems, such as: Lattice-based cryptography: Relies on the difficulty of solving certain problems in high-dimensional lattices. Hash-based cryptography: Uses cryptographic hash functions, which are generally considered quantum-resistant. Code-based cryptography: Based on error-correcting codes. Multivariate polynomial cryptography: Relies on the difficulty of solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations. Integrating PQC into Bitcoin would involve changing the signature algorithm used for transactions. Instead of ECDSA, a quantum-resistant signature scheme would be employed. This would likely involve changes to how addresses are generated and how transactions are validated. Challenges with PQC integration: Larger Key Sizes: Many PQC algorithms result in significantly larger public keys and signatures compared to ECDSA, which could impact transaction size and block space. Performance: Some PQC algorithms might be computationally more intensive, affecting transaction processing times. Standardization: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is still in the process of standardizing PQC algorithms, and the final choices could influence Bitcoin’s adoption. Lopp’s BIP implicitly acknowledges these challenges by proposing a gradual, well-thought-out migration rather than a rushed implementation. The Proposed Migration Roadmap: A Phased Bitcoin Upgrade The beauty of Lopp’s proposal lies in its pragmatic and phased approach to a Bitcoin upgrade . It understands that a network as critical and decentralized as Bitcoin cannot undergo radical, overnight changes. Instead, it suggests a careful, deliberate transition: Phase Description Trigger User Action Phase 1: Research & Preparation Ongoing research into PQC standards, community discussion, and soft fork development for PQC-compatible addresses. Current State / Community Initiative Awareness, potentially testing PQC wallets. Phase 2: Optional PQC Addresses Introduction of new address types that support PQC signatures (e.g., through a soft fork like Taproot). Users can optionally move funds to these addresses. Early signs of credible quantum threat, PQC standardization. Users voluntarily migrate funds to PQC-enabled addresses for enhanced security. Phase 3: Emergency Migration & Mandatory Transition If a significant quantum threat becomes imminent (e.g., a powerful quantum computer is demonstrated), mechanisms for forced migration or ‘bail-out’ transactions for non-PQC addresses are activated. Imminent quantum threat (e.g., demonstrated quantum computer breaking ECDSA). Users must move funds to PQC-enabled addresses; network may assist in emergency cases. This roadmap provides flexibility, allowing the Bitcoin network to adapt based on the actual progression of quantum technology rather than making premature, irreversible changes. It’s a testament to the foresight of individuals like Jameson Lopp , who are thinking decades ahead. Incentives and Safeguards: Protecting Assets During the Transition A critical component of any large-scale protocol change, especially a Bitcoin upgrade , is ensuring user adoption and asset protection. Lopp’s BIP considers both. While the specifics are still under discussion and development, the proposal aims to include: Incentives for Early Adoption: These could range from educational campaigns to potential minor transaction fee advantages for PQC-enabled transactions, encouraging users to migrate their funds proactively. The idea is to make the transition as seamless and beneficial as possible for users. Emergency Mechanisms: In a worst-case scenario, where a quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA emerges rapidly, the proposal suggests mechanisms to protect funds held in legacy addresses. This could involve pre-signed transactions, time-locked contracts, or other innovative solutions that allow users to ‘rescue’ their funds before they become vulnerable. Such mechanisms would likely require network consensus and careful implementation to avoid new attack vectors. The goal is to avoid a ‘quantum panic’ and provide a structured, secure pathway for all Bitcoin holders. This thoughtful approach underscores the robust security considerations inherent in the proposal. Why This Proactive Approach Matters for Bitcoin’s Future The significance of Jameson Lopp’s proposal extends far beyond merely addressing a hypothetical future threat. It reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a resilient, future-proof digital store of value. By actively planning for a quantum computing future, the Bitcoin community demonstrates: Long-Term Vision: Unlike many short-sighted projects, Bitcoin’s core developers and thought leaders are committed to its multi-decade, even multi-century, existence. Adaptability: Despite its reputation for conservatism, Bitcoin’s protocol can evolve through the BIP process, incorporating crucial advancements while maintaining its core principles. Enhanced Trust: Knowing that the community is proactively addressing such profound threats bolsters confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term security and viability as a global reserve asset. Leadership in Blockchain Security: Bitcoin continues to set the standard for security and innovation in the blockchain space, prompting other cryptocurrencies to consider similar proactive measures for post-quantum cryptography . This initiative is not about fear-mongering but about responsible, strategic planning. It ensures that Bitcoin remains the most secure and reliable digital asset, regardless of how technology evolves. Conclusion: Securing Bitcoin’s Quantum Future Jameson Lopp’s new BIP is a testament to the Bitcoin community’s unwavering commitment to its long-term security and resilience. By proposing a comprehensive Bitcoin upgrade plan to integrate post-quantum cryptography , Lopp and the broader community are taking decisive action against the potential threats posed by future quantum computing advancements. This proactive approach, with its carefully outlined migration roadmap, incentive mechanisms, and robust security considerations, ensures that Bitcoin remains a formidable, unassailable digital asset for generations to come. It’s a crucial step in safeguarding the digital gold standard, reinforcing its position as a secure and reliable foundation for the global financial future.

In a significant development, Ghana is stepping up to the plate, reportedly finalizing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. This proactive approach aims to bring various digital asset platforms under formal oversight, a move that could set a precedent for other developing economies. Why is Ghana Crypto Regulation a Game Changer? The news, initially reported by Bloomberg, highlights Ghana’s commitment to creating a structured environment for digital currencies. For too long, the crypto space has operated in a legal grey area in many parts of the world, leading to concerns about consumer protection, illicit financial flows, and overall market stability. Ghana’s initiative signals a clear intent to foster innovation while mitigating risks. This isn’t just about controlling; it’s about legitimizing and integrating. What Does This Mean for Digital Asset Platforms? For businesses operating digital asset platforms in Ghana, or those looking to enter the market, this upcoming framework will bring much-needed clarity. Currently, the lack of clear rules can deter legitimate businesses and investors. A well-defined regulatory landscape can: Enhance Trust: Investors and users are more likely to engage with platforms that operate under a clear legal structure. Promote Innovation: With regulatory certainty, companies can invest more confidently in developing new products and services. Combat Illicit Activities: Robust regulations can help prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes often associated with unregulated crypto. Foster Growth: By bringing platforms into the formal financial system, it opens doors for partnerships with traditional financial institutions. This move is a strong signal that Ghana is ready to embrace the digital economy responsibly. Crafting a Robust Cryptocurrency Framework: The Ghanaian Approach Developing a comprehensive cryptocurrency framework is no small feat. It requires balancing the decentralized nature of crypto with the need for centralized oversight. While the specifics of Ghana’s framework are yet to be fully disclosed, it’s expected to cover key areas such as: Licensing and Registration: Requirements for crypto exchanges, custodians, and other service providers. Consumer Protection: Measures to safeguard users’ funds and data, including dispute resolution mechanisms. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Strict Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols and reporting obligations. Taxation: Clarity on how crypto assets and transactions will be taxed. Market Integrity: Rules to prevent market manipulation and ensure fair trading practices. The success of this framework will depend on its adaptability and ability to keep pace with rapid technological advancements in the crypto space. Ghana’s Influence on African Crypto Adoption Ghana’s proactive stance could significantly impact the broader landscape of African crypto adoption . The continent has seen remarkable growth in cryptocurrency usage, often driven by a need for alternative financial services, remittances, and inflation hedging. However, regulatory responses have been varied, from outright bans to cautious experimentation. If Ghana successfully implements a balanced and effective framework, it could serve as a blueprint for other African nations. This could lead to a more harmonized regulatory environment across the continent, facilitating cross-border crypto transactions and fostering regional digital economic integration. Ghana’s leadership in this area could inspire a wave of structured growth, moving African crypto from a largely informal sector to a more formalized and secure one. Ensuring Financial Stability in a Digital Age Ultimately, the core objective behind Ghana’s regulatory push is to enhance financial stability . Unregulated digital assets can pose systemic risks to a nation’s financial system, including volatility spillover, potential for financial fraud, and challenges to monetary policy. By bringing these assets under regulatory purview, the Bank of Ghana and other financial authorities aim to: Monitor and Manage Risks: Gain visibility into crypto market activities to identify and mitigate potential threats. Protect the Financial System: Prevent illicit funds from flowing through digital channels and impacting traditional finance.

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-set-to-explode-heres-the-latest/,"Shiba Inu is beginning to stand out as a notable gainer in the current cryptocurrency market cycle. While its recent price movements have not reflected explosive growth, several analysts now believe that the asset is on the verge of a major trend reversal. Bear Market Exhaustion Signals a Possible Turning Point Crypto analyst “Cantonese Cat,” known for his broad following on social media, recently commented that sell pressure on Shiba Inu has drastically declined. In his view, the bearish grip that has restrained SHIB’s price for months could soon be broken with minimal upward momentum from buyers. He emphasized that current market activity suggests holders are not offloading their positions, indicating low sell-side volume. Shiba Inu has experienced a prolonged downtrend since March 2024, losing approximately 77% of its value, falling from a high of $0.000045 to a low of $0.00001004. Despite intermittent recovery attempts during that time, bearish resistance consistently overpowered bullish momentum, pushing the token dangerously close to losing another decimal point. Nobody is selling $SHIB either. Sell volume is nonexistent, and all it takes is just some volume coming in and these bear trends will reverse in a big way. https://t.co/oUpZtxBoCu pic.twitter.com/difHLffzwv — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) July 13, 2025 However, analysts now suggest that conditions may be aligning in favor of a stronger price recovery, especially given recent patterns in whale accumulation. Whale Activity Reflects Growing Confidence On July 10, on-chain data showed that major Shiba Inu holders, those controlling at least 0.1% of the total supply, purchased 1.81 trillion SHIB tokens. This represented a 422% increase in accumulation compared to the previous day and an astonishing 1,247% rise from one month earlier. This surge in buying coincided with SHIB surpassing the $0.000013 threshold for the first time in nearly a month. Even though 1.28 trillion SHIB was withdrawn from large wallets the same day, the net inflow remains positive, suggesting ongoing accumulation. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00001364, reflecting an 11.3% gain over the past week. Despite reaching a monthly high, several market participants argue that SHIB’s price still does not reflect its potential value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Outlook from Analysts Although Cantonese Cat did not provide a specific price target for Shiba Inu, other analysts have offered projections. “SHIB Spain,” a notable community figure, shared a chart indicating that SHIB could soon break past $0.000018. He further suggested that long-term growth could take SHIB toward the $0.0001 mark. Meanwhile, technical analyst “Crypto Candy” described SHIB’s current chart as bullish and identified several price milestones. His short-term objective is $0.00001718, with a mid-range target at $0.00002502. Should momentum persist, he anticipates a potential move back to December 2023’s high of $0.00003324 and possibly beyond. While optimism among supporters is increasing , not all observers are convinced. Some market participants continue to express doubts about the long-term prospects of meme-based tokens like SHIB. Critics argue that the token’s peak performance may be behind it, and that new investors should remain cautious despite recent gains. Regardless of skepticism, the sharp decline in selling activity, combined with a noticeable surge in whale accumulation, indicates renewed confidence in the asset.

The news of prominent trader James Wynn experiencing a partial crypto liquidation on his substantial 40x Bitcoin (BTC) and 10x PEPE long positions on Hyperliquid has sent ripples through the trading community. This incident, first reported by Onchain Lens on X, serves as a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can shift in the fast-paced digital asset markets. What Exactly Happened to James Wynn’s Positions? In a development that quickly captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts, James Wynn , a well-known figure within the Hyperliquid trading ecosystem, faced a partial liquidation. This wasn’t just any trade; it involved significant leverage on two highly popular, yet volatile, assets: Bitcoin (BTC) and the meme coin PEPE. Specifically, Wynn held a 40x long position on BTC and a 10x long position on PEPE. A ‘long’ position means he was betting on the price of these assets to go up. However, when prices move against such highly leveraged bets, the risk of liquidation becomes imminent. Partial liquidation occurs when a trading platform automatically closes a portion of a trader’s position to prevent further losses, typically when the margin balance falls below the required maintenance margin. This mechanism is designed to protect both the trader from losing more than their initial collateral and the exchange from bad debt. The incident highlights the unforgiving nature of high-leverage trading, where even experienced traders like James Wynn can face significant setbacks due to market fluctuations. Understanding the Dynamics of High Leverage on Hyperliquid For those new to the space, understanding leverage is crucial. Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their actual capital. For instance, with 40x leverage, a trader can control $40 for every $1 they put up as collateral. While this amplifies potential gains, it also drastically magnifies potential losses. On platforms like Hyperliquid , which are known for offering high leverage options, the stakes are incredibly high. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what high leverage entails: Amplified Exposure: A small price movement can lead to large profit or loss. Lower Margin Requirements: You need less capital upfront to open a large position. Increased Liquidation Risk: Your liquidation price is much closer to your entry price, meaning a small adverse move can trigger a margin call or liquidation. The decision to use 40x leverage on Bitcoin trading, an asset known for its volatility, and 10x on a meme coin like PEPE coin , which can experience even wilder swings, demonstrates a high-risk, high-reward strategy. While such strategies can lead to immense profits during favorable market conditions, they also expose traders to substantial downside during unexpected price reversals. Leverage Multiplier and Risk Leverage Multiplier Impact on Gains/Losses Proximity to Liquidation 1x (No Leverage) 1:1 with price movement Only if asset goes to zero 10x 10x amplified 10% adverse move triggers liquidation (approx.) 40x 40x amplified 2.5% adverse move triggers liquidation (approx.) Why is High Leverage So Risky in Crypto Trading? The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its rapid price swings, often influenced by news, regulatory changes, and broader market sentiment. This inherent volatility makes high-leverage trading a double-edged sword. Even a minor correction or a sudden flash crash can wipe out a significant portion of a trader’s capital, leading to a crypto liquidation event. Unlike traditional markets, crypto operates 24/7, meaning price movements can occur at any time, catching traders off guard. Key factors contributing to the risk: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and PEPE coin can experience double-digit percentage swings in a single day. Unpredictable News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, or major whale movements can cause sudden price drops. Liquidation Cascades: When a large number of leveraged positions are liquidated simultaneously, it can create a domino effect, pushing prices down further and triggering more liquidations. Emotional Trading: The pressure of high-leverage positions can lead to irrational decisions, such as over-trading or failing to set proper stop-losses. For traders engaging in Bitcoin trading or speculating on meme coins, understanding these risks is paramount. The allure of quick profits can often overshadow the potential for equally rapid and substantial losses. Lessons from James Wynn’s Experience: Navigating Bitcoin Trading and PEPE Coin Volatility The partial liquidation of James Wynn ‘s positions offers invaluable lessons for both novice and experienced traders. It underscores the critical importance of robust risk management strategies, especially when dealing with high-leverage products on platforms like Hyperliquid . Actionable Insights for Traders: Prioritize Risk Management: Always define your maximum acceptable loss per trade. Use stop-loss orders diligently to limit potential downside. This is perhaps the most crucial lesson from any crypto liquidation event. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While 40x or 10x leverage might seem appealing for quick gains, they drastically reduce your margin for error. Consider lower leverage (2x-5x) or even no leverage, especially if you’re new to the market or trading highly volatile assets like PEPE coin . Understand Liquidation Points: Before entering a leveraged trade, always calculate your liquidation price. Know exactly how much the asset needs to move against you before your position is automatically closed. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Wynn focused on BTC and PEPE, spreading your capital across different assets can mitigate risk. Stay Informed but Skeptical: Follow market news and sentiment, but always do your own research (DYOR). Don’t blindly follow prominent traders or social media trends, as their strategies might not align with your risk tolerance or capital. Emotional Discipline: Trading under pressure can lead to poor decisions. Develop a trading plan and stick to it, avoiding impulsive actions driven by fear or greed. Learn from Others’ Mistakes: The unfortunate events faced by traders like James Wynn provide real-world case studies. Analyze what went wrong and how similar situations can be avoided in your own Bitcoin trading journey. Conclusion: Navigating the High-Stakes World of Crypto The partial liquidation of James Wynn ‘s significant BTC and PEPE long positions on Hyperliquid is a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. While the allure of amplified gains is undeniable, the potential for rapid and substantial losses is equally real. This incident serves as a crucial case study, emphasizing the absolute necessity of sound risk management, prudent leverage choices, and emotional discipline for anyone venturing into the high-stakes world of crypto.

Speaking at the annual Mansion House dinner in London, Bailey condemned Trump’s proposed 30% tariffs on imports from the EU and Mexico—on top of existing levies on Chinese goods—as deeply disruptive. He labeled the approach “economic sabotage,” arguing it would backfire and worsen inflation, which he described as the real threat. Bailey says these tariffs are dangerous, noting that the US move may prompt a cycle of retaliation and protectionism. He added that the tariffs could slow trade and cause prices for ordinary goods to climb, reducing global economic activity. Bailey said that higher tariffs could seriously risk the global economy and trade. He warned that such measures would ultimately harm the households they intended to support. Bailey urges global leaders to choose collaboration over conflict Bailey also pushed for renewed international cooperation between the US and China to solve outstanding trade and capital-flow imbalances. He said that China and the US account for nearly 40% of the world’s current account imbalances. The US runs a large trade deficit, and China has a big surplus due to elevated savings and low domestic consumption. Bailey said the two positions were untenable, adding that economic divisions reinforced political hostility between the sides. However, Bailey opposed hitting back with tariffs and urged world leaders to work together and reform multilateral institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) . And these institutions can better manage worldwide shifts in trading and financial systems, he said. Bailey said that all parties must agree upon the rules of the process. He cautioned that allowing one dominant player to dictate the rules was not a formula for lasting stability. He also said the US should explain how it reconciles its increasing domestic fiscal deficit with condemnation of its trade imbalance with the rest of the world. He also urged China to solve its low household consumption and excessive export dependence. BOE warns stablecoins and digital currencies pose risks The Bank of England has warned that the widespread use of digital currencies could intensify the severity of bank runs. In a recent Economic Letter, the central Bank noted that when confidence in a bank’s solvency collapses, a rush by depositors to withdraw funds could lead to a rapid loss of liquidity. This, in turn, would dry up other funding sources and render many of the Bank’s assets effectively worthless. The Bank explained that banks, whose deposits and loans are no longer backed by gold but by short-term securities, could quickly become insolvent in such scenarios. It added that holders of other securities issued by the affected Bank would likely scramble to sell, triggering further panic in the financial markets. Transitioning from global trade to financial innovation, Bailey’s speech instead raised fears of the rapid expansion of digital assets—particularly stablecoins—and lobbying for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Britain. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value, typically by being pegged to the value of the US dollar. They are becoming better known as a means of payment and investment, including in the United States, where there have been recent moves to write regulations underpinning their use. However, Bailey is not convinced of their place in a secure and stable financial system in the future. He also voiced his reservations over the proposed digital pound under consideration by the Bank of England and the HM Treasury. While some view a UK CBDC as an inevitability, Bailey said the case for innovation “has not yet been made.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|Bank of England,EN,0,0,FIAT|ASIA|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-15 23:41:38

What had begun as a positive crypto week for President Donald Trump has turned sour after the Congress signaled different interpretations of certain clauses, especially in the Genius Act , which have been meant to provide clear rules for stablecoins. Out of the total votes, 196 House members voted for the bill to continue while 223 members, the majority including the Democrats, voted against the debate of the legislation. As a result, the House has been on standstill and a huge blow to President Trump and the wider Republicans. Furthermore, the just-concluded vote has prevented the Congress from debating and eventually voting on the bill later this week. What Went Wrong in Congress With the Genius Act Bill? According to Eleanor Terrett, the Republicans who voted against the Genius Act argued that the bill could have been constructed to secretly allow the Federal Reserve to introduce a CBDC.

Yet, when a figure as prominent as former U.S. President Donald Trump publicly champions a specific piece of legislation aimed at cementing America’s dominance in the digital asset space, it sends ripples across the globe. This week, Trump took to social media during what he dubbed ‘Crypto Week,’ advocating for the crucial GENIUS Act , a move that could redefine the future landscape for digital assets in the United States. What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Trump Crypto Vision? At its core, the GENIUS Act (likely an acronym for ‘Guiding Entrepreneurs in New Innovative US Startups’ or similar, given its stated purpose) is designed to provide a clear regulatory framework and foster innovation within the burgeoning digital asset sector. While specific details of the bill are still emerging, Trump’s endorsement highlights its potential to streamline processes, encourage investment, and protect consumers in the crypto market. This legislative push is a significant indicator of how seriously top political figures are now taking the crypto industry. For years, the U.S. has grappled with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to a patchwork of state-level rules and federal agencies often operating without clear mandates. This uncertainty has, at times, hindered innovation and driven some crypto businesses offshore. The GENIUS Act aims to address this by: Establishing Regulatory Clarity: Providing clear guidelines for digital asset classification, issuance, and trading. Fostering Innovation: Creating a supportive environment for blockchain startups and developers. Protecting Consumers: Implementing safeguards against fraud and market manipulation. Promoting Economic Growth: Attracting capital and talent to the U.S. digital asset sector. Why is US Leadership in Digital Assets Crucial? President Trump’s emphasis on securing U.S. leadership in digital assets is not merely political rhetoric; it’s a strategic imperative with profound economic and geopolitical implications. In an increasingly digitized global economy, the nation that leads in emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies will hold a significant competitive advantage. This leadership translates into several key benefits: Economic Prosperity and Job Creation A robust digital asset ecosystem can unlock immense economic potential. By attracting companies, developers, and investors, the U.S. can create high-paying jobs, stimulate technological advancements, and generate new revenue streams. Imagine a future where the next Google or Apple of blockchain technology is born and thrives on American soil, contributing massively to the national GDP. National Security and Financial Stability Controlling the narrative and infrastructure around digital assets is also a matter of national security. As central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) gain traction globally, having a strong domestic framework ensures the U.S. can influence global standards, prevent illicit finance, and maintain financial stability in an evolving landscape. Ignoring this sector would leave the U.S. vulnerable to foreign technological dominance and potential financial disruptions. Global Influence and Innovation Being at the forefront of digital asset innovation allows the U.S. to set global benchmarks and standards, much like it has done in other technological revolutions. This leadership reinforces America’s position as a global innovator and attracts the brightest minds from around the world, creating a virtuous cycle of progress. Trump’s Shifting Stance: A Game Changer for Crypto Legislation? Donald Trump’s vocal support for digital assets marks a notable evolution in his public stance on cryptocurrencies. Previously, his comments on Bitcoin were often viewed with skepticism, sometimes even outright dismissal. However, his recent embrace, culminating in the declaration of ‘Crypto Week’ and the strong endorsement of the GENIUS Act, signals a significant shift. This pivot is likely influenced by the growing mainstream adoption of crypto, its increasing integration into traditional finance, and the recognition of its potential economic impact. This change of heart from a leading political figure could be a powerful catalyst for broader crypto legislation . When a potential presidential candidate makes digital assets a campaign talking point, it elevates the discussion from niche financial circles to the national political stage. This can pressure Congress to act more decisively, potentially leading to bipartisan efforts to pass comprehensive crypto laws. What Does This Mean for the Future? The implications of Trump’s support are multifaceted: Increased Political Momentum: Crypto legislation could become a more prominent issue in upcoming elections, pushing candidates to articulate their stances. Potential for Bipartisan Support: While crypto has seen some bipartisan interest, a high-profile endorsement from a former president could encourage more lawmakers to engage. Market Confidence: Clearer regulatory pathways often lead to increased institutional investment and broader adoption, as uncertainty is a major deterrent for many traditional investors. The Road Ahead: Congressional Collaboration and Challenges for Crypto Legislation While President Trump’s endorsement is a powerful statement, the actual implementation of the GENIUS Act, or any comprehensive crypto legislation , requires diligent work and collaboration with Congress. The legislative process is often slow and complex, particularly when dealing with a rapidly evolving technology like digital assets. Key challenges that Congress will need to navigate include: Defining Jurisdictions: Deciding which federal agencies (SEC, CFTC, Treasury, etc.) have primary oversight over different aspects of digital assets. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Crafting laws that protect investors without stifling technological progress. International Harmonization: Ensuring U.S. laws are compatible with global standards to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Technological Literacy: Educating lawmakers and their staff on the nuances of blockchain and various digital asset classes. Trump’s pledge to work with Congress on further legislation indicates a willingness to engage in this complex process. For the crypto community, this is a call to action: active participation, education, and advocacy will be crucial in shaping these upcoming policies. Actionable Insights for the Digital Asset Community Given these developments, what should individuals and businesses in the digital asset space consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on legislative developments, particularly concerning the GENIUS Act and broader crypto legislation. Follow reputable news sources and official government channels. Engage with Policy Makers: If you’re a business or an advocate, consider engaging with your representatives to share your perspectives on how sensible regulation can foster innovation. Prepare for Change: While the specifics are uncertain, a push for clearer regulation means businesses should start reviewing their compliance frameworks and adapting to potential new requirements. Educate Others: Help demystify digital assets for those less familiar, promoting a balanced understanding of their benefits and risks. Conclusion: A New Era for US Leadership in Digital Assets? President Donald Trump’s unequivocal support for the GENIUS Act and his vision for U.S. leadership in digital assets marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This is more than just a political endorsement; it signifies a growing recognition at the highest levels of government that digital assets are not a fleeting trend but a fundamental component of the future global economy. While the path to comprehensive legislation will undoubtedly present challenges, the commitment from a figure like Trump injects significant momentum into the conversation. The coming months and years will reveal whether this bold vision translates into actionable policy that truly solidifies America’s position at the forefront of the digital revolution. For those invested in the future of finance and technology, this is a development worth watching closely, as it could usher in an era of unprecedented growth and clarity for the digital asset landscape.

The project’s presale has now hit $339 million, cruising through Batch 29 with momentum still building. Over 23.9 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, and those who got in during Batch 1 have seen returns of 2,660%. Instead of betting on short-lived meme coin spikes, users are leaning into long-term value with BlockDAG’s real-world focus. Bitcoin Pepe staking has stirred excitement in meme circles, especially for those chasing passive rewards. But putting money behind a meme is not the same as supporting tech infrastructure. That’s where BlockDAG is stepping in strong. A mining app with over 2 million users, security audits completed, DeFi tools prepped for launch, and partnerships that are driving adoption, that’s what real traction looks like. Bitcoin Pepe Hype Builds, But How Long Will It Last? For the Bitcoin Pepe community, getting listed on MEXC is no small feat. It gives the project visibility on a high-volume exchange, and the launch of staking adds another reason for supporters to stay active after the presale. The presale had all the classic meme coin ingredients: big buzz, fast-paced sales, and a surge of social media hype. With its signature frog branding and meme culture backing, Bitcoin Pepe quickly found a loyal base. But even with the current rise in popularity, questions about future direction are starting to show up. Many meme coins follow a pattern: go viral, get listed, then struggle to build beyond the hype. Without a clear product roadmap or developer activity, long-term staying power becomes uncertain. And in today’s market, having a clear vision matters more than ever. $339M Raised & Sports Collabs Push BlockDAG Forward BlockDAG isn’t chasing fast fame; it’s building for reach. While many projects focus on influencer boosts or fast exchange listings, BlockDAG is going for long-term recognition. The project recently partnered with two pro sports teams, the Seattle Seawolves (rugby) and Seattle Orcas (cricket). These are not surface-level promotions. The deals include fan events, NFT rollouts, and deeper community engagement. These moves show BlockDAG’s push to go beyond just crypto-native users. The goal is broader adoption, from sports fans to everyday tech users. With past deals like Inter Milan and UFC’s Alex Pereira already in its portfolio, BlockDAG is building a worldwide presence. Now, with $339 million raised and over 23.9 billion coins sold, the numbers are lining up with the mission. Buyers from Batch 1 have already gained a 2,660% return, heading into the full $0.05 launch price. CertiK and Halborn audited the network, and the X1 app alone onboarded over 2 million users. Plus, a full DeFi ecosystem is gearing up for launch. Right now, thanks to the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, a special $0.0016 price is live until August 11. That means users can still lock in a 3,250% return before the $0.05 price goes live. This is one of the lowest rates offered since the early batches, and it’s drawing heavy attention. With the presale in Batch 29 and the price at $0.0276 normally, this time-sensitive offer is a major window for new entries. Vibes or Value? BlockDAG Leads with Structure Let’s be honest. Bitcoin Pepe staking might offer some short-term gains, but without a broader structure to support it, those rewards won’t last. Meme coins like Doge and Floki have pulled big numbers before, but few can hold on once the buzz fades. BlockDAG is doing something different. It’s not just chasing trends, it’s locking in value. There’s a complete plan behind the scenes, with a fast-growing user base and real-world tools backing it all. That’s rare in crypto, especially with so many projects relying only on internet attention. While Bitcoin Pepe’s listing will help it stay relevant in the short run, BlockDAG is setting up for something bigger. With tech, utility, and strong brand partnerships, it’s becoming the project that stands out, not just this month, but through the next cycle. The Final Verdict Meme coins will always have a crypto place, but lasting success needs more than just jokes and staking rewards. Bitcoin Pepe’s listing might bring in a few wins, and its staking system could keep users around for a bit. But the real action is happening with BlockDAG. With $339 million raised, 23.9 billion coins sold, and a full ecosystem in development, BlockDAG is positioning itself for major visibility. The presale is still open, and the $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer runs until August 11, giving people a rare shot to grab BDAG at one of its earliest prices. As Bitcoin Pepe rides the meme trend, BlockDAG is building something that lasts.

Are You Seeing This?,https://timestabloid.com/chartist-says-xrp-is-screaming-all-time-high-are-you-seeing-this/,"Market analyst Ali Martinez has indicated that XRP is exhibiting significant upward potential and may be positioned for a strong rally, provided it clears a key price barrier. According to his assessment, the cryptocurrency must achieve a confirmed weekly close above $3 to unlock further gains, with targets extending to $4.80 in the mid-term. Current Price Activity and Consolidation Zone As of mid-July 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $2.87, following a brief retracement from a recent attempt to test the $3 resistance . The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a modest cooldown after substantial price movements earlier this month, which included Bitcoin reaching new record highs. Since January 2025, XRP has maintained a consistent trading range, fluctuating between $2 as support and $3 as resistance. While the asset has made multiple efforts to break above this upper boundary, those attempts have been unsuccessful so far. Simultaneously, the lower end of the range has remained firmly supported by buying interest. $XRP is screaming all-time highs. Are you seeing this? pic.twitter.com/fWKQUESNqQ — Ali (@ali_charts) July 14, 2025 Comparison to Previous Market Structure Martinez notes that XRP’s current price behavior is reminiscent of a similar pattern observed between August 2023 and November 2024, during which the token traded within a narrower band ranging from $0.40 to $0.74. Once that prior consolidation phase ended with a breakout above resistance, XRP advanced quickly to higher price levels, surpassing $1 and eventually reaching $2. Based on this historical setup, Martinez believes the market could be witnessing a comparable consolidation phase that precedes a larger breakout, potentially leading to fresh all-time highs. Resistance Levels and Momentum Indicators Should XRP manage to secure a weekly close above the $3 threshold, the next areas of resistance are projected to be $3.40, a level that rejected price action earlier in January 2025, followed by the previous all-time high of $3.80, set in 2018. If both levels are breached, Martinez sees $4.80 as a reasonable target in the near to mid-term. Technical indicators appear to support the bullish outlook. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows that the Average Directional Index (ADX) is currently at 25, suggesting that a trend is forming. The Positive Directional Indicator (+DI) is positioned at 23.6, while the Negative Directional Indicator (–DI) has decreased to 15.47. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The widening gap between these metrics implies strengthening bullish momentum and weakening seller presence. A sustained ADX reading above 25 would confirm a developing upward trend. Beyond short-term targets, Martinez has previously emphasized a significant breakout from a seven-year symmetrical triangle that occurred in November 2024. This move marked the end of a prolonged compression phase and initiated a new market cycle. Since then, XRP has largely consolidated its gains during the first half of 2025. Using Fibonacci extension analysis, Martinez has identified potential long-term price objectives at $8.96, $16.17, and $26.24, contingent upon continued bullish conditions and strong market participation. While XRP’s momentum remains favorable, Martinez underscores that a confirmed breakout above $3 is essential to trigger any major upward move. Until this level is decisively breached, the asset is likely to continue consolidating within its established trading band.

Using a detailed Elliott Wave structure and historical halving patterns, the expert outlines what could be Bitcoin’s final parabolic move, laying out a clear roadmap toward a new ATH target. Bitcoin Parabolic Phase Still Ahead Following Bitcoin’s explosive rise above $123,000 in a single day, crypto analyst XForceGlobal reaffirmed his earlier predictions and intensified his bullish outlook. He now asserts that Bitcoin is in the early stages of a much larger breakout, with the final and most parabolic phase of its rally yet to unfold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trajectory To $155,000: Why No Major Dips Are Expected From Here The analyst Bitcoin Price Trajectory To $155,000: Why No Major Dips Are Expected From Here a detailed chart showing that Bitcoin is now trading over $40,000 above its Wave 2 bottom of the macro 5th. This indicates that the market could be transitioning into Wave 3 of a larger Elliott Wave impulse pattern. The chart also visually segments previous bull market runs into distinct macro phases, each unfolding after a halving cycle. Every phase began with a consolidation period, followed by exponential growth and eventual correction. Bitcoin’s price history is further marked by the halving events in 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024—all of which have consistently preceded major bullish rallies. The latest halving, which occurred in April 2024, is now expected to lead to an intermediate-term rally that may extend BTC’s price beyond $270,000 before entering another corrective phase. While XForceGlobal maintains a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin, he urges investors to be cautious and aware that the final wave may generate market euphoria before a significant decline sets in. His projected roadmap shows a steady bullish climb toward $272,832, followed by a potential retracement to around $41,646, marking a steep 85% crash from the top. During his analysis, the market expert highlighted the difference between smart and dumb money during this bullish phase of the cycle. He claimed that smart investors have already mapped out their exit strategies, understanding that success comes from early planning rather than spontaneous decisions. He also added that with the market yet to reach a climax, there’s still time to prepare an exit before red flags emerge. Analyst Predicts $155,000 As Bitcoin’s Next Stop In a follow-up X post, XForceGlobal forecasted Bitcoin’s next short-term price target at $155,000. This prediction comes as BTC recently rallied past $123,000 before undergoing a pullback, now trading slightly above $116,800. According to the analyst, Bitcoin remains firmly in an extended Wave 3, which traditionally represents the most impulsive and powerful phase of the Elliott Wave sequence.

David Sacks, a key figure reportedly tapped to lead the White House’s AI and cryptocurrency strategy should Donald Trump return to office, has confirmed plans to decisively block the issuance of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This revelation, initially reported by Odaily and echoing sentiments previously expressed by Trump himself, sends powerful ripples through the global financial landscape. It promises a stark contrast to approaches taken by many other major economies, and for crypto enthusiasts and digital finance observers, this isn’t just a policy statement; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine the future of money in the United States. Understanding the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Debate: What Exactly Are We Talking About? Before diving into the implications of the Trump administration’s stance, it’s crucial to grasp what a central bank digital currency (CBDC) truly is. In essence, a CBDC is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Think of it as a digital version of the cash in your wallet, but instead of being printed by the government, it exists purely in electronic form and is directly controlled by the central monetary authority. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which operate on distributed ledgers and are not controlled by any single entity, a CBDC would be centralized. It would be a direct liability of the central bank, similar to physical banknotes, offering a level of sovereign backing that private digital currencies or stablecoins currently do not possess. Globally, central banks are exploring two main types of CBDCs: Retail CBDCs: These are designed for general public use, much like digital cash. Individuals and businesses would hold accounts or digital wallets directly with the central bank, or through intermediaries, enabling direct digital payments. Wholesale CBDCs: These are restricted to financial institutions for interbank settlements, aiming to improve the efficiency and security of wholesale payment systems. Proponents of CBDCs often highlight a range of potential benefits: Potential Benefits of CBDCs Potential Concerns of CBDCs Financial Inclusion: Providing access to digital payments for the unbanked or underbanked populations. Privacy Erosion: Potential for government surveillance of all financial transactions, leading to a loss of financial anonymity. Payment System Efficiency: Speeding up domestic and cross-border payments, reducing transaction costs. Government Control & Programmability: Risk of central banks or governments imposing restrictions on how and when money can be spent. Monetary Policy Effectiveness: Offering new tools for central banks to implement monetary policy, such as direct stimulus or negative interest rates. Disintermediation of Commercial Banks: Threatening the business models of traditional banks if individuals move deposits to the central bank. Combating Illicit Finance: Increased traceability could help in fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. Cybersecurity Risks: Centralized digital infrastructure could become a single point of failure, vulnerable to cyberattacks. Maintaining Monetary Sovereignty: In an increasingly digital world, a CBDC could ensure a nation’s currency remains dominant amidst the rise of private digital currencies. Economic Instability: Potential for bank runs if, during a crisis, people shift funds from commercial banks to the safer CBDC. Why is the Trump Administration Taking Such a Decisive Stand Against CBDCs? The proposed stance by the Trump administration , articulated by figures like David Sacks, is not merely a technical policy decision but appears deeply rooted in a fundamental distrust of centralized digital control and a strong emphasis on individual liberty and financial privacy. Donald Trump himself has publicly stated his opposition to a U.S. CBDC, framing it as a threat to freedom. David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist and a close ally of Trump, has been particularly vocal on these issues. His perspective often aligns with a tech-libertarian viewpoint that champions decentralization and individual autonomy over government intervention. For Sacks and the potential Trump administration, the potential benefits of a CBDC are heavily outweighed by its inherent risks to civil liberties and the existing financial order. Key reasons underpinning this proposed blockade include: Profound Privacy Concerns: This is arguably the most significant driver. A CBDC could allow the government to monitor every single financial transaction made by its citizens. This level of granular oversight raises serious alarms about financial surveillance, the erosion of personal financial anonymity, and the potential for abuse of power. Imagine a scenario where the government could track your spending habits in real-time or even freeze your digital funds based on certain criteria. Fear of Government Overreach and “Programmable Money”: Critics argue that a CBDC grants excessive power to the central bank, potentially enabling direct control over citizens’ spending. The concept of “programmable money” – where the issuer could dictate how, when, or even if funds can be used (e.g., expiring funds, restrictions on certain purchases) – is a significant fear. This is seen as a direct assault on economic freedom. Protection of the Commercial Banking System: If individuals hold accounts directly with the central bank, it could bypass traditional commercial banks, disrupting their deposit base and lending capabilities. This disintermediation could destabilize the existing fractional reserve banking system, leading to unforeseen economic consequences. The administration may seek to protect the established financial infrastructure. Preservation of Physical Cash: There’s a strong sentiment within certain political factions to preserve physical cash as a bastion of privacy and freedom. They view CBDCs as a step towards a cashless society, which they believe could lead to greater government control and less individual autonomy. Ideological Alignment: This approach aligns with a broader conservative and libertarian philosophy that prioritizes market-driven innovation and individual choice over government-led digital finance initiatives. It’s a stance that resonates with a significant portion of the Republican base. Should Trump assume office, this opposition could manifest in various ways, from executive orders halting any CBDC development by the Federal Reserve to legislative efforts aimed at banning its issuance. This signals a clear intent to draw a line in the sand against what they perceive as an encroaching digital authoritarianism. The Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Markets: A Boon for Decentralization? This proposed policy by the Trump administration could have profound and perhaps unexpected implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. If the U.S. opts out of developing and issuing a CBDC, it could inadvertently bolster the case for decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which were fundamentally designed to operate outside central control. Potential Upside for Decentralized Crypto: Narrative Reinforcement: The “freedom money” and “permissionless” narratives of Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies could gain significant traction. If the alternative presented by a CBDC is perceived as government surveillance and control, users concerned about privacy might flock to truly decentralized solutions, seeing them as the only viable alternative. Increased Adoption: A U.S. CBDC block might encourage more individuals and institutions to explore and adopt existing cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This could lead to increased liquidity and market capitalization for these assets. Innovation Shift: Development efforts within the crypto space might further concentrate on privacy-enhancing technologies, self-custody solutions, and robust decentralized infrastructures, as these become even more valuable in a world wary of centralized digital currencies. Clearer Regulatory Landscape (Potentially): While the administration’s broader crypto stance remains to be fully defined, blocking CBDCs could simplify the regulatory debate by clearly demarcating “private” crypto from “state-issued” digital money. This could lead to more tailored and potentially more favorable regulations for the decentralized sector. Challenges and Nuances: While a CBDC block might seem unequivocally bullish for crypto, it doesn’t automatically mean a fully crypto-friendly regulatory environment across the board. The administration’s broader stance on stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, and crypto exchanges would still be crucial and could vary. The U.S. potentially falling behind on CBDC development could also raise questions about its future leadership in digital finance on a global scale, potentially ceding ground to nations that embrace digital currencies. The debate over the environmental impact of certain cryptocurrencies or their use in illicit activities would likely persist, regardless of the CBDC stance. Global Perspectives on Digital Currency Development: Is the U.S. Falling Behind or Leading a New Path? The U.S. approach, as articulated by the Trump administration, stands in stark contrast to many other nations actively exploring or even implementing a digital currency . This divergence highlights a global ideological split on the future of money and central bank roles in the digital age. Examples of Global CBDC Initiatives: China’s Digital Yuan (e-CNY): China is arguably the frontrunner, having extensively piloted its digital yuan across major cities and integrated it into daily life. Their motivations include improving payment efficiency, enhancing financial inclusion, combating illicit finance, and asserting geopolitical influence, often with less emphasis on individual privacy compared to Western concerns. Europe’s Digital Euro: The European Central Bank (ECB) is deep into its investigation phase for a digital euro, aiming to complement cash and offer a resilient payment system. The ECB has emphasized privacy safeguards and the importance of a “digital euro” to maintain monetary sovereignty in a rapidly digitizing world. Nigeria’s eNaira: Nigeria was one of the first countries to launch a live CBDC, the eNaira, in October 2021, aiming to boost financial inclusion and improve cross-border remittances. India’s Digital Rupee (e₹): India’s Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has launched pilot programs for both wholesale and retail versions of its digital rupee, focusing on efficiency and innovation in the payment system. United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, etc.: Many other nations are in various stages of research, consultation, and pilot programs, recognizing the potential benefits and challenges of CBDCs. This global landscape presents a complex picture. While some view CBDCs as an inevitable and necessary step for modernizing financial systems and maintaining competitive advantage, the Trump administration’s proposed block signals a strong pushback against this trend. It potentially positions the U.S. as a unique outlier, perhaps a defender of financial privacy and traditional monetary systems in a world seemingly rushing towards centralized digital cash. The question then becomes: Is the U.S. falling behind in the global race for digital currency innovation, or is it setting a new standard for protecting civil liberties in the digital age? The answer likely depends on one’s philosophical perspective on the role of government and technology. What Does This Mean for the Future of Central Bank Digital Currency in the U.S.? The proposed stance by the Trump administration creates significant uncertainty for the future of a central bank digital currency in the United States. While the Federal Reserve has been researching a potential digital dollar, publishing extensive papers and engaging in public discussions, its ultimate implementation would require strong political backing from both the executive and legislative branches. This announcement clearly undermines that backing. Key Questions and Challenges Arise: Political Feasibility: Even if a CBDC is deemed technologically feasible and economically beneficial by some, its political viability under a potentially hostile administration would be virtually nil. This could lead to a multi-year hiatus on any official U.S. CBDC development. Global Leadership: How will the U.S. maintain its global financial leadership and influence without a CBDC, especially as other nations advance their own digital currencies? Will this lead to a fragmentation of the global financial system, or will it force other nations to reconsider their own approaches? Rise of Private Alternatives: Could this void be filled by private stablecoins, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar but issued by private entities? The debate around stablecoin regulation would become even more critical, as they could effectively become the de facto “digital dollar” for many users. This could present new challenges related to systemic risk and consumer protection. Innovation and Competitiveness: Will a lack of a U.S. CBDC hinder innovation in payment systems, or will it spur greater private sector innovation in areas like instant payments, blockchain-based settlements, and decentralized finance? This policy move is not just about blocking a specific technology; it’s about defining the philosophical boundaries of government involvement in the financial lives of citizens. It sets up a fascinating ideological battleground that will likely dominate financial policy discussions for years to come, forcing a deeper societal conversation about privacy, control, and the very nature of money in a digital era. Conclusion: A Decisive Turn in the Digital Currency Debate The Trump administration’s explicit intent to block central bank digital currencies marks a pivotal and potentially transformative moment in the ongoing debate over the future of money. By prioritizing privacy, individual liberty, and limiting perceived government control, this proposed policy could reshape the landscape for traditional finance and provide an unexpected, yet significant, boost to decentralized cryptocurrencies. While much of the world appears to be moving towards exploring or even implementing CBDCs, the U.S. under a potential Trump presidency could forge a distinct and solitary path. This stance champions financial freedom and directly challenges the very notion of state-issued digital cash as an inevitable progression. The implications for global financial leadership, the evolution of payment systems, and the future trajectory of the broader crypto market are immense. This is a development that demands close attention from anyone invested in the evolving world of digital assets, as it promises to be one of the defining financial policy decisions of the coming years.

This bold Ethereum Price Prediction comes from Eric Jackson, the founder of Toronto-based hedge fund EMJ Capital, and it’s certainly capturing attention across the market. Could ETH truly reach such heights, or is this just another speculative call? Jackson’s insights suggest a confluence of powerful factors could indeed propel Ethereum to unprecedented levels. Let’s dive into the core arguments fueling this optimistic outlook. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is a $10,000 ETH Surge Truly Attainable? Eric Jackson’s confidence in a $10,000 Ethereum Price Prediction isn’t merely based on market sentiment. According to CoinDesk, his analysis points to several fundamental shifts and upcoming events that he believes the market is significantly underestimating. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding these drivers is key to evaluating the potential trajectory of ETH. It’s a target that, if realized, would mark a substantial increase from current levels and solidify Ethereum’s position as a dominant force in the digital economy. Jackson highlights four primary catalysts that he believes will converge to create a powerful upward momentum for ETH: Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Staking Approval: A major institutional gateway. Deflationary Token Economy Post-Merge: A fundamental supply-side shift. Increased Layer-2 Transaction Fees: Driving utility and ETH burn. Increased Tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs): Expanding Ethereum’s utility into traditional finance. Each of these factors, individually strong, becomes even more potent when considered together, creating a compelling narrative for Ethereum’s future valuation. The Catalytic Impact of ETH ETF Approval: An Underestimated Force? One of the most anticipated events in the crypto space is the approval of an ETH ETF . While several spot Ethereum ETFs have recently been approved for trading in the U.S., Jackson’s focus is specifically on the prospect of an ETF with staking capabilities , which he anticipates by October of this year. This distinction is crucial. What does an ETH ETF , particularly one with staking, mean for Ethereum? Currently, investors who want to earn staking rewards on their ETH must hold the asset directly and participate in the staking mechanism, which can be complex for traditional institutional investors. An ETF with staking would: Simplify Access: Allow institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to ETH and its staking yield through traditional brokerage accounts. Increase Demand: Attract a massive wave of new capital from pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers who prefer regulated, easily tradable products. Reduce Supply Pressure: ETH acquired by the ETF for staking would be locked up, reducing the circulating supply available for sale on exchanges. Jackson argues that the market is currently underestimating the sheer volume of capital that could flow into Ethereum once such a product is available. The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year provides a compelling precedent, demonstrating the significant demand from traditional finance for regulated crypto investment vehicles. The Power of Scarcity: Understanding Deflationary Ethereum Following its monumental shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with The Merge, Ethereum underwent a significant change in its tokenomics, moving towards a Deflationary Ethereum model. This is a critical, often misunderstood, aspect of its value proposition. How does Ethereum become deflationary? The mechanism primarily involves two key components: EIP-1559 (London Hard Fork): Introduced a base fee for every transaction on the Ethereum network, which is burned (permanently removed from circulation) instead of going to miners. This means that a portion of every transaction fee effectively reduces the ETH supply. Proof-of-Stake (The Merge): Replaced energy-intensive mining with staking. Stakers are rewarded with newly minted ETH, but the amount of new ETH issued is significantly less than what was previously issued to miners. When network activity is high, the amount of ETH burned via EIP-1559 can exceed the new ETH issued through staking, leading to a net reduction in the total ETH supply. This dynamic creates a scenario where ETH can become a scarce asset, similar to how a commodity becomes more valuable as its supply diminishes while demand remains constant or grows. A truly Deflationary Ethereum , where more ETH is burned than created, means that each remaining ETH becomes inherently more valuable over time, assuming consistent network usage. Fueling Growth: How Layer-2 Scaling Boosts ETH Utility and Value The rapid expansion of Layer-2 Scaling solutions is another cornerstone of Jackson’s bullish thesis. Layer-2 networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon, are built on top of the Ethereum mainnet (Layer-1) to process transactions more efficiently and at lower costs. Why are Layer-2s so important for ETH’s value? Increased Network Throughput: Layer-2s alleviate congestion on the mainnet, allowing Ethereum to handle a much larger volume of transactions than it could alone. This scalability is vital for mass adoption. Lower Transaction Fees: By bundling many Layer-2 transactions into a single transaction on Layer-1, these solutions drastically reduce costs for users, making the Ethereum ecosystem more accessible and attractive for everyday use. Direct Contribution to ETH Burn: While transactions occur on Layer-2s, they periodically ‘settle’ or ‘batch’ their data back to the Layer-1 Ethereum blockchain. These settlement transactions incur fees on Layer-1, which are subject to EIP-1559 and thus contribute to the burning of ETH. More Layer-2 activity means more Layer-1 settlement, leading to more ETH burned. Ecosystem Growth: Robust Layer-2 Scaling fosters innovation and expands the range of applications built on Ethereum, from DeFi to NFTs and gaming, driving overall demand for the network’s native token. The growth of Layer-2s is a symbiotic relationship: they enhance Ethereum’s utility, and in turn, their increased usage contributes directly to the deflationary pressure on ETH. RWA Tokenization: Unlocking New Frontiers for Ethereum’s Dominance Perhaps one of the most transformative trends highlighted by Jackson is the burgeoning field of RWA Tokenization , or Real World Asset Tokenization. This involves converting rights to physical or tangible assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, with Ethereum emerging as a leading platform for this innovation. What does RWA Tokenization entail? Imagine owning a fractional share of a skyscraper, a piece of fine art, or a government bond, all represented by a token on the Ethereum blockchain. Examples include: Real Estate: Fractional ownership of properties, making illiquid assets more accessible and tradable. Bonds and Securities: Issuing digital bonds that offer faster settlement, increased transparency, and programmable features. Commodities: Tokenizing gold, silver, or other raw materials, simplifying their transfer and storage. Intellectual Property: Tokenizing music rights, patents, or copyrights. Why is Ethereum the blockchain of choice for RWAs? Security and Decentralization: Ethereum’s robust security and decentralized nature make it a trustworthy ledger for valuable assets. Smart Contract Capabilities: Its programmable smart contracts enable complex legal agreements and automated processes to be embedded directly into the tokens. Established Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community, extensive tooling, and a vast network effect, making it a reliable foundation for institutional-grade applications. The market for tokenized RWAs is projected to reach trillions of dollars in the coming years. As more traditional assets migrate onto the Ethereum blockchain, the demand for ETH (for gas fees, collateral, or even as a base layer for these new financial instruments) is expected to surge dramatically, cementing Ethereum’s role as the foundational layer for the future of finance. Challenges and Considerations for the Road Ahead While the arguments for a $10,000 ETH are compelling, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Several factors could influence Ethereum’s journey: Regulatory Environment: Evolving regulations worldwide could impact the adoption of ETFs, Layer-2s, and RWA tokenization. Macroeconomic Conditions: Broader economic downturns, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events can affect investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Competition: While Ethereum holds a dominant position, other Layer-1 blockchains continue to innovate and compete for market share. Technical Risks: Although Ethereum’s network is robust, any unforeseen technical issues or security vulnerabilities could impact confidence. Investors should always conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with digital assets. This article provides analysis based on current information and expert opinion and should not be considered financial advice. Actionable Insights for Navigating Ethereum’s Potential Future For those looking to understand or participate in the Ethereum ecosystem, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments regarding ETH ETF approvals, Layer-2 innovations, and major RWA tokenization projects. Understand the Fundamentals: Grasping concepts like deflationary tokenomics and the role of Layer-2s provides a clearer picture of Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Consider Diversification: As with any investment, diversification across different assets can help mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and be prepared for significant price fluctuations inherent in the crypto market. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Path to New Heights? Eric Jackson’s $10,000 Ethereum Price Prediction is not just a bold statement; it’s a synthesis of powerful, interconnected trends shaping the future of digital finance. The potential approval of an ETH ETF with staking, coupled with the inherent scarcity of Deflationary Ethereum , the scalability offered by Layer-2 Scaling , and the transformative impact of RWA Tokenization , paints a compelling picture for Ethereum’s future. While the path ahead may be volatile, the fundamental drivers suggest that Ethereum is poised for a significant expansion of its utility and value. The coming months will be critical in determining if these catalysts can indeed unleash the projected surge and solidify Ethereum’s place as a cornerstone of the global economy.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As East Asia begins its business day, bitcoin is down 1.8%, trading above $117,800, as traders take some profit after BTC pushed through multiple all-time highs. While there's a belief from some market participants that the rally is just beginning, with calls for BTC to hit 160k , 200k , and further , OKX's Chief Commercial Officer, Lennex Lai warns that risk is building just as fast as market enthusiasm. ""Across platforms, we're seeing an increase in aggressive long positions and widening funding rates as ‘Crypto Week’ headlines boost sentiment,"" Lai told CoinDesk in an interview via Telegram. ""At these levels, risks can build quickly - escalation of trade tensions with the EU, Mexico, and other trading partners could trigger sharp corrections. Another risk is letting euphoria drive decisions."" Lai points to a slate of coming macro announcements – like the U.K. CPI release, and the U.S Core PPI, retail sales, and consumer sentiment, that could influence global risk sentiment and set the tone for broader markets. These concerns echo findings from K33 Research’s H1 2025 market report , which highlighted similar risks and volatility triggers earlier this year. According to K33, geopolitical turmoil and trade policy uncertainty have already driven significant market swings, such as a 30% correction to $75,000 earlier in the year. The report specifically noted, ""Bitcoin struggled in this de-risking period but showed subtle hints of relative strength vs equities by outperforming equities in the aftermath of Liberation Day."" Additionally, K33 highlighted historically low funding rates amidst rising prices, signaling cautious sentiment among seasoned traders who remain wary of abrupt market reversals. ""Annualized funding rates averaged at 4.51% throughout the half-year, the lowest average half-year funding rate since December 31, 2022,"" when the post-FTX crypto winter was at its coldest, the report said. ""In moments like this, smart traders focus on strategy over sentiment, using discipline to manage risk,"" Lai continued. ""The excitement at the top is real, but those who manage their entries, exits, and funding exposure carefully are best positioned for whatever comes next."" After all, he concluded, ""strong momentum doesn’t mean the market is invincible.""

A surge of over $100 million in new deposits this week pushed Maple’s total assets under management (AUM) to $2.9 billion, eclipsing BUIDL’s $2.3 billion. While BUIDL draws capital with its ultra-conservative exposure to short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, Maple appeals to more risk-tolerant institutions by offering yield through undercollateralized loans to vetted trading firms and crypto-native borrowers. That model, which relies on delegated credit underwriting rather than blanket overcollateralization, now appears to be scaling faster. The milestone suggests a growing appetite for yield-bearing DeFi credit products amid continued macro uncertainty. It also marks a rare instance where a decentralized credit protocol has outpaced a major TradFi incumbent like BlackRock on-chain, at least by raw AUM. AI Tokens Rally as Big Tech Doubles Down on Infrastructure AI-focused crypto tokens jumped 5% overnight, pushing the sector’s market cap to $29.6 billion, according to CoinGecko . The move comes amid a surge of AI and data infrastructure announcements from major U.S. tech firms, sparking renewed investor enthusiasm across both equity and token markets. Google said Tuesday it will invest $25 billion into data centers and AI infrastructure across the PJM electric grid, America’s largest, while also agreeing to buy 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power via a $3 billion deal with Brookfield. Meta, meanwhile, is planning “hundreds of billions” in AI data center builds, including a multi-gigawatt facility called Prometheus in Ohio. The announcements were timed around a Trump administration-led summit at Carnegie Mellon University, where over $90 billion in AI, energy, and data infrastructure pledges were revealed. The bullish tone on AI, from both government and industry, appears to be spilling into token markets, at least for now. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $117,810.33, down 1.69%, and failed breakout attempts gave way to high-volume support, narrowing consolidation, and thinning liquidity, signaling market exhaustion and anticipation ahead of the next macro catalyst, according to CoinDesk's Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum surged 2.6% to $3,066.57 in a volatile 24-hour session, rebounding from a $2,933.50 low as institutional flows, record staking, and strong volume fueled a breakout past $3,075, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Gold: Gold fell 0.56% to $3,331.55, even as a new London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) poll showed analysts turning more bullish with upgraded 2025 forecasts averaging $3,324.40—driven by geopolitical tensions, dollar weakness, and fiscal concerns, though opinions remain split on whether prices will climb toward $4,000 or fade into year-end. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets are set to open mixed after President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that includes a 19% U.S. tariff on its exports. S&P 500: The S&P 500 edged 0.4% lower after touching an intraday record, as rising Treasury yields and a 2.7% June inflation reading raised concerns over tariff-driven price pressures, despite strong bank earnings and Nvidia-led tech gains.

This groundbreaking news, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, signals a potentially transformative shift in how traditional finance views and integrates with the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem. What does this mean for the future of money, and why is a banking giant stepping into the realm of digital currencies? What Does Citigroup’s Stablecoin Exploration Mean for the Market? For years, the narrative around cryptocurrencies often pitted decentralized digital assets against centralized financial institutions. However, Citigroup’s reported consideration of a stablecoin changes that dynamic significantly. A stablecoin, by definition, is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to a commodity. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to offer the benefits of blockchain technology—speed, transparency, and lower transaction costs—without the price fluctuations. Citigroup’s foray into this space isn’t just another bank experimenting with blockchain; it represents a major vote of confidence from a systemic financial player. This move could: Legitimize Digital Assets: A Citigroup-backed stablecoin would bring institutional credibility to the stablecoin market, potentially accelerating broader adoption by corporations and other financial entities. Streamline Payments: Imagine instant, low-cost cross-border payments for businesses and individuals, leveraging blockchain rails instead of traditional correspondent banking networks. Open New Avenues for Innovation: It could pave the way for new financial products and services built on top of a reliable, institutionally-backed digital currency. The potential launch of a Citigroup stablecoin isn’t merely a technical endeavor; it’s a strategic move that could redefine how value is transferred and settled in the global economy. The Rise of Bank Stablecoins: A Paradigm Shift? Citigroup is not alone in recognizing the strategic importance of digital currencies. The concept of a bank stablecoin has been gaining traction, with various financial institutions and consortia exploring similar initiatives. JP Morgan’s JPM Coin, for instance, launched in 2019, serves as a wholesale payment token used for internal settlement within its blockchain-based network. This illustrates a growing trend where banks are no longer just observing the crypto space but actively participating in its evolution. Why are banks increasingly interested in stablecoins? Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Traditional payment systems are often slow, expensive, and complex, especially for international transactions. Stablecoins, built on blockchain, can offer near-instant settlement and significantly lower operational costs. Improved Liquidity Management: Banks can use stablecoins to manage their own liquidity more effectively, allowing for 24/7 operations and real-time reconciliation. New Business Models: The underlying technology can enable tokenized assets, smart contracts, and other innovative financial instruments, creating new revenue streams and services. This shift from a purely speculative asset class to a functional tool for financial infrastructure marks a pivotal moment. The embrace of a bank stablecoin by a titan like Citigroup could set a precedent for other global banks, fostering a new era of interbank digital currency exchange. Institutional Crypto Adoption: Paving the Way for Mainstream Integration The news about Citigroup underscores a broader, undeniable trend: institutional crypto adoption is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. What was once considered a fringe asset class is now becoming a legitimate component of investment portfolios, corporate treasuries, and financial infrastructure. This growing acceptance is driven by several factors: Factor Impact on Institutional Adoption Regulatory Clarity As governments and regulatory bodies begin to establish clearer frameworks, institutions gain confidence to participate. Technological Maturity Blockchain technology has matured, offering more robust, scalable, and secure solutions for institutional use cases. Client Demand High-net-worth individuals, corporations, and even retail clients are increasingly demanding access to digital asset services. Macroeconomic Factors Concerns about inflation and traditional asset performance are pushing institutions to explore alternative investments. Beyond stablecoins, institutions are exploring various facets of the crypto market, including Bitcoin ETFs, tokenized securities, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Citigroup’s move is a powerful indicator that the world’s financial heavyweights are not just dipping their toes but preparing to dive deep into the digital asset ocean. This level of institutional crypto adoption is crucial for bringing digital assets into the mainstream financial system, potentially bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. Digital Currency Innovation Beyond Bitcoin: The Stablecoin Spectrum While Bitcoin pioneered the concept of digital currency, the landscape of digital currency innovation has expanded dramatically. Stablecoins represent a significant branch of this evolution, offering stability that Bitcoin’s volatility does not. They come in various forms, each with its own mechanism for maintaining stability: Fiat-backed Stablecoins: These are the most common, like USDT, USDC, and potentially Citigroup’s stablecoin. They are backed 1:1 by reserves of fiat currency held in traditional bank accounts. Crypto-backed Stablecoins: Over-collateralized by other cryptocurrencies, such as MakerDAO’s DAI. Algorithmic Stablecoins: Maintain their peg through algorithms that adjust supply and demand, though these have faced significant challenges. It’s also important to distinguish bank-issued stablecoins from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). While both are digital forms of money, a CBDC is issued and controlled by a central bank (e.g., a digital dollar issued by the Federal Reserve), whereas a bank stablecoin is issued by a commercial bank. The former is sovereign money, the latter is commercial bank money. Both represent strides in digital currency innovation , but serve different purposes within the financial ecosystem. Citigroup’s stablecoin would operate within the commercial banking sphere, offering a new digital rail for its clients. Navigating the Financial Future: Challenges and Opportunities The journey towards a more digital financial future , particularly with the introduction of bank-issued stablecoins, is not without its hurdles. While the opportunities are immense, understanding the challenges is crucial for successful integration: Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite increasing clarity, the global regulatory landscape for stablecoins remains fragmented and evolving. Banks need clear guidelines on everything from anti-money laundering (AML) to consumer protection. Interoperability: Ensuring that a Citigroup stablecoin can seamlessly interact with other digital assets, blockchain networks, and traditional financial systems is a complex technical challenge. Scalability and Performance: For a global bank, any digital currency solution must be able to handle millions of transactions per second without compromising speed or security. Cybersecurity Risks: Digital assets are attractive targets for cybercriminals. Robust security measures are paramount to protect customer funds and maintain trust. Public Perception: Overcoming skepticism and educating the broader public about the benefits and safety of stablecoins will be an ongoing effort. Opportunities: Enhanced Global Trade: Stablecoins can dramatically reduce the friction and cost of international trade, benefiting businesses of all sizes. Financial Inclusion: By lowering transaction costs and increasing accessibility, stablecoins could potentially bring more unbanked populations into the formal financial system. New Market Creation: The ability to tokenize real-world assets (real estate, art, commodities) opens up vast new markets for investment and fractional ownership. Competitive Advantage: Banks that embrace digital currency innovation early can gain a significant competitive edge in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. For businesses and investors, the actionable insight is clear: stay informed, understand the evolving regulatory environment, and explore how these digital tools can be leveraged for efficiency and growth. The path to the financial future is being paved by these pioneering moves. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Global Finance Citigroup’s exploration of a stablecoin launch is far more than just a headline; it’s a profound signal of the ongoing convergence between traditional finance and the digital asset world. This move, if realized, would not only solidify the role of bank-issued stablecoins but also significantly accelerate institutional crypto adoption , pushing the boundaries of digital currency innovation . As major players like Citigroup commit to exploring this space, the vision of a more efficient, interconnected, and inclusive financial future powered by blockchain technology moves closer to reality. The implications for global payments, capital markets, and even everyday transactions are immense, promising a truly revolutionary shift in how we perceive and interact with money.

The renewed push has raised fears that political interference at the US central bank could spark long-term inflation and disrupt the economy. President Trump has consistently lashed out at Powell for not cutting rates repeatedly since he returned to the White House in January. His recent comments have gone even further, suggesting that Powell should step down and suggesting that he has acted to sabotage the US economy by keeping interest rates too high. Trump said that Powell’s resignation “would be a great thing” as he expressed frustration with the Fed’s refusal to lower rates, even as signals of weakening global growth are picking up. And while the president does not have the legal power to remove the Fed chair over policy disputes, his aggressive public pressure campaign has prompted speculation about a more sustained effort to meddle with the traditionally independent institution. Trump’s repeated attacks have undermined investor confidence and left many worried that a politicized Fed might lose the resolve to fight inflation in favor of providing a temporary economic boost. Markets hedge against inflation fears The financial markets have answered with one clear statement: investors are bracing for higher inflation. The yield on longer-dated US Treasury bonds has risen, indicating expectations that future interest rates will rise as inflation starts to creep up. However, analysts caution that if Trump persuades the central bank to cut rates too soon, it could trigger an overheating economy. “If markets believe that a politically-captured Fed will lower rates to stimulate growth regardless of economic consequences, long-term inflation expectations will rise, causing the curve to steepen,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at asset manager Janney Capital Management. It was difficult to predict the exact scale of the market reaction. Still, he believed the move could be significant, measured in percentage-point increases in 30-year Treasury yields rather than basis points. A steepening yield curve is of particular concern to homeowners and businesses when long-term borrowing costs rise more rapidly than short-term borrowing. Rising rates on 30-year mortgages, car loans, and corporate bonds would raise borrowing costs, crimp household budgets, and squeeze corporate profits. The dollar has also begun to wobble. The greenback fell against most other major currencies as investors anticipated looser monetary policy. Looser money tends to weaken the dollar, making imports more expensive, which throws fuel onto the fire of inflationary pressures that Trump’s trade tariffs have lit. Wall Street economists rise to the defense of Fed independence The reaction on Wall Street and across the broader business community to Trump’s campaign has been swift. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a strong warning , emphasizing that central bank independence is essential for economic stability. During a Tuesday investor call, he cautioned that undermining this independence could lead to serious, unintended consequences . Other economists agree. Most say that the Feds’ credibility lies in their ability to act without being swayed by political pressure. Suppose the markets believe that the Fed is caving to the White House. In that case, the potential for volatility is not limited to bonds, but could ripple through stocks, commodities, and various global currencies. Minutes of the Fed’s June 17–18 meeting, released last week, provided little support for a rate cut when the central bank meets next on July 29–30. Most policymakers were concerned about inflationary risks, specifically the inflationary risks posed by Trump’s protectionist trade policies. And with tariffs still in effect on tens of billions of dollars’ worth of goods, inflation pressures are already simmering. However, instead of heeding the warnings, Trump and his aides have doubled down. In recent weeks, top officials have gone on financial news programs and social media, repeating calls for lower interest rates and saying Powell should resign if he won’t bend.

Recently, a pivotal revelation from Unfolded on X highlighted how a strategic entity has significantly amplified its Bitcoin holdings , now accounting for a staggering 3% of the total circulating supply. This isn’t just another purchase; it’s a monumental statement on the future of digital assets. Unveiling the Strategic Accumulation of Bitcoin Holdings The entity in question, widely recognized as MicroStrategy, has once again demonstrated its unwavering conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Their latest acquisition of 4,225 more BTC has propelled their total Bitcoin holdings to an astounding 601,550 BTC. This move isn’t merely about adding more coins to a portfolio; it signifies a deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role as a premier treasury asset. To put this into perspective, owning 3% of the entire circulating Bitcoin holdings means MicroStrategy now controls a substantial piece of the finite 21 million BTC supply. This level of accumulation by a publicly traded company is unprecedented and sends a clear signal to both traditional finance and the broader crypto market about the potential of digital gold. It solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as a trailblazer, continuously expanding its digital reserves and influencing the narrative around corporate treasury strategies. The Profound Impact on BTC Supply and Market Dynamics What does it mean when a single entity secures such a significant portion of the finite BTC supply ? The implications are far-reaching. Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity is one of its most powerful attributes. With only 21 million coins ever to be mined, every significant accumulation reduces the available supply for new entrants and existing holders. This creates a supply shock dynamic that can exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price over time. MicroStrategy’s strategy effectively ‘locks up’ a substantial amount of Bitcoin, removing it from active trading circulation and placing it into long-term strategic reserves. This reduced liquidity, coupled with increasing demand from both retail and institutional investors, can create a powerful bullish feedback loop. Here’s how such a large holding impacts the BTC supply : Reduced Liquidity: A significant portion of Bitcoin is held off-market, limiting the number of coins available for buying and selling. Increased Scarcity: Reinforces Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ narrative, highlighting its fixed supply against endless fiat currency printing. Price Floor Effect: Large, conviction-based holdings can act as a psychological price floor, as these holders are unlikely to sell into dips. Market Confidence: Signals strong belief in Bitcoin’s future from a major corporate player, encouraging others. MicroStrategy Bitcoin: A Pioneering Investment Philosophy The journey of MicroStrategy Bitcoin accumulation began in August 2020, spearheaded by its visionary co-founder and former CEO, Michael Saylor. Saylor’s unwavering conviction in Bitcoin as a superior store of value and an inflation hedge transformed MicroStrategy from a business intelligence firm into a de facto Bitcoin proxy. Their approach has been anything but conventional, opting to use various financial instruments, including convertible notes and equity offerings, to fund their aggressive purchases. Why has MicroStrategy taken such an audacious stance? Their philosophy centers on the belief that traditional fiat currencies are depreciating assets due to inflation and expansive monetary policies. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and fixed supply, offers a robust alternative. The benefits for MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy are multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: Protects corporate treasury from the erosion of purchasing power. Capital Appreciation: Positions the company to benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term price growth. Investor Attraction: Appeals to a new class of investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company. Competitive Advantage: Differentiates MicroStrategy in the market, making it a unique investment proposition. However, this bold strategy isn’t without its challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin means MicroStrategy’s balance sheet is subject to significant fluctuations, which can impact its stock price. Regulatory uncertainties and public scrutiny also remain ongoing concerns. Yet, MicroStrategy has consistently navigated these waters, doubling down on its conviction with each market cycle. The Broader Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s pioneering moves have undeniably paved the way for wider institutional Bitcoin adoption . What was once considered a niche, speculative asset is now increasingly being recognized by mainstream financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has further legitimized Bitcoin as an asset class, making it more accessible to traditional investors. We are witnessing a significant shift in how large entities view Bitcoin. Beyond MicroStrategy, various hedge funds, asset managers, and even some pension funds are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This growing trend is driven by several factors: Diversification: Bitcoin offers a low correlation to traditional assets, providing portfolio diversification benefits. Digital Gold Narrative: Its appeal as a ‘digital gold’ alternative to physical gold, particularly among younger generations. Technological Innovation: Recognition of blockchain technology’s disruptive potential. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Increasing clarity and frameworks make it safer for institutions to participate. Are we on the cusp of a new era of corporate treasury management where Bitcoin becomes a standard component? The actions of MicroStrategy certainly suggest a strong possibility, setting a precedent that others may eventually follow as the digital economy continues to evolve. Navigating Your Own Bitcoin Investment Journey For individual investors, the aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy employed by MicroStrategy offers valuable insights, though it’s crucial to remember that corporate strategies differ significantly from personal financial planning. While most individuals won’t be leveraging debt to buy Bitcoin, the core principles of conviction and a long-term outlook are highly relevant. What lessons can individual investors glean from this corporate titan’s playbook? Here are a few actionable insights for your own Bitcoin investment journey: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technology, and market dynamics before investing. Long-Term Conviction: Bitcoin’s history shows significant volatility. A long-term perspective can help weather market fluctuations. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This can smooth out your average purchase price. Secure Your Assets: Learn about self-custody options like hardware wallets to protect your Bitcoin. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin, while promising, remains a volatile asset. MicroStrategy’s bold moves underscore the growing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin within the financial world. Their strategy highlights the potential for significant gains but also the need for a robust, well-thought-out approach to Bitcoin investment . A Legacy of Conviction: Bitcoin’s Enduring Appeal The recent boost in MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings to 3% of the circulating BTC supply is more than just a news headline; it’s a testament to a pioneering MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy that continues to shape the landscape of institutional Bitcoin adoption . This relentless accumulation reinforces Bitcoin’s scarcity and its growing role as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainties. As the digital asset space matures, MicroStrategy’s unwavering commitment serves as a powerful case study, encouraging a deeper look into the long-term potential of Bitcoin investment . Their actions not only validate Bitcoin’s position as a formidable asset but also challenge conventional treasury management, paving the way for a more digitally-native financial future.

She emphasized that a suitable trade agreement must be reached by the August 1 deadline. The announcement came after it pledged to impose a 30% tariff threat on the country’s imports to the US, that is, if it failed to succeed in its mission to put an end to drug cartels. In a statement, Sheinbaum clarified their motive, stating that they only need a fair agreement with the US. According to her, if it fails to provide one by August 1, they will be forced to take steps that they will inform them about. Mexico-US trade agreement faces growing uncertainties amid Trump’s tariff threats Washington had earlier announced plans to impose a 17% duty on fresh tomatoes imported to the US from Mexico. This did not please Mexico’s president. Respondingly, Sheinbaum hoped to make known the measures the country would take, including for tomato farmers, to counter the tariff threat. Sheibaum stated that they believed they could reach an agreement with the US. However, based on her argument, it was essential to have a backup plan since they needed to get ready for all possibilities. Notably, Mexico is pivotal in importing fresh tomatoes to the US. According to data from sources, the country imports approximately two-thirds of the fresh tomatoes consumed in the US. In the meantime, the US Commerce Department announced a cancellation of a 2019 trade agreement with Mexico that ended an investigation on Mexico’s countervailing duty. This amounted to a valuation of $3 billion of Mexican exports to the US annually. Mexico’s tomato export agreement was first made in 1996, whereby the two governments vowed to control it and resolve US allegations against Mexico concerning “unfair trade” practices. The agreement was updated six years ago to stop an investigation into dumping and settle tariff issues. On the other hand, Trump is still focused on striking as many trade deals as possible, and he pledges to impose his threatening tariffs on nearly all of his trading partners. Mexico vows that no other country can substitute Mexican tomatoes in the US market Following the US’s assertion to withdraw from the tomato agreement with Mexico, Mexico demonstrated strong confidence in renewing the agreement. The economy and agriculture ministries considered the 17.09% duty on Mexican tomatoes imported to the United States unfairly “underpriced.” Based on their argument, it did not favour Mexican producers and the US industry’s interests. To curb this, the Mexican government intends to support its tomato farmers and expand its market overseas as it negotiates a deal to strip out the tomato duty. A coalition of five Mexican agriculture associations, including representatives from Baja California and Sinaloa states, said they would work with the Mexican government to develop more solutions to the problem. They acknowledged that no other country can substitute Mexican tomatoes in the market, which they have developed through hard work and creativity over the last 120 years. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick shared his view on the topic of discussion. According to Lutnick, unfair trade practices have hurt their farmers by lowering the prices of their crops, such as tomatoes. Trump reveals plans to impose a 10% tariff rate on smaller US trade partners US President Donald Trump recently announced that letters with trade agreement terms and tariff rates will be sent to smaller US trade partners before the August 1 deadline. He hinted at a 10% tariff rate on these countries. After attending an event in Pittsburgh, Trump mentioned that he was pleased with simple agreements. This came after the announcement unveiled that nearly 20 nations have already been subjected to tariff rates, as other countries were next in line. Afterward, Trump said they would send out a letter soon addressing tariff rates for several smaller countries. According to him, they will likely establish one tariff for all of them, probably just above 10%.

This came only hours after Scott himself said he’d be “happy to do it” if asked. The timing was insane. One moment, the Treasury Secretary was on Bloomberg TV talking like a front-runner. The next, Trump shut it down in front of reporters, saying Scott isn’t at the top of his list. His reason ? “Because I like the job he’s doing.” The blunt rejection also came after Scott had already confirmed that a “formal process” had begun to find a Jerome Powell replacement. Scott even admitted he’s part of that process and said, “It’s President Trump’s decision, and it will move at his speed.” Well, it did. Scott reacts, but Trump drags Powell instead Earlier that same day, Scott had taken shots at Powell in that Bloomberg interview. He said Powell should step down from the Fed entirely when his chair term ends in May 2026. Scott argued that keeping Powell around past that date would send the wrong signal. “There’s been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion,” Scott said. “And I can tell you, I think it’d be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on also.” Scott was making a clear pitch for a clean break, pushing the idea that the next Fed chair should start fresh, with no Powell hanging around to cloud the waters. It’s worth noting that Powell’s term as a Fed governor doesn’t end until January 2028. That gives him the legal option to stay at the central bank for almost two full years after stepping down as chair, nearly till the end of Trump’s term. But Trump isn’t even waiting that long. He’s pissed about the whole renovation saga at the Federal Reserve’s headquarters. “I think he’s a total stiff,” Trump told reporters about Powell. “But the one thing I didn’t see him as is the guy that needed a palace to live in.” He also called the cost overruns “pretty disgraceful,” hinting it could be a fireable offense. Powell’s side of the story says the media reports were inaccurate. This week, he even requested the bank’s Inspector General to investigate the matter. Doesn’t seem to matter. Trump’s already decided Powell doesn’t belong in that seat anymore. He’s said before that Powell keeps rates too high. And he’s made it very clear he wants someone who’s ready to slash them. Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh lead the race With Scott now pushed to the side, Trump’s pick seems to be leaning toward Kevin Hassett or Kevin Warsh. Reports say the two are front-runners in what one White House insider called an “Apprentice-style” contest. Yes, that’s real. Apparently , Trump is running this whole thing like a reality show. Scott is advising on the selection, but it’s obvious now that his name’s been scratched off the list unless everyone else fails. Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, has been in Trump’s orbit for a while now. He used to be seen as a moderate economist with a neutral political stance, but that’s so over now. These days, he is a full-blown MAGA mouthpiece. He goes on TV echoing all of Trump’s views, whether it’s on inflation, interest rates, or tariffs. He also hasn’t been shy about attacking Powell either. Just this month on Fox Business, he slammed the Fed for lowering rates before last year’s election and then holding them steady because of tariff-driven inflation risks. “I think that that raises the specter that they’re not being non-partisan, they’re not being independent,” Hassett said. Warsh, on the other hand, has kept a lower profile but is still a serious name in the mix. He’s a former Fed governor, and Trump is reportedly impressed with him. He’s not out there doing interviews, but insiders say his name keeps coming up. Still, it’s Hassett who’s making the most noise. Scott did say that there are “a lot of great candidates,” but now it’s obvious he’s not one of them. That “I’ll do it if asked” moment is now just another quote in the press cycle. Trump slammed the door right after he cracked it open. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This bombshell announcement sends ripples through traditional financial markets and inevitably sparks discussions within the cryptocurrency space, where market sentiment is highly sensitive to shifts in economic leadership and policy. Such a direct challenge to the Fed’s top official highlights growing discontent over current economic strategies and could signal significant turbulence ahead for investors across all asset classes. Who is William Pulte and What’s His Concern for the Housing Market? To understand the weight of this call, it’s crucial to know who William Pulte is and the role of the FHFA. As the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Pulte oversees crucial entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are central to the U.S. housing finance system. His agency’s primary mission is to ensure the stability and liquidity of the housing market, a sector that has been particularly sensitive to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions over the past few years. Pulte’s concerns likely stem from the direct impact of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes on housing affordability and market activity. Higher interest rates translate to more expensive mortgages, cooling demand, and potentially stressing homeowners and the broader real estate sector. Given his mandate, it’s natural for Pulte to voice strong opinions when he perceives policies are undermining the stability of the very market he is tasked to protect. This direct intervention underscores a deep-seated apprehension regarding the current trajectory of the economy and the Fed’s role in it, particularly as it pertains to the foundational housing sector. The Unprecedented Call for Jerome Powell’s Resignation The call for Jerome Powell to step down is not just a political statement; it’s a rare and potent critique from within the upper echelons of U.S. financial leadership. While criticism of the Fed Chair is not uncommon, an outright demand for resignation from a sitting agency head is highly unusual and signals a significant fracture in the perceived unity of economic policymakers. This public challenge indicates that the disagreements are profound, extending beyond mere policy differences to a fundamental distrust in leadership or strategy. The specifics of Pulte’s reasoning, beyond general discontent with economic conditions, would likely center on the efficacy and consequences of the Federal Reserve’s actions. Was it the pace of rate hikes? The communication strategy? Or perhaps a perceived misjudgment of inflation’s persistence? Whatever the precise grievances, this public demand elevates the discussion from policy debate to a crisis of confidence, demanding immediate attention from markets and the public alike. Why Now? Unpacking the Federal Reserve’s Economic Strategy and Challenges The timing of Pulte’s call is critical, coming amidst ongoing debates about inflation, interest rates, and the broader health of the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve, under Jerome Powell’s leadership, embarked on an aggressive campaign to combat soaring inflation, raising the federal funds rate from near zero to over 5% in a relatively short period. This strategy, while aimed at cooling the economy and bringing prices down, has had significant side effects. Inflation Battle: The Fed’s primary mandate is price stability. While inflation has cooled from its peak, it remains above the Fed’s 2% target, leading to persistent concerns about the cost of living for American households. Interest Rate Hikes: These hikes have impacted borrowing costs across the board, from mortgages and auto loans to business investments. While necessary to curb inflation, they also carry the risk of slowing economic growth too much, potentially leading to a recession. Labor Market Dynamics: The Fed has walked a tightrope, aiming to cool the labor market without causing widespread job losses. The unemployment rate has remained remarkably low, but some argue that this indicates the Fed’s policies haven’t been restrictive enough, or that the full effects are yet to be felt. Financial Stability Concerns: Rapid rate changes can expose vulnerabilities in the financial system, as seen with regional bank failures in 2023. Ensuring overall financial stability is another key aspect of the Fed’s responsibilities. Pulte’s intervention suggests that, from his vantage point overseeing the housing sector, the current approach is either insufficient, misguided, or causing unacceptable collateral damage. It highlights the tension between the Fed’s broad economic mandate and the specific impacts felt by different sectors of the economy. What Does This Mean for Overall Economic Stability? A public call for the Fed Chair’s resignation introduces a layer of uncertainty that can directly impact overall economic stability . The Federal Reserve’s independence and perceived competence are cornerstones of investor confidence, both domestically and internationally. When these are questioned, particularly by another high-ranking financial official, it can lead to market jitters and a re-evaluation of economic forecasts. Here’s how such an event could play out: Aspect Potential Impact Market Confidence Increased volatility in stock, bond, and currency markets as investors price in political uncertainty and potential policy shifts. Policy Outlook Questions arise about the continuity of monetary policy. Will the Fed be pressured to change course? This uncertainty can delay investment decisions. Political Pressure The call might embolden other critics, leading to more political scrutiny of the Fed’s actions, potentially undermining its independence. International Perception Global investors may view U.S. economic leadership as less stable, potentially impacting capital flows and the dollar’s strength. For the average consumer and business, this translates to heightened uncertainty regarding future interest rates, inflation, and employment prospects. It underscores the delicate balance the Federal Reserve must maintain and the immense pressure its leadership faces from various stakeholders. The Ripple Effect: Implications for Crypto Markets and Investors While the call for Jerome Powell’s resignation is rooted in traditional finance and economic policy, its implications are profoundly relevant for cryptocurrency markets. Crypto assets, despite their decentralized nature, are not immune to macroeconomic headwinds and the broader sentiment in global financial markets. Here’s why this matters for crypto investors: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding central bank leadership and future monetary policy often leads to increased volatility across all asset classes, including Bitcoin and altcoins. Investors might seek safe havens or reduce risk exposure, impacting crypto prices. Dollar Strength: Any perceived weakening of U.S. economic leadership or stability could impact the U.S. dollar. While a weaker dollar can sometimes be seen as bullish for crypto (as a hedge against inflation), uncertainty can also drive capital towards more established safe havens or out of risky assets entirely. Interest Rate Expectations: If the call for resignation leads to speculation about a shift in Fed policy (e.g., a faster pivot to rate cuts or a more aggressive stance), it could significantly influence crypto market dynamics. Lower interest rates generally make riskier assets like crypto more attractive. Regulatory Scrutiny: Periods of economic instability often bring increased regulatory scrutiny across financial sectors, including crypto. Policymakers might seek to tighten controls to prevent further perceived risks. For crypto investors, the key actionable insight is to remain vigilant. Monitor official statements from the FHFA and the Federal Reserve, observe market reactions, and consider diversifying portfolios to mitigate risks associated with sudden shifts in economic policy or leadership. This event serves as a stark reminder that even the most innovative and decentralized markets are still intertwined with the decisions made by traditional financial authorities. Concluding Thoughts: A Critical Juncture for U.S. Economic Leadership William Pulte’s public demand for Jerome Powell’s resignation marks a critical juncture for U.S. economic leadership. It underscores the immense pressures faced by policymakers grappling with persistent inflation, a sensitive housing market, and the overarching goal of maintaining financial stability . While the immediate outcome of this call remains uncertain, it has undeniably ignited a fierce debate about the effectiveness of current monetary policy and the direction of the U.S. economy. This development serves as a powerful reminder that even the most influential positions in global finance are subject to intense scrutiny and criticism, especially when economic challenges persist. The ripple effects of such a high-profile disagreement will undoubtedly be felt across all sectors, from the housing market to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, making it a situation worth closely monitoring for anyone with a stake in the global financial landscape.

For those looking to gain exposure to innovative blockchain technologies through regulated channels, Grayscale Investments has consistently been a frontrunner. Their latest announcement marks another significant step: the opening of the Grayscale SUI Trust to eligible accredited investors. This move is more than just a new product offering; it signifies a growing institutional interest in promising Layer 1 blockchains like Sui and expands the avenues for sophisticated capital to enter the crypto space. What Exactly is the Grayscale SUI Trust? Grayscale Investments, a leading digital currency asset manager, has announced the availability of its SUI Trust. This trust is designed to provide accredited investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to the native asset of the Sui blockchain, SUI, without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. Think of it as a traditional investment vehicle that holds SUI tokens on behalf of its investors. Here’s a breakdown of what this means: Simplified Access: Investors can gain exposure to SUI through a familiar trust structure, similar to how one might invest in a gold ETF. Custody and Security: Grayscale handles the secure custody of the underlying SUI tokens, mitigating the risks associated with self-custody. Regulatory Compliance: The trust operates within a regulated framework, which can be appealing to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals who prioritize compliance. This offering underscores Grayscale’s commitment to broadening the spectrum of digital assets available through regulated investment products, further legitimizing the asset class for a wider audience. Diving Deeper into the Sui Blockchain The core asset of this new trust is SUI, the native cryptocurrency of the Sui blockchain . But what makes Sui noteworthy enough for Grayscale to launch a dedicated trust? Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs, a team largely composed of former Meta (Facebook) engineers who worked on the Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain project. It stands out for its unique approach to scalability and performance, designed to support high-throughput applications and a user-friendly Web3 experience. Key features include: Move Language: Sui utilizes a Rust-based programming language called Move, specifically designed for secure and verifiable smart contracts. Its object-centric model enhances security and enables parallel transaction execution. Parallel Execution: Unlike many traditional blockchains that process transactions sequentially, Sui can process independent transactions in parallel. This significantly boosts its throughput and reduces latency, making it ideal for gaming, DeFi, and social applications. Scalability: Sui’s architecture is built for horizontal scaling, meaning its capacity can increase with more computational resources, making it future-proof for mass adoption. Low Transaction Fees: Designed to offer predictable and low transaction fees, improving the user experience for dApp interactions. Sui aims to be a foundational layer for the next generation of Web3 applications, focusing on developer experience and user adoption. Its innovative design principles position it as a strong contender in the competitive Layer 1 landscape. Why Are Accredited Investors Crypto Opportunities So Crucial? The term accredited investors crypto refers to individuals or entities that meet specific income or net worth requirements, making them eligible to invest in certain complex or higher-risk securities. For Grayscale’s SUI Trust, this means the offering is not open to the general public. Why is this distinction important? Here’s why accredited investor access is a significant development: Risk Mitigation: Regulators often restrict certain investments to accredited investors because these individuals are presumed to have the financial sophistication and capacity to absorb potential losses from less liquid or more volatile investments. Institutional Gateway: Many institutional investors, such as hedge funds, family offices, and endowments, operate under strict mandates that often require them to invest in regulated products. Grayscale trusts provide a compliant pathway for them to gain crypto exposure. Market Maturation: The participation of accredited investors signals a growing acceptance and maturation of the digital asset market. Their involvement brings significant capital and often a long-term perspective, contributing to market stability and growth. Product Innovation: By catering to this segment, Grayscale can launch more specialized and diverse products, pushing the boundaries of what’s available in the crypto investment landscape. For accredited investors, the SUI Trust offers a compelling opportunity to diversify their portfolios with exposure to a high-growth potential blockchain, managed by a reputable asset manager. The Broader Impact: Driving Digital Asset Investment Forward Grayscale’s continuous expansion of its product suite, including the new SUI Trust, plays a pivotal role in accelerating digital asset investment across the board. By packaging individual cryptocurrencies into accessible, regulated investment vehicles, Grayscale bridges the gap between traditional finance and the nascent crypto market. Consider the ripple effects: Increased Liquidity: As more capital flows into these trusts, it can indirectly contribute to the liquidity of the underlying assets in the broader market. Price Discovery: Institutional interest often leads to more robust price discovery mechanisms and can reduce volatility over the long term as market depth increases. Education and Awareness: Each new product launch brings renewed attention to the underlying blockchain technology, fostering greater understanding and potentially wider adoption. Competitive Landscape: Grayscale’s moves often spur other financial institutions to explore similar offerings, leading to a more competitive and innovative digital asset investment landscape. The SUI Trust is not just about Sui; it’s about the ongoing trend of financial innovation making digital assets more palatable for a wider array of sophisticated investors. Accelerating Institutional Crypto Adoption: Grayscale’s Strategic Role Grayscale has long been a trailblazer in facilitating institutional crypto adoption . From its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to its newer offerings, the firm has consistently provided pathways for traditional investors to participate in the crypto economy. The launch of the SUI Trust reinforces this strategic position. Why is institutional adoption so critical for the crypto market? Aspect Impact of Institutional Adoption Market Maturity Adds stability, depth, and legitimacy to the market, moving it beyond speculative retail trading. Capital Inflow Brings significant capital, which can drive demand, innovation, and infrastructure development. Regulatory Clarity Increased institutional participation often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Innovation & Infrastructure Demands from institutions drive the development of more robust trading platforms, custody solutions, and analytical tools. The SUI Trust is another testament to Grayscale’s vision of making digital assets a mainstream investment class. By offering exposure to a high-performance blockchain like Sui, they are not only providing a new investment avenue but also validating the potential of emerging blockchain technologies. Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges While the Grayscale SUI Trust presents an exciting opportunity, it’s crucial for eligible investors to consider both the potential benefits and inherent challenges: Benefits: Diversification: Adds exposure to an emerging Layer 1 blockchain, diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ease of Investment: Simple access through a familiar trust structure, avoiding direct crypto management. Security: Professional custody and management of the underlying assets. Potential Growth: Sui’s technological advancements and ecosystem growth could lead to significant appreciation of SUI. Challenges & Considerations: Accredited Investor Requirement: Limited to a specific class of investors. Premium/Discount: Grayscale trusts can sometimes trade at a premium or discount to their underlying net asset value (NAV), which can impact returns. Liquidity: While Grayscale trusts are traded, they might not offer the same liquidity as direct on-exchange crypto holdings. Regulatory Risk: The digital asset space is still evolving, and future regulatory changes could impact the trust. Market Volatility: The underlying SUI token, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to high price volatility. Prospective investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consult with financial advisors to assess if this investment aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance. A Compelling Summary: The Future is Trust-Based Grayscale’s decision to open its SUI Trust to accredited investors marks a significant milestone for both the Sui blockchain and the broader digital asset investment landscape. It offers a regulated, accessible pathway for sophisticated capital to gain exposure to an innovative Layer 1 blockchain, underscoring the growing confidence in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. This move not only expands Grayscale’s impressive portfolio but also reinforces its pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future. As institutional interest continues to grow, such trusts will likely become even more vital in shaping the trajectory of digital asset adoption globally.

United States President Donald Trump’s second son, Eric Trump, recently said that half a Bitcoin will be a huge amount of money soon and predicted the crypto could hit $1 million in the mid‑term. Those comments add to a chorus of bullish voices. Millionaires Feel The Squeeze Based on analysis from Binance co‑founder Changpeng Zhao, the $1 million mark isn’t far off. He told investors that it could happen in this bull cycle. Brandon Green of BTC Inc. agreed, forecasting a similar timeframe for liftoff.

The UK government is setting the stage for a groundbreaking initiative, empowering its wholesale financial market to delve deep into the potential of UK DLT and tokenization. This isn’t just about adopting new tech; it’s about fundamentally reshaping how financial transactions are conducted, promising unprecedented efficiency, transparency, and innovation. What is Driving Wholesale Finance DLT Adoption? The global financial landscape is constantly evolving, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) is at the forefront of this transformation. For the wholesale financial market, DLT offers a compelling proposition: the ability to streamline complex processes, reduce intermediaries, and enhance security. Imagine a world where asset transfers are instantaneous, settlement risks are minimized, and audit trails are immutable. This is the promise of wholesale finance DLT . Traditionally, wholesale financial markets, which include large-scale transactions between institutions like banks, investment funds, and corporations, have been characterized by multi-party reconciliation, lengthy settlement cycles, and and high operational costs. DLT, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides a shared, immutable ledger that all participants can access and verify in real-time. This shared source of truth can drastically cut down on reconciliation efforts and associated risks. Key drivers for DLT adoption in wholesale finance include: Efficiency Gains: Automating manual processes and reducing settlement times from days to seconds. Cost Reduction: Lowering operational expenses by minimizing intermediaries and manual reconciliation. Enhanced Transparency: Providing a single, immutable record visible to all authorized participants. Reduced Risk: Mitigating counterparty risk and operational errors through automation and shared ledgers. Unlocking Transformative DLT Use Cases The UK’s strategic move is centered on identifying and nurturing the most impactful DLT use cases within its wholesale financial sector. This proactive approach aims to move beyond theoretical discussions to practical, implementable solutions that can deliver tangible benefits. The potential applications are vast and varied, touching almost every facet of wholesale finance. Let’s explore some of the most promising DLT applications: DLT Use Case Description Potential Benefits Digital Bonds & Securities Issuing and managing traditional bonds and other securities as digital tokens on a DLT platform. Instant settlement, fractional ownership, reduced issuance costs, increased liquidity. Repurchase Agreements (Repos) Executing repo transactions on a DLT, facilitating collateral management and cash settlement. Automated lifecycle management, real-time collateral adjustments, reduced counterparty risk. Fund Management & Distribution Tokenizing fund units to streamline subscription, redemption, and transfer processes. Improved transparency, lower administration fees, broader access for investors.

The Power of Tokenization Solutions in the UK Hand-in-hand with DLT, tokenization solutions are poised to revolutionize how assets are owned, traded, and managed. Tokenization involves representing real-world assets (like real estate, art, or even commodities) or traditional financial instruments (like stocks and bonds) as digital tokens on a blockchain or DLT. Each token can represent a share of ownership, making assets more liquid, divisible, and accessible. The UK’s focus on tokenization signals a clear intent to unlock new avenues for capital formation and investment. For the wholesale market, tokenization means: Increased Liquidity: Making illiquid assets more tradable by dividing them into smaller, tokenized units. Fractional Ownership: Enabling multiple investors to own a portion of a high-value asset, democratizing investment. Automated Compliance: Embedding regulatory rules directly into the tokens themselves via smart contracts, ensuring compliance at every step. Reduced Intermediaries: Cutting out layers of brokers and custodians, leading to lower costs and faster transactions. The regulatory sandbox approach being considered by the UK is crucial here. It allows for controlled experimentation with tokenized securities and other assets, providing a safe space for innovation while ensuring consumer protection and market stability. Fostering Financial Innovation in a Regulated Environment The UK’s ambition is not just to adopt new technology but to lead in financial innovation . This involves creating a regulatory framework that is both forward-looking and robust. The government’s plan to enable the wholesale market to identify DLT use cases is a testament to this commitment. It acknowledges that innovation thrives when industry and regulators collaborate to understand the nuances and implications of emerging technologies. Key aspects of the UK’s approach to fostering innovation include: Regulatory Sandboxes: Providing a controlled environment for firms to test innovative products and services without immediate full regulatory burden. Task Forces & Working Groups: Bringing together industry experts, regulators, and technologists to discuss challenges and opportunities. Policy Development: Crafting clear and adaptable regulations that support DLT adoption while mitigating risks like market manipulation, cybersecurity threats, and money laundering. This balanced approach is vital. It allows the UK to capitalize on the benefits of DLT and tokenization without compromising the stability and integrity of its financial system. By proactively engaging with the wholesale market, the government ensures that policy development is informed by real-world needs and challenges. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the potential is immense, the journey to widespread DLT adoption in wholesale finance is not without its hurdles. Key challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: Ensuring a consistent and clear legal framework across jurisdictions.

This isn’t just a symbolic gesture; it’s a tangible commitment to embracing digital innovation, with three Bitcoin mining rigs now operating 24/7 within the hallowed halls of city hall. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital assets and their integration into mainstream society, this development marks a pivotal moment, signaling a potential new era for how cities manage resources and engage with emerging technologies. Fort Worth Bitcoin Mining: A Groundbreaking Initiative at City Hall The news, initially reported by Fox News 4 and amplified by Walter Bloomberg on X, confirms that Fort Worth has installed three Bitmain Antminer S9 rigs, which will run continuously for a six-month trial period. While three rigs might seem like a modest start in the vast landscape of global Bitcoin mining operations, the significance lies not in the scale, but in the precedent. This isn’t a private enterprise; it’s a municipal government, a public entity, directly participating in the decentralized network of Bitcoin. This bold step by Fort Worth’s city leadership demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and digital currencies to contribute to local economies and public services. The decision to place these rigs within city hall itself is particularly symbolic. It brings a cutting-edge technology, often perceived as abstract or complex, directly into the heart of civic administration. This physical presence can serve as a powerful educational tool, demystifying Bitcoin for citizens and potentially fostering greater understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It’s a clear statement that Fort Worth is not just observing the digital revolution; it’s actively participating in it, aiming to harness its benefits for its residents. The Strategic Vision Behind Municipal Crypto Adoption: Why Now? Why would a city embark on a municipal crypto mining venture? The rationale extends beyond mere novelty. Fort Worth’s initiative is rooted in a strategic vision to position the city as a hub for technology and innovation. In an increasingly digital world, cities are competing to attract talent, investment, and future-proof industries. By embracing Bitcoin mining, Fort Worth signals its openness to new ideas and its willingness to experiment with disruptive technologies. Several key drivers likely influenced this decision: Economic Diversification: Exploring new revenue streams beyond traditional taxes and fees. Bitcoin mining, while volatile, offers a unique opportunity to generate income directly from a global digital asset. Innovation Hub Development: Attracting blockchain companies, developers, and enthusiasts to the city, fostering a vibrant tech ecosystem. This can lead to job creation and economic growth in emerging sectors. Public Awareness and Education: Serving as a tangible example of blockchain technology in action, which can help educate the public and local businesses about its potential applications. Future-Proofing Infrastructure: Gaining hands-on experience with decentralized technologies that may play a significant role in future public services, from supply chain management to secure record-keeping. This proactive stance by Fort Worth’s leadership suggests a long-term view on the role of digital assets in the global economy, aiming to secure a competitive edge for the city in the evolving technological landscape. Unpacking the Benefits of City Hall Bitcoin Mining: What’s in it for Fort Worth? While the immediate financial gains from three mining rigs might be modest, the benefits of this city hall Bitcoin project extend far beyond simple revenue. Fort Worth is investing in experience, visibility, and future potential. Let’s delve into the multi-faceted advantages: Potential Revenue Generation Every block mined contributes Bitcoin to the miner. While the three S9 rigs are not industrial-scale operations, they will generate a continuous, albeit small, stream of Bitcoin. Over time, and especially if Bitcoin’s value appreciates, these earnings could contribute to city coffers, potentially funding public services or further technological initiatives. This creates a novel, non-tax-based revenue stream, diversifying the city’s financial portfolio. Energy Efficiency and Sustainability (A Key Discussion Point) One of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin mining is its energy consumption. However, Fort Worth’s approach could serve as a case study in responsible mining. Many municipalities have access to existing infrastructure and potentially underutilized energy capacity, especially during off-peak hours. If the city can power these rigs using excess or renewable energy sources, it transforms a perceived negative into a positive, showcasing how Bitcoin mining can be integrated sustainably. The small scale also means minimal additional load on the grid, making it an efficient use of existing resources. Establishing Technological Leadership By being the first U.S. city to directly mine Bitcoin, Fort Worth immediately gains recognition as a pioneer. This enhances its brand as an innovative and tech-forward city, which can attract tech companies, startups, and skilled workers looking for an environment that embraces emerging technologies. This leadership position can lead to a virtuous cycle of innovation and economic growth. Public Education and Engagement The presence of mining rigs at city hall offers a unique opportunity for public engagement. Imagine school groups visiting, learning about blockchain, and seeing Bitcoin mining in action. This hands-on exposure can demystify complex concepts, foster digital literacy, and inspire a new generation of tech innovators within the community. It turns an abstract concept into a tangible reality. Navigating the Challenges of Public Sector Blockchain: What Are the Risks? No pioneering venture comes without its challenges, and Fort Worth’s foray into public sector blockchain is no exception. While the benefits are compelling, the city must also prudently manage potential risks and criticisms. Market Volatility of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. The value of the mined Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, impacting the revenue generated. The city will need a clear strategy for managing these assets, whether holding them, converting them to fiat, or using them for specific purposes, to mitigate financial risk. Energy Consumption and Environmental Concerns Despite the small scale, any mention of Bitcoin mining often triggers concerns about its environmental footprint. Fort Worth will need to be transparent about the energy source for its rigs and demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. Proactive communication and, ideally, reliance on renewable energy or utilizing excess power, will be crucial to maintaining public support. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. While Bitcoin mining itself is generally legal, future regulations regarding digital asset holdings by municipal entities could emerge. Fort Worth will need to stay abreast of these developments and adapt its operations accordingly. Security Risks Operating Bitcoin mining rigs, even on a small scale, involves security considerations. Protecting the physical hardware from theft or damage, and safeguarding the digital wallets where mined Bitcoin is stored, are paramount. Cybersecurity measures must be robust to prevent hacking attempts or other malicious activities. Public Acceptance and Skepticism Not everyone is a crypto enthusiast. Some citizens may view this initiative with skepticism, seeing it as a waste of taxpayer money or an unnecessary risk. Effective public relations and transparent reporting on the project’s performance will be essential to build trust and demonstrate value to the broader community. Fort Worth’s Bold Step: A Precedent for Crypto Adoption Across the Nation? Fort Worth’s decision could be a significant turning point for broader crypto adoption within governmental structures across the United States. When a city takes such a visible and direct step, it sends a powerful message that cryptocurrencies are not just for tech enthusiasts or private investors, but are legitimate tools with potential applications for public good. This initiative could inspire other municipalities to: Explore Similar Mining Ventures: Cities with favorable energy costs or renewable energy surpluses might consider their own small-scale mining operations as a new revenue source. Investigate Blockchain for Public Services: Beyond mining, cities might look into using blockchain for more secure record-keeping, transparent voting systems, efficient supply chain management for municipal procurements, or even issuing municipal bonds on a blockchain. Accept Cryptocurrency Payments: If cities are comfortable mining Bitcoin, they might become more open to accepting Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for taxes, fees, or utility payments, enhancing convenience for citizens. Foster Local Crypto Economies: By embracing crypto at a municipal level, cities can encourage local businesses to also adopt digital assets, potentially creating localized crypto economies that attract new businesses and talent. Fort Worth is essentially running a live experiment, and the results of their six-month trial will be closely watched. A successful outcome could provide a blueprint for other cities, demonstrating that prudent engagement with cryptocurrencies can yield tangible benefits and contribute to urban innovation. What Lies Ahead: The Future of Fort Worth’s Bitcoin Venture The initial six-month trial period will be crucial for Fort Worth. During this time, the city will likely monitor the performance of the rigs, the revenue generated, the energy consumption, and public reception. The insights gained will inform future decisions regarding the scalability and long-term viability of the project. Possible future scenarios include: Expansion: If the trial is successful and the benefits outweigh the challenges, Fort Worth might consider expanding its mining operations, perhaps by adding more rigs or exploring larger-scale facilities. Integration into Broader Blockchain Strategy: The mining initiative could be just the first step in a more comprehensive blockchain strategy for the city, exploring applications in smart contracts for city services, digital identity, or even municipal stablecoins. Data Transparency: To maintain public trust and provide valuable lessons for other cities, Fort Worth would ideally publish regular reports on the project’s performance, including revenue, energy usage, and operational costs. Collaboration: The city might seek partnerships with private sector blockchain companies to enhance its capabilities, provide expertise, or explore joint ventures. Fort Worth’s pioneering spirit sets a powerful example. Their willingness to explore new frontiers in technology, even in the traditionally conservative public sector, marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more digitally integrated future. The world will be watching to see how this bold experiment unfolds and what lessons it offers for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in civic life.

The crypto community certainly hoped so. After months, even years, of anticipation, two pivotal pieces of cryptocurrency legislation were on the cusp of reaching the House floor for a full vote. Yet, in a dramatic turn of events, those hopes were dashed. House Republicans, unable to muster the necessary votes for a procedural motion, effectively blocked these crucial crypto bills from advancing, leaving the future of US crypto regulation hanging in the balance. This unexpected halt has sent ripples through the market and raised significant questions about the path forward for digital asset policy. What Just Happened with US Crypto Regulation? The legislative process in the U.S. Congress can be complex, and often, the biggest hurdles aren’t the final votes on a bill’s substance, but the procedural steps required to even get it to the floor. In this instance, House Republicans attempted to bring two significant cryptocurrency bills – widely believed to be the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) and a stablecoin bill – to a plenary vote under a ‘suspension of the rules’ procedure. This method is typically used for non-controversial bills or those with broad bipartisan support, as it requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass. Unfortunately, the procedural motion failed. This means that despite the efforts of proponents, these bills could not bypass the usual committee processes and be fast-tracked for a full House vote. The immediate consequence is a significant delay, and potentially, the shelving of these specific legislative efforts for the foreseeable future. Infinity Hedge, reporting via Telegram, aptly summarized the sentiment: this will not be the ‘crypto week’ in the U.S. that many had eagerly awaited. Why Did the Procedural Motion Fail, and What Does It Mean for Cryptocurrency Legislation? The failure of a procedural motion often signals deeper divisions than might appear on the surface. While the exact reasons for the lack of two-thirds support aren’t always immediately clear, several factors could have contributed: Bipartisan Disagreement: Despite some bipartisan efforts on crypto, significant disagreements persist between Democrats and Republicans on the scope, nature, and oversight of digital assets. Some Democrats may view these bills as too favorable to the industry or lacking sufficient consumer protections. Internal Party Divisions: Even within the Republican caucus, there might be differing opinions on how to approach crypto regulation, leading to a lack of unanimous support needed for a supermajority vote. Regulatory Turf Wars: The debate over which existing agencies (e.g., SEC vs. CFTC) should have primary oversight over various digital assets continues to be a contentious issue, complicating legislative efforts. Timing and Priorities: With a busy legislative calendar and an election year looming, some members may have prioritized other issues or felt there wasn’t enough time to properly debate such complex legislation under a fast-track procedure. For cryptocurrency legislation, this failure is a major setback. It underscores the difficulty of passing comprehensive digital asset laws in a politically divided Congress. Without a clear regulatory framework, the crypto industry in the U.S. continues to operate in a gray area, facing uncertainty that can stifle innovation and deter institutional investment. The Broader Impact on Digital Asset Policy and the Crypto Market The blocking of these crypto bills has immediate and long-term implications for the entire digital asset ecosystem. The crypto market, which thrives on clarity and certainty, often reacts negatively to regulatory ambiguities or setbacks. Immediate Market Reaction: While specific price movements are influenced by many factors, news of regulatory delays or failures can contribute to: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty can lead to more speculative trading and wider price swings. Investor Hesitation: Both retail and institutional investors may adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach, slowing down capital inflow. Innovation Stifled: Companies might delay product launches or expansion plans in the U.S. due to the lack of clear rules. Long-Term Implications for Digital Asset Policy: This legislative roadblock could have profound effects on the U.S.’s standing in the global crypto landscape: Aspect Potential Impact of Legislative Delay Innovation & Competitiveness The U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions (e.g., EU with MiCA, UAE, Singapore) that are actively developing clear regulatory frameworks. Crypto businesses may choose to establish operations elsewhere. Consumer Protection Without comprehensive legislation, consumers and investors may remain vulnerable to scams, hacks, and market manipulation, as existing laws are often ill-suited for digital assets. Institutional Adoption Large financial institutions require regulatory clarity to fully engage with crypto. Delays hinder their participation, limiting the market’s growth and maturity. National Security Clear regulations are essential for combating illicit finance and ensuring the integrity of the financial system in the age of digital currencies. A fragmented approach creates loopholes. The continued lack of a cohesive digital asset policy means that the U.S. relies on enforcement actions and fragmented interpretations of existing laws, creating a patchwork regulatory environment that is challenging for businesses and confusing for consumers. What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation and Crypto Bills? Despite this setback, the push for comprehensive US crypto regulation is far from over. The crypto industry and its advocates in Congress are tenacious, and the underlying need for clarity remains. So, what are the potential paths forward? Potential Avenues for Future Cryptocurrency Legislation: Reintroduction and Committee Process: The bills could be reintroduced and go through the traditional committee process, allowing for more debate, amendments, and potentially, bipartisan compromises. This is a slower but potentially more robust path. Standalone Bills: Elements of the comprehensive bills might be broken down into smaller, more digestible standalone bills, focusing on specific aspects like stablecoins or market structure, which might have an easier time garnering support. Executive Action & Agency Guidance: In the absence of new laws, executive agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, Treasury) will continue to issue guidance and pursue enforcement actions based on existing statutes. While not ideal for the industry, this is a de facto form of regulation. Election Impact: The upcoming elections could shift the political landscape, potentially creating new opportunities or challenges for crypto legislation depending on the composition of the next Congress. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community: For those invested in the future of digital assets, this setback is a reminder of the importance of engagement: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of legislative developments and the positions of your elected officials. Advocate: Support organizations that lobby for sensible crypto regulation. Contact your representatives to share your views on the importance of clear rules for innovation and consumer protection. Educate: Help bridge the knowledge gap about digital assets. Many policymakers still lack a deep understanding of the technology and its potential. The failure of House Republicans to pass the procedural motion highlights the deep-seated challenges in achieving comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation. It’s a stark reminder that while the crypto industry is rapidly evolving, the political process moves at its own pace, often hindered by partisan divides and procedural complexities. A Critical Juncture for Digital Asset Policy The recent legislative snag in the U.S. House of Representatives marks a critical moment for digital asset policy. While the immediate anticipation of a ‘crypto week’ has been dashed, the underlying need for a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto bills remains paramount. The setback underscores the challenges of navigating complex technology through a politically charged legislative environment. However, it also serves as a catalyst for renewed advocacy and a deeper understanding of the intricate dance between innovation and governance. The crypto industry, investors, and policymakers alike must now regroup and reassess the path forward. Whether through refined legislation, targeted bills, or continued engagement with regulatory bodies, the journey towards a robust and clear US crypto regulation framework will continue. The future of digital assets in the U.S. hinges on finding common ground and fostering an environment where innovation can thrive responsibly, benefiting both the economy and the public.

Launched in August 2020 as an Ethereum-based token, SHIB capitalized on Dogecoin’s hype, fueled by retail investor enthusiasm on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. Elon Musk’s tweets and Vitalik Buterin’s donation of 50 trillion SHIB to India’s COVID relief fund amplified its visibility. Trading volume surged, with SHIB briefly ranking among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, hitting $39 billion. Its decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, launched in July 2021, boosting utility with staking and liquidity pools. Despite its meteoric rise, SHIB faced volatility, dropping 50% by year-end. The frenzy highlighted meme coins’ speculative appeal, drawing millions of holders, though its lack of fundamental use cases sparked debate about sustainability. Dual Lending System: Flexibility and High-Yield at Layer-2 Speed Shiba Inu (SHIB) made history in 2021 when it skyrocketed from a meme to a market sensation, delivering unbelievable returns in a matter of weeks. But while the hype was real, many investors were left chasing the tail end of its parabolic move. Today’s smarter capital isn’t hunting for viral spikes — it’s focused on real utility, DeFi infrastructure, and long-term growth. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters with powerful fundamentals and presale momentum that’s capturing serious attention. Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trading at just $0.03, with over $12.2 million raised, 13,200+ token holders, and 73% of the phase already sold out. A 20% price jump to $0.035 is imminent in the next phase, and listing is set at $0.06 — meaning current buyers are locking in 2x upside before launch, with analyst projections aiming far higher in the years to come. Unlike meme tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a structured Layer-2 lending ecosystem, enabling real earning mechanisms through two robust models — peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, users will deposit assets like DAI, USDT, ETH, AVAX, or MATIC into pooled contracts and will earn passive yield based on real-time pool utilization and dynamic interest rates. With lucrative loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, the system will be optimized to protect deposits while delivering consistent rewards. Meanwhile, P2P lending on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will unlock a personalized DeFi experience. This model is being designed to support assets that traditional DeFi protocols often exclude — including meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. Lenders will negotiate one-on-one deals, setting their own interest rates, loan durations, and loan-to-value ratios. This flexibility allows both parties to create custom agreements, making it a powerful option for users holding unconventional or volatile tokens. Built on Layer-2 infrastructure, Mutuum’s entire lending and borrowing process will benefit from lower gas fees, faster finality, and a seamless user experience. With the upcoming beta launch scheduled around the time of listing, the project will aim to onboard thousands of users into a scalable DeFi network designed to support real-time loan execution and yield tracking. In parallel, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is building excitement among early participants and social followers — now surpassing 12,000 on X (Twitter) — while also boosting visibility across DeFi communities. Stablecoin Architecture and Early Investor Gains Signal Strong Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is laying the foundation for a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin that will only be minted when users borrow against assets like ETH. This stablecoin will be burned automatically upon loan repayment or liquidation, preventing unnecessary inflation. Its $1 peg will be maintained through governance-adjusted interest rates and arbitrage opportunities, ensuring price stability without relying on market-driven rate changes. Only approved issuers with set minting caps will be able to create this stablecoin, keeping system risk in check. All loans will remain overcollateralized and subject to automatic liquidation when necessary, helping preserve the integrity of the ecosystem over time. Mutuum also rewards depositors with mtTokens, which reflect the user’s underlying principal and earned interest. These mtTokens can be staked in the designated smart contracts to earn dividends from the protocol’s revenue — offering a second layer of passive income for long-term holders. This dual-yield setup separates Mutuum from traditional DeFi platforms, where users typically earn yield from only one source. Consider the investor who rotated $5,000 of capital from Ethereum (ETH) into Mutuum during Phase 1 at just $0.01. Today, that holding is worth $15,000 at the current $0.03 price — a 3X gain before launch. With the token set to list at $0.06, that position will soon reflect a 6x return, and a known analyst — known for spotting Solana (SOL) at $1 in 2020 — is now calling $0.30 targets by 2026, giving MUTM a 10x path forward. Mutuum’s credibility is also reinforced by a CertiK audit with a 95.00 score, an active $50,000 bug bounty, and a roadmap that includes Layer-2 deployment, multi-chain integration, and governance expansion in later phases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may run again — but while retail chases past hype, smart investors are securing real utility. Only 27% of Phase 5 tokens remain at $0.03. Once Phase 6 begins, that price disappears forever. This is the final discounted entry for one of the most utility-packed projects of the cycle.

A pivotal crypto bill , poised to shape the future of digital assets in America, recently failed a crucial procedural vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. This turn of events has not only sent ripples through the legislative chambers but has also reportedly drawn the ire of the President himself, adding a layer of high-stakes political intrigue to the ongoing debate over digital asset policy. The Unexpected Stumble: What Happened with the Crypto Bill? In a surprising development that caught many off guard, the U.S. House of Representatives saw a key crypto bill falter during its initial procedural vote. This vote, often a formality that paves the way for a full debate and final vote on a piece of legislation, instead became a roadblock. According to reports from Fox News, cited by Jin10, the bill failed to garner the necessary support to proceed, putting its immediate future in question. For those unfamiliar with the legislative process, a procedural vote is essentially a vote on the rules or procedures for considering a bill, rather than on the bill’s substance itself. It’s a critical step that dictates how a bill will be debated, amended, and ultimately voted upon. A failure at this stage can indicate significant opposition or strategic maneuvering by lawmakers aiming to block or delay the legislation. Despite this initial setback, there’s still hope for the bill. Plans are already in motion to hold a second vote, reportedly scheduled for around 21:00 UTC. This swift re-attempt underscores the urgency and importance attached to this particular piece of digital asset legislation , suggesting that its proponents are not ready to give up without a fight. The coming hours will be critical in determining whether this legislative effort can overcome its initial hurdle and move forward. Understanding the House Vote Dynamics and Political Fallout The failure of the initial House vote has ignited a firestorm of political activity. The report that the President is ‘angry’ and actively engaging with lawmakers who blocked the bill highlights the high stakes involved. This direct intervention from the executive branch signals the administration’s keen interest in the outcome of this legislation and its potential implications for the broader economy and technological innovation. Why would a procedural vote draw such presidential ire? Often, such failures indicate a lack of party discipline, unexpected bipartisan opposition, or strategic dissent within the President’s own party. It suggests that the administration had anticipated a smoother path for the bill and views its blockage as a significant challenge to its legislative agenda. The President’s engagement with these lawmakers could involve persuasive arguments, political pressure, or even negotiations to secure their support for the upcoming second vote. The dynamics of this House vote are complex. Was it a genuine rejection of the bill’s content, or a tactical move to extract concessions or send a message? The answer likely lies in the specific concerns of the lawmakers who voted against it. These concerns could range from worries about consumer protection, financial stability, or even the competitive landscape for traditional finance. Understanding these underlying motivations is crucial for predicting the outcome of the second vote and the future trajectory of U.S. crypto regulation . Why U.S. Crypto Regulation is a Contentious Battleground The struggle to pass comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation is not new. For years, lawmakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders have grappled with how to effectively oversee the rapidly evolving digital asset space. The inherent novelty and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies pose unique challenges for traditional regulatory frameworks, which were largely designed for centralized financial systems. The debate often pits proponents of innovation and economic growth against those prioritizing consumer protection, financial stability, and national security. On one side, industry leaders argue for clear, concise rules that foster innovation and allow the U.S. to remain competitive on the global stage. They often advocate for a light-touch approach that avoids stifling technological advancement. On the other side, concerns are frequently raised about illicit finance, market manipulation, and the potential for retail investors to lose money in volatile or fraudulent schemes. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC have often asserted their jurisdiction, leading to a patchwork of enforcement actions rather than a unified regulatory framework. This lack of clarity has created an environment of uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to operate and innovate within the U.S. The current legislative push, embodied by this crypto bill , aims to bring some much-needed clarity and structure to this chaotic landscape. However, as the recent procedural vote shows, achieving consensus on such a complex and multifaceted issue is an uphill battle, requiring significant political will and compromise from all parties involved. The President’s Stance: A Key Indicator for Digital Asset Legislation? The reported anger of the President is a significant development, underscoring the executive branch’s growing focus on digital assets. Historically, presidential administrations have varied in their approach to cryptocurrency, with some taking a more cautious stance while others have expressed openness to its potential. The current President’s stance appears to be one of urgency and a desire for concrete action, especially given the rapid global adoption of digital currencies. While the specifics of the President’s direct conversations with lawmakers are not public, his involvement suggests that this particular digital asset legislation aligns with his administration’s broader economic or technological goals. It could be that the administration views robust crypto regulation as essential for maintaining U.S. leadership in financial innovation, combating illicit activities, or even addressing concerns about national security in the digital realm. A President’s direct engagement can be a powerful tool in legislative battles. It can rally wavering votes, put pressure on opponents, and signal to the public the importance of a particular policy. Therefore, the President’s reported frustration is not just an emotional reaction but a strategic indicator that the administration is committed to seeing this or similar legislation pass. This commitment could significantly influence future debates and the eventual shape of U.S. crypto regulation . Challenges and Opportunities for Future Digital Asset Legislation The path forward for digital asset legislation in the U.S. is fraught with both challenges and opportunities. On the challenge front, the primary hurdles include: Lack of Consensus: Disagreement among various government agencies (e.g., SEC, CFTC, Treasury) on who should regulate what, leading to regulatory arbitrage and confusion. Technical Complexity: Many lawmakers and regulators still struggle to fully grasp the intricate technical aspects of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, making it difficult to draft effective legislation. Lobbying Efforts: Powerful lobbying groups from both traditional finance and the crypto industry exert significant influence, often pushing for divergent outcomes. Political Polarization: Crypto, like many other issues, can become a victim of partisan divides, hindering bipartisan cooperation. Despite these challenges, opportunities abound. Clear and comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation could: Foster Innovation: Provide legal certainty for startups and established companies, encouraging investment and development in the U.S. Enhance Consumer Protection: Implement safeguards against fraud, scams, and market manipulation, building trust among retail investors. Improve Market Integrity: Establish rules for exchanges, stablecoins, and DeFi, leading to more transparent and robust markets. Strengthen National Security: Enable better tracking and prevention of illicit financial flows through digital assets. Here’s a brief look at the contrasting approaches to crypto regulation: Approach Description Potential Impact on Innovation Potential Impact on Consumer Protection Strict Regulation Heavy oversight, detailed rules, high compliance burden (e.g., EU’s MiCA) May stifle some innovation due to high costs and complexity High, strong safeguards against fraud and market abuse Light-Touch Regulation Minimal rules, focus on existing laws, industry self-regulation (e.g., early U.S. approach) High, encourages rapid development and experimentation Lower, potential for more scams and market instability Innovation-Focused (Sandbox) Regulatory sandboxes for testing, flexible frameworks Moderate to High, allows for controlled experimentation Moderate, specific protections within sandbox environment What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The legislative drama surrounding this crypto bill inevitably sends signals to the broader crypto market. In the short term, uncertainty around the second House vote could lead to increased volatility in digital asset prices. Investors and businesses prefer regulatory clarity, and any perceived delay or failure in establishing a clear framework can cause apprehension. However, if the bill eventually passes, it could be a significant positive catalyst. Clear U.S. crypto regulation would likely attract more institutional investment, provide greater legitimacy to digital assets, and enable a wider range of financial products and services. Conversely, a prolonged legislative stalemate or the failure of this bill could push innovation and investment to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions, potentially hindering the U.S.’s position as a global leader in the digital economy. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Businesses Given the ongoing legislative developments, what can crypto enthusiasts and businesses do? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on news from Capitol Hill, especially regarding the upcoming second vote and any subsequent legislative efforts. Understanding the nuances of proposed digital asset legislation is key. Engage (where possible): For businesses and advocacy groups, engaging with policymakers, sharing insights, and advocating for sensible regulation can be impactful. Individual enthusiasts can support organizations that champion responsible crypto policies. Understand the Risks: While the promise of crypto is immense, regulatory uncertainty remains a significant risk factor. Diversify portfolios and be aware of the evolving legal landscape. Looking Ahead: The Path for U.S. Crypto Regulation The immediate focus is on the second House vote . Its outcome will determine whether this specific crypto bill proceeds or faces further delays. Even if it passes this procedural hurdle, the bill will still need to navigate through full House and Senate votes, potentially facing amendments and further debate. The legislative process is often long and arduous, especially for groundbreaking areas like digital assets. Regardless of this specific bill’s fate, the broader push for comprehensive U.S. crypto regulation is unlikely to subside. The increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system necessitates a clear legal framework. The President’s strong reaction indicates a clear desire from the executive branch to see progress. This ongoing legislative journey will undoubtedly shape not just the crypto industry in the U.S. but also influence global standards for digital asset governance. The initial stumble of the crypto bill in the U.S. House of Representatives serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and political hurdles involved in shaping the future of digital assets. While the immediate outcome of the second House vote remains to be seen, the reported anger of the President underscores the high stakes and the administration’s commitment to advancing U.S. crypto regulation . This ongoing legislative battle is more than just a procedural vote; it’s a critical moment that will define the landscape for digital asset legislation , impacting innovation, consumer protection, and America’s role in the global digital economy.

This marks a major step forward in Kraken’s effort to provide a fully integrated trading experience. Through this rollout , clients can trade cryptocurrency futures directly on CME Group’s platform via Kraken Pro. Users will enjoy seamless collateral transfers, enhanced capital efficiency, and a simplified interface that combines spot and derivatives trading in one place. That means Kraken’s clients can now trade numerous crypto futures—such as Bitcoin and Ethereum contracts—besides traditional spot markets in the Kraken Pro interface, which is the exchange’s advanced trading feature. Combining both offers instantaneous collateral transfers and enables strategies to be carried out faster. “With this launch, Kraken clients in the US can now trade futures alongside one of the world’s most liquid cryptocurrency spot markets,” said Shannon Kurtas, Head of Exchange at Kraken. He noted that it’s important to provide traders with broad market access and increased capital efficiency within a regulated, high-performance environment. In making crypto futures available in a compliant and regulated environment, Kraken caters to the increasing institutional and retail demand for advanced trading instruments in the US. That’s important as US regulators grow more adamant about regulating the cryptocurrency market, putting added focus on regulatory clarity and investor protection. Kraken develops a unified digital and traditional trading solution The introduction of Kraken Derivatives US isn’t a once-in-a-while maneuver. It is part of Kraken’s larger plan to develop a holistic multi-asset platform where users can easily trade digital and traditional assets in a single place. In April 2025, Kraken launched its traditional finance offering , commission-free trading in US equities. Kraken has said it makes more than 11,000 US stocks and ETFs accessible, and that all trades are open 24 hours a day. This was a major step toward breaking the barrier between crypto and traditional investing. The company also recently introduced tokenized equities, through which customers can purchase fractionalized publicly traded stock shares on a blockchain. That means Kraken users can now manage a diverse investment playbook that features crypto coins and blue chips without leaving the platform. Kurtas said Kraken Derivatives US is constantly working to build and expand a holistic trading experience that enables seamless trading across digital and traditional assets, all on one platform without compromise in functionality, performance, or liquidity. She said the company is building an ecosystem to serve traders in DeFi, traditional finance, and the spectrum. We aim to create a trading system where capital can quickly and efficiently move across markets with high confidence using just one high-performance interface. Kraken expands after acquiring NinjaTrader This new ability for Kraken was largely facilitated by the acquisition of NinjaTrader , one of the US’s most storied retail futures trading platforms. This acquisition was strategically important for Kraken, as it added regulatory infrastructure, technology, and mastery to its business to move into older derivatives markets. The debut of Kraken Derivatives US is the largest product to come out of that acquisition. But it’s only the beginning. Kraken, one of the oldest crypto exchanges, said it would extend its derivatives offering later in the year to include more futures, such as commodities, foreign exchange (FX), stocks, and bonds. That development would put Kraken in direct competition with established institutions rather than those in the crypto market, offering traders a single place for managing risk and trading across all major asset classes. The move is especially critical when institutional interest in crypto and digital assets is increasing, and hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers seek ways to enter digital markets compliantly. By providing futures contracts, spot trading, tokenized and traditional equities under one roof, Kraken says it aims to be a power player in global finance, not just crypto.

Ethereum’s Strength Tested at High Market Cap Ethereum recently climbed above the $3,000 mark after months of trading within a narrow range, signaling renewed market confidence. Its transition to proof-of-stake, over $90 billion in total value locked, and one of the largest developer communities reinforce Ethereum’s position as a leading smart contract platform. However, the network still depends heavily on Layer 2 solutions to manage congestion. During periods of high activity, performance issues and rising fees can negatively impact the user experience. While the current momentum is strong, Ethereum’s growth could face limits in the short term. Doubling its market cap would require an influx of more than $350 billion—a significant challenge that, while possible, is unlikely to unfold rapidly. XLM Rises Fast, But Long-Term Doubts Remain Stellar’s main strength lies in its simplicity and efficiency. It enables fast payments and low-fee transfers, making it ideal for cross-border remittances and use in financial networks. Its focus on reducing friction in money movement gives it strong utility in real-world applications. Recently, XLM surged 92% in just a week after breaking a key resistance level, supported by bullish indicators like the MACD and RSI, which suggest continued upward momentum. However, Stellar faces some notable limitations. It lacks compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning it can’t easily support a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). As a result, its developer activity and overall ecosystem remain significantly smaller when compared to platforms like Ethereum. How BlockDAG Blends Speed, Mining, Scalability & ROI! BlockDAG is getting major traction with its unique hybrid model. It uses both DAG architecture and proof-of-work, supporting over 15,000 transactions per second. This setup balances speed, security, and decentralization—a rare combination for any Layer 1 platform. What also stands out is BlockDAG’s user-first approach. It supports EVM compatibility, so developers can easily bring dApps from Ethereum. There’s a low-code contract builder too, helping non-tech users build applications. BlockDAG’s X1 mobile miner app has crossed 2 million users globally. Its approach has helped onboard more than 200,000 holders and sell 23.8 billion coins. Miner sales now exceed 18,000 units. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release is offering BDAG coins at $0.0016 until August 11. That’s a huge discount from Batch 29’s current rate of $0.0276. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, early buyers could gain 3,025%. BlockDAG’s presale has now raised $339 million. It’s also building visibility through partnerships with Seattle-based sports teams, including the Orcas and Seawolves. These steps are putting the project in front of broader, non-crypto audiences. Unlike Ethereum or Stellar, which each focus on specific use cases, BlockDAG is combining performance, accessibility, and community. It’s quickly becoming a Layer 1 contender with wide reach. Looking Ahead The Layer 1 race is heating up again as the market gains strength in Q3 2025. Ethereum has moved back above $3,000, keeping its reputation as the dominant smart contract network. Stellar just delivered a 92% jump in a week, bringing renewed attention to its role in payments. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is making headlines as it pushes past $339 million raised, with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release offering coins at just $0.0016 until August 11. These three platforms showcase different visions for blockchain. Ethereum remains the top choice for smart contracts. Stellar focuses on fast, affordable financial transfers.

To the point: an analyst at Standard Chartered says that, once stablecoins hit the $750 billion mark, they may begin to influence the structure of U.S. Treasury markets. (Their market cap is currently at roughly $258 billion according to DefiLlama.) We also have Deribit making it possible for USDC holders to earn 4% yield, a crypto startup called Dakota raising $12.5 million to make it easier for businesses to move funds from U.S. dollars to stablecoins, and back again. These four headlines are all from today, and they’re nothing out of the ordinary. We are used to seeing an abundance of news, every day, about stablecoin adoption. “Stablecoins are crypto’s killer app” has become a motto almost akin to “stay humble, stack sats.” The underdiscussed winners of the stablecoin growth are market makers — the outfits that provide liquidity to crypto markets and ensure trades are executed efficiently. Kevin de Patoul, CEO of global investment firm Keyrock , recently told CoinDesk that demand for bitcoin and stablecoins outshined demand for any other type of cryptocurrencies by a wide margin. Even more interesting, demand for stablecoins is increasingly coming from companies that aren’t crypto native, but consider stablecoins as a genuinely superior technology for international payments. “That’s really been a change over the last year and a half, seeing those assets being used for their superior efficiency, rather than simply a way to gain exposure to crypto,” he said. Stablecoins will show the way for the tokenization of stocks , money market funds , and other, stranger types of financial products . De Patoul expects the financial system’s backend will be completely updated to improve user access to these vehicles. While tokenization is a bit of a newer and shinier concept for crypto natives — a little more like bleeding edge tech — stablecoins, with their “mind-boggling” potential, will likely remain the bigger story for years to come, De Patoul said. “Eventually, 50% of global payments are going to be made in stablecoins,” he said. “Stablecoins are going to continue to be the biggest use case for digital assets for the next few years.”",Opinion|Stablecoins|Keyrock|Opinion,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 02:03:06

HTE is a game-changing rewards platform built to onboard over 24 million non-crypto users into Web3 through a unified ecosystem of high-utility applications. Powered by Hedera’s secure infrastructure, HTE bridges the usability gap while delivering real token-based incentives. At launch, HTE integrates three leading apps: Cashtree, Berryfox, and Bibble—each powered by Blade Wallet’s SDK, making Web3 wallet creation and token rewards effortless for any user. Cashtree is Indonesia’s top mobile ad platform with over 20 million users and 1,000+ brand partnerships. Now expanding globally through Google Play, it introduces new Web3 reward mechanics via its ""Tap-to-Win"" Telegram mini-game. Berryfox, a cosmic idle P2E game rebuilt from Berrystore, blends NFT-based battles, mining, and crafting in a seamless, offline-compatible experience. Users explore planets, collect Ruby Stones, and earn HTE through passive and active gameplay. Mars Labs enters the HTE ecosystem with Bibble, a reward-driven app. Users can earn HTE by creating content and joining virtual events, making Bibble a next-gen mining and engagement hub. HTE connects these platforms through a single interoperable reward system, enhancing user engagement while preserving each app’s native experience. With one ecosystem and one token, user activity across any app amplifies the entire network's value. To celebrate its launch, HTE kicks off a global airdrop event via its official community. Users who activate mining in any of the apps will receive randomized HTE rewards—instantly distributed and visible in their Blade Wallet. With extra bonuses for missions and community participation, the incentive structure is built to drive early traction. HTE is already in discussion with top global exchanges for listings, alongside a phased token swap plan for existing holders. Designed for scalability and real usage, HTE sets a new standard in connecting apps, users, and rewards on-chain. With millions onboarded and three proven apps at launch, HTE marks a bold leap forward in Web3 adoption—not just launching a project, but igniting a movement. About HederaToEarn Hedera To Earn (HTE) is a large-scale Web3 rewards platform built on the Hedera mainnet, designed to connect real users with real utility across gaming, advertising, and metaverse applications.

BTC is now trading below $120,000 and might find bids near the $115,500 zone. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the new all-time high near $123,200. The price is trading below $120,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $117,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $120,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Corrects From New ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase after it cleared the $118,500 resistance zone. BTC gained pace for a move above the $120,000 and $122,000 resistance. The bulls even pumped the pair above the $123,000 zone. A new all-time high was formed at $123,140 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $108,636 swing low to the $123,140 high. Bitcoin is now trading below $120,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . However, the price is holding the 50% Fib level of the upward move from the $108,636 swing low to the $123,140 high. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $117,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $118,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $120,000 level. The next resistance could be $122,000. A close above the $122,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $123,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $125,000 level. The main target could be $130,000. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $120,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support is near the $115,850 level. The first major support is near the $115,500 level. The next support is now near the $114,150 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.

The address had held 80,009 BTC in total and had never previously moved funds in the modern era. According to on‑chain sleuth Lookonchain, “the Bitcoin OG with 80,009 BTC ($9.46 B) has transferred 40,009 BTC ($4.68 B) to Galaxy Digital,” and Galaxy “has directly deposited 6,000 BTC ($706 M) into Binance and Bybit.” Bitcoin OG Whale Awakens The activity began late Monday evening (UTC). First, 9,000 BTC—about $1.06 billion—left the dormant wallet, followed an hour later by another 7,843 BTC ($927 million) Over the next five hours several smaller tranches arrived at Galaxy Digital’s custodial accounts before the decisive push that brought the running total to 40,009 BTC. Blockchain explorers show the coins originated from a bech32 address that first received block rewards in early 2011, when bitcoin changed hands for less than one US dollar. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trajectory To $155,000: Why No Major Dips Are Expected From Here Notably, Galaxy Digital operates one of the largest over‑the‑counter (OTC) desks in the industry and regularly intermediates block trades for institutions seeking to avoid slippage on public venues. The firm advertises “premier execution” and bespoke liquidity provisioning for trades that are too large for order‑book execution. On‑chain analysts therefore read the wallet’s choice of counterparty as a signal that the owner intends to liquidate at least part of the hoard discreetly rather than deploy it into DeFi or cold storage. Within hours of receiving the coins, Galaxy split 6,000 BTC between Binance and Bybit, the two venues that currently post the deepest spot‑BTC liquidity. Bitcoin had just printed an all‑time high of $123,153 on 14 July, buoyed by Washington’s “Crypto Week” legislative push. As the OG whale’s transactions hit public mempools, spot prices recoiled more than 6%, sliding from $123,000 to an intraday low near $115,700 before stabilising around $116,900 at press time. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO With half of the stash now under Galaxy’s control and only a fraction confirmed as exchange deposits, traders are bracing for further transfers. If Galaxy executes an OTC cross, the impact could be muted; if the coins bleed into order books, bids at $112,000‑$115,000 will face a major test. US Inflation Data Dampens Sentiment However, today’s price drop can not solely be attributed to the OG whale’s doing; it coincided with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ June CPI print, which showed headline consumer prices rising 0.3 % month‑on‑month and 2.7 % year‑on‑year—up from 2.4 % in May—while core CPI ticked up 0.2 % on the month and 2.9 % on the year. The modest print pushed the dollar index above 95.5, and risk assets have been whipsawing ever since. “The price action on the dollar pretty much tells you everything you need to know about this CPI report—mixed and the market is trying to digest it and to figure out the direction today,” observed Daan Crypto Trades on X. At press time, BTC stood at $116,972.

A growing number of corporations are now accumulating ETH at an unprecedented pace. Ethereum Demand Showing No Signs Of Exhaustion According to an X post by crypto entrepreneur Kyle Reidhead, current demand for ETH has been “insane.” Specifically, ten Ethereum treasury firms have collectively accumulated more than 550,000 ETH – worth approximately $1.65 billion – over the past 30 days. Reidhead emphasized that this momentum is accelerating, with no signs of slowing. He noted that new ETH treasury companies are launching every week, and the largest of these may not have entered the market yet. Moreover, each of these companies is reportedly aiming to buy more ETH than they did the previous week. If this trend continues, ETH purchases could hit $2 billion in the next month, and potentially $3 billion the month after. While this demand will inevitably taper off at some point, it appears unlikely to do so in the near term. In particular, stablecoin supply growth and favorable digital asset regulations could further encourage companies to add crypto to their balance sheets. It’s worth noting that the week beginning July 14 marks “ Crypto Week ” in the US, during which three major digital asset bills are expected to face congressional votes. These bills focus on key issues like stablecoin regulation and the potential use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in monetary policy. ETH To Face Supply Shock? Reidhead added that in the past 30 days, ETH treasury firms have bagged as much as 0.5% of the total circulating ETH supply. These firms have also moved ETH into Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) contracts through staking or lending. The entrepreneur also drew a contrast between treasury buyers and Ethereum ETFs, stating that unlike ETFs, these treasury firms do not sell. Instead, they appear committed to accumulating and holding ETH long-term. He remarked: This is going to create a supply shock for ETH over the coming months, there’s really no way around it. Fade ETH and the treasury companies at your own caution. Supporting this thesis, data from SoSoValue shows that spot ETH ETFs have enjoyed nine consecutive weeks of positive inflows, with $907 million added in the week ending July 11. As of July 15, spot ETH ETFs have already received $259 million in fresh inflows. Another data point that strengthens the argument for a looming ETH supply shock is the rapidly depleting exchange reserves. That said, some caution is warranted . At press time, ETH trades at $3,018, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ether|Ethereum Adoption|ethereum etf|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-16 04:00:07

But some names are cutting through the noise. BlockDAG, Dogecoin, Hyperliquid, and XRP are gaining attention fast, showing signs of momentum and market interest. From early-stage excitement to long-time community favorites, these four projects are catching fire. If you’re tracking what traders are watching closely right now, these picks stand out. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Early Access with Major Buzz BlockDAG (BDAG) brings a chance to grab a coin before it hits public exchanges. While most people find projects after big price jumps, BDAG is still in presale and sitting at an entry price. It has already raised over $339 million and moved more than 23.9 billion coins. The project focuses on speed, scalability, and a decentralized setup, drawing in a large base of early supporters. The buzz keeps building as the price has jumped over 2,600% from its batch 1 start. Some market watchers think it could even aim for $1 down the line. With more than 200,000 holders and growing attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) is shaping up as one to watch. Right now, the coin is available at just $0.0016, while the latest batch price is $0.0276. That big gap has many acting fast to secure a spot before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. For anyone watching for early-stage moves, this could be a rare moment to get in while the price is still low. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE): More Than Just a Meme Play Dogecoin (DOGE) has pushed past its meme coin status to earn a real spot among the top crypto to buy now. Fueled by a loyal online following and repeated mentions from Elon Musk, DOGE is widely used for tipping, micro-payments, and community donations. Its strong presence across top exchanges makes it easy to access and trade. At the moment, DOGE is hovering around $0.17, with some analysts pointing toward a move to $0.20 or even $0.25 if market energy returns. The meme roots are still there, but so is real traction. With speculation still swirling about future use cases, DOGE keeps attracting attention from those chasing high-risk, high-reward plays in the crypto space. 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Big Momentum and Bigger Targets Hyperliquid (HYPE) has made a name fast, landing on the radar as a top crypto to buy now. Built as a gas-free Layer‑1 that supports fast-paced trading, HYPE is now seeing on-chain activity close to that of major centralised exchanges. Crypto funds and firms are already holding large HYPE reserves, pushing the project into the spotlight. It just hit a new all-time high around $48–$49 after a 20% weekly jump, though some warn a short-term pullback could follow if the market cools. Still, projections are heating up, with possible moves toward $60–$100 in the near term. With that kind of upside, HYPE is quickly turning heads across trading circles. 4. XRP (XRP): Big Moves in Global Transfers XRP (XRP) continues to earn its place as a top crypto to buy now. Known for its speed and low fees, it’s used by banks and remittance platforms worldwide. With a current price near $2.27 and a massive $130 billion market cap, XRP is trending upward again and may climb toward $5 by the end of the year. Some technical models even hint at a future between $4 and $7, with ultra-bullish scenarios pushing the price as high as $8–$27 if an XRP ETF and stronger regulations come through. With its real-world use and global reach, XRP keeps the spotlight as one of crypto’s long-term contenders. Why These 4 Coins Are Standing Out Right Now When looking at the top crypto to buy now , each of these coins brings something different. Dogecoin has culture, memes, and momentum. Hyperliquid brings serious speed and deep trading activity. XRP focuses on solving cross-border money movement with big financial backing. But BlockDAG stands apart with something the others don’t have: early access at just $0.0016. It’s still in presale, and prices are expected to rise fast ahead of the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. For anyone eyeing big upside before a coin hits exchanges, this may be the moment to jump in.

Reputational risk is no longer a factor, opening doors for crypto-bank partnerships. OCC, FDIC, and Fed push for secure handling of keys, data, and evolving crypto risk frameworks. Agencies Explain Rules for Crypto Custody On Monday, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC issued a joint statement explaining how banks should apply existing rules when holding crypto for customers. The statement does not introduce new policies but says banks must manage crypto risks like they would with any other service. The agencies said banks should have clear plans to handle cybersecurity, protect private keys, and keep sensitive data secure. These expectations apply before offering crypto safekeeping services. Banks Told to Adapt Risk Frameworks The regulators want banks to adjust their internal controls as the crypto market changes. They wrote: “A banking organization that is contemplating providing safekeeping for crypto-assets should consider the evolving nature of the crypto-asset market.” Banks are expected to maintain risk controls, response plans, and strong oversight. These steps should match the standards already in place for traditional financial products. In a related development , the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it is eliminating the use of “reputational risk” as a supervisory factor. This decision could shift how banks approach relationships with crypto businesses. New Flexibility for Crypto Activities In recent months, each agency has taken steps to allow more crypto use by banks. In May, the OCC said banks can buy and sell digital assets for their own portfolios. The FDIC followed by stating that banks do not need to notify the agency before starting crypto services. Meanwhile, these changes make it easier for banks to offer crypto-related products such as trading, custody, and settlement. Industry watchers say the joint statement is a move toward clear and consistent rules. Last week, the Senate confirmed Jonathan Gould as head of the OCC. Gould worked at blockchain company Bitfury and held senior roles at the OCC in the past. His background suggests more crypto experience at the top of the agency. Banks and regulators are now expected to work more closely as interest in digital assets continues to grow.

SUI’s steady climb in a shifting crypto market SUI is posting a notable 35% gain over the past month, trading between $3 and just under $4. Last week alone, it surged by over a third, signaling strong momentum. Despite a 14% dip over six months, SUI’s recent rally suggests it could challenge its resistance near $4.20. If it breaks through, crypto charts indicate a potential push toward $5. Strong support at $2.50 provides a safety net, and upward RSI trends hint at growing investor confidence. Yet, SUI’s volatility raises questions about sustainability. As crypto prices fluctuate, can SUI maintain its upward trajectory? Mutuum Finance, however, offers a different angle with its presale stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale gains traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. Over 70% of this phase is filled, signaling that the window to buy at this level is closing fast. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, and the token will launch at $0.06, ensuring a 100% return for current buyers. With $12,400,000 raised and 615 million tokens sold, Mutuum Finance is attracting 13,400 holders. The team has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities found, bolstering trust. Moreover, a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK rewards hunters across four severity tiers, enhancing security. Investors are eyeing MUTM as a top crypto to buy now. Innovative lending powers Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in DeFi with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts for automated, market-responsive interest rates, ensuring stability for lenders and borrowers. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer model enables direct transactions, ideal for volatile assets needing custom terms. This flexibility sets Mutuum Finance apart from centralized platforms, offering transparency and control. The project is also developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, reducing depegging risks compared to algorithmic rivals. Crypto investment in MUTM could yield significant returns, with analysts predicting a $3 post-launch price in 2025, a 100x gain from the current $0.03. Furthermore, a new dashboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing loyalty. Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem expands Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a dynamic ecosystem. Its mtTokens represent deposited assets like ETH or DAI, accruing interest and enabling trading or staking within the platform. A buyback program funnels protocol revenue into repurchasing MUTM tokens, rewarding stakers with passive income. The team is also planning Layer 2 scaling to cut gas fees and boost transaction speeds, positioning Mutuum Finance for global adoption. A $100,000 MUTM giveaway , split among 10 winners, requires a $50 presale investment and simple tasks like submitting a wallet address. As crypto prices rise, MUTM’s infrastructure makes it a standout crypto investment. Looking ahead to big gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top crypto to buy now, blending innovative lending with a secure, scalable ecosystem. Its presale at $0.03, backed by a CertiK audit and a $100,000 giveaway, positions it for explosive growth, potentially hitting $3 in 2025. SUI’s 35% rally is impressive, but its reliance on market trends contrasts with MUTM’s utility-driven model. Investors seeking stability and high returns are turning to Mutuum Finance. Join the presale to secure tokens before Phase 6’s price increase. The crypto market is buzzing, and MUTM stands out as a calculated bet for the future.

As the crypto market heats up, investors are eyeing both tokens for explosive growth. Dogecoin’s bullish surge DOGE is riding a wave of momentum, climbing 19.7% in two weeks. Its price recently broke the $0.196 resistance, a level that stalled gains in June. Technical charts show higher lows and higher highs since June 22, signaling bullish strength. Analysts like CryptoKaleo note similarities to DOGE’s 2020 pattern, which led to a massive rally. The next target lies between $0.23 and $0.25, a 27% jump from current levels. However, a $1 price seems plausible, though a $72 repeat of 2020’s 36,000% surge is unlikely due to DOGE’s unlimited supply. Crypto prices today reflect cautious optimism for DOGE’s next move. Moreover, DOGE’s reliance on market sentiment and Bitcoin’s performance raises questions about sustainability. Its inflationary model limits long-term value retention compared to structured DeFi projects. Investors seeking stability may look elsewhere. Mutuum Finance’s presale power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charging through Phase 5 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. Over 70% of this phase is filled, signaling urgency for investors. The price has tripled from $0.01 in Phase 1, and Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% hike to $0.035. With a launch price of $0.06, buyers now secure a 100% return. Experts predict MUTM could hit $5 post-launch, a 16,566% leap from its current price. The project has raised 12,400,000, with 615 million tokens sold and 13,400 holders onboard. Crypto investment in MUTM is surging due to its tangible utility. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their positions. This incentivizes long-term commitment, setting MUTM apart in the crypto market. Innovative DeFi lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts for dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability. The Peer-to-Peer model allows direct lending, ideal for volatile assets. Both offer flexibility and transparency, surpassing centralized platforms. A native stablecoin, pegged to USD on Ethereum, is in development, reducing depegging risks. This stablecoin will enhance liquidity and simplify transactions. Mutuum Finance’s focus on crypto investing prioritizes user control and efficiency, making it a standout. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities. Its Bug Bounty Program, partnered with CertiK, offers $50,000 in rewards across four tiers, reinforcing trust in its ecosystem. Scaling for the future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building beyond lending. Its mtTokens represent deposited assets, accruing interest and enabling trading or staking. Buybacks of MUTM tokens fund rewards for stakers, ensuring passive income. Mutuum Finance’s infrastructure positions it as a top crypto for long-term growth. Consequently, its blend of utility and innovation makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a compelling choice in today’s crypto market. Tying it all together Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a top crypto to buy now, offering a 100% return at its $0.06 launch price. Its $5 price prediction for 2025 dwarfs DOGE’s $1 target, driven by a robust DeFi ecosystem. While DOGE rides market sentiment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers real-world utility through lending, stablecoins, and Layer 2 scaling. Investors seeking the best crypto to invest in should act fast—Phase 5 is nearly full. Join the presale and explore Mutuum Finance’s potential to reshape DeFi.

Remember when Dogecoin barked its way onto the charts? That moment is back, but this time, it’s clawing instead of barking. Meme coins are booming again, and degens are piling into wild new projects with explosive upside. From AI-driven narratives to nostalgia-fueled bangers like Notcoin and Housecoin, June 2025 is already shaping up to be a month where fortunes are made, or missed. The one presale stealing the spotlight? A cosmic cat prankster called Trollercat , currently in Stage 13 of its 26-stage presale, with over $325,000 already raised, more than 1,400 token holders, and an ROI gain of 1581.2% from Stage 1. But it’s not the only one rising. Alongside $TCAT, meme legends like Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT), LOFI ($LOFI), Official Trump ($TRUMP), and more are flooding feeds across CT. So if you’re looking to scoop the top 10 meme coins before the entry price launches into orbit, read fast. Every stage delay with $TCAT means 15% more per token. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Every now and then, a meme coin emerges that flips the rulebook, eats the pages, and spits out something revolutionary. Troller Cat is exactly that. Built on Ethereum, this isn’t just another “funny token” — it’s a 69% APY-staking, deflationary, Game Center–powered troll fest backed by legendary lore. With Trollercat presale Stage 13 live and themed after The Friday Phenomenon, a nod to Rebecca Black’s infamous internet anthem, \$TCAT is harmonizing chaos and rewards like never before. From a first-stage price of $0.00000500 to today’s $0.00008406, the numbers speak volumes. That’s 1581.2% ROI for early believers, and there’s still room to pounce. With only 13 stages left until launch and a hard listing price of $0.0005309, anyone buying now is sitting on a potential 531.57% upside, assuming they don’t wait and watch that opportunity slip through their claws. 69% APY Staking Trollercat staking isn’t just live, it’s lethal. While most meme coins bank on vibes, this cat banks on compound chaos. Investors staking their $TCAT earn a monstrous 69% APY, rewarding loyalty with real gains. And the best part? Staking is unlocked anytime, but rewards are locked for 2 months post-launch, preventing dumpers and boosting post-launch momentum. Let’s Talk ROI: Imagine staking $15,000 at Stage 13. At a 69% APY and a projected listing ROI of 531.57%, you’re looking at a post-launch valuation of $94,735.50, plus rewards. That’s life-changing. New car. College debt cleared. Or just stack that ETH bag higher. The only wrong move? Not moving. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With wild staking rewards, a meme-fueled Game Center, and one of the most committed deflationary burn systems in crypto, Trollercat presale is what happens when internet history meets smart tokenomics. Buy before this cat slips through your fingers. 2. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) The meme god has spoken, and he screams in caps lock. Goatseus Maximus takes degenerate hype and wraps it in divine imagery, promising “goat-tier gains” with an ultra-low cap, fair launch, and an NFT-based battle game where holders compete for on-chain supremacy. It’s absurd, it’s chaotic, and it’s gaining traction fast across Telegram shill threads. The roadmap teases oracle-run prophecies, themed staking tournaments, and limited edition minting events that tie into Greek-myth style comic drops. Engagement is growing, and the community’s trolling energy fits perfectly into meme coin season. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Community-powered chaos, plus a roadmap that includes NFT goat battles and burn-to-level mechanics? Goatseus could moon or explode, and that’s why it belongs on any top 10 meme coins list. 3. LOFI ($LOFI) Calm beats. Clean vibes. LOFI leans into chill branding and long-term tokenomics. Inspired by lo-fi music culture, it rewards users for simply holding and relaxing. With staking at 11%, a slow minting curve, and NFT drops synced to classic lo-fi tracks, this one’s building quietly, but stacking loud attention. Token burns occur every time a user mints an NFT. Holders can also participate in “chill raids” to earn extra incentives. The low volatility model appeals to investors who want meme coin energy without constant chart-checking. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Not every meme coin needs to yell. LOFI is the lo-fi banger of the top 10 meme coins list, offering peace, chill, and passive ETH flow to diamond hands. 4. Official Trump ($TRUMP) $TRUMP isn’t subtle, it’s a political meme coin engineered to grab headlines and fuel tribal buying. With election season heating up, its daily volume has exploded. Holding certain amounts unlocks NFTs like “MAGA-Pepe” and “Wall Builder,” which earn bonuses during staking cycles. Whether for laughs or gainz, people are aping in. It also features meme wars where two sides vote on-chain to trigger either a burn or token redistribution. Political satire meets crypto rebellion in a volatile yet captivating project. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Because attention = volatility = gains. $TRUMP’s on every radar, and its virality puts it firmly in the top 10 meme coins this month. 5. Notcoin ($NOT) The irony coin that keeps not trying, but keeps pumping. Born from Telegram’s mini-games, $NOT has evolved into a gamified L2 ecosystem where “not playing” might just make you rich. With over 40M downloads and in-game mining mechanics, it’s less a meme, more a cult. Developers recently teased a decentralized trivia game, where wrong answers earn you more $NOT than right ones. It’s trolling logic itself, and the community loves it. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With a user base rivaling legit chains and a memetic brand that never breaks character, Notcoin earns its seat at the top 10 meme coins table. 6. Dogs ($DOGS) All the dogs, none of the fluff. $DOGS is a low-tax, dog-pack-themed token that rewards holders for backing the most “loyal breeds.” Its multichain compatibility and leaderboard structure drive engagement while maintaining meme quality. It’s weird, and it’s working. Pack battles, team staking wars, and pup NFTs make this one feel like Pokémon for degens. The supply is fixed, and the community is doggedly active. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It gamifies loyalty and lets the dog coins fight it out for supremacy. That’s meme innovation, and that’s top 10 meme coins material. 7. Act I: The AI Prophecy ($ACT) What if AI became sentient just to pump its own bags? $ACT rides the AI narrative with story-driven tokenomics, weekly plot twists on-chain, and holders determining the ending. NFTs unlock “code fragments” that may someday trigger a massive token burn or vault release. Its lore has gone viral, with fan theories and animations flooding social feeds. As the story deepens, so does the community’s investment. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Narrative-powered chaos, an engaged community, and AI-fueled lore? That’s how you blend storytelling with memecoinery. A clear pick for the top 10 meme coins. 8. Cheems ($CHEEMS) He’s back. The OG doge sidekick has re-emerged with a new token and play-to-earn clicker game where players mine Cheemsburgers. It’s simple, dumb, and instantly addicting. Supply is limited, and Cheems is finally getting the solo spotlight he deserves. $CHEEMS has partnered with meme merch stores and offers discounts when paid in Cheems. That kind of offline tie-in adds serious credibility. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Meme royalty never dies. Cheems is surging again with the kind of nostalgia-driven pump CT lives for. Definitely one of the top 10 meme coins to hold now. 9. Housecoin ($HOUSE) Born out of satire for the housing market, $HOUSE lets you own a piece of “digital rent.” The tokenomics include adjustable “interest rates,” foreclosure events, and airdropped HOA fees (yes, really). It’s dark comedy meets smart contract. $HOUSE is working on a Metaverse game where holders can build virtual homes and rent them out using NFT lease contracts. It’s both absurd and oddly functional. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Housing memes meet DeFi chaos. The narrative is strong, the engagement is stronger, and that earns $HOUSE a spot on this top 10 meme coins roundup. 10. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW) The feline resistance is real. $MEW is the anti-dog memecoin, marketing itself as the cat revolution in a dog-dominated crypto landscape. With clawbacks, scratch tokens, and community-driven burns, this one’s clawing up the ranks with purr-sistence. Its community has declared July “National Scratch Month” where bonus burns occur weekly. Memes are strong, branding is clean, and momentum is building. Why This Coin Made It to the List: A cat memecoin rising among dogs? That narrative alone makes $MEW worthy of a top 10 meme coins nod. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Best Meme Coins to Invest (top 10 meme coins) in June 2025 are Troller Cat, $GOAT, $LOFI, $TRUMP, and more. From meme chaos to staking utility, these projects show how ridiculous ideas can evolve into ROI-producing assets. With Trollercat’s 69% APY, ultra-tight referral system, and deflationary buyback model, the presale value just keeps climbing. Meanwhile, other tokens ride community hype, game theory, or cultural parody, making this month rich with upside. Buy now before this cat claws its way out of reach.

Binance Coin (BNB) pumps Binance Coin (BNB) dipped 0.5% this week, settling at $686, despite earlier bullish signals. The Maxwell upgrade, slashing block times by 47%, and a $1B token burn failed to sustain momentum amid profit-taking after a $700 peak. Declining DEX volume (-15% to $4.9B) and a bearish MACD crossover reflect fading enthusiasm, with technicals pointing to a $650 support test if selling persists. Regulatory scrutiny in Asia and US-BRICS trade tensions further dented sentiment. BNB’s slip could sour sentiment for exchange tokens, dragging down CRO and KCS, as investors pivot to Layer-1s like SOL. Blockchain stocks, particularly Binance-linked firms, may face sell-offs amid global trade fears. In forex, a resurgent dollar amplifies BNB’s downside, but renewed burn momentum and Binance’s NFT marketplace expansion could spark a rebound, potentially targeting $720 if $700 resistance breaks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized protocol designed to help users unlock passive income from their crypto holdings, without giving up custody. At the core of this system is the upcoming Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending model, which will allow users to deposit assets like AVAX, ETH, and major stablecoins into smart contract-managed liquidity pools. In return, depositors are expected to receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that automatically increase in value as interest accrues. These mtTokens can be held, used as collateral, or even traded on secondary markets. The envisioned P2C model is intended to create a fluid and efficient lending environment. Take AVAX as an example: a user who deposits $5,000 worth of AVAX into a pool with an estimated yield of 9.2% APY will earn consistent returns depending on pool utilization. On the other side, a borrower would deposit that same AVAX as collateral and unlock $3,500 in liquidity based on a 70% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. This setup enables the borrower to maintain upside exposure to AVAX’s market performance, while the lender earns steady income, backed by overcollateralized risk management. All of this is set to function via audited smart contracts, without relying on custodians, middlemen, or centralized gatekeepers. $12.35M raised, price climbing, and only 27% tokens left in current phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted over $12.35 million in presale contributions, currently in Phase 5 at a token price of $0.03. With over 13,300 holders already on board and 73% of this round sold out, it’s becoming clear that this isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a DeFi protocol gaining real traction. Once Phase 5 is complete, the price will automatically move to $0.035, with a planned listing at $0.06. That means early buyers from Phase 1 who exchanged $1,000 worth of LINK for MUTM are already sitting on double their value, with another 100% upside to go before listing. Security has also taken center stage. The project has undergone a detailed audit by CertiK, achieving a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 77.50. To reinforce this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with rewards tiered by severity—critical, major, minor, and low. This initiative supports a security-first approach that’s attracting technically-minded contributors and long-term investors alike. With only 27% of Phase 5 tokens left, investors are rushing to secure their position before the next price jump. The rapid sellout pace highlights strong interest in real DeFi utility, not just hype. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prepares to roll out its beta version in parallel with the token listing. The protocol will also benefit from Layer-2 integration, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions that solve common issues like congestion and high gas fees, key improvements for user experience. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just building a new lending platform—it’s building a new standard for DeFi income. While large-cap assets like BNB show signs of slowing, MUTM is racing ahead, offering both passive income and price growth in a single, scalable protocol.

The move signals Citigroup’s deepening commitment to blockchain-based payments and infrastructure, as traditional financial institutions increasingly explore digital assets to streamline settlement and enhance global transfers. Citigroup Builds Crypto Custody Framework Fraser said the bank is also exploring reserve management for stablecoins and developing custody solutions for crypto assets. *CITI CEO JANE FRASER: CITIGROUP IS EXPLORING ISSUING A STABLECOIN $C pic.twitter.com/790Ob0UZ3Y — Investing.com (@Investingcom) July 15, 2025 Citi isn’t just trying to keep up in the stablecoin space. Fraser said the real goal is to upgrade the bank’s infrastructure in ways that bring clear, real-world benefits to its clients. “We aim to deliver the benefits of advancements in stablecoin and digital assets to our clients in a safe and sound manner by modernizing our own infrastructure and improving efficiency, transparency, and interoperability,” Fraser said. Citi Bets on Stablecoins for 24/7 Finance As digital payments shift toward always-on, instant settlement, stablecoins offer a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto-native world. Fraser said that Citi’s focus is guided by customer needs. “Digital assets are the next evolution in the broader digitization of payments, financing, and liquidity,” she said. “Ultimately, what we care about is what our clients want and how do we meet that need.” The bank’s strategy includes four focus areas: reserve management, custody services, seamless fiat-to-crypto on and off ramps, and tokenized deposits. Together, these could form the foundation of a robust offering that positions Citi at the heart of a rapidly changing payments landscape. Stablecoin Market Set to Top $2 Trillion Citigroup is not alone in this effort. Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo had begun exploring a possible shared stablecoin initiative . The project, if realized, could accelerate institutional adoption of blockchain technology. The stablecoin market, once a niche corner of the crypto world, is growing rapidly. Citi projects that market capitalization could rise from roughly $260b today to over $2t by 2030. Under a base-case scenario, the bank sees supply hitting $1.6t by decade’s end, with a more bullish outlook estimating $3.7t. For a global bank with exposure to trade finance, treasury services and cross-border flows, venturing into stablecoins makes strategic sense. These digital tokens, pegged to fiat currencies, promise real-time settlement without the inefficiencies of legacy banking rails. While regulators remain cautious, the broader trend is clear. With clients demanding 24/7 settlement and greater transparency, stablecoins are becoming less of a speculative experiment and more of a necessary upgrade.

The price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $2.840 support zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.880 zone. The price is now trading above $2.840 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.840 zone. XRP Price Retains Gains XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.750 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.850 resistance level. The recent move was positive and the bulls pushed the price above the $3.00 level. A high was formed at $3.0324 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below $2.90 level, and the price spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.0324 high. However, the bulls were active near the $2.80 support zone. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.9450 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.00 level. A clear move above the $3.00 resistance might send the price toward the $3.080 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance or even $3.150 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.20 zone. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $2.9450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.880 level and the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $2.840 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.840 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.750 support. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.

At the heart of the dispute is a push by some members of the GOP to include a ban on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the legislation. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he is hopeful the House will attempt to pass a procedural vote on Wednesday. “It’s a priority of the White House, the Senate and the House to do all of these crypto bills,” he stated, as reported by Politico. Disagreements on Strategy and Bill Structure The package includes the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, along with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, and the CLARITY Act, which proposes a new market framework for crypto assets. Some Republicans have argued that the bills should be bundled into one, but Speaker Johnson pushed back, warning the Senate would not approve such a move. “We have to do them in succession,” Johnson reportedly said. This legislative push is part of the Republican-led “Crypto Week,” intended to pass meaningful crypto regulation before Congress adjourns for a month-long break in August. In response, Democrats have dubbed the effort “anti-crypto corruption week” to express their opposition. CBDC Concerns Drive Republican Resistance Tensions escalated on Tuesday when 13 Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, voted against considering the bills. Among those dissenting were lawmakers such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Biggs, and Victoria Spartz. Several lawmakers took to X to clarify that they weren’t opposed to crypto regulations in general, but refused to support the GENIUS Act without an explicit CBDC ban. “I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on central bank digital currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments,” Greene said. Biggs echoed the sentiment, warning that the current version of the bill could allow for a layered CBDC and lacked guarantees for self-custody. “House Leadership must allow an open amendment process so Members can freely debate and improve the bill,” he added. Past and Future of the GENIUS Act The GENIUS Act had previously failed its first Senate vote in May due to Democratic concerns about Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto. It eventually passed in June with bipartisan support. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long urged calm after Tuesday’s delay, noting that the Senate also required a second vote to move forward on the GENIUS Act. “BEFORE Y’ALL FREAK OUT, don’t forget that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the GENIUS Act failed as well…the second one passed 11 days later,” she wrote on X. Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, argued that the current bill already restricts the Federal Reserve from creating a retail CBDC. Speaker Johnson Continues Talks According to ABC News, Speaker Johnson is continuing discussions with Republican holdouts. However, one of the main sticking points remains whether the three bills should be passed together or separately. “They want to push that and merge them together,” Johnson said. “We’re trying to work with the White House and with our Senate partners on this.” The House is scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday to resume its legislative work.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-16 05:15:17

On Wednesday, the Nasdaq-listed company purchased 6,377 ETH , worth about $19.56m at current prices. That brings SharpLink’s total to nearly 312,000 ETH, valued at roughly $974m, based on Wednesday’s price of $3,122.98 per coin. The latest buy follows a 24,371 ETH purchase made on July 15, a $73m outlay. Between July 7 and July 13, SharpLink picked up another 74,656 ETH for $213m , averaging $2,852 per coin. SharpLink Buys 10K ETH Directly From Ethereum Foundation In one of the most notable transactions, the company directly acquired 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation. SharpLink( @SharpLinkGaming ) bought another 6,377 $ETH ($19.56M) today. In the past 7 days, they've accumulated 91,330 $ETH ($275M). https://t.co/8pOfvpDWym pic.twitter.com/NGepBvYcP4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2025 Since late May, SharpLink has been accumulating Ethereum in large batches, often moving funds on-chain through major centralized exchanges and over-the-counter addresses. This deliberate strategy suggests a long-term view, possibly tied to expectations of major price moves or upcoming upgrades to the Ethereum protocol. The company’s pivot into Ethereum marks a strategic shift. While it remains focused on its core business in sports betting and iGaming, SharpLink is now using ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. That decision came after a $425m private placement led by Consensys, with participation from Pantera Capital, Electric Capital and ParaFi Capital. The move was first announced on May 27, 2025. SharpLink Nears Ethereum Foundation in Holdings Size CEO Rob Phythian has framed the acquisitions as a defining moment for public company engagement with crypto. He said over 99% of SharpLink’s Ethereum holdings are staked or restaked in protocols to generate yield while supporting the security of the Ethereum network. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin, who now chairs SharpLink’s board, has described the firm’s strategy as a public-market proxy for Ethereum exposure, similar to MicroStrategy’s approach with Bitcoin. Lubin emphasized Ethereum’s importance for decentralized applications and digital commerce, pointing to favorable U.S. legislation as a major tailwind. With its daily buying spree showing no signs of slowing, SharpLink could soon overtake the Ethereum Foundation itself, which currently holds around $725m worth of ETH. The company’s positioning reflects a broader trend, as corporations increasingly look beyond Bitcoin and toward Ethereum as a programmable, yield-bearing asset. Investors are taking notice. SharpLink’s stock was up more than 14% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.

The main goal of the task force is to enhance government transparency and efficiency. Meanwhile, crypto’s political influence is growing as Fairshake PAC gathered $141 million to support pro-crypto candidates ahead of the 2026 elections. Despite these advances, key legislation like the GENIUS Act is facing some headwinds in the House. California Partners with Crypto Firms California Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled a new initiative that will help boost government efficiency by bringing together leaders from the cryptocurrency sector to help modernize public services. Dubbed the California Breakthrough Project , the task force includes representatives from Ripple, Coinbase, and MoonPay, among others. It even held its first meeting on June 6 at Ripple’s San Francisco headquarters. The project’s goal is to improve collaboration between regulators and technology firms while also addressing inefficiencies and enhancing transparency in public services. Although Newsom did not specify how blockchain technology might be directly implemented, the inclusion of major crypto firms suggests that the state is seriously considering the role of blockchain in public sector innovation. Part of Gavin Newsom’s announcement California is already a major hub for blockchain activity, with roughly 25% of North America's blockchain companies based in the state. This is according to a recent report by the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency. That same report mentioned the potential for blockchain-based entrepreneurship and innovation to contribute meaningfully to government services and consumer engagement. Newsom's announcement coincided with US Crypto Week, which is a pivotal moment in federal crypto policy where lawmakers prepare to debate several major digital asset bills. Among them are the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, and the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for US dollar-backed stablecoins. Overall, California's decision to formally involve the blockchain industry in state-level innovation initiatives is a major shift in how public institutions are beginning to embrace digital assets and the technologies behind them. Fairshake Builds Political War Chest The growing connection between crypto and politics is becoming harder and harder to miss. Fairshake, a US-based political action committee supported by major crypto firms, recently reported holding $141 million in funds that are specifically aimed at influencing upcoming elections. In the first half of 2025 alone, Fairshake raised approximately $52 million, with Coinbase contributing $25 million. This figure adds to the $109 million the PAC accumulated since November of 2024, which gives it more financial firepower than it deployed in the previous US election cycle. Through affiliated organizations like Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress, Fairshake already spent more than $2 million this year in support of candidates running in special House elections in Virginia and Florida. The PAC also previously spent more than $130 million in 2024 to support candidates seen as favorable to cryptocurrency or to oppose those who were deemed hostile to the industry. According to spokesperson Josh Vlasto, Fairshake is actively evaluating races for both the remainder of 2025 and into the 2026 midterm elections. The PAC did not exist during the 2022 midterms, when much of the crypto industry’s political spending was steered by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who has since been indicted for fraud. While Fairshake did not directly back Donald Trump’s campaign, some well known people in the industry like the Winklevoss twins, Ripple Labs executives, and Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell individually contributed to the president. These contributions come as PAC spending increasingly shapes the legislative environment around digital assets in Congress. After the 2024 elections, Republicans secured narrow control of both the House and Senate, with around 270 lawmakers reportedly aligned with pro-crypto views. Fairshake now seems ready to continue its influence heading into 2026, which could potentially deepen the partisan divide on crypto-related legislation. This week, House Republicans are pushing forward with three key bills focused on payment stablecoins, market structure, and central bank digital currencies. Trump instructed all GOP members to support the stablecoin legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, including new House members from Florida who were backed by crypto PAC funds. GENIUS Act Hits Roadblock Despite crypto making a lot of progress in politics, legislation to regulate payment stablecoins failed to advance in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, despite Trump’s public push for action. The president urged Republicans to approve the GENIUS Act, which is part of a package of crypto-related bills Republican leaders hoped to pass during “crypto week.” However, a key procedural vote fell short, reportedly with at least 13 Republicans voting against it. President Trump post on Truth Social House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested a second vote could take place later in the day, and the GENIUS Act may still reach the House floor by Thursday. The bill previously passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. Trump’s backing of the GENIUS Act attracted a lot of criticism due to revelations that his family-linked company, World Liberty Financial, launched its own stablecoin, USD1, with help from Binance. The stablecoin was allegedly involved in facilitating a $2 billion investment by an Abu Dhabi firm into Binance, which raised serious ethical and national security concerns due to foreign funding and the president’s financial ties to the industry. Press release Democrats responded by launching an “ anti-crypto corruption week ,” and calling for amendments to the digital asset bills that would ban elected officials from holding or promoting cryptocurrencies to prevent conflicts of interest. With Republicans holding a slim majority, political and financial stakes around crypto legislation will certainly stay high heading into the 2026 elections.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|SPONSORED|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-16 05:30:00

Core CPI rose just 0.1% month-over-month for the fifth straight time, fanning bullish sentiment across crypto markets despite broader equity weakness. “The data was bullish for crypto, as the Fed may be more likely to cut interest rates in September, potentially triggering more capital to flow into the crypto industry,” said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer of OSL. “Bitcoin’s price held up well as a testament to traders’ optimism, despite some crypto stocks dropping after the GENIUS Act failed to pass a procedural vote, which will continue to be refined by lawmakers for another vote,"" Cheung added. The data sparked a rebound in ether (ETH) which reclaimed the $3,100 level amid inflows into spot ETFs and tailwinds from a newly passed stablecoin bill, seen as reinforcing ETH’s role as a base layer for tokenized dollars. Dogecoin (DOGE) was sitting near 19 cents, delivering a modest 2.7% daily climb and extending its weekly gain to roughly 15%. Solana's SOL (SOL) remains steady at $163, while XRP (XRP) trades near $2.92, reflecting steady interest. BNB (BNB) trades around $688, holding onto recent gains, and TRON's TRX (TRX) remains flat at about 3 cents. Institutional flows remained strong. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs logged their ninth consecutive day of net inflows, with $403 million added Tuesday. BlackRock’s IBIT alone saw $416 million in new funds, more than offsetting $70 million in combined outflows from GBTC, FBTC and ARKB, according to SoSoValue. Spot ether (ETH) ETFs also posted $192 million in inflows, their eighth straight positive day. In the macro backdrop, Asian markets slipped and U.S. equity futures dipped as traders reassessed the pace of potential rate cuts. While some firms are reportedly passing tariff-related costs to consumers, Fed officials remain cautious. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan noted that the central bank may still need to hold rates steady unless labor markets or inflation weaken further. Still, crypto traders appear to be looking past short-term policy noise. “Despite a temporary setback for the GENIUS Act, Bitcoin has been able to maintain a solid position at around $118,000” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “We remain positive that the current bull run still has much runway left to see higher prices in the second half of the year.” Read more: U.S. June CPI Rose an In Line 0.3%; Core Rate Slightly Better Than Hoped at 0.2%",Markets|Markets|Ether|Dogecoin|Bitcoin|Inflation|Fed|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-16 05:31:52

Brandon Lutnick, the Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, is in “late-stage talks” with Back on a direct Bitcoin transfer deal, exceeding $3 billion, sources told the Financial Times . Cantor Equity Partners 1, a special-purpose acquisition company, would issue new shares to Back in exchange for 30,000 Bitcoin. Further, the company seeks to raise $800 million in outside capital for additional Bitcoin purchases, the report said. Following the completion of the transaction, the vehicle will be renamed BSTR Holdings. Cantor Equity Partners 1 launched in January with $200 million from its IPO to target crypto investments.

Brandon Lutnick took over as chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald early this year, after his father, Howard Lutnick, joined the Trump administration as commerce secretary. Cantor’s combined SPAC, BSTR Holdings and Twenty One Capital, could accumulate nearly $10 billion in Bitcoin this year. Additionally, in the Cantor-Blockstream deal, the investment banking giant would partner with one of the crypto industry’s earliest supporters – Adam Back. Back, who has long championed institutional adoption as a path to “hyperbitcoinization,” has personally funded several Bitcoin-focused companies. In June, he funded a $15 million convertible bond for Swedish health technology and bitcoin treasury company H100 Group, which has plans to stockpile Bitcoin . Crypto Investors Turn to SPAC or Reverse Mergers Several crypto investors are turning to SPACs to publicly list their crypto ventures. Recently, Trump’s crypto adviser, David Bailey-led Nakamoto Holdings announced that it had raised $51.5 million for its own Bitcoin treasury firm, which it plans to take public via merger with KindlyMD. Last month, Anthony Pompliano announced a $1 billion business merger to create a Bitcoin-native firm, ProCap Financial. The company will go public through a SPAC with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. If completed, the Cantor SPAC deal would become the latest in a series of high-profile deals to buy Bitcoin.

Gold prices edged up to around $3,330 per ounce on Wednesday, following a two-day decline, as investors assessed a pick-up in US inflation and ongoing trade developments. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.45% to around 39,716 while broader Topix Index fell 0.4% to 2,815 on Wednesday, with Japanese shares showing mixed performance. The Japanese yen weakened toward 149 per dollar on Wednesday, its lowest level since early April. On the domestic front, sentiment among Japanese manufacturers improved slightly in July, supported by a rebound in the semiconductor sector. Markets are now turning attention to upcoming trade and inflation data from Japan, which may offer further insight into the local fallout from tariff threats. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.23% to below 3,500 while the Shenzhen Component shed 0.05% to 10,740 on Wednesday, extending losses from the previous session amid trade uncertainties, and the offshore yuan President Donald Trump said the US would be fighting China “in a very friendly fashion,” although there appears to be no progress in trade negotiations. Meanwhile, analysts noted that Nvidia’s resumption of H20 AI chip sales to China could signal a positive tone for trade talks with the U.S. ahead of the August deadline. Optimism also grew around the upcoming July Politburo meeting, with hopes it may deliver fresh measures to sustain growth in H2 of 2025. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.13% to 24,760 on Wednesday morning, extending gains for the fifth session and notching their highest level in four months. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.18% to 82,416 in morning trade on Wednesday, snapping the previous session’s gains as traders turned cautious amid ongoing US–India trade negotiations. However, the decline was partially offset by positive trade data, as India’s trade deficit narrowed in June 2025 for the first time in three months. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.83% to around 8,545 on Wednesday, retreating from a record level finish in the prior session. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.653 on Wednesday, snapping a three-day losing streak, as investors turned their attention to Thursday’s labor market data. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors digested hotter June inflation data, a fresh batch of big bank earnings, and news that Nvidia may resume chip sales to China.

Price predictions for 2025 suggest highs of $50 and potential ETF approval. Long-term forecasts indicate AVAX could reach $518.50 by 2030. Avalanche has become a go-to platform for developers, especially after its Avalanche 9000 mainnet upgrade and the launch of the AVAX card in early 2025. With lower fees and growing real-world use cases, plus backing from giants like Mastercard and SMBC, AVAX is gaining serious traction.

Moreover, the upcoming years are expected to be bullish, with a conservative momentum. With an optimistic outlook, we expect the AVAX coin price to reach $50 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $12.36 $30.91 $49.46 Avalanche Price Target July 2025 The price prediction for Avalanche (AVAX) in July 2025 suggests that bulls have regained control and moved past short-term EMA hurdles and aimed at 200-day EMA band, flipping this would push AVAX to the $26.50 resistance level. In a more optimistic scenario, prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3 2025, only if momentum remains strong. However, if momentum doesn’t sustain above the 200-day EMA, then momentum could rise for a brief time, and AVAX might retreat to $20 or $15 support in that upcoming short-term scenario. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) AVAX Price Target July 2025 15.00 26.50 33.06 AVAX Price Prediction 2025 Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining traction among developers, thanks to its high throughput and low fees, making it an attractive platform for gaming applications. Looking ahead, there’s a promising outlook for the AVAX price in 2025. A Bloomberg ETF analyst recently suggested that an AVAX ETF could receive approval by the end of the year, with a 90% chance of success. This potential approval could significantly boost adoption and drive prices higher. Meanwhile, a look at its daily technical chart reveals that after a challenging Q1 2025, where AVAX dropped to $14.65, the price showed some recovery in Q2, climbing to $26.50 by mid-May. However, by the end of Q2, it retreated to around $16, facing strong resistance from the 200-day EMA band. Interestingly, the $15-$16 support area has been tested three times in Q2, indicating that bearish pressure is weakening at this level. Even from late June to mid-July, AVAX has surged to $22 following bullish altcoin sentiment. The AVAX is on the brink of forming a golden cross between the 20-day and 50-day for a sustained uptrend and inching towards the 200-day EMA band’s resistance. This is increasing investors’ hopes for H2 to be better than H1. Therefore, if bulls continue the July’s bullish momentum, a short-term rally could push AVAX back to the $26.50 resistance by July 2025. In a more bullish scenario, prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3. For the long term, a price target of $50 is feasible, provided that AVAX maintains above $26.50 and closes daily above this level. Achieving this would signal a shift in trend, breaking the bearish pattern and indicating a Change of Character (ChoCh) followed by an upward Break of Structure (BoS). However, this bullish outlook could be overturned if a strong bearish activity stops $26.50 breach, then AVAX will have no choice but to retreat back to $15 demand area.

The asset has gained 22% over the past month, but remains down 10% on the year.

Ethereum is also set to benefit from a general rise in risk appetite, he noted, adding that Federal Reserve rate cuts, expected later this year, will lead to increased liquidity, which is positive for risk assets such as cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel has taken a 9.1% stake in Tom Lee’s BitMine as the Ethereum treasury momentum builds, according to an SEC filing . “ETH is going so much higher, and thank you for all the work you’re doing to communicate that to your peers,” commented ‘DeFi Dad,’ who predicted that the asset would top out at between $15,000 and $30,000 this cycle. “One of the best-looking charts right now is Ethereum,” commented trader and analyst ‘Income Sharks,’ who suggested prices would reach $5,000 by September.

It is the highest that ETH has traded since early February. Ethereum has surged almost 30% over the past fortnight, outperforming the wider crypto market after more than a year in the doldrums. However, it still has a long way to go and remains below the July 2024 price of $3,500. Institutions are driving momentum, and retail has yet to join the party, as Ether ETFs have seen more than $1 billion in inflows over the past week, and ETH treasury companies have stacked more than $1.6 billion worth over the past month.

The price is now facing hurdles near $692 and might dip again toward the $675 support. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $675 support zone. The price is now trading below $690 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $692 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).

A low was formed at $674 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above $680.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $692 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $690 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $692 level. The next resistance sits near the $695 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $707 swing high to the $674 low. A clear move above the $695 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $708. A close above the $708 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $720 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $732 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $692 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $682 level. The next major support is near the $680 level.

Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. Algorand’s strong push for scalability, security, and decentralization is paying off. With the launch of AlgoKit 3.0 in Q1 2025 and growing developer interest, ALGO adoption has improved and is now on the rise. The rising adoption is beneficial for an asset, as it is directly proportional to a token’s price. But the big question for intrigued market participants still remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle? Read our in-depth Algorand Price Prediction 2025 and long-term outlook through 2030 to find out. Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Algorand Price Prediction Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Algorand Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast 2026 ALGO Coin Price Projection 2027 Algorand Crypto Price Action 2028 ALGO Token Price Analysis 2029 ALGO Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Algorand Token ALGO Price $ 0.27870982 1.01% Market cap $ 2,410,075,971.5879 Circulating Supply 8,647,259,034.5742 Trading Volume $ 278,673,672.5420 All-time high $3.28 Jun 21, 2019 All-time low $0.0958 Jun 10, 2023 CoinPedia’s Algorand Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Algorand Price Prediction, the forecast for the Algorand network is optimistic for the coming years. With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In Q4 2024, Algorand (ALGO) experienced a significant drive, reaching a high of $0.613, marking a remarkable 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. However, the excitement was short-lived as a sell-off intensified in the final month of 2024, extending that into Q1 2025. By the first week of April, ALGO’s price plummeted to a low of $0.1491, which established a strong multi-year support area. From the second week of April, the price action began to shift, forming a higher-high structure that indicated a recovery from the multi-year support level. By mid-May, Algorand’s price had climbed nearly 70% to $0.24 from the Q2 low of $0.150. Unfortunately, this upward momentum was halted in mid-May as strong supply levels rejected further advances, pushing the price below the 200-day EMA band. In the third week of June, ALGO returned to April’s low, finding support at the $0.15 level. At this point, the price was down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% from mid-May’s peak. The risks were high, with indications that any short-term bearish pressure could lead to a drop to the 2024 low of $0.0943, breaching the $0.15 support. However, everything changed last week in June, which was also the finishing week for H1. The momentum in H2 began with the blast. Algo Price Target July 2025 For Algorand the demand surged in the last week of June with bulls reviving at the price at $0.15, driven by high demand, breaking through the multi-month resistance trendline. By mid-July, ALGO had surpassed mid-May’s high after breaking the 200-day EMA band. Also, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed a golden cross, signaling continued bullish demand in the short term. From late June to mid-July, ALGO price surged to $0.30, recording a remarkable 105% gain, largely fueled by the overall bullish stance in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $123,231. As July progresses, if the $0.27 level maintains strong demand, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.50 mark by the end of the month. But losing the grip at $0.27 could drop ALGO to $0.21. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.18 0.30 0.50 ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, if demand increases in direct proportion to adoption at an unprecedented rate, ALGO could clear significant targets such as the $0.60 mark and potentially reach $0.90 by year-end. While these targets may seem ambitious compared to its current price, a broader view of the monthly chart reveals that the last three years have been characterized by a range-bound sideways movement, contrasting sharply with the high-strength parabolic growth seen in 2021. This perspective suggests that with the right momentum, ALGO could indeed achieve these higher price levels.

Corporate breakout attempts above $2.92–$2.93 failed four times (12:00, 13:00, 17:00, 18:00) as coordinated institutional selling emerged. Market makers and treasury desks provided strong support around $2.85, with volumes exceeding the 78.9 million daily average during 14:00 and 19:00 accumulation windows. Final-hour move from $2.88 to $2.90 (+0.69%) came after a decline to $2.87, supported by 2 million+ token volume bursts — classic institutional footprint. News Background As ProShares’ XRP Futures ETF approaches its July 18 launch, institutions appear to be rotating positions aggressively around key thresholds. While $3.00 remains the headline target, structured selling at $2.93 and consistent buy-side activity around $2.85 suggest tight-range rebalancing by corporate treasury desks. Regulatory ambiguity continues to limit upside, with several desks unwilling to cross full allocation thresholds until ETF flows normalize. Price Action Summary Range: $2.82 → $2.93 | Spread: $0.12 = 4.08% Failed Breakouts: $2.92–$2.93 rejections at 12:00, 13:00, 17:00, 18:00 Support Zone: $2.85 demand during 14:00 and 19:00 sessions Final Hour (02:33–03:32): XRP rose from $2.88 → $2.90 (+0.69%) Volume Spikes: Over 2 million tokens traded at 02:36–02:42, confirming accumulation Technical Analysis Price remains in tight consolidation channel under $3.00 psychological ceiling $2.85 continues to act as a key liquidity zone, with treasury activity concentrated near this level Resistance at $2.93 holds — confirming near-term indecision Classic pattern of higher lows forming intraday, despite rejection at upper boundary Momentum requires clear break above $2.93 with volume above 100 million for continuation What Traders Are Watching Will XRP break $2.93 ahead of the July 18 ETF launch, or fade into range-bound drift? Accumulation zones near $2.85 suggest positioning ahead of potential volatility spike Breakout above $3.00 would likely trigger corporate allocation upgrades across structured portfolios Failure to hold $2.88 could unwind recovery structure and target $2.82 retest Takeaway XRP is consolidating under pressure. Institutions are accumulating — but not yet committing above $2.93. The ETF catalyst is near. Until then, this is a volume game: support at $2.85 holds the floor; resistance at $2.93 sets the ceiling. Break either — and momentum will follow.

Accordingly, cryptocurrency legislation that was expected to be voted on in the US House of Representatives this week has been postponed due to a procedural vote failure. In the vote held yesterday, the proposal, which would have paved the way for the discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills, was rejected with 223 “no” votes against 196 “yes” votes. Following the rejection decision, there was a positive development in laws that are of great importance to US President Donald Trump. Trump intervened and announced a meeting with House members who oppose the procedural agreement for the GENIUS Act. At this point, Trump said that an agreement had been reached to hold a vote again on July 16 and advance the stablecoin bill in the US. Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he met with 11 of the 12 people needed for the passage of the GENIUS Act in the Oval Office. According to Trump's post, the group agreed to vote on the morning of July 16. House Speaker Mike Johnson joined the meeting by phone and stated that he was ready to move forward with a vote as soon as possible. This update came after the House failed to hold a procedural vote on the bill. “I'm currently in the Oval Office at the White House with 11 of the 12 members of the House of Representatives whose approval is needed for passage of the GENIUS Act. After a brief discussion, they all agreed to vote yes tomorrow morning. I hope the vote will take place as soon as possible tomorrow. I extend my gratitude to the representatives for their prompt and positive response.” What Are These Laws? This week, dubbed “Crypto Week,” features two important bills on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. *This is not investment advice.

Volume spiked to 464.28 million during the 23:00–00:00 window, crushing the 24-hour average of 287.95 million. Breakouts occurred at 12:00 and again in the evening session, lifting DOGE past $0.195 resistance. Final hour showed rejection at $0.200, with short-term pullback forming a descending micro-channel into $0.196. News Background DOGE’s breakout follows a broader return of meme coin flows as traders rotate into volatility ahead of key macro events later this week. Institutional footprints were visible in volume surges above $0.195, with market makers defending support levels near $0.190 during the early session. Technical setups are now aligned with Fibonacci retracement targets around $0.197 — with $0.21 flagged as the next extension if bulls regain strength.

Break above $0.200–$0.202 resistance would trigger fresh upside momentum Breakdown below $0.195 invalidates rally setup and reopens $0.190 retest Watch for 20-minute volume bars >25 million to confirm directional shift Takeaway DOGE’s 5% rally was real — volume, structure, and order flow confirm institution-backed momentum. With $0.195 now acting as a potential base, bulls are eyeing $0.21 — but only if $0.200 resistance breaks clean on volume. Until then, the chart remains coiled.

Their proposal aims to steer Bitcoin holders to adopt more secure, quantum-resistant storage methods and implement additional protective measures. Quantum algorithms are a threat to Bitcoin’s cryptographic pillars Crypto experts say quantum computing could break Bitcoin’s encryption system. The network applies cryptographic security measures such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to protect wallets and SHA-256 to confirm mining and transactions. Quantum algorithms, however, pose a threat to these systems. For example, Shor’s algorithm might allow attackers to solve the math underlying these protections, making it possible to expose a private key from a known public key. Many Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) and Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses are exposed, which puts an estimated 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply in danger, according to a Deloitte study. Furthermore, with identifiable public keys, Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant wallets would also be vulnerable to quantum attacks . The same applies to another quantum algorithm that threatens the security of Bitcoin — Grover’s algorithm , which cuts the effective security of SHA-256 by 50%. In May, Lopp had cautioned that quantum signature schemes have become significantly larger, which could reopen debates about Bitcoin’s ability to handle high transaction volumes. He also warned that if a quantum computer could break the ECDSA pillar, it would be disastrous—stolen BTC will fill the markets, undermining trust and possibly triggering a price collapse. Experts have articulated that existing quantum computers cannot crack ECDSA now. Some anticipate that quantum computing will become a real threat in at least 10 years, seeing how engineers are still working on building fault-tolerant systems. However, some analysts believe Bitcoin could be in trouble in the next five years if quantum computers advance beyond expectations, an opinion many have brushed off as unlikely. Earlier, Lopp argued that while it’s not easy to estimate how long they have before quantum computing becomes a real threat, the Bitcoin community should collaborate to come up with solutions before it grows into an existential crisis. Lopp’s proposal would have BTC owners shift to post-quantum secure addresses Lopp had help from five other developers to draft the Bitcoin improvement plan. In the proposal, they iterated that Bitcoin is under threat, noting that a successful quantum attack would hurt economies and possibly the entire ecosystem. The proposal also details that miners would have to transfer funds to post-quantum secure addresses and restrict Bitcoin spending within five years. It stated: “It turns quantum security into a private incentive. Fail to upgrade [to a new address type] and you will certainly lose access to your funds.” Ideally, the plan includes incentives for Bitcoin owners who shift to more secure addresses. In his proposal, Lopp also references BIP 360, an upgrade created by Anduro’s Senior Protocol Engineer, Hunter Beast, to introduce address formats incorporating post-quantum cryptography at varying security levels. Other developers, such as Michael B. Casey, Director of Engineering at Marathon, have also contributed their own ideas to strengthen Bitcoin’s defenses. Casey introduced the hourglass narrative, dictating that vulnerable wallet types like pay-to-public-key reduce their number of transactions. He argued that fewer transactions would give the community time to look into other alternatives, at least delaying access to tokens to eight months from a few hours. He further noted that the move would cause hackers to target the older wallets that many people rarely use. Meanwhile, tech giants like Google and Microsoft have poured significant resources into advancing quantum computing.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency. Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.23484121 0.60% Market Cap. $ 9,955,546,057.2896 Trading Volume. $ 735,382,957.6199 Circulating Supply. 42,392,670,019.2012 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile first half of 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement were evident in the TVL, which contributed to this downturn. Ultimately, HBAR was pushed into a converging falling wedge pattern, hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR, breaking free from the wedge and bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived, as geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, causing HBAR’s price to retreat back to its April lows, forming another parallel declining wedge on the chart. By the end of June, HBAR remained within that channel but started to see bears losing grip to bulls, when entering July, momentum blasted, breaking the upper border of the parallel channel. Hedera Price Targets July 2025 Precisely in July, from the declining parallel channel, Hedera saw strong demand starting from $0.125 in late June to mid-July, where HBAR spiked 108% to $0.26, piercing through all short-term and long-term EMA bands. This movement followed a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June and was further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $123,231. As of mid-July, Hedera experienced a slight halt as Bitcoin and the overall market witnessed early profit booking, marking a cooldown phase before another potential rally. If the bulls regain strength and achieve a daily close above $0.270, HBAR price could potentially retest the $0.34 and $0.40 resistance levels in July or the coming months. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.125 $0.27 $0.40 Hedera Price Prediction 2025 (H2) Looking ahead, if the momentum persists, HBAR price might even reach $0.75 by year-end. However, on the downside, failing to maintain the $0.190 support zone could pull it down towards multi-month support at $0.125. Below this level, the price could even drop toward $0.072. Also, while TVL was previously down, it has witnessed a resurgence, with investor trust reflected in TVL increasing from $75 million to $114 million within the last 30 days. Hedera’s internal developments also tell a promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand, with the launch of its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025, aiming to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Moreover, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the Hedera Foundation and the Governing Council rebranded as the Hedera Council. This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem.

The inflation increase appears to have affected investor sentiment. After reaching a new high above $123,000 on Monday, Bitcoin has since declined by roughly 5.4% from that peak, with its price currently trading just above $116,000. The broader crypto market also reacted to the news, with the global crypto market cap valuation dropping by nearly 7% in the past day amid renewed uncertainty about future interest rate policy. While Bitcoin has exhibited a strong uptrend in recent weeks, the latest pullback introduces short-term volatility that analysts are watching closely. One particularly notable development occurred on-chain: a transfer of 10,000 BTC, valued at roughly $1.2 billion, from a dormant address last active over a decade ago. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO Historic Bitcoin Transfer Raises Eyebrows, but No Signs of Exchange Activity CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán shared insights into the large transaction in a recent post titled “10,000 Historic BTC Move On-Chain.” According to Alemán, the transaction occurred on July 14 at 16:17 UTC, moving 10,000 BTC from address ‘bc1q84…7ef6k ‘ to ‘bc1qmu….8v2p.’ These coins had not moved in over 10 years, indicating they likely originated from early miners during Bitcoin’s earliest phases when the block reward was 50 BTC. Alemán noted that such old unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) often trigger concern about potential sell-offs, but in this case, further analysis suggests a more neutral interpretation. The movement of old coins can occur for various reasons, including UTXO consolidation, wallet upgrades, or potential sales. Alemán explained that this transfer displayed characteristics consistent with consolidation for efficiency and security purposes. For example, the transaction used 16 different inputs, which can help reduce future transaction fees. Additionally, no corresponding inflow to centralized exchanges (CEXs) was detected, typically a key signal when holders intend to liquidate. The analyst also pointed out that two small test transactions were sent to the receiving address before the full transfer. These included a 0.00089 BTC and a 1 BTC transaction, commonly used to verify wallet accessibility before moving a large sum. Interestingly, two hours after the initial transaction, the same destination wallet received another transfer of 10,009 BTC, bringing the total to more than 20,000 BTC moved in the span of a few hours. Implications for Market Behavior and On-Chain Trends While the transaction did not lead to immediate market selling, it has added to ongoing discussions about the role of long-term holders in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. Large transfers from early addresses are rare and often interpreted as strategic reorganization of funds. Alemán noted that the absence of exchange-related activity makes it unlikely that the coins are being liquidated in the short term.

Pepecoin is adding new holders fast. But neither comes close to what Unilabs is building. While FLOKI chases headlines and PEPE thrives on short-term hype, Unilabs Finance focuses on real growth and lasting utility. In its latest presale, Unilabs sold over one billion tokens – proof of rising demand. This isn’t speculation. It’s driven by real tools and a clear reward system. UNIL holders earn 30% of platform revenue, offering passive income that meme coins can’t match. Unilabs Finance isn’t just another token. It’s building a full DeFi stack – stablecoin yields, cross-chain trading, and flash loans. Each tool adds value and keeps users engaged. Floki Inu’s Price Surges On Multiple Bullish News Floki Inu’s price jumped 25% last week, fuelled by strong fundamentals and fresh momentum. It became the first meme coin to gain MiCA compliance in the EU, earning “Admission to Trading” status under ESMA. That move opens the door to institutional flows across Europe, giving Floki Inu’s price a serious edge over other meme coins still stuck in legal limbo. Floki Inu Price | Source: TradingView FLOKI also landed a major listing on Webull Pay, unlocking access to over 24 million new users. On top of that, the long-awaited Valhalla mainnet is finally live. Over 100,000 NFTs have already been minted using FLOKI in-game, helping lock supply and boost deflationary pressure. Whales have noticed, adding 1.23 billion tokens to their bags. Open interest hit a yearly high of $50 million. Floki Inu’s price broke past the key $0.000080 level with strong volume. RSI and Bollinger Bands confirm the bullish trend. If momentum holds, traders now look to $0.000095 and possibly $0.0001 as Floki Inu’s price reaches the next breakout zones. Pepecoin Surges Past 463k Holders as Analysts Predict Massive Surge Pepecoin just hit a major milestone – 463,000 holders – and momentum is picking up fast. Bullish signals are stacking up across charts, on-chain data, and derivatives markets, fuelling hopes of a breakout. A clear cup-and-handle pattern is forming, with Pepecoin testing the key $0.00001580 level. A breakout here could send PEPE flying toward $0.000030. The DMI shows strong buyer control, with +DI at 35.3 and -DI at 12.7. ADX sits at 23.0, signalling a trend that’s still strengthening Pepecoin. On-chain activity backs the hype. New wallets are up 39%, active wallets rose 38%, and wallet churn spiked 42% – clear signs of retail growth. Pepecoin whale transactions also increased 6.6%, hinting at quiet institutional moves. Unilabs – The DeFi Powerhouse Nobody Talks About Traditional investors are flocking to Web3 and eyeing DeFi for its low fees, asset control, and freedom. Hedera once led the way, but now Unilabs is winning users. It makes DeFi faster, safer, and easy to use. Active traders love the Cross-Chain Trading Hub. It solves chain fragmentation. You trade across blockchains without risky bridges. You tap into dozens of DEXs with one click. No more delays or security fears. If you prefer steady returns, the SSA is your tool. Deposit stablecoins and earn reliable interest. You skip the wild swings of the crypto markets and collect passive income. Advanced traders get the Flash Loan Accelerator. It delivers instant, no-collateral loans repaid in one transaction. You can run complex strategies, grab arbitrage, or unlock yield—all without locking up your capital. Unilabs Finance isn’t just one app or a memecoin like Pepecoin. It’s a full DeFi ecosystem designed for every style. It blends speed, simplicity, and top-tier security, making it a go-to platform in today’s fast-moving crypto world. UNIL – Fueling Everything with Dividends At the heart of Unilabs sits UNIL, the native token priced at $0.0074. It’s not a hype play like Floki Inu’s price. It powers the platform and pays real rewards. Unilabs returns 30% of its revenue to token holders. That’s a built-in dividend model, not just a promise. The system spans twelve tiers. The more you hold, the bigger your cut. This design drives loyalty and cuts down on pump-and-dump games. It builds a stable base for long-term growth. The upside is huge. Capture just 0.1% of the $500 billion asset management market and Unilabs pulls in $400 million a year. That equals $120 million back to UNIL holders. It’s a clear signal: Unilabs Finance is built for lasting success, not quick hype.

What is the Malaysian Government Saying About Cryptocurrency in 2025? In 2025, the Malaysian government is considering introducing new regulations for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to align with global trends. While the government is creating new frameworks, the Securities Commission of Malaysia (SCM) is focusing on: Regulating cryptocurrencies as securities Overseeing digital assets trade and issuance Regulating digital assets exchange and Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)platforms. Crypto License in Malaysia The crypto incident framework in Malaysia aims for technical adherence and transparency in its internal structure. The crypto businesses and platforms are subject to strict penalties, including fees, blocked access, and license revocation for non-compliance with crypto laws. Types of crypto licenses in Malaysia: Issuer: The Main purpose is the issuance and offerings of tokens with a minimum of 500 thousand MYR. Startups and fintech projects are applicable for this license. IEO Operator: Serves as an organization of initial public offerings with 5 million MYR. Platforms for attracting investments are required to obtain this license. Digital asset custodian (DAC): The Primary purpose is serving as a storage of digital assets with 500 thousand MYR fees.

Conclusion Malaysia is one of the countries that does not consider crypto as legal tender, but it has a legal regulatory framework to facilitate it. The country does not even have any specific laws for crypto tax, and this is why Malaysia is recognized as one of the crypto-friendly countries in the world. Despite not having separate laws, the country maintains strict regulations to prevent fraud and risk in the crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, buying and owning crypto is legal in Malaysia. However, it’s not recognized as legal tender, but rather as a security under the Prescription Order 2019 (amended 2025). How is cryptocurrency regulated in Malaysia? The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) regulates crypto as securities, overseeing digital asset trading, issuance, exchanges, and IEO platforms. They are actively developing a comprehensive framework. How is cryptocurrency taxed in Malaysia ? Capital gains from personal crypto investments are generally not taxed. However, crypto trading as a frequent business activity, mining, or receiving crypto as compensation is subject to income tax (0-30%). Which government body is responsible for crypto operations in Malaysia? The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) is the main government body responsible for regulating digital asset operations in the country, including trading, issuance, and safekeeping.

According to analyst Rekt Capital, the PI Cycle Top uses two moving averages to signal when Bitcoin may be nearing its top. Historically, these moving averages, especially the 111-day average, have accurately predicted the end of previous bull markets. Recently, this faster-moving average has been rising sharply. Back on June 1, it was tracking around $92,000, but now it’s already near $98,000, just under $100K. This quick rise shows how strong the current price momentum is. What’s important here is how fast the predicted “crossover,” when the two moving averages intersect, is moving forward in time. A few days ago, the crossover was projected for April 2027, but now it’s shifted to February 2027. And if Bitcoin continues to consolidate or climb, that crossover could move even closer — possibly into 2026 or even late 2025. Why does this matter? Because when the crossover occurs, it has typically marked the top of the bull market. If the trend continues, we could see this crossover hit when Bitcoin is priced somewhere between $130,000 to $170,000, or even more if momentum keeps building. The key takeaway: While we may still be early in this bull run, the data is telling us that the window to take profits could arrive as early as the second half of 2025. The PI Cycle Top Indicator won’t act alone, but it’s one of the most reliable tools we have to track when the cycle might end. Keeping an eye on it could make all the difference in this high-stakes crypto journey.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 06:09:29

Recent moves suggest growing pressure from both bulls and bears, as the asset trades just below a major resistance zone. With volatility compressing and momentum building, it appears primed for its next big move. The market is watching closely—will the XRP price break above the current range and push toward fresh highs, or is a deeper retracement on the horizon? Short-Term Setup: Squeezed Between Support and Resistance Over the past several sessions, XRP has been locked in a consolidation zone, reflecting indecision across the broader crypto market. The price continues to oscillate within a clearly defined band, repeatedly testing both upper and lower bounds without a breakout. This narrowing price behavior reflects a classic “build-up” phase, where momentum is being stored before release. Such setups often result in sharp price moves, depending on whether bulls or bears seize control first. The structure forming on the chart shows a tightening triangle, typically viewed as a precursor to volatility. Current price levels are crucial, as a confirmed move beyond this range could ignite a much stronger trend, either to the upside or downside. While the Bollinger bands are squeezing, the MACD displays a drop in selling pressure. Hence, a strong upward move is approaching. Long-Term Setup: Eyes on Expansion Beyond the Range While XRP’s short-term setup suggests a breakout is near, the longer-term structure presents an even more compelling picture. After years of ranging below its all-time high, XRP is slowly building the foundation for a major macro move. The multi-year resistance zone—previously a ceiling during past rallies—is now being approached with a stronger base structure and renewed investor interest. This prolonged consolidation, combined with strengthening market participation, hints at a potential shift in trend dynamics. If XRP decisively breaks above its current high-timeframe range, the next major move could mark the beginning of a sustained uptrend, not just a short-term spike. The price history suggests that once XRP clears these long-standing resistances, the asset tends to move rapidly toward new territory. This phase may mirror previous cycles, where long periods of consolidation are followed by aggressive price discovery. What’s Next for XRP: Potential Scenarios Bullish Scenario: If buyers reclaim control and push XRP above the overhead resistance with conviction, momentum could quickly build. This would pave the way toward targets near $3.60 and potentially $4.00 in the coming weeks, depending on broader market strength. Bearish Scenario: Failure to hold the $2.60–$2.70 region may expose XRP to deeper retracements. A drop into the $2.30–$2.20 zone remains possible before bulls regroup for another upward attempt. Neutral/Sideways Bias: XRP could also continue to consolidate within its current structure if volume remains thin and no catalyst appears. However, this scenario is unlikely to last much longer given the tightening price range.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-16 06:18:18
