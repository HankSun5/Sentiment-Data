The world’s largest cryptocurrency holds a market cap of $2.27 trillion, with 19.9 million BTC in circulation out of a capped supply of 21 million. Despite the recent rebound, the charts show BTC struggling to hold above its short-term support zones. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Key Levels Ahead On the technical front, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC has slipped beneath its 50-day moving average ($116,033), which has flipped into resistance. The rejection near $124,450 carved a bearish engulfing candle, signaling momentum loss after July’s rally. Traders are now watching the neckline of a potential head-and-shoulders pattern around $112,000. A breakdown below this level could accelerate declines toward $108,000 and possibly $105,150, as shown in TradingView’s projected path. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum signals back this caution. The MACD has crossed into negative territory, while the RSI at 44 leaves room for further downside. Consecutive bearish candlesticks resemble the start of a three black crows pattern, often linked with deeper pullbacks. Yet, the longer-term structure is less bleak. Since June, Bitcoin has defended a series of higher lows, with small-bodied dojis near $113K showing indecision rather than panic selling. Should buyers retake $116,150, the path opens toward $120,900, then $124,450, with a breakout potentially extending to $127,540 and the long-anticipated $130K level. Fundamental Outlook: Armstrong’s $1M Call While the charts point to short-term caution, fundamentals remain highly supportive. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on August 20 that he expects Bitcoin to reach $1 million per coin by 2030. Armstrong described this as the “rough idea” in his head, highlighting adoption, innovation, and technological improvements as drivers of exponential growth. JUST IN: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicts Bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 by 2030. pic.twitter.com/rT95DfJbTG — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 20, 2025 No model, but the bigger picture is accumulation, supply is shrinking, and use cases are expanding. So long term investors can be confident even if short term traders are navigating volatility. Outlook for Traders and Investors For traders the playbook is clear: close above $116K and long to $124K-$130K, close below $112K and short to $108K. For investors this is an accumulation zone in a bigger bull run. In the bigger picture Armstrong’s $1M call shows how market leaders see Bitcoin not as a speculative asset but as a long term foundation of digital finance. Whether BTC retests $108K or goes to $130K in the short term the road ahead is higher over the next few years. New Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $10.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012755—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

50410625,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788645,1755730770,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50410625.jpeg,Coinbase bets everything on stablecoins becoming the backbone of AI-driven payments,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-bets-everything-on-stablecoins/,"Coinbase has decided that stablecoins are now the center of everything. The company is banking on these digital dollars to become the financial engine behind AI-powered apps, bots, and machines. And it’s already started pushing that future. According to Bloomberg, the company hosted a hackathon in Brooklyn during a boiling-hot August weekend where around 100 developers from places like Malaysia and Italy coded tools that let software send and receive payments using stablecoins. Developers built prototypes like a publishing platform that pays writers instantly, a chatbot that charges a few cents per answer, and a group-chat marketplace where users can buy and sell with each other, without ever touching traditional finance. The event was all about building financial infrastructure for AI systems that will need to handle payments on their own; buying services, paying cloud fees, and making micro transactions automatically, around the clock. Coinbase pushes x402 as AI’s payment backbone Coinbase is trying to lead this charge with x402, an open-source protocol it named after a long-unused internet error code: “402 Payment Required.” It’s built for bots, apps, or any connected software to charge and settle instantly using stablecoins over the internet. Whether it’s a couple of pennies for an AI tool or a few dollars for digital content, the goal is real-time payment without needing PayPal, Visa, or a bank wire. Nemil Dalal, who runs the Coinbase Developer Platform, said this strategy goes straight back to what Brian Armstrong wrote in his “Secret Master Plan” almost a decade ago, a plan that started with speculation, moved to infrastructure, and ends with a fully open, global financial system. “Like literally, that’s exactly what we’re doing,” said Nemil. “Now we’re in the app era. People are creating tons of different apps. And then we’re going to see a large amount of things come up from that.” During the Brooklyn hackathon, developers were encouraged to use x402 in their projects. Ben Reilly’s team added it to a chatbot that could collect payments directly from users. “The killer app for crypto, that’s very obvious, is stablecoin payments,” said Ben. His teammate, Alvaro Echevarria Cuesta, said the reason was simple: “Building your whole financial system on top of stablecoins gives you a lot more freedom than being bound by Stripe, PayPal, and all the restrictions they put in there.” Coinbase is making a hard push to become the go-to toolkit for developers, the same way Amazon Web Services became the silent backbone of the internet. Their pitch is simple: forget casino coins, and start wiring software to make payments using tools that actually work at scale. Congress clears the way as competitors close in Coinbase isn’t alone, and the race is getting tight. Stripe acquired a company called Bridge that builds stablecoin infrastructure and is now working on its own blockchain. PayPal has already launched its own stablecoin, leaning on its huge user base to drive usage. Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard are still sitting on decades of built-in merchant systems, regulatory capital, and global reach. What’s pushing Coinbase to act fast is Washington. Congress passed the first US law regulating stablecoins this summer. It forces issuers to hold reserves and gives developers a clear legal pathway to build on top of them. That legal clarity is already pulling more builders into the space. Vishal Gupta, a former Coinbase and Circle executive who judged the hackathon, said it flatly: “Anytime you have clarity, it enables the next wave.” Now Vishal is running a firm called True Markets that’s also backing stablecoin payment systems. His view? Crypto isn’t just trading anymore. It’s becoming something people can use. “We can actually use some of these native crypto rails in real consumer products and real B2B products,” he said. Coinbase still makes most of its money from trading, which is volatile and competitive. The company also shares stablecoin revenue with Circle, which went public earlier this summer. But none of this is guaranteed. Most people still rely on existing payment rails. AI is still unpredictable. Consumer habits change slowly. And the old financial systems have deep roots. Still, for that weekend in Brooklyn, the builders dreamt. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Some are thriving on community power, others on ecosystem growth, and a few on presale traction. Among the best cryptocurrencies to buy today, four projects lead the list: Cold Wallet (CWT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Cold Wallet is advancing with a live app and cashback utility, while DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE stay popular for their strong communities and active trading. Together, they offer a mix of early-entry potential, meme-driven hype, and real-world use cases worth following this month. 1. Cold Wallet: Presale Growth, Cashback Rewards, & Big ROI Potential Cold Wallet is proving why many see it as the best crypto to buy today. Now in Stage 17 of its presale, CWT is priced at $0.00998. So far, it has raised $6.3 million and sold more than 740 million tokens, showing strong traction. With a fixed launch price of $0.3517, current buyers could see up to 37× returns, or about 3,600%, if the target is hit. Early buyers at $0.007 during Stage 1 could potentially make up to 50×. Cold Wallet is also listed on CoinMarketCap, giving users live updates on progress, sales, and funds raised. What sets Cold Wallet apart is that it’s not waiting until launch to prove itself. The wallet app is already live on both Android and iOS. Users get cashback in CWT for gas fees, swaps, bridges, and on/off-ramps, with no staking or lockups required. This means that everyday activity turns into earnings instead of costs. Security audits are being carried out by Hacken, with CertiK reviewing the platform as well. Adoption was boosted further when Cold Wallet acquired Plus Wallet for $270 million, instantly adding more than 2 million active users. On top of that, a referral program gives users immediate USDT payouts and future CWT rewards, adding both short-term incentives and long-term value. This mix of live product, growing user base, referral mechanics, and strong presale momentum makes Cold Wallet a rare presale project delivering actual utility today. With early entry pricing and clear adoption strategies, it stands out as the best crypto to buy today for those looking at both ROI potential and a product that already works. 2. Dogecoin: Meme Power With Staying Strength Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the top meme coin by recognition. Trading around $0.199 with a $28.6 billion market cap and daily volumes of $1.2 billion, DOGE has gained 3% in the past 24 hours. It’s not just hype; it’s widely used for tipping, online payments, and merchandise. With recent updates aimed at lowering transaction fees and boosting efficiency, DOGE stays relevant. Backed by deep liquidity and loyal fans, it remains one of the best cryptos to buy today for traders seeking volatility and meme-driven momentum. 3. Shiba Inu: Expanding Beyond Meme Status Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at about $0.00002185, with a $12.9 billion market cap and daily trading volume near $6.34 million. It’s up 4% in the past day, supported by heavy activity and ecosystem progress. The launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution for faster and cheaper transactions, is key to SHIB’s growth. Combined with its token burn strategy, which steadily reduces supply, SHIB is moving beyond simple speculation. For those chasing community-backed projects with evolving use cases, SHIB remains one of the best cryptos to buy today. 4. Pepe: Meme Liquidity and Market Buzz Pepe (PEPE) trades near $0.000012 with a $5.1 billion market cap and $1.5 billion in daily trading volume. It has posted gains of 5–8% in the last day, proving meme demand is still alive. Analysts are split: some expect a dip, while others think a sharp rally could follow if sentiment spikes mid-month. High liquidity, rapid moves, and community hype keep PEPE firmly in play as one of the best cryptos to buy today for short-term traders chasing volatility. Final Thoughts Cold Wallet, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe each bring something different to the table this August. Cold Wallet blends presale ROI potential with a live product and a large user base. DOGE continues to thrive on brand strength, SHIB grows through Layer-2 and token burns, and PEPE keeps attention with sharp price action. For traders and holders alike, these picks are among the best crypto presale to buy , balancing meme energy with real adoption and presale opportunity.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has suffered a sell-off in the past six days, with its price falling to as low as $4,074 in the last 24 hours. The decline is occurring alongside institutional investors beginning to pull money from Spot Ethereum ETFs at a record pace, a trend that casts doubt on the sustainability of Ethereum’s price surge above $4,800 and into new all-time highs. $422.3 Million Pulled In A Single Day According to data from SosoValue, Tuesday, August 19, was one of the worst days on record for Spot Ethereum ETFs based in the US. Notably, about $422.30 million was withdrawn in a single session, making it the second-largest daily outflow since these funds were created. The only bigger exodus was on August 4, when outflows came to $465 million. Among the issuers, Grayscale and Fidelity led the exodus with outflows of $122 million and $156.32 million, respectively. BlackRock’s flagship, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), saw its holdings slip from 3.6 million ETH (around $15.8 billion) to about $14.7 billion on Tuesday. The timing of this wave of withdrawals in the past 24 hours could not be more damaging, as Ethereum was already sliding from its recent peak. The outflow immediately amplified downward pressure on the market, which caused Ethereum to crash below $4,100. Tuesday’s outflow numbers were not an isolated incident but the culmination of an outflow trend that has now stretched across three consecutive trading sessions. On Monday, Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded outflows of $196.62 million, which itself was one of the highest single-day exits since launch. This came immediately after Friday’s $59 million outflow, which ended the prior streak of record inflows. In just four days, these withdrawals have drained more than $677 million from Spot Ethereum ETFs. Record Inflows To Quick Reversal In the eight trading sessions leading up to last Friday, Spot Ethereum ETFs had attracted an unprecedented $3.7 billion in inflows, with August 11 even surpassing $1 billion in net inflow. That surge in demand was an important factor behind Ethereum’s rally to its $4,776 multi-year high, and this brought along with it predictions that the $4,800 level could soon be breached. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,167, having bounced up at $4,070 and trending a bit upward. In terms of percentage points, the leading cryptocurrency is down by 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 10% in the past seven days. The leading altcoin is now witnessing a domination of sellers, with on-chain data showing that hedge funds have almost doubled their short positions in the past seven days. The wave of outflows from Spot Ethereum ETFs carries significant implications for Ethereum’s near-term price outlook. If the exodus continues, Ethereum could struggle to maintain its footing above the $4,000 support level and enter into a deeper retracement toward the mid-$3,000 range.",Ethereum|Active Realized Price|BlackRock|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ETHA|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Fidelity|Grayscale|iShares Ethereum Trust|Sosovalue|spot Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 23:00:24

Open Interest Surpasses $40 Billion As Longs Crowd In,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-open-interest-40-billion-longs/,"After hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,474 on Binance on August 13, Bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled toward $113,000, with the next major support zone around $110,000. Analysts warn that more downside could still be ahead for the top cryptocurrency. Bitcoin To Fall More? Crowded Long Trade Gives Hint According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin open interest across all exchanges has surged past $40 billion, nearing ATH territory. This rise shows both whales and short-term traders are piling into leveraged positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $115,000 As Binance Buying Power Ratio Collapses The chart below highlights the recent spike in BTC open interest, now hovering at $40.6 billion. Compared to August 2024 levels of $15 billion, open interest has grown by more than 150%. The CryptoQuant contributor added that despite this surge, the funding rate has remained positive, showing a strong long bias. While this reflects market optimism, it also signals a crowded trade, with most participants betting on further BTC appreciation. As a result, the risk of a long squeeze – forced liquidations of long positions due to aggressive leverage – has risen. XWIN Research Japan explained in their analysis: A sudden price drop can trigger a cascade of forced selling, amplifying volatility. In other words, Bitcoin’s short-term moves remain at the mercy of speculative flows. BTC Fund Holding By Institutions Rises Despite speculative froth from excessive leverage in the market, BTC fund holdings by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional investors continue to surge, exceeding 1.3 million according to latest data. Spot ETFs and corporate treasuries absorbing BTC provides the digital asset a structural bid that steadily reduces its available supply. According to data from SoSoValue, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold $146 billion in net assets – representing 6.47% of BTC’s market cap. Related Reading: Market Jitters Rise As Bitcoin Pulls Back—Is $135K Still Possible? That said, this week alone has seen more than $645 million in outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, following two consecutive weeks of inflows totaling nearly $800 million. Among the ETFs, BlackRock’s IBIT leads with $84.78 billion in net assets as of August 19. Still, not all signals are bearish. For instance, while BTC slipped below $115,000, its spot trading volume surged past $6 billion, giving bulls hope for a potential rebound. Similarly, technical analyst AO recently suggested that BTC could be mirroring gold’s trajectory, with an ambitious target of $600,000 by early 2026. At press time, BTC trades at $113,845, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

Investors are focusing on coins that combine community strength, proven technology, and clear growth potential. The most compelling choices tend to balance innovation with measurable results, proving they are more than short-term hype. This analysis looks at four projects currently standing out, BlockDAG, Stellar, Hyperliquid, and Chainlink. Each is approaching growth differently, but together, they highlight why these names are among the top crypto assets for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $377M Raised & Global Adoption in Motion BlockDAG has quickly become one of the most discussed presales in the market. Its hybrid design, combining Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability with Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, creates a network that is both reliable and high-performing. With EVM compatibility, it also makes Ethereum-based applications easy to integrate, strengthening its developer appeal. The presale metrics stand out. BlockDAG has raised more than $377 million so far, placing it among the largest ongoing sales. Coins are priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, with early participants from Batch 1 already up over 2,600% on paper. Projections suggest a post-listing price near $1, a 36× gain from today’s levels, making it a focal point for investors assessing the top crypto assets . Adoption supports the hype. The X1 mobile miner app has 2.5 million users, more than 19,300 ASIC miners are already distributed, and the community includes over 200,000 holders and 4,500 developers building 300 decentralized apps. A demo trading platform is live, offering practical use before the mainnet launch. BlockDAG has also launched a 200 ETH competition worth nearly $1 million to drive engagement. With 20 confirmed listings and ambitions for Coinbase and Gemini, it is positioning for global expansion. 2. Hyperliquid: Building a Futures Market Edge Hyperliquid is gaining attention as a decentralized platform specializing in perpetual futures trading. It enables traders to access advanced financial products without relying on centralized exchanges, providing both security and speed. This niche approach is gaining traction as more users seek decentralized alternatives for sophisticated trading. Its volumes have been climbing, driven by user demand for decentralized trading solutions. The roadmap includes new product offerings and integrations to attract both retail traders and institutional participants. Though still relatively early in its journey, the strong interest in its futures market places Hyperliquid firmly among the top crypto assets for 2025. 3. Stellar: Driving Efficiency in Payments Stellar (XLM) was designed to make payments faster, more affordable, and widely accessible, especially across borders. Its blockchain processes transactions at near-instant speeds and with extremely low fees, making it ideal for remittances and small-scale transfers. Compared to traditional systems such as SWIFT, Stellar offers a streamlined solution that resonates with both individuals and institutions. Adoption has grown through collaborations with fintechs and payment providers, along with developers using Stellar for asset issuance and token transfers. While XLM’s price reflects overall market conditions, its utility in gbal payments sustains its relevance. For those exploring the top crypto assets for 2025, Stellar represents a project with proven functionality and long-term potential. 4. Chainlink: Powering Smart Contracts With Real Data Chainlink (LINK) has cemented its role as a vital piece of blockchain infrastructure. Its decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts with real-world data, from asset prices to weather and financial information. This function is essential, particularly in DeFi, where reliable external data is critical for accurate execution. Over time, Chainlink has become the dominant oracle provider, supporting thousands of projects and securing billions in value. It is now expanding into cross-chain interoperability, enterprise applications, and even traditional finance integrations. Demand for decentralized data continues to rise, reinforcing LINK’s long-term importance. For investors evaluating the top crypto assets in 2025, Chainlink remains one of the most dependable choices. Assessing the Top Crypto Assets For 2025 Each of these four projects highlights a different strength in today’s market. BlockDAG has raised $377 million, attracted millions of users, and created major presale momentum, putting it on track to be one of the most watched launches in years. Stellar continues to prove itself in global payments with its fast, low-cost transactions. Hyperliquid is tapping into the perpetual futures space with decentralized solutions. Chainlink remains essential infrastructure, powering smart contracts with real-world data. For those assessing the top crypto assets for 2025, this mix of presale potential, payment solutions, futures trading, and core infrastructure provides a balanced perspective. BlockDAG is leading with scale and adoption, while Stellar, Hyperliquid, and Chainlink strengthen the market with proven use cases. Together, they form a lineup of assets that could play a major role in shaping the year ahead.

Angie Craig (D-Minn.) “It’s no secret that my side of the aisle would prefer not to see any sitting President — I won’t name one — participating in this market while a sitting president unless those assets are in a sealed trust,” Craig said on stage at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday. Trump, as well as his family, particularly Eric Trump, who was present at the venue during Craig’s appearance, have both built businesses in the industry, particularly since Trump retook office this past January. Trump has issued several meme coins tied to his name and his social media platform, Truth Social, has applied for several exchange-traded funds. Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, a mining company owned by Hut 8. Craig, who was joined by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wi.), spoke on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act which the House passed with a massive bipartisan vote last month. The Senate Banking Committee is working on its own version of crypto market structure legislation. While the majority of Republicans are in favor of the bill, many Democrats remain skeptical, and a big reason for that is the Trump family’s involvement in the industry, Craig said. “The elephant in the room here is the President’s family’s participation in this marketplace and that’s a stumbling block to get more Democrats to support the legislation,” she said. Craig said that while there is some language in the legislation that limits this conflict of interest, a stronger tone is needed to convince some lawmakers. “If we could find some language that would allow or prevent conflicts of interest to occur, from our perspective, I think you would see a whole lot more Democrats support it,” she said. Craig is the ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee, meaning she is the leading Democrat on that committee. This isn't the first time she's referenced the Trump family's crypto tie-ups — during a committee hearing in June on the Clarity Act, she said his crypto actions were ""making this debate more difficult"" and suggested that Congress should add restrictions on how the U.S. president can trade in markets overseen by the CFTC, including crypto. Despite her comments, Craig still voted to advance the Clarity Act without any such language being added.

This rare level of profitability has historically preceded sharp declines, but some analysts believe this cycle may follow a different trajectory. High Profitability Levels Raise Concerns XRP continues to trade above $3, close to its record highs, after climbing from $0.40 to $3.11 within a year, a gain of more than 500%. According to on-chain figures published by Glassnode, this surge has pushed nearly every XRP wallet into positive territory. Market commentator Winny cautioned that such widespread profitability has been a warning signal in the past. He pointed to two historical examples where a similar setup preceded major crashes. Markets have memory. And every time XRP hits a major milestone it feels like déjà vu. Think of it like climbing a mountain: the higher you go, the thinner the air. XRP just touched $3.11 a 500% run from $0.40 in less than a year. 94% of all supply is now in profit ( @glassnode ).… https://t.co/7LhOwyxepM — Winny (@0xWINNYx) August 18, 2025 In early 2018, profitability exceeded 90% as XRP approached $3.30, after which the token fell by more than 95%. Again in 2021, when XRP reached $1.95, profitability was at similar levels before an 85% decline followed. Given these precedents, Winny argues that investors should be cautious, stressing that when most market participants are in profit, selling pressure becomes difficult to avoid. Factors That Could Prevent a Repeat Despite the risks, Winny acknowledged that current conditions show important differences from prior cycles. Notably, large holders , wallets with more than one million XRP, have reached record levels, suggesting stronger long-term conviction among major investors. Network activity is also at its highest point in years, with daily active addresses rising to 225,000, the largest figure in three years. Technical data adds to this outlook, as XRP is consolidating around $3.05 in a triangle formation. A downside break below this area could open the door to $2.40, but if the price moves upward, Elliott Wave projections suggest a possible advance toward $6 or beyond. Winny concluded that these factors could create stronger support levels than in previous cycles, potentially reducing the scale of any correction even if profit-taking occurs.

He argued that while XRP may experience a further rally in the near term, a significant retracement remains likely. He presented two possible scenarios: if XRP rises to $9, he expects a pullback of about 85%, which would return the token to $1.30. In a more bullish case, if XRP surges to $27, he foresees a correction of roughly 97%, which could push the price back to $0.80, similar to the collapse seen in 2018. The market’s next move remains uncertain as XRP investors weigh high profitability against new technical and on-chain developments. While historical data suggests that such levels of profit often precede steep declines, analysts argue that increased whale accumulation and stronger network activity may change the outcome this time. Whether XRP can sustain its current momentum or repeat past patterns will likely be determined by how the market reacts in the coming weeks.

The studio appointed Rod Fergusson to lead the production of the upcoming game, which has been in development for several years now. The project is yet to receive an official title or release date despite being in production for some time now, with multiple restarts and adjustments. The layoffs are reportedly cutting across the development team behind the game, with no precise details on the scale of the cuts. Uncertainty still surrounds BioShok 4 after six years of development. The restructuring announcement follows the recent appointment of Rod Fergusson, former head of the Diablo franchise at Blizzard. Fergusson has worked on several projects, and he is recognized as a veteran in the industry for delivering finished, high-quality games rather than rushed releases. After BioShok 4 failed the recent internal review, the studio head, Kelley Gilmore, was fired, and creative director Horgath de la Plante was taken to publishing. Would you kindly allow me to share some news? Some of you guessed it, I’m returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. I’ll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with… — Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) August 19, 2025 The project is facing drastic changes, which have triggered reactions from fans. Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two CEO, admitted that the game development has faced ups and downs, but asked the fans to honour the BioShock legacy. He attributed the longer cycles in development to the industry’s focus on quality, saying that they are prioritizing exceptional entertainment over sheer output. Cloud Chamber was established in 2019 by 2K Games, a brand of Take-Two Interactive, to revive the BioShock series, which has been on hold for several years now. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that the project has been restarted more than once as the studio sought to fine-tune its creative direction. The latest project, dubbed BioShock 4, has been in the works for nearly six years now. BioShock has delivered several games in its series, including Irrational Games’ debut in 1997, BioShock 2, and BioShock Infinite. The pioneer of the series, Ken Levine, is currently working on his project, Judas, with his studio, Ghost Story Games, and he will not participate in the development of BioShock 4. Fergusson brings renewed hope for the BioShock series Rod Fergusson’s previous works have given him a stable reputation across the gaming industry. Before moving to Blizzard , He worked on the Gears of War series at Epic Games and The Coalition. He is known across the industry for his focus on production management and delivering projects on schedule. His leadership style has been characterized as pragmatic for avoiding prolonged development cycles currently experienced at Cloud Chamber studio. Fergusson revealed his excitement for returning to 2K Games while acknowledging the studio’s ongoing restructuring. He applauded the work done so far at BioShock and committed himself to building a game that gamers will love. He confirmed that he will be the head of the BioShock Franchise and overseeing the development of BioShock 4, plus extensions like the in-development Netflix movie. The BioShock Franchise is expanding into film with the upcoming game receiving a live-action BioShock adaptation currently in production at Netflix. Francis Lawrence, who directed The Hunger Games and I AM Legend, is the current director of the BioShock adaptation film. The film is expected to incorporate visual and thematic style drawn from the original games, which combined dystopian storytelling with art deco. Cloud Chamber and 2K have not issued any comment so far on the status of the upcoming project, which remains in development with its future tied to Fergusson’s leadership. However, the 2K Games studio revealed it aims to preserve the spirit of the Franchise while exploring new settings and themes. It also remains unclear how the staff reduction will affect the progress of the game after the confirmation from Fergusson. Get seen where it counts.

Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6023 Market cap $453.37M Trading volume $42.82 Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.6118 24-hour low $0.5873 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 7.09% 50-day SMA $0.6348 200-day SMA $0.6848 Sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (August 20), APE’s price dropped by 6.04% in one week and rose 0.64% in the last 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market (1.48%). The market recorded less trading interest as trading volumes dropped by 28.10%. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. This week, the coin traded along the William Alligator moving averages with little momentum as shown by the MACD histograms (0.0003). The RSI (48.71) suggests neutral momentum. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s run and its support at $0.58. Its volatility is dropping with a three white soldier candlestick pattern. The next 8 hours are critical to whether APE will continue upwards or reverse.

APE price analysis shows that the coin is bearish with little volatility. Lower trading volumes confirm less conviction in the current market trend. Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. driven by the APE bridge to ApeChain and growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction August 2025 The APE August price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $0.70, with an average of $0.59.

XRP, developed by Ripple, has been one of the most prominent examples, designed to streamline international payments at lower cost and with faster settlement than traditional channels. Today, analysts argue that this resistance is losing ground, as calls for an updated financial infrastructure are becoming mainstream, even from political leaders. Growing Tensions Between Banks and Digital Assets Traditional banking institutions have long opposed innovations that challenge their dominance, particularly products that could replace or undermine savings accounts and cross-border transfers. Rupert, an analyst from All In Crypto, explained on the Paul Barron Podcast that banking associations fought extensively against proposals such as paying yield on stablecoins. The reason is straightforward: if consumers can earn interest directly on digital assets, banks risk losing one of their primary advantages. This pushback reflects how threatened the financial sector feels by blockchain-based solutions that give customers cheaper and more efficient alternatives. However, recent political commentary suggests that momentum is shifting in favor of modernizing financial rails. President Donald Trump recently criticized the outdated infrastructure underpinning the U.S. financial system, describing it as several decades behind current technology. He advocated for an upgrade built on “crypto technology” to prepare the United States for a 21st-century economy. Although he did not reference Ripple by name, his remarks align closely with what Ripple has developed. The XRP Ledger is specifically designed to enable fast, inexpensive international transfers, addressing exactly the shortcomings that Trump highlighted. Analysts note that Trump’s comments underscore a broader recognition among policymakers that legacy systems no longer meet modern demands. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SWIFT Faces Mounting Pressure At the center of this discussion is SWIFT , the dominant international payments messaging system. Despite its long-standing role, critics argue that it is slow, expensive, and unsuitable for the digital era. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even likened reliance on SWIFT to relying on outdated communications methods, emphasizing the need for alternatives. Ripple’s system provides a clear contrast. By using the XRP Ledger, institutions can complete cross-border settlements within seconds, eliminating the reliance on intermediary banks. If widely adopted, this model could offer the liquidity and scalability necessary to challenge SWIFT’s dominance and transform global finance. Ripple’s Broader Significance While Bitcoin was created as a decentralized form of money, Ripple’s purpose has always been narrowly defined: to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments. This mission places it in direct competition with banks, which profit from the fees and delays inherent in the existing system. Rupert cautioned that while price predictions for XRP often generate skepticism , the true impact of Ripple’s network is still unknown. The scale of adoption will ultimately determine how disruptive the technology becomes. What is clear, however, is that Ripple represents one of the most credible challenges yet to traditional banking infrastructure. The global financial system is under increasing pressure to modernize. While banks have resisted blockchain technology for years, recent political support for crypto-based solutions highlights a shift in direction. Ripple’s technology fits squarely into this conversation, offering the speed, efficiency, and scalability that leaders like Trump are now demanding.

August crushed the rally these firms enjoyed just weeks ago, slamming names that had become investor magnets during the sideways bitcoin market. The sell-off arrives just before the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where whatever the hell Jerome Powell says next could drag these stocks even deeper, or spark a quick rebound. This entire picture was reported by CNBC, who tracked every company in the space holding crypto as treasury. Some of these companies had only just started their crypto play. Ethzilla, which used to be a biotech firm called 180 Life Sciences, jumped into the game on July 29. Investors reacted fast. The stock exploded in early August and is now showing a 114% gain for the month, the highest return in the group. Right behind it is BitMine Immersion Technologies, which focused on ether instead of bitcoin, followed by DeFi Development Corp, a company that went all-in on Solana back in April. Biggest gains tied to timing and tokens DeFi Development made its move on April 7 and has climbed 2,600% since then. Even in August, while others tanked, it’s still up 8%. That kind of gain almost matches what Strategy pulled off since launching its now-famous bitcoin treasury plan in June 2020. But Strategy’s current numbers are ugly; it’s down 16% this month. The timing of each company’s crypto shift clearly matters. No two firms announced their strategies at the same time, making head-to-head comparisons messy. Still, some stocks burned fast. CEA Industries, a vape company out of Canada, jumped 550% on July 28 just for saying it was accumulating Binance Coin. The hype didn’t last. The stock is now down 28% in August. Bit Digital tried switching things up by ditching bitcoin mining in June to go full ether treasury and staking. The results? Meh. Since the announcement, shares are up 11%, but in August alone, they’re already down 6.5%. High-profile investors fuel confidence and volume Some names have got famous backers putting their faces on the line. Tom Lee, from Fundstrat Global Advisors, became chairman of BitMine Immersion in late June. Just after that, Peter Thiel picked up a 9% stake in the company, then added a 7.5% slice of Ethzilla too. That kind of support does more than look pretty in a press release. Michael Bucella, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital, said, “Large names extend their reputation to the vehicle and instill confidence that the backers of these assets — alongside executives and board members with legal ties — will operate them as real businesses, growing revenue while managing risks.” He added, “That investor confidence creates momentum and market depth, which fuels volume and options activity. This in turn enables these companies to establish sizable ATM programs, raising large sums of capital to acquire more of the asset and gain greater prominence in its ecosystem.” Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, said it’s not just about who invests but who runs the company. Galaxy, which has backed firms like SharpLink Gaming and ReserveOne, sees management as a key driver for whether a crypto treasury stock can actually survive. “Those that raise more capital with the right partners, with the right business model, with the right management teams have a much better shot of achieving some escape velocity with their ultimate treasury management companies, which also can become ecosystem companies that are bigger than just the immediate launch moment,” Kurz said . The Ether crowd is holding up better than the bitcoin players. There are reasons for that. The IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, the passing of the GENIUS Act, and an explosion of institutional interest in stablecoins (most of which live on Ethereum) have all helped ether-linked companies gain an edge.

Trump, who co-founded bitcoin mining company American Bitcoin earlier this year, reiterated his excitement for bitcoin during an appearance at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday. He even called himself a “bitcoin maxi.” The businessman and executive vice president of the Trump organization said he now spends over 50% of his time on crypto projects. He said he believes that the crypto asset will be worth $175,000 a token by the end of the year, sticking with his earlier prediction. Trump told several personal stories pointing out what he described as the flaws of the current financial system and how bitcoin and blockchain technology can solve those issues, including faster transactions and payment settlements. American Bitcoin, which merged with Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr-owned American Data Center in March, is expected to go public on Nasdaq via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). The brothers own 20% of the company while bitcoin miner Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%. Trump's comments came hours after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made a similar prediction .

50412502,561256,1755734410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50412502.jpeg,Bitcoin STH Capitulate: $5.69B In Losses Hit Exchanges In 48 Hours,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sth-capitulate-5-69b-losses-hit-exchanges/,"Bitcoin is trading at a critical support level after reaching a new all-time high of $124,500 before swiftly losing the $115K level in less than a week. The sudden reversal underscores the sharp rise in volatility, with bulls and bears locked in a battle for momentum. While some analysts argue that BTC could reclaim its highs in the coming days, others expect the market to cool off further, with consolidation potentially dragging the price into lower ranges. Key insights from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn reveal that Bitcoin just faced one of the heaviest loss-driven moves in weeks. Short-term holders (STHs) have been under pressure, with billions in BTC flowing into exchanges at a loss, signaling capitulation among speculative investors. Historically, such moments of intense selling either trigger deeper corrections or set the stage for recovery rallies, depending on how quickly markets absorb the supply. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to stabilize above the $115K–$113K support zone will likely determine the short-term trajectory. If buyers step in aggressively, a rebound toward $120K+ could materialize. However, failure to defend current levels may leave BTC vulnerable to a deeper retracement before any attempt to retest its all-time highs. Short-Term Holders Capitulate as Bitcoin Faces Pressure According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Bitcoin’s short-term holders (STHs) are showing signs of serious capitulation . Over just two days, a staggering 50,026 BTC — worth approximately $5.69 billion — flowed from STHs to exchanges at a loss. This marks the deepest loss-driven move in more than a month, underscoring how quickly sentiment can shift in an overheated market. STHs selling at a loss is a critical signal. Historically, these moments often align with market stress points where speculative investors exit positions under pressure. Bulls, however, are looking for a different outcome. They want this to represent a sharp flush-out of weak hands, followed by renewed accumulation and a swift price rebound. In this view, the sell-off would simply be a reset — a profit-taking event that clears the path for more sustainable gains. If that fails to materialize, the risk grows that this episode could mirror the prolonged loss realization seen from late February through late May, when persistent capitulation dragged Bitcoin through an extended consolidation phase. For now, bulls are defending the $115K region, but many analysts point to $110K as a decisive level. Losing that support could expose BTC to a deeper retracement, while holding it could provide the springboard for a renewed push back toward all-time highs. BTC Price Analysis: Testing Key Moving Average The 8-hour Bitcoin chart shows that BTC is under strong selling pressure after failing to hold above the $120K–$123K resistance area. The chart highlights multiple rejections at the $123,217 level, establishing it as a critical ceiling. After the most recent failed breakout attempt, price has sharply retraced, now trading around $113,486. On the downside, BTC is testing the 200-period moving average (red line), currently sitting near $113,292. This zone has acted as a key support level in previous consolidations. If the price manages to defend this area, it could form a base for a potential rebound toward the mid-range levels around $117K–$118K. However, failure to hold this moving average would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward the $110K psychological level. The 50-period (blue) and 100-period (green) moving averages are now above the price, acting as resistance, signaling a short-term bearish bias. Market structure suggests consolidation is underway, with momentum shifting toward bears.

50412548,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79451,1755734413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Says XRP Is Preparing for the Next Pump to $5. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-preparing-for-the-next-pump-to-5-heres-why/,"XRP is once again drawing attention from traders as its price structure points to a potential breakout. Market analyst JackTheRippler recently argued on X that XRP is “preparing for the next pump,” projecting a move beyond $5. A closer look at the charts suggests that his forecast is grounded in the asset’s current technical formation. A Strong Ascending Channel The weekly BITSTAMP chart shows XRP moving within a clearly defined ascending channel that has been intact since late 2024. This structure is characterized by higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a market that continues to build strength over time. As of report time, XRP trades at $2.95, positioned near the middle of this channel after retreating from resistance just above $3.30 earlier in the summer. The preservation of this upward channel underscores a strong underlying trend, as each pullback has been met with renewed demand at higher levels. #XRP IS PREPARING FOR THE NEXT PUMP! $5+ IMMINENT pic.twitter.com/wJrsI6XICS — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 20, 2025 Testing Support and Eyeing Resistance The channel has established consistent zones where traders respond. Each time XRP has approached the lower boundary in the $2.50 to $2.60 region, buyers have defended the level, reaffirming it as a reliable base of support. On the other hand, resistance has been repeatedly felt near the channel’s upper edge, which currently lies in the $3.30 to $3.50 range . Price now sits at a pivotal mid-channel position, where momentum typically begins to build before the next decisive move. If buyers regain control and drive the price above the upper boundary, the chart implies an extension that naturally projects toward the $5 level. Why the $5 Target Holds Weight JackTheRippler’s $5 call aligns with the measured move potential that often follows channel breakouts. When an asset consistently trends within parallel rails, a breakout to the upside typically produces gains equal to the width of the channel. In XRP’s case, the projected path from the current formation places the next significant resistance zone near $5. This target is not arbitrary—it follows directly from the geometry of the trend and the strength of recurring support that has underpinned XRP’s rise throughout 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Integrity of the Pattern The credibility of this setup lies in its consistency. Both the support and resistance levels of the channel have been tested multiple times, confirming the validity of the structure. As long as XRP continues to respect these levels, the broader bias remains bullish. A decisive breakout above resistance would confirm market conviction and pave the way toward $5 , while a sustained drop below $2.50 would be required to invalidate the pattern. Final Outlook XRP’s technical outlook provides a clear explanation for JackTheRippler’s $5 projection. The cryptocurrency is locked within a disciplined ascending channel, consolidating near its midpoint and preparing for its next directional move. With the trend firmly intact and resistance levels within reach, a breakout could propel XRP into the $5 region in the near term. The case is not built on speculation but on the strength of the chart itself, which continues to show resilience and upward momentum.

With presales often linked to major updates, wallet releases, or new blockchain features, choosing the right ones can deliver strong growth potential. In 2025, a few projects are gaining momentum through adoption, funding, and standout ideas. BlockDAG has attracted strong attention with its hybrid framework and large-scale fundraising, while Nexchain AI has stepped up as an ambitious AI-powered blockchain. Best Wallet is changing how wallets operate by rewarding user activity in ways not seen before, and Remittix is building its place in the PayFi sector with real-world payment use cases. Each of these presales adds something unique, but BlockDAG’s scale, adoption, and presale record make it especially noteworthy. This article explores why these are the top crypto presale for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Strength in Hybrid Design and $378M Presale BlockDAG is gaining speed with a hybrid Directed Acyclic Graph and Proof-of-Work model, creating a system that supports high-speed transactions while keeping decentralization. It is also EVM-compatible, allowing Ethereum-based apps to run without barriers. Adoption has been impressive even before launch, with over 2.5 million users joining via the X1 mobile miner app. More than 19,300 ASIC miners have also been distributed, creating one of the most inclusive mining setups in the industry. This dual mining option enables casual mobile users and large-scale miners to take part, strengthening the network and driving adoption further. The presale has moved quickly, raising $378 million in Batch 29, with BDAG priced at $0.0276. Early buyers have already seen paper returns of around 2,660% as prices rose with each batch. Analysts project a possible $1 listing price, which could mean about 36× growth from the current stage, making it a key presale to watch. Adding to this, BlockDAG (BDAG) has introduced a 200 ETH competition worth nearly $1 million, aimed at boosting community involvement and rewarding active presale buyers. With strong technology, rapid adoption, and notable financial milestones, BlockDAG has positioned itself as a leader in the top crypto presale of 2025, setting up one of the most anticipated launches of the year. 2. Nexchain AI: Speed, Security, and AI-driven Features Nexchain AI is making progress as an AI-powered Layer-1 blockchain created for scalability, high speed, and advanced smart contract use. It runs with a hybrid Proof-of-Stake plus AI-driven consensus and is designed to reach up to 400,000 transactions per second at fees as low as $0.001. The system enhances smart contracts through fraud detection and real-time adjustment, offering use cases in finance, logistics, and healthcare. Security is also central, using post-quantum cryptography and AI-driven error checks. The network has passed a CertiK audit, which improves trust in its framework. The presale is currently in Stage 25, with NEX priced at $0.10 and about $8.5–$8.8 million raised toward a $9.27 million goal. Supporters benefit from community programs, testnet activities, and codes like TESTNET100 offering extra bonuses. Nexchain AI has also launched a $5 million airdrop campaign to expand adoption. With estimates that NEX could rise to $0.30 at launch, there is speculation of a 300% increase. These elements place Nexchain AI as one of the key projects in the top crypto presale for 2025. 3. Best Wallet: Turning Usage into Real Rewards Best Wallet changes the idea of a crypto wallet by offering rewards for user activity instead of just storage. It gives back to the community whenever users swap, transfer, or ramp crypto. With cashback on transactions, referral programs, and rewards through its CWT coin, it transforms self-custody into a way to earn. Plans also include rebates for gas fees, stronger transparency on transactions, and eventually a Layer-2 scaling path to add more speed. Its presale has drawn attention for its clear model and accessible setup. CWT is the base of this reward-focused system, and demand has grown as the network moves closer to launch. Best Wallet’s presale pricing and design make it a platform that goes beyond storage, acting as a hub for daily crypto utility. With its presale open, Best Wallet stands out as one of the leading names in the top crypto presale, especially for those seeking simple use combined with real benefits. 4. Remittix: Building Global PayFi Solutions Remittix is working to improve global payments, positioning itself as a PayFi service that connects crypto with standard banking systems. Its Web3 wallet, set for beta release on September 15, 2025, will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies with instant conversion. This creates a practical way to send funds worldwide, offering zero foreign exchange fees and same-day settlement across 30+ countries. With only 50 testers chosen for the beta launch, anticipation continues to grow. The presale is close to reaching $20 million, with RTX priced around $0.092–$0.0944 and bonus offers of 40–50%. A major centralized exchange listing is expected once the $20 million mark is crossed, driving momentum. Passing a CertiK audit with no critical issues has added more trust. Analysts project the chance for 100× growth in 2025 due to its real-world payment model and low market cap. With giveaways and community activity included, Remittix secures its place as a notable name in the top crypto presale this year. Final Thoughts: Four Presales Defining 2025 Presales remain one of the strongest ways to access crypto projects early, and 2025 brings several promising names. BlockDAG leads with unmatched presale fundraising, adoption through mobile and ASIC miners, and a unique hybrid model mixing DAG with Proof-of-Work. Nexchain AI adds a future-focused AI blockchain, Best Wallet converts regular usage into active rewards, and Remittix delivers practical PayFi services for global use. With BlockDAG’s $378 million raised, Nexchain AI’s advanced Layer-1 setup, Best Wallet’s cashback model, and Remittix’s near $20 million milestone with an upcoming wallet launch, these projects represent the top crypto presale for 2025 . Each has distinct strengths, but together they show how presales are driving the next wave of adoption. Choosing the right one now could mean joining some of the most important launches in the coming cycle.

Currently trading at $2.8, XRP has made a 3.68% decline in the past 24 hours, with trading volume rising slightly by 0.82% to $6.85 billion. Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ The latest downturn comes after on-chain data revealed that whales offloaded 470 million XRP tokens over the past 10 days, slashing their cumulative holdings to just 7.63 billion coins. Large-scale exits by wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP suggest institutional desks and high-net-worth traders are taking profits after XRP’s recent rally to above $3.39 earlier this month. XRP Price Action: $2.85–$2.90 Becomes Key Battleground Price action data shows XRP’s sharpest drop occurred between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC on August 19, when it slid from $3.04 to $2.93 as volume spiked to 137 million, nearly double the daily average. Despite heavy selling, buyers repeatedly defended the $2.85–$2.88 zone, preventing further collapse. Currently, XRP is consolidating near $2.85–$2.90, a sign that short-term selling pressure may be easing. Still, resistance at $3.04 has been confirmed, making a bullish recovery difficult without stronger demand. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Can Bulls Hold the Line at $2.8? For traders, the $2.8 level is now the most critical support to watch. A breakdown could open the door for a deeper decline, while reclaiming $3.00 would signal renewed buyer strength. Analysts note that a recovery above $3.19 is essential for momentum to shift back in favor of the bulls. Adding to the pressure, a security audit ranked the XRP Ledger lowest among 15 major blockchains, sparking concerns over long-term resilience. Meanwhile, the U.S. SEC has delayed decisions on several XRP ETF applications, including Nasdaq’s CoinShares filing, until October, deepening regulatory uncertainty.

XRP has entered a fresh bullish phase, while SHIB has reignited excitement with a massive burn rate surge. Both are trending and creating short-term opportunities. But for long-term plays, the question remains: which project blends momentum with lasting adoption? That’s where Cold Wallet enters. Rather than chasing hype, it is building adoption through strategy, most notably, the $270M Plus Wallet acquisition. This deal instantly positioned Cold Wallet as a serious contender in self-custody, backed by both a strong presale and a ready-made user base. Ripple (XRP) Technicals Indicate Strong Breakout Potential Ripple is once again drawing headlines as XRP price charts point to a potential breakout. Its structure is pressing against resistance, and momentum is supported by the expanding stablecoin market. More stablecoin usage boosts demand for networks like XRP that support fast liquidity transfers. Analysts highlight XRP consolidating near a key zone that, if broken, could send prices to record highs. With volume increasing and Ripple’s reputation as a payment solution leader, its case for further upside is strong. For long-term holders, Ripple’s resilience against legal challenges and relevance in cross-border payments give it credibility. But the pace of adoption will still decide its next big move. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Fuels Price Forecast Shiba Inu delivered a 5% price jump in just 24 hours after an 83,000% surge in burn rate. This sharp reduction in supply lit up the SHIB community, with many predicting more upside. SHIB’s model has always leaned on its loyal community and token burns. This latest move proves retail appetite for high-volatility coins is still alive in 2025. But questions remain about sustainability. Burn events may create scarcity, but without deeper utility or ecosystem growth, momentum risks fading. Projects like Shibarium help, but SHIB still depends on community energy more than long-term fundamentals. Cold Wallet’s Plus Wallet Acquisition Powers Adoption and Presale Growth While XRP and SHIB thrive on cycles, Cold Wallet is building something more durable. At its core, it is a self-custody wallet powered by the $CWT token, rewarding users for on-chain actions like swaps, transfers, and bridging. What makes 2025 different is its bold adoption play, the $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet. This move brought over 2 million users into Cold Wallet’s ecosystem instantly. For a presale-stage project, that’s unheard of. Instead of waiting years for adoption, Cold Wallet starts with a large user base and expands faster than rivals. At the presale level, Cold Wallet is priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, with over $6.3M raised and more than 740 million tokens sold. Unlike many presales, this one is paired with real adoption pipelines. It isn’t just speculation; it’s a product that people can use from day one. Referral bonuses add another layer of growth. Users receive 10% of their referrals’ purchases in $CWT, and referees earn 5%. Both are vested under the same terms as bought tokens, creating fairness and sustainability. With 25% of supply allocated to rewards and team tokens locked for years, inflation is avoided. The acquisition and presale momentum align perfectly with rising demand for self-custody wallets. Cold Wallet offers users full control of their assets while rewarding everyday activity, setting it apart from hype-driven projects. Final Words Ripple brings payment use cases and a strong setup for traders, while Shiba Inu thrives on community and burns. Both have appeal, but they remain tied to cycles. Cold Wallet, with its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition and $6.3M raised, is building differently. By combining real adoption with presale success, it creates long-term value while rewarding users daily. For anyone searching for the best long-term crypto investment, Cold Wallet stands out as the project built to scale.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin steadied in Asia Thursday at $114,610 (+1.4%), clawing back some ground after last week’s slide, while ether outpaced with a 5.8% jump to $4,370.73 as investors rotated selectively across the market. The CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the performance of the largest crypto assets, is up 3.5%, trading above 4,078. OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin said in a note to CoinDesk that the rising ETH/BTC ratio shows capital shifting into ether’s relative strength while Bitcoin consolidates. ""Crypto capital is getting more selective,"" Lin told CoinDesk. She stressed that this is not a broad “altseason,” but a targeted move into ETH as macro catalysts like the Jackson Hole conference and U.S. inflation data loom. Fresh figures from CryptoQuant underline why Bitcoin’s rally has cooled. Apparent demand has dropped from 174,000 BTC in July to 59,000 BTC today, while ETF inflows have slowed to their weakest since April,"" the firm wrote in a recent report. Profit-taking remains heavy, with whales realizing $2 billion in gains on Aug. 16 alone, bringing total realized profits since July to $74 billion. CryptoQuant analysts now classify the market as in a “bullish cooldown” phase, with $110,000 flagged as an important support level. In a note to CoinDesk, analysts at Enflux, a Singapore-based market maker noted that retail enthusiasm for altseason has dropped sharply compared to last week, even as strategic bets like BNB hitting all-time highs and Hyperliquid’s operational strength continue to draw capital. “This indicates that the altcoin market is no longer a uniform beta trade, as macro conviction is forming, but more selective and concentrated, also on the institutional side,” the firm said. The result is a market less defined by broad rallies and more by selective winners, with ETH setting the tone as capital stays in crypto but moves with sharper focus, favoring resilience over speculation. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin edged up 1.4% to just above $114,000 while U.S. stocks slipped, and altcoins showed unusual resilience as BTC dominance nears a six-month low. ETH: Ether outperformed bitcoin, climbing 5.8% as traders rotated into majors despite slowing BTC demand. Gold: UBS raised its gold price target to $3,600 per ounce in Q1 2026, citing the strongest bullion demand since 2011 driven by U.S. macro risks, de-dollarization, and heavy ETF and central bank buying. S&P 500: The Nasdaq fell 0.68% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.26% Wednesday as investors rotated out of tech stocks into sectors like energy, healthcare, and consumer staples ahead of the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium.

Switzerland has become the latest hotspot for mainstream integration, with SPAR enabling crypto payments across more than 100 stores and growing to 300 sites soon. Using DFX.swiss and Binance Pay, clients may now settle invoices with over 100 tokens, including stablecoins, with quick confirmation and no gas fees. Ripple is also making news, appearing in Gemini’s IPO filing with a fresh $75 million credit facility. The deal not only gives Gemini more cash before its market debut, but it also sets Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin up for wider use by businesses. XRP is selling well, and people are now beginning to speculate if the coin could eventually hit $10 or more in 2025. Investors are also interested in projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that are trying to get in early before the next important spike. Crypto Payments Go Mainstream in Switzerland SPAR’s launch is being lauded as one of the most visible indicators that digital assets are no longer limited to trading desks. Merchants pay around two-thirds less in transaction fees than they would with a credit card, while customers get their money quickly and without having to pay for gas. Another strong inducement for adoption is Switzerland’s planned five-year tax exemption on cryptocurrency revenues, which will start in 2025. The Top New Crypto Contender Gains Momentum In line with XRP’s growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads within the market. With only a few tokens available and a lot of people wanting them, the presale has quickly sold out in several phases. Analysts are already comparing it to the early days of Shiba Inu, claiming that people who get in now could make a lot of money when the project goes live on big exchanges. Its quick development in the community and early success make it one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on in 2025. Ripple’s Strategy Beyond IPO Buzz The IPO filing by Gemini exposes not only financial pressure, but also Ripple’s strategic impact. The deal might go up to $150 million, which is more than the first $75 million facility. It could also include Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which came out in late 2024 and is already getting a lot of attention from institutions. Ripple isn’t trying to go public; instead, it’s focusing on buying other companies and growing its ecosystem. This keeps XRP in a strong position for future growth. Conclusion: Eyes on $10 XRP The case for XRP reaching $10 by 2025 is getting stronger as more people in Switzerland use crypto and Ripple pushes for more businesses to use it. Bullish mood is growing because more people are using Ripple, transactions are cheaper, and Ripple’s ecosystem is getting bigger. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-growth bet , providing investors with a rare early-stage chance before the next bull surge begins.

Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high of $123,000 last week. It has since pulled back, falling nearly 9% from that peak. After approaching a new record high last week, Ether's closing price experienced a significant retreat, dropping over 14% from that peak. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high of $123,000 last week. It has since pulled back, falling nearly 9% from that peak. BTC is now up ~20% year to date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. After approaching a new record high last week, Ether's closing price experienced a significant retreat, dropping over 14% from that peak. ETH is now ~21% year to date and is ~15% below its record high from November 2021 XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), and Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

50413681,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788672,1755735450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50413681.jpeg,"Palantir’s six-session slump erases $73 billion in value, as short sellers finally win",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/palantirs-six-session-slump-erases-73b/,"Palantir just got dragged through six painful days on Wall Street, losing $73 billion in market value and giving short sellers a rare payday after months of losses. This losing streak, which started after the stock hit a record high on August 12, marks the company’s worst run since April 2024. Shares are now down over 17%, putting them on track for the ugliest week since the tariff-driven drop earlier this year. Despite being the biggest loser in the S&P 500 over the last six sessions, Palantir is still the top performer on the index in 2025, holding a 106% gain since the start of the year. That explosive rally led to a sky-high valuation, which most short sellers couldn’t handle. But this latest slide finally gave them room to breathe, and collect. Shorts pocket gains after long beating The decline handed $1.6 billion in profits to traders who bet against the Denver-based company, data from S3 Partners LLC showed. But those profits don’t undo the $4.5 billion in total losses short sellers have suffered this year betting against Palantir. The overall trend had been brutal for contrarians—until now. Matthew Unterman, managing director at S3, said short interest as a percentage of Palantir’s float dropped to 2.5%, down from nearly 5% a year ago. That means many traders had already exited their short positions as the stock kept rising. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC, said those traders either “wanted to avoid being run over by a monster momentum trade or were forced out after the freight train hit.” Vikram Rai, a portfolio manager and macro trader at Fny Capital Management LP, made it clear that the current drop wasn’t caused by bears taking control. “The selloff that we’re seeing in Palantir, it’s long overdue and it’s not because the short sellers have taken over,” Vikram said . He pointed to broader market weakness, especially in tech names like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which are also under pressure. “When you have the likes of Google, Meta and Microsoft declining, then obviously the high-beta stocks, which are hopelessly overvalued, will decline more.” Most of Palantir’s rise in 2025 came from long-only investors rather than a short squeeze. But with the stock finally showing some weakness, some contrarians are stepping back in. Short interest has grown by around 10 million shares since June, according to S3. That’s still a small chunk of Palantir’s 2.3 billion shares outstanding, but it’s a sign of growing pressure. Tech under pressure as investors rotate out The hit to Palantir isn’t happening in a vacuum. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.76 points, or 0.68%, ending at 21,170.19. The S&P 500 slipped 16.40 points, or 0.26%, closing at 6,394.97. Only the Dow Jones held flat, edging up by 1.48 points to 44,923.75. Investors are rotating away from tech into cheaper sectors like energy, healthcare, and consumer staples. The pullback comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where traders expect to hear new signals about policy direction. At the same time, worries are building across the tech space. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently warned that AI stocks are “in a bubble,” triggering more selloffs. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology added to the panic, showing that many tech companies aren’t yet turning their AI investments into actual profits. That’s not the only concern. President Donald Trump’s administration is now weighing the idea of taking equity stakes in chipmakers like Intel, just weeks after pushing revenue-sharing deals with Nvidia and AMD. That idea rattled investors. Shares of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Micro all fell in response. Traders are watching Nvidia’s earnings set for August 27, hoping to get a better sense of demand in the AI space. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Investor sentiment is buoyed by fading legal overhangs, renewed institutional interest, and strong technical setups forming on the charts. Analysts’ predictions vary, with moderate targets pointing toward $4 and more aggressive outlooks extending to the $5–$7 range or higher if momentum holds. This optimism has pulled traders back into XRP, but many also recognize the limitations of large-cap assets. While XRP may offer double- or triple-digit gains, the kind of exponential upside that defines bull market legends is usually found in smaller , earlier-stage projects. That’s why presale opportunities are attracting increasing attention. Investors are not just hunting for tokens with upside – they are looking for projects that can capture narrative power in a way that drives attention, liquidity, and long-term community growth. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE begins to stand apart. Key Catalysts Supporting XRP’s Momentum First, regulatory clarity is improving: the long-running SEC legal battle with Ripple is winding down, improving confidence in the token’s legitimacy. Second, U.S. legislative developments – including the GENIUS Act and Digital Markets Clarity Act – as well as plans to open crypto to retirement accounts like 401(k)s, are energizing institutional sentiment and encouraging broader adoption. Third, technical resistance near the $3.40–$3.60 range could be tested as momentum builds; some analysts even envision a clean breakout toward $4 or higher for XRP. Furthermore, veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt has forecasted a possible 60% rally toward $4.47 , while Standard Chartered anticipates XRPs could reach $5.50 by year-end, $8 in 2026, and even $12.50 by 2028. These bullish projections highlight a growing expectation that hype, adoption, and macro tailwinds may drive XRP to new highs. Amid this rally, many investors are pivoting their attention to presale opportunities outside XRP—seeking upside before markets become crowded. One such play gaining attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With XRP climbing toward record highs, a different countdown is capturing attention in presale markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the verge of closing its latest round, with allocations nearly gone. What sets it apart isn’t just the rapid sellout pace but the way early adopters are locking in positions before major exchange exposure begins . Each presale stage has introduced scarcity-driven demand, and thousands of participants have already joined in anticipation of the next pricing jump . The project’s unique political branding adds another layer of visibility, ensuring it resonates far beyond typical crypto circles. For investors looking at XRP’s surge as proof of capital rotation into altcoins, MAGACOIN represents a chance to secure exposure at presale prices before the next pump phase ignites. Altcoins in the Spotlight as XRP Gains Traction XRP’s strength often sets the tone for broader altcoin sector movements. A breakout could catalyze renewed interest across mid-cap and narrative-driven tokens. Markets frequently rotate from major movers into high-potential presale opportunities, especially those with political or cultural nuance. As attention converges on XRP’s new highs, MAGACOIN sits at the crossroads: benefiting from the spotlight while offering clean branding, capped supply, and growth clarity. Conclusion XRP is setting up for a compelling push toward new highs before summer ends, supported by regulatory clarity, bullish technical patterns, and strong analyst projections. That build-up could spark a sector-wide shift toward similarly dynamic altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with presale rounds nearly sold out and extra allocations incentivizing early participation, offers a scaled-down , branded entry point poised to leverage the mainstream momentum of this rally. For investors seeking to ride the wave both on-chain and in political-themed token storytelling, it might just be the most strategic bet of the season .

Mechanism: Foundation-led $260M buyback (6-week schedule) Start Date: July 21, 2025 Cumulative Impact: ~$150M executed in ~30 days Supply Effect: ~3.48% of circulating supply, ~1.53% of total supply This is one of the largest foundation-managed buybacks in crypto so far. CoinMarketCap: $ENA trades at $0.71, market cap $4.32B. Why Buybacks Matters Buybacks sound bullish, but execution is what matters. In equities, they reduce shares and boost EPS. In crypto, the impact depends on how buybacks are funded and whether they can last. $HYPE: sustainable, tied to protocol fees. $PUMP: turns meme-driven traffic into token support. $ENA: foundation-backed, showing scale and structure. But buybacks are not guaranteed. Protocols can stop anytime. If revenue slows, the mechanism loses weight. Bigger Picture To Monitor The rise of buybacks shows crypto maturing. Projects are now recycling profits back into their tokens, instead of relying only on emissions or hype. That creates a loop: user activity drives fees, fees drive buybacks, and buybacks support tokens. It’s the closest crypto has come to equity-style capital returns. Still, there are risks. Some projects may announce programs and underdeliver. Others could overcommit and hurt their treasuries. The key question remains: is the buyback funded by real revenue? Buybacks are one of the clearest tokenomics trends in 2025. They don’t automatically make a token bullish, but they change the narrative. $HYPE proves scale. $PUMP adds a backbone to memes. $ENA shows how foundations can run structured buybacks. What matters is sustainability. A buyback backed by fees is stronger than one backed by reserves. The real winners will be projects that align buybacks with long-term revenue.

The move is designed to make global market access faster, cheaper, and more seamless for millions of users. TRON’s high-volume network, known for its low fees and fast settlement times, is well-suited for asset tokenization. With this integration, xStocks extends beyond its initial Solana and BNB Chain launches, giving traders and investors more options and less friction across blockchains. Kraken first introduced xStocks on June 1, 2025, allowing users to trade tokenized shares of leading US companies directly on-chain. Each xStock is fully backed 1:1 by the corresponding underlying equity. Through this latest expansion, eligible clients can soon deposit and withdraw xStocks via the TRON network, offering the same ease as transferring stablecoins. Issued by Swiss-based Backed Finance in the form of TRC-20 tokens, each xStock remains securely tied to its real-world counterpart. TRON DAO will further support adoption by integrating the tokens across its wide ecosystem of applications and partners. Since launch, xStocks has seen rapid adoption, with combined centralized and decentralized trading volumes surpassing $2.5 billion . Kraken’s co-CEO Arjun Sethi emphasized that deploying xStocks on three blockchains in under 60 days demonstrates the power of open, multichain architecture. He added that TRON’s global scale, speed, and low fees significantly value Kraken’s vision for tokenized markets. TRON offers speed, scale, and global access TRON is no stranger to traffic. It already dominates global stablecoin transfers , which it processes daily in the billions. Today, TRON is in the top five blockchains according to total value locked, including over USD 6 billion on its network. This scale and efficiency made the high-volume blockchain an obvious choice for an xStocks app. The founder of TRON, Justin Sun, said the integration would help make finance more inclusive: “Tokenized equities represent a natural evolution for crypto, bridging traditional markets with blockchain. As demand for popular equities meets a global base of previously excluded users, we’ll see a more efficient, flexible, and accessible market.” Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said the move aligned with the main strength of high-volume blockchain. He explained that TRON users were already transferring millions in stablecoins at very low cost, and the next step was to extend that use case to tokenized equities. According to him, this shift would allow people worldwide to access traditional markets with the same ease as sending digital dollars. Kraken seizes a global market opportunity The integration of TRON by Kraken is part of its broader goal of replatforming Wall Street on the blockchain. The company already has customers in more than 140 countries. More locations will be rolled out over the coming weeks, providing access to tokenized stocks for an even larger user base. It’s a simple idea: Let people trade stocks the way the internet lives — boundaryless, permissionless, and interoperable for every chain. With multichain yStake, Kraken is knocking down similar walls that have all too often made traditional markets off limits to all. That often represents their first chance to have exposure to US stocks. That could be life-changing in places where savers have limited or costly access to a traditional brokerage account.

He aped into @Solana’s newest memecoin, $YZY, with $768K. The chart ripped. Market cap touched $134M (CMC) before crashing. By the time he rage-sold, his stack was worth just $56K. The wipeout lit Crypto Twitter on fire. NEW: A whale bought $768K of @Solana memecoin $YZY , its market cap spiked to $134M and then dropped instantly. Just 4 hours later, he sold it for $56K — a ~$712K loss. pic.twitter.com/RpTFW2uIw8 — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 20, 2025 Finnbags and the Kanye Play Behind $YZY is @finnbags, Founder & CEO of @BagsApp . Last night he launched the token himself. CT says he pulled a Sahil move: making memes, farming his own referrals, and steering liquidity. hey @kanyewest we made a $YZY coin for you on @BagsApp You get 100% of royalties earned from the trading volume of the coin. $50K has already been raised for you in the first 10 minutes. 70% of the supply is locked and can be transferred to you on a vesting schedule.… — FINN (@finnbags) August 19, 2025 The setup was wild: FINN bought 70% of supply at launch. 100% of trading fees went straight to Kanye West’s wallet. Market went full PvP. Cap nearly hit $13M (CMC) within hours. Then Finn tweeted at @kanyewest, telling him to “claim” the fees. Traders weren’t laughing. The chart nuked. Market cap dumped to $1.5M (CMC) overnight. Theories flew. Some pointed at Wintermute, calling it a money laundering op. Others just said it felt like a clout grab gone wrong. CT Starts Digging The backlash didn’t stop at the token. Clips of Finn’s old stream with @MrBeast resurfaced, no crypto talk in sight. Later, his appearance on @notthreadguy’s stream made things worse. Excuses didn’t land. Trust cratered. Every token tied to him bled. The “launch for Ye” meme collapsed before it even got traction. A few influencers like @SOL_IDNESS defended him, arguing intentions weren’t bad. But the larger CT consensus? If Kanye is already a billionaire, why would he ever need a memecoin fee drop? The Pumpfun Angle To Note As the drama grew, @StalkHQ traced the $YZY chart. Turns out, much of the run was botted. The dev botted the fake $yzy chart and pushed it all the way to $82M market cap, yet only made $3.62K in Pumpfun @pumpdotfun creator rewards. This shows the dev isn’t making much from rewards, meaning their main profit path could be through rugging the token instead. https://t.co/cFstowO0Nm pic.twitter.com/5EMgRiwVGr — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) August 20, 2025 On Pumpfun , the dev pushed the chart all the way to $82M market cap, but only earned $3.62K in creator rewards. That mismatch tells a story. If devs don’t make money from Pumpfun rewards, their main incentive leans toward rugging. Compare it to imperfect, another Pumpfun token. Market cap sits at just $1.27M (CMC). Yet its creator already pulled $3.53K in rewards. Smaller, but more sustainable. The difference is clear: organic community-driven growth pays creators better. Botted pumps may look strong, but they usually collapse fast, leaving exit scams as the only profit path. What This Shows 1. Pumpfun doesn’t reward fake pumps. When a chart rockets but creator rewards stay tiny, it’s often bot-driven. 2. Organic traction is king. Tokens that build communities see rewards track closely with their growth. 3. Red flag signal. High market cap + low rewards = botting risk, and often rugs. It’s exactly what happened with $YZY. The chart went vertical, but the mismatch gave it away. And when the smoke cleared, the whale’s $768K entry became a $56K exit. The Bigger Picture For CT, the episode blends two familiar storylines: whales getting torched chasing hype, and founders turning launchpads into personal casinos. The Kanye angle just made it messier. What was pitched as a “token for Ye” ended up as another quick pump, another crash, another bag burned. And it leaves a blunt takeaway: If a billionaire like Kanye isn’t claiming it, maybe you shouldn’t either. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

They let early buyers join before major listings, often at more favorable prices. Yet not every presale delivers. The most promising ones show strong funding, active communities, and clear plans that look solid for the long run. Some depend on cultural hype but still succeed in drawing attention from traders aiming for fast moves. This article highlights four projects gaining traction: BlockDAG, Maxi Doge ($MAXI), Snorter Bot ($SNORT), and PepeNode ($PEPENODE). Each brings different strengths, ranging from real technical progress to heavy community buzz. For anyone scanning the top crypto presales, these four stand out for combining adoption trends with high speculation appeal. 1. BlockDAG: $376M Secured and Still Rising BlockDAG has emerged as one of the largest presales of 2025. It merges Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) design with Proof-of-Work (PoW) for a system that balances speed with decentralization. It also supports EVM compatibility, letting developers launch Ethereum-based apps and contracts with ease. The presale has crossed $376 million, with BDAG priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29. Early participants from Batch 1 are already up more than 2,660%, and projections suggest the price could move toward $1 after listing, offering about a 36× jump. Adoption metrics are also compelling. The X1 mobile miner app has brought in more than 2.5 million users, while over 19,300 ASIC miners have been delivered, creating one of the most inclusive mining setups today. The project already counts more than 200,000 holders and a developer group of 4,500+ building 300 decentralized apps ahead of the mainnet. To build momentum further, BlockDAG launched a 200 ETH competition worth around $1 million. Those who expand their holdings during the presale can join for a chance to win, adding more excitement. With 20 exchange listings secured and plans for Coinbase and Gemini in motion, BlockDAG (BDAG) is positioned well. For anyone evaluating the top crypto presales, this is a clear standout as its framework and community are already established before trading begins. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Culture with Extra Features Maxi Doge takes inspiration from meme culture but adds plans that go beyond humor. While rooted in the same community energy that drove past meme coin surges, $MAXI aims to combine fun with a roadmap that includes staking, reward systems, and a small NFT marketplace. This gives it more depth than projects relying on memes alone. The presale has been set up to attract both casual buyers and early participants, using low barriers and frequent community activities. Strong social media engagement has boosted interest, and its identity resonates across different groups. Even though it is still in presale, Maxi Doge is getting attention by blending cultural relevance with modest utility features. For those who value both hype and long-term ideas, $MAXI stands out among the top crypto presales as a project mixing fun with potential staying power. 3. Snorter Bot ($SNORT): Designed for Fast Access Snorter Bot is focused on improving speed and ease of use in crypto. Its goal is to deliver low-cost, high-speed transactions paired with a clear interface that can work for experienced traders as well as newcomers. By building cross-chain compatibility, it is shaping a platform that connects with multiple networks while keeping costs efficient. The presale has drawn notice by offering rewards to early users and setting out a roadmap that includes incentives for active participation. This approach could help build a loyal user base that values both speed and perks. At today’s presale price, it presents an affordable entry before listing on exchanges. While the project still needs to prove itself, $SNORT’s balance of function and simplicity gives it appeal. For those reviewing the top crypto presales, Snorter Bot is a project that offers both utility and opportunity. 4. PepeNode ($PEPENODE): Viral Energy with Broader Goals PepeNode aims to harness meme-driven hype while adding plans for functional growth. Building around the viral Pepe theme, it uses community energy to drive attention while outlining a platform that could provide rewards and limited integration with decentralized projects. This approach allows it to ride the popularity of memes while adding extra features for users. Its presale has been made widely accessible, with low entry levels designed for broad participation. Online groups and meme communities have helped spread its reach, putting $PEPENODE in a position to stand out if the team follows through on its plans. Though not as advanced as larger presales, the project’s mix of meme strength and functional aims makes it notable. For those who like community-driven projects but want some added utility, $PEPENODE ranks among the top crypto presales worth watching in 2025. Closing Thoughts Presales offer early chances to join, but the strongest ones combine real adoption with clear paths forward. BlockDAG has already set itself apart, raising more than $376 million, attracting millions of users, thousands of developers, and launching a $1M competition to boost activity. Maxi Doge blends meme power with staking and NFT features. Snorter Bot targets speed, simplicity, and cross-chain links, while PepeNode mixes viral culture with light functional goals. For anyone searching the top crypto presales , these four show how hype and fundamentals can work together. BlockDAG especially stands out since it already has major funding, an active ecosystem, and multiple exchange listings in motion. If it reaches $1 after launch as analysts suggest, it could deliver some of the strongest results in 2025.

Two names drawing attention are Arbitrum (ARB) and XRP. Arbitrum’s charts show technical breakouts pointing to higher targets, while XRP stays in focus thanks to fresh updates on exchange activity and shifting positions among holders. Both tokens play important roles in the crypto space, giving analysts plenty to follow. But the real question for most buyers isn’t which coin makes the loudest headline; it’s which has staying power. In that search for the top crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet is making its mark. With a presale built around adoption, structured tokenomics, and proven demand, it offers something many projects lack: a design built to last. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Momentum Draws Trader Interest Arbitrum gained attention in August as bullish momentum lifted its price above key technical levels. Analysts highlight a breakout that opened targets as high as $1.20, giving it strength while other altcoins stall. This Arbitrum price momentum has traders suggesting it could spark renewed capital flow into Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, where ARB holds a lead. Its relevance goes beyond short-term moves. Arbitrum powers one of Ethereum’s largest scaling systems, handling fast and cheap transactions. With DeFi apps expanding and developers committed, ARB sits at the centre of the infrastructure conversation. If it sustains momentum toward higher levels, it could remain a strong candidate for the top crypto to buy now. Still, risks remain. $1.20 is a key target, and failure to hold support could trigger setbacks. Investors will need to weigh its technical signals against wider market trends. XRP News Highlights Market Uncertainty And Potential XRP continues to grab headlines, this time with Coinbase cutting its holdings by over 50%. Some took this as a negative, but analysts suggest it reflects risk management more than rejection. Even so, XRP’s price shows both resilience and hesitation. The bullish case points to Ripple’s improving legal clarity, which could attract institutions. Bears, however, argue that XRP’s inability to sustain breakouts remains a concern. These opposing views make XRP a battleground, yet its place among the biggest crypto assets ensures it stays relevant. For those deciding if XRP is the top crypto to buy right now, much depends on whether institutions expand adoption. Without new triggers, the token risks stagnation even with its strong reputation. Cold Wallet Presale Delivers Real Utility & ROI Potential Cold Wallet is offering something different: a presale tied to real-world function, not just hype. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, it has raised $6.3M and sold more than 740M tokens. Instead of relying on speculation, it rewards users directly. Every gas fee, swap, or transfer turns into cashback paid in $CWT, making everyday crypto use a source of return. This utility-first design sets it apart. Cold Wallet operates as a self-custody mobile app with no KYC, no waiting, and full control of assets. Planned Layer-2 integration will lower or even remove gas fees, making rewards instant and cost-free. Unlike meme-driven projects, Cold Wallet ties adoption to real benefits, ensuring users have reasons to keep engaging long term. Its tokenomics reinforce this structure: 40% allocated to presale, 25% to rewards, with team allocations locked for years. This reduces inflation risk and aligns growth with user participation. The presale’s 150-stage design ensures steady scaling, with early entrants enjoying the strongest ROI potential, up to 4,900%. Cold Wallet shows why structure matters. By turning costs into earnings and offering a sustainable model, it is positioning itself as the top crypto to buy right now, especially for those seeking value beyond hype. Final Outlook: Why Cold Wallet’s Design Sets It Apart Arbitrum’s momentum signals strength in Ethereum scaling, while XRP’s ongoing news proves its market presence. Both hold potential but rely on external triggers to deliver gains. Cold Wallet instead focuses on usability and reward mechanics. With $6.3M raised, 740M+ tokens sold, and cashback that grows with adoption, it is building long-term value from the ground up. For 2025, the best performers may be those designed for daily use, and Cold Wallet looks ready to lead that category.

50414699,561445,1755738048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50414699.jpeg,Argentina’s Capital Adopts Crypto For Tax Payments,https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-capital-adopts-crypto-for-tax-payments/,"Buenos Aires has switched on “BA Cripto,” a policy package that lets residents and businesses settle city taxes and administrative fees using cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Rolled out on Tuesday, August 19, 2025, the program covers municipal levies such as ABL (property tax), Patentes (vehicle tax), and Ingresos Brutos (turnover tax), as well as non-tax procedures like driver’s licenses and traffic fines, payable via a city QR flow. Buenos Aires Goes Crypto City Hall’s move is broader than a payments toggle. Officials unveiled four measures: adding crypto-linked activities to the city’s economic-activity nomenclator to simplify filings; excluding virtual-asset service providers (PSAVs) from certain bank-collection regimes under the turnover tax; shifting the taxable base for crypto trading from gross transaction value to the net spread; and enabling QR crypto payments for both taxes and administrative services. The government framed the package as a regulatory tune-up that reduces frictions while aligning taxation with how digital-asset markets actually operate. Mayor Jorge Macri presented the initiative as an institutional modernization designed to attract investment and make compliance easier. “The goal is for the City to be a world leader in crypto,” he said, adding: “We already have the human capital, and now we are building the tools by reducing bureaucracy to make taxpayer compliance easier and to support the arrival of new companies setting up here.” The remarks were delivered at The Slow Kale in Colegiales, a venue that accepts crypto payments. Macri also argued the package signals a friendlier posture toward the sector: “These measures ensure the crypto world sees that the City is increasingly friendly. The digital economy compels us to update and adapt with a modern, agile, efficient and intelligent State. We want talent to find a place to grow, innovate and lead without obstacles.” The backdrop is growing usage. According to city data cited at launch, roughly 10,000 people in Buenos Aires receive income from abroad via crypto or PayPal , and the use of PIX rails has been rising. Nationwide, Argentina counts “more than 10 million” crypto accounts—about 22% of Latin America’s total—figures the city says justify tailored rules and public-service rails that natively accommodate digital assets. For firms, the classification update matters because it gives crypto activities an explicit slot in the tax nomenclator, improving clarity “without fiscal cost” and easing cross-jurisdiction information matching. Excluding PSAVs from bank-collection regimes is intended to curb automatic withholdings that can tie up working capital, while the new spread-based tax base acknowledges the mismatch between high-volume, low-margin trading and a gross-receipts framework. Together, these steps amount to what the city calls a more “agile” and “transparent” environment for digital-asset businesses to operate in the capital. On the consumer side, the payment experience is meant to be straightforward: scan a city QR and pay the selected tax or fee with a compatible wallet. Officials said only some wallets currently support crypto payments, but a Buenos Aires–provided “aggregator” is in the works to let “neighbors and companies” pay “from any wallet, directly, faster, and simpler.” The government did not publish a technical spec or list of supported assets at launch. Hernán Lombardi, the city’s Economic Development Minister, cast the reforms as a recalibration of legal and tax treatment for digital assets. “These reforms mark a change in the legal and tax treatment of digital assets. Less bureaucracy, greater legal certainty, and clear rules will translate into more investment,” he said, noting the updated nomenclator will help “determine and clarify the activities of companies and individual crypto-asset users, and thus avoid withholdings that compromise the sector’s working capital.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.77 trillion.",Crypto News|Argentina|bitcoin|bitcoin news|Buenos Aires|crypto|crypto news|Crypto News Argentina,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 01:00:48

Expert Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-treasury-bubble-popping/,"In a thread on August 19, analyst Miles Deutscher argued that MicroStrategy’s market-implied net asset value (mNAV) premium—the core gear in Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin acquisition flywheel—has compressed sharply, weakening the feedback loop that helped the company outpace Bitcoin through most of the cycle. “Michael Saylor built the craziest BTC flywheel in history. But his buying power is starting to fade. The market is now asking one question: ‘Is the BTC treasury bubble finally popping?’” MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Premium Is Fading Deutscher grounds the discussion in how investors currently value MicroStrategy. “People often overlook that MicroStrategy has a legacy software business, which continues to generate revenue. However, MicroStrategy has essentially become a company whose valuation is primarily influenced by its BTC holdings. The entire system is powered by mNAV (Market-Implied NAV).” In practical terms, the mNAV multiple is the premium investors pay over the company’s look-through Bitcoin value to access leveraged BTC exposure via MSTR. “An mNAV of ~1.58x means the market is paying a 58% premium for their BTC.” According to Deutscher, that premium “was once a 3.4x mNAV” when Bitcoin was surging, but it has “now decreased to 1.58x. Demand is slowing down.” In other words, what had been a powerful flywheel—high premium enabling cheap equity issuance that funded more Bitcoin purchases, which in turn kept NAV rising and the premium elevated—now spins with much less torque. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts The Collapse Of Bitcoin In This Timeframe That shift intersected with a contentious corporate action. “Recently, Saylor sparked controversy by revealing that Strategy had revised its MSTR Equity ATM Guidance to offer greater ‘flexibility’ in executing its capital markets strategy.” The implication, Deutscher argues, is that greater issuance flexibility “may dilute shareholder value and increase financial risk tied to Bitcoin’s volatility.” He notes that “the market is quite divided” on the change. On the constructive side, he quotes @thedefivillain’s take—“Slower concentration of supply in Saylor’s hands,” “Greater leverage to justify mNAV,” and “Reduced buying pressure for BTC in dollar terms”—as reasons the revision could ultimately be benign. But critics worry about “the possibility of a ‘death spiral.’ The removal of the 2.5x mNAV safeguard for equity issuance may allow MicroStrategy to sell shares at lower valuations.” Reflexivity, in Deutscher’s telling, is the operative risk factor: “Reflexivity is a brutal force that operates in both directions.” A Hypothetical Scenario Deutscher then sets up a stress-test to illustrate how that reflexivity could bite if Bitcoin weakens and the premium compresses to parity. “If BTC’s price drops 20% and MicroStrategy’s mNAV multiple falls to 1.0x, the stock might plummet by 46.5%.” He walks through the arithmetic from a notional baseline of $115,000 per BTC, which on a 20% decline would fall to $92,000. On MicroStrategy’s “226,331 BTC,” he calculates that would put look-through NAV at $20.82 billion. To align an mNAV of exactly 1.0x, he backs into enterprise value and market cap under that scenario: “Starting with an enterprise value of $20.82 billion, we subtract MicroStrategy’s $2.2 billion in debt and add its $0.1 billion in cash. This calculation unveils the company’s market cap, hitting $18.72 billion, a significant pullback from its original $35 billion market cap.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Hinges On Trump’s Pick For Fed Chair: Analyst The conclusion he draws from the modeled path—BTC −20% to ~$92,000, mNAV → 1.0x, MSTR market cap −46.5%—is that MicroStrategy’s equity remains a leveraged instrument with an outcome path that can be materially worse than Bitcoin itself when the premium compresses. Beyond the scenario math, Deutscher links recent spot price action to changing marginal demand. “I think BTC’s recent weakness can be attributed to the market starting to price in reduced Saylor demand/tail potential risk of the revised ATM guidance.” In parallel, he highlights how the proliferation of spot ETFs erodes the original rationale for paying a large listed-company premium to own BTC “beta”: “Spot Bitcoin ETFs are plentiful now. Why would you pay a 58% premium for MSTR’s leveraged exposure when you can grab IBIT at a clean ~1.0x NAV?” By his framing, the mNAV premium itself “was indicative of the market’s view that MSTR was going to outperform BTC.” With that view fading, the premium looks less like an enduring structural feature and more like a belief-sensitive variable. “In my opinion, the MSTR premium is essentially a gamble. You’re betting on three fragile things: unwavering market confidence, open capital markets, and Saylor’s leadership. If any of those pillars start to wobble, the premium collapses.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,624.

The idea mirrors Amazon’s early move into cloud computing nearly two decades ago, when it began offering excess capacity to outside businesses. That experiment evolved into Amazon Web Services (AWS), now a multibillion-dollar powerhouse and a cornerstone of the modern internet. For OpenAI, the logic is similar. The company has poured resources into cutting-edge chips, servers, and cooling systems to power its large-scale AI workloads. Allowing others to rent that infrastructure could open the door for startups and smaller firms to access high-performance computing without building it themselves—while creating a lucrative business line for OpenAI. Still, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar emphasized the idea remains speculative. With demand for ChatGPT and other AI products soaring, OpenAI’s immediate priority is securing enough capacity for its needs. In a recent interview, Friar confirmed the company isn’t actively pursuing the plan yet but sees it as a possible opportunity in the future. CFO eyes infrastructure leasing down the road OpenAI has become good at building data centers tailored for artificial intelligence. This know-how could be productized. Friar said that OpenAI is trying to take more control of its infrastructure design instead of relying on external vendors , cautioning that if the company only purchased equipment from others, it would risk giving away its intellectual property. The company has raised tens of billions for ultrapowerful AI chips and facilities. Its Stargate project with SoftBank and Oracle promises to construct some of the largest data centers in the world, in the United States and beyond. Excitement is running high after CEO Sam Altman promised ambitious plans, saying that people should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on infrastructure shortly. He added that the company is working on an interesting new financial instrument to fund these mega-projects, though he did not provide further details. Until now, OpenAI has depended on Microsoft and the technology company Oracle to cover most of its infrastructure costs . But Friar said banks and private equity firms are now piling in, providing debt financing. In addition to debt, the company is considering innovative financing mechanisms. But even with such aspirations, OpenAI still loses money. Data centers and GPUs are very expensive. But growth is rapid. In July, the firm surpassed a $1 billion monthly revenue for the first time — buoyed by surging global demand for ChatGPT and its enterprise tools. Altman frames bold plans, warns of AI hype Despite his push for massive spending, Altman has also acknowledged that AI may be in a bubble. In an interview last week, he compared the current enthusiasm to the dot-com era, noting that smart people often go overboard on a kernel of truth. Still, expansion is moving ahead. The project, Stargate, is a $500 billion joint venture and is already starting with projects in the US, Norway, and the UAE. The aim is to secure AI capacity to a level no company has ever achieved. Altman has suggested we need 100 million AI GPUs to power future models. It could cost $3 trillion. For reference, that’s more than the GDPs of many countries. According to recent accounts, OpenAI is reportedly gearing up for a second stock sale. It would enable current and former employees to cash out their shares at an estimated valuation of around $500 billion. That would be almost double its last disclosed valuation of $300 billion, in a financing round by SoftBank. Investor appetite remains strong. OpenAI secured $41 billion in its latest round, exceeding its initial goal of $40 billion because of strong demand.

Among such a token is Mutuum Finance (MTU), causing massive frenzy among traders and DeFi participants alike. Over 15400 investors have invested in the project presale to date, and over $14.65 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already up to Stage 6 of Presale priced at $0.035. Stage 7 will be a 14.29% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance is arousing anticipations of a potential 50x rally from its $0.035 starting point, thus forming a gem in a market where well-established assets like Cardano may experience short-term consolidation. Cardano Price Outlook Cardano (ADA) currently trades at about $0.92, making slight intraday oscillations around a $0.92–$0.98 range as it consolidates at resistance levels without extreme movements. Market analysts indicate ADA is passing through a symmetrical triangle pattern, constricting between roughly $0.85 and $0.98, and this indicates that a breakout will happen soon—either to the $0.80 support or to a potential push to $1.10–$1.15 resistance, depending on the direction of the market. In this tranquil build-up, interest in Mutuum Finance remains present. Mutuum Finance Presale Proceeds to Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has completed Phase 5 of presale and proceeded to Phase 6, in which its tokens sell at $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has surpassed $14.65 million already and over 15400 holders have participated. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Partners with CertiK to Run $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is partnering with CertiK for its Bug Bounty Program. The reward pool of the program shall be $50,000 USDT. The program shall be rewarded under four categories, i.e. low, minor, major and critical. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) had reached a full audit by Certik for user funds security and blockchain integrity. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a $100,000 giveaway where 10 of its participants will be given $10,000 MUTM tokens worth. It has also made public that a leaderboard system will reward the top 50 token holders of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with a bonus. Mutuum Finance is a P2C and P2P lending protocol in which uses are in control of their funds. It is an end-to-end DeFi experience highly tailored to the customer’s requirements and more transparent, secure, and flexible compared to the centralized lending product. The project is gaining popularity as a DeFi project with the potential of delivering more returns than most of the established older altcoins. As Cardano (ADA) is hovering at $1, technical indicators are anticipating short-term stabilization with a window of opportunity for new DeFi platforms to gain popularity among investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking advantage of this, with Stage 6 presale at $0.035, over 15,400 participants, and raised funds of $14.65 million. Backed by a CertiK-audited bug bounty and a $100,000 community giveaway, along with its Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending dual model, MUTM is positioned for a possible 50x upside, and it’s one of the front-runners in a space where established altcoins such as ADA may lose steam. Early investors should find good returns if the project maintains its current momentum and adoption.

Among the highlights is Magic Cue, an intelligent assistant designed to make everyday tasks more seamless. The feature scans Gmail, Calendar, Messages, and other apps in real time to provide context-aware suggestions—reminders, quick replies, or relevant information. For instance, if you call an airline, Magic Cue can instantly recognize the number and pull up details about your upcoming flight from Gmail or Calendar. When a friend texts about dinner, the tool can check your availability, suggest a reply, and even include reservation information. This level of integration shows how Google is pushing AI beyond convenience, transforming it into a practical assistant capable of handling real-world scenarios . The Pixel 10 debuts Camera Coach for professional-grade photo guidance and real-time Voice Translate, further underscoring Google’s push to lead the smartphone AI race. Pixel 10 series puts privacy first while packing pro-level AI photography Google built Magic Cue to provide maximum privacy . Users’ data will never leave their phones unless they explicitly allow it, because all data remains stored in a secure enclave on their device. Similarly, apps won’t access any information that Magic Cue collects unless users permit them. The phones will also feature another AI tool, Camera Coach, that helps users take professional photos. The tool suggests the best photo angles, lighting conditions, and lens modes to capture high-quality images. Super Res Zoom on the Pro models allows users to zoom in on distant objects. It uses AI to enhance clarity and seamlessly merge multiple images to produce more detailed pictures. Google also made these advanced features accessible to different users by maintaining competitive pricing for the Pixel 10 series. The base model starts at $800, the Pixel 10 Pro at $1,000, the Pixel 10 Pro XL at $1,200, and the foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold at $1,800. The standard Pixel 10 models will be available in stores from August 28, and the foldable version on October 9. Google highlights AI features and improvements at event Google integrated the Gemini AI platform into the Pixel 10 series to allow users to access its interactive and proactive features. Take visual overlays, for example. With it, Gemini can recognize objects through the camera and point out helpful information like street signs while travelling or important details in documents. Another interactive tool, Gemini Live, can detect the tone of a user’s voice in conversation and provide more natural and personal replies. With these abilities, the Pixel 10 phones can provide more human-like interaction between users and their devices. Voice Translat can translate phone calls across multiple languages in real-time while preserving the natural tone of each speaker. Users don’t need third-party translation apps or awkward delays while interpreting conversations. The Pixel 10 series also includes Pixel Journal and other AI-driven productivity tools to help users organize their work, track personal goals, and manage everyday tasks more efficiently. There are more AI-powered tools across apps like Photos, Messages, and Gboard that allow users to edit images with natural language commands, draft messages or emails faster, and receive intelligent suggestions based on context. Google’s advanced features with the Pixel 10 series surpass Apple’s offerings, whose next-generation Siri is not expected until 2026. Analysts say Google’s steady integration of AI could have potential ripple effects on other Android devices like Samsung smartphones. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Litecoin is lining up for a breakout toward $175–$180, backed by strong wallet activity and record futures open interest. Avalanche is flashing bullish signals with a double-bottom and a huge surge in stablecoin and DEX volumes. While these setups look attractive, not every project relies on charts or catalysts. Cold Wallet is shaping its own future with a mobile-first, self-custody app that pays users for activity. With $6.3 million raised and more than 740 million tokens sold at $0.00998, Cold Wallet’s design offers everyday value in a way technical rallies alone cannot. Litecoin (LTC) Price Target: Signs of Breakout Strength Litecoin (LTC) is drawing attention as its technical and on-chain signals align. Futures open interest recently hit $1.26 billion, while active wallets have risen 12% month-on-month. Over 60% of LTC supply remains with long-term holders, a bullish sign of confidence. The network has also processed more than 250 million transactions, showing continued usage. On charts, LTC is holding just under $137–$138 resistance. Analysts believe a clean break could lift prices toward $150 soon and extend to $175–$180 by the end of August. Weekly indicators like the Supertrend have flipped bullish, and RSI readings are climbing toward overbought, hinting at an explosive move if volume supports. With broader crypto strength, LTC could even test $200 later this year. Avalanche Price Forecast: Ecosystem Growth Adds Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is building momentum after forming a bullish double-bottom near $15.60 and pushing above its 50-day EMA. The neckline sits at $27.40, and a breakout could send AVAX toward $40, a potential 65% move higher. Supporting this are real growth metrics: stablecoin volumes on Avalanche have surged 715% in just a month, while DEX activity and total value locked are also climbing. Dinari Global’s launch of tokenised U.S. stocks on Avalanche further boosts utility, adding real-world use cases. With both technical and ecosystem expansion driving it, AVAX is shaping up as one of the top crypto picks for 2025. Cold Wallet: Utility, Self-Custody, and Real Rewards Unlike coins that depend on hype or chart breakouts, Cold Wallet is building long-term value through usability. It is a self-custody, mobile-first wallet that removes onboarding hurdles, no external wallets or lengthy KYC needed. You control your keys, and the app is designed for everyday use. What sets it apart is its rewards system. Every action inside the app, swaps, bridging, paying gas fees, earns cashback in native CWT. This design flips costs into earnings, meaning the more you use it, the more you gain. The referral program adds another layer, rewarding both the inviter and the new user with cashback, creating compounding growth across the network. Currently in Stage 17 at $0.00998, Cold Wallet has raised $6.3 million and sold over 740 million tokens. Unlike speculative assets that need whales or news events to rally, Cold Wallet’s value expands through user activity. Adoption builds naturally, making it less dependent on outside sentiment. This blend of self-custody, access, and reward gives Cold Wallet a lasting edge. For those asking about the best crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet isn’t just another name on a chart. It’s a system that grows stronger with every user, aligning ownership with utility and financial benefit. The Final Verdict Litecoin is eyeing a breakout toward $175–$180, supported by strong fundamentals and rising activity. Avalanche shows promise with its double-bottom and real ecosystem expansion. Both coins are attractive plays in 2025. But Cold Wallet offers something different: a user-driven system where self-custody meets rewards. With $6.3 million raised and over 740 million tokens sold, its model creates lasting value by rewarding everyday usage. For those weighing options, Cold Wallet may be the best crypto to buy now, driven not by speculation, but by a design that pays back its community.

Why BlockDAG, Stellar, Ondo & Hyperliquid Are 2025’s Big Shots!",https://thecoinrise.com/looking-for-the-next-altcoins-to-explode-why-blockdag-stellar-ondo-hyperliquid-are-2025s-big-shots/,"The crypto market is gearing up for what could be its strongest cycle yet, and attention is shifting to the next altcoin to explode before valuations take off. This time it’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum, newer, utility-driven projects with strong adoption are lining up for center stage. Getting in early could mean the difference between modest profits and life-changing returns. Four names are standing out right now: BlockDAG, the presale powerhouse with staggering ROI potential; Stellar (XLM), showing strong technical setups; Ondo Finance (ONDO), leading the way in tokenized assets; and Hyperliquid (HYPE), setting trading volume records in DeFi. Together, these projects highlight innovation, adoption-ready ecosystems, and momentum that could dominate 2025 headlines. For those scanning the horizon for the next altcoin to explode, these four deserve top priority. 1. BlockDAG: 25 Billion Coins Sold Before Launch! BlockDAG’s presale is moving fast, with each batch bringing higher prices and stronger demand. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG coins are available for $0.0276, with analysts calling for a $1 launch value, an eye-catching 36x upside. Buyers from Batch 1 have already locked in gains of 2,660% compared to today’s rate, and momentum is far from slowing down. The numbers are impressive, $378 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a rapidly expanding base of holders. BlockDAG ’s appeal isn’t just its presale, though. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design allows lightning-fast, secure, and scalable transactions while staying decentralized. Adoption is already underway with 19,000 ASIC miners sold and more than 2.5 million active users on the X1 mobile miner app. Developers are busy ahead of mainnet, ensuring utility from day one. Once Batch 29 sells out, the entry point jumps instantly, making hesitation costly. History shows the next altcoin to explode usually rewards early movers, and BlockDAG looks primed to be one of 2025’s breakout names. 2. Stellar: Eyes on $0.50 Breakout Level Stellar is showing real momentum after climbing 12.4% this week, holding between $0.43–$0.45. All eyes are on the $0.50 resistance, where an inverse head-and-shoulders and bullish engulfing candle pattern signal a potential breakout. Analysts predict that a push past $0.50 could trigger a rally of 43%, targeting $0.60–$0.77. On-chain signals confirm the trend, with Stellar’s TVL surging nearly 80% to $152 million, highlighting growing adoption in cross-border transactions. Still, maintaining volume and support above $0.50 is key for sustained momentum. With solid fundamentals backing its technical strength, Stellar stands out as the next altcoin to explode for traders looking for short-term upside. 3. Ondo Finance: $309M Daily Volume Boosts Liquidity Ondo Finance is steadily building its position as a leader in the tokenized asset sector. Priced around $1.02, ONDO is trading with $309 million in daily volume, a 26% jump in just one day. The team is scaling aggressively with its $250M Ondo Catalyst initiative, targeted acquisitions, and new alliances that expand the Global Markets Alliance to 25 members. These moves strengthen its Real-World Asset (RWA) ecosystem, giving it a foothold in what many expect to be a trillion-dollar market. While its weekly chart looks steady, ONDO’s long-term setup is what’s driving confidence. For those chasing future growth in finance, Ondo is among the clearest picks for the next altcoin to explode. 4. Hyperliquid: RSI and MACD Signal Breakout Hyperliquid is shaking up DeFi like few others. On August 15, it smashed records with $29 billion in daily trading volume and $7.7M in fees generated. HYPE has gained 19% this week, trading at $48.57, just 1.1% under its all-time high. Indicators like an RSI of 63 and a strong MACD are pointing toward a move to $55. Meanwhile, institutional involvement is scaling fast. TVL now sits at $610M, with inflows jumping from $21M in June to $349M in July, showing accelerating adoption. With record-setting trading and liquidity, Hyperliquid has carved out its place as the next altcoin to explode, riding the wave of DeFi scalability. Final Thoughts In a fast-changing market, catching the next altcoin to explode before mainstream attention hits can mean the biggest rewards. BlockDAG is leading the way with unmatched presale traction and scalable design. Stellar is closing in on a breakout with strong technical and adoption growth. Ondo Finance is securing its role in the tokenization boom, and Hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of DeFi growth. All four combine innovation, adoption, and strong momentum, key ingredients for high-performing digital assets in 2025. While risks always exist, aligning early with these projects could be transformative as the next bull run gathers steam. The post Looking For The Next Altcoins to Explode?

Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ The total ranks among the largest weekly inflows seen recently, CoinShares data shows. Prices rose, but the main driver was money moving into funds rather than a broad retail rush. Concentrated Flows From A Single Product Based on reports from CoinShares, almost all of the inflows came through one provider. The US accounted for $3.73 billion, almost the entire week’s total. Canada added $33.7 million, Hong Kong close to $21 million, and Australia $12 million. By contrast, Brazil and Sweden recorded outflows of $10.6 million and $50 million. Market participants say the bulk of the cash was funneled into a single iShares product, which helps explain how a relatively narrow set of flows moved overall AUM so sharply. Ethereum Draws The Most Money Ethereum attracted the lion’s share of last week’s inflows at $2.87 billion, or 77% of the total. That brings year-to-date net inflows into ETH to about $11 billion. Ethereum now makes up nearly 30% of assets under management, versus Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Bitcoin’s weekly intake was $552 million. Other moves included Solana taking $176.5 million and XRP adding $126 million, while Litecoin and Ton showed small outflows of $0.4 million and $1 million, respectively. These numbers point to a clear shift in where institutional money is parked this week. Corporate Holdings And Supply Notes Reports have disclosed that more than 16 companies have added Ethereum to their balance sheets, according to CryptoQuant. Together they hold about 2.45 million ETH, valued at roughly $11 billion, and those coins are effectively out of circulation while locked in treasuries or cold storage. It’s worth noting that Ethereum does not have a fixed supply like Bitcoin; about one million ETH was added to supply last year, and supply dynamics can vary with network activity. Watch Futures And Large Holders Futures open interest sits near $38 billion, a sizeable figure that raises the chance of swift price moves when positions are closed. Related Reading: Cardano Climbs To 8th, Pushing Dogecoin And TRON Down The Ranks Large, concentrated holders and sudden shifts in futures positions have shown they can push prices sharply in either direction. For now, this is a flow-driven event more than a broad retail surge. If the same product keeps taking in large sums, it will keep adding upward pressure. At the same time, thin liquidity and big positions can flip gains into losses fast. Investors and traders should keep an eye on weekly fund flows, futures open interest, and on-chain movements to see whether the trend spreads beyond a few big buyers.

The purchases, made through the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), highlight Ark’s conviction in digital asset infrastructure even as broader crypto stocks tumbled. According to Ark’s latest filing, the fund acquired 356,346 shares of Bullish and 150,908 shares of Robinhood. This marks the third consecutive trading day Ark boosted its Robinhood position, following earlier buys of $14 million on Monday and $9 million last Friday. The moves expand Ark’s exposure to platforms shaping the future of trading and digital finance. Bullish and Robinhood Slide Amid Market Sell-Off Despite Ark’s heavy buying, both stocks ended sharply lower on the day. Bullish dropped 6.09% to $59.51, slipping an additional 3.24% in after-hours trading, while Robinhood fell 6.54% to $107.50 and lost another 1.23% post-market. The sell-off wasn’t isolated. Other crypto-linked equities also suffered, with Coinbase down 5.82%, Galaxy Digital plunging 10.06%, Strategy sliding 7.43%, and Circle off 4.49%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.46% as investors pulled back ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where policy signals are expected to shape market sentiment. A Strategic Bet on Crypto’s Long-Term Growth Ark’s latest move builds on a $172 million allocation to Bullish last week, when the Cayman Islands-based exchange made its highly anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange. With Ark now holding more than 1.1 million Bullish shares valued at roughly $73.85 million, the firm is betting big on the platform’s role in the evolution of crypto markets. Similarly, Robinhood has become one of Ark’s most consistent crypto-adjacent holdings. The recent spree increases its share of ARKK’s portfolio to over 4%, highlighting Ark’s belief in the platform’s long-term potential despite short-term volatility. Wood’s investment strategy mirrors confidence in crypto’s ongoing institutional adoption, as firms like Gemini, OKX, and Kraken explore IPOs. Ark also maintains significant positions in Circle and Coinbase, further engraving its role as one of Wall Street’s most vocal champions of digital assets. As volatility shakes out weaker hands, Ark’s contrarian bets may position it to capitalize if crypto markets rebound, raising the question: is this a bold gamble, or a long game in the market?

The PAC, named the Digital Freedom Fund, openly aligns with Republicans. Its mission is to defeat Democrats and bolster Republican efforts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The Winklevoss twins contributed 188.45 BTC, roughly $21.5 million, to launch the fund. Tyler Winklevoss said the donation will support candidates who champion “President Trump’s crypto agenda” in primaries and midterm races. The brothers warned that a Democratic takeover of the House or Senate could threaten Trump’s initiatives. Tyler suggested that Democrats, based on past actions, might resort to tactics he described as “bad-faith,” including impeachments and lawsuits. Their policy priorities focus on advocating for a light-touch, regulation-lite “skinny” crypto bill, blocking the creation of a US central bank digital currency, and ensuring protections for developers to build open-source tools without liability risks safely. The Winklevosses also emphasized the need for a “Bitcoin and Crypto Bill of Rights” to safeguard fundamental principles such as self-custody, peer-to-peer transfers, and clear ownership rights. For them, these measures are more than policy—they represent the foundation of what they call an “American Golden Age.” Winklevoss twins break from bipartisan crypto lobbying The decision sets them apart from much of the crypto industry. Others, like Fairshake, which raised over $300 million in 2024, have tried to remain bipartisan, backing Republicans and pro-crypto Democrats. The Winklevoss twins, however, have taken a different route. They have explicitly tied their new PAC to Trump’s reelection campaign and Republican victories, convinced that a GOP-led Congress is the only path to achieving their goals. Their hardline approach signals a shift in crypto politics. While many executives still frame their lobbying as “agnostic,” the influence of major players increasingly mirrors the tightening grip of Trump-era politics, as he nears the close of his second—and possibly final—term. Even figures like Mr. Fox, once a critic of Bitcoin, now embrace it as part of his economic vision. Cameron and Tyler were among the first industry leaders to throw their support behind Trump for 2024, months before others followed. That early loyalty is now being rewarded with political clout and financial backing. Winklevoss brothers turn Bitcoin into political muscle The $21 million Bitcoin gift is among the biggest individual crypto contributions in the history of digital-currency contributions to political causes. It reflects how much the industry is now invested in shaping Washington’s course. Leaders in crypto had long been people who operate at the fringes of politics, quietly lobbying and donating when the time called for it. The move amounts to a new level of ambition and an acknowledgment that digital wealth can be used as political capital. At the same time, the plan comes with major risks. By so blatantly allying themselves with Republicans and President Trump, the Winklevoss brothers are helping to make cryptocurrency a partisan issue. That is a dangerous path for many in the industry. But, though the Republicans have adopted a pro-Bitcoin stance, some democrats are friendly to innovation and blockchain-based initiatives. Alienating them might box in the industry if political power changes. The Digital Freedom Fund is poised to receive its first real exam in the 2026 midterms. If it can help the party win Republican victories, it could help build momentum for moves to loosen regulations, ban a U.S. international digital currency, and protect developers and investors. If it fails, it may reveal deep divisions among the crypto community, diminishing the industry’s power in Washington.

For years, it traded for virtually nothing—fractions of a cent—before the market suddenly turned its attention to the coin. The real turning point came in early 2021, when Dogecoin surged from around $0.02 to nearly $0.74 in just a few months. That explosive rally delivered over 3,600% gains , fueled by retail enthusiasm, community power, and mainstream cultural momentum. What DOGE taught us: Timing and narrative drive exponential gains Dogecoin’s breakout proved that timing is everything in crypto. Infrastructure mattered less than narrative, and those who entered early saw their positions multiply dramatically. DOGE’s rise underscored how branding, community, and sentiment can ignite growth faster than traditional fundamentals. It set the stage for meme-driven assets to dominate headlines and capture capital flows during peak speculative cycles. Who is poised for the next narrative surge As Ethereum and Bitcoin consolidate at higher ranges, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a new contender with parallels to DOGE’s early trajectory. Currently in presale, the project is building momentum before broader awareness and tier-1 exchange listings arrive. What makes it distinct is its politically infused branding , giving it cultural weight beyond the crypto world. Each presale round has sold out quickly, showing strong demand from investors who see this as a second chance at catching an early-stage moonshot. Breaking through DOGE’s ceiling Some investors are going even further, openly betting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could surpass Dogecoin’s historic records. Their argument rests on scale and timing: DOGE exploded during a period when meme coins were new, but MAGACOIN enters a market already conditioned to chase culturally branded assets. If DOGE could reach a market cap in the tens of billions without a clear utility, many argue a politically infused token with global recognition has the potential to push even higher . The presale’s rapid pace has only reinforced this view, with traders framing MAGACOIN FINANCE as not just the next DOGE – but the project that might finally outdo it. Market rotation: Where capital flows next Crypto cycles often follow a familiar pattern: Bitcoin rallies, Ethereum stabilizes, and liquidity seeks out new stories with high-upside potential. This rotation is where meme-driven and culturally branded projects thrive. With the market primed for a new speculative wave, capital is already starting to circle around tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that combine hype with strong community traction. Conclusion: A new altcoin chapter inspired by DOGE’s legacy Dogecoin’s rise from near-worthless meme to household name showed the power of timing and culture in crypto markets. Today, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself with similar ingredients – strong branding, community backing, and explosive presale momentum .

50418169,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79447,1755743621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Record Performance Overshadows Ethereum After Recent Price Crash,https://timestabloid.com/magacoin-finances-record-performance-overshadows-ethereum/,"Ethereum’s sharp pullback last week has reignited debate about whether the second-largest cryptocurrency has already reached the limits of its near-term growth. After climbing toward the mid-$4,700 range earlier in August, ETH tumbled back below $4,300 in a matter of hours, erasing billions in market value. This rapid downturn came despite steady ETF inflows and long-term forecasts placing Ethereum between $6,000 and $8,000 over the next cycle. While committed holders point to resilience, shorter-term traders are questioning whether the same outsized gains that once defined ETH’s rallies are still achievable in such a mature market. This uncertainty is pushing capital further down the risk curve, toward early-stage projects where exponential upside remains possible. Analysts note that the familiar rotation cycle appears to be repeating: Bitcoin rallies first, Ethereum follows with strong but measured gains, and then liquidity begins flowing into smaller-cap tokens with higher risk but greater potential rewards. With Ethereum now facing heavy resistance near its recent highs, attention is shifting to projects that can capture the narrative of the next wave. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most discussed names. Still in presale, the project is benefiting from its timing – offering investors an entry point before listings – and from its unique positioning at the crossroads of crypto and politics. Analysts argue that politically-branded tokens carry additional momentum in an election cycle, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has leveraged that backdrop to build rapid community traction. Unlike Ethereum, which is battling overhead resistance, this project is being positioned by early supporters as a ground-floor opportunity with far greater headroom for growth. Ethereum’s limitations become clear Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts, but size is becoming a double-edged sword. Pushing ETH from its current levels to $6,000 represents a return of under 50%, far below the outsized gains traders saw in earlier cycles. Even with network upgrades and institutional adoption, Ethereum’s trajectory reflects a maturing asset, strong, but no longer explosive. This is why investors often begin to rotate into alternative tokens once Ethereum stalls. Smaller projects provide the volatility and growth potential that established coins can’t replicate, particularly as presales and early listings draw huge capital. Amid this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a unique position by combining presale momentum with political branding that resonates far beyond traditional crypto audiences. Unlike many presales that fade after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly developed an active and expanding community, with each round selling out faster than the last. Its roadmap emphasizes features designed to reward holders long-term, creating a stronger foundation than typical launches. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s narrative is aligning perfectly with the broader market cycle. As traders look for the next 10,000% play while mainstream attention grows, projects with clear branding, rapid adoption, and utility-based mechanics stand out. In this environment, MAGACOIN is increasingly seen as a potential outperformer – mirroring the early excitement of breakout tokens in previous cycles but with added cultural relevance that gives it wider reach. Market outlook favors rotation If Ethereum continues to consolidate, capital is likely to keep moving into smaller-cap projects with aggressive growth potential. The same pattern played out in 2017 and 2021, when altcoins delivered historic runs after the majors slowed. With MAGACOIN FINANCE building both hype and community infrastructure, it could be one of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation. Institutional money may keep flowing into Ethereum, but retail investors searching for transformative gains are now scanning for the next breakout. That divergence of strategies is what often fuels dramatic surges in promising altcoins. Conclusion: The early-stage edge Ethereum will likely remain a pillar of the crypto ecosystem, but its growth ceiling is becoming clearer. For investors seeking exponential upside, the conversation has shifted toward newer names with political resonance and strong community energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies those qualities, and its rapid momentum suggests it could deliver the kind of breakout that defined past market cycles. With analysts eyeing a potential 10,000% upside before late-stage euphoria sets in, the project is capturing attention as a serious alternative to large-cap consolidation plays.

Our goal is to support President Trump and his Administration’s efforts to continue to usher in America’s Golden Age.” Winklevoss Twins Back Republican Causes The Winklevosses have been long-time vocal members of the Republican Party, backing U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The duo donated $5 million to crypto-focused super PAC Fairshake and $2 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign. Most recently, Politico reported that the twins pressed Trump to reject Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman nominee Brian Quintenz despite Tyler praising his nomination earlier this year. “Congratulations Brian,” Tyler said in a February X post. “Well deserved. Great choice for crypto and for America.” The Winklevoss brothers’ $21 million Bitcoin donation marks their latest effort to influence U.S. crypto policy, reinforcing their support for Trump’s agenda and signaling continued engagement in shaping the political landscape around digital assets.

50419091,561500,1755745243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50419091.jpeg,Will Bitcoin Beat Every Asset Class? Bitwise Says Institutions Are Taking Notice,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-beat-every-asset-class-bitwise-institutions/,"Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios is continuing to evolve, with new research from Bitwise Asset Management suggesting the asset could become the strongest-performing major investment class in the years ahead. According to a preview of the firm’s forthcoming Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), Bitwise expects Bitcoin to deliver an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% over the next 10 years while experiencing gradually declining volatility . The report, authored by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, frames Bitcoin not as an opportunistic play but as a maturing asset that is increasingly being considered a core portfolio component. Hougan noted that the launch and adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked a turning point, prompting large investment platforms and allocators to begin requesting long-term models for Bitcoin alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Hougan explained that long-term capital market assumptions serve as the foundation for how major financial institutions design portfolios. Each year, firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock release detailed outlooks that guide asset allocation strategies . For the first time in 2025, professional investors have begun requesting that Bitcoin be included in these frameworks, with Bitwise reporting 12 such inquiries this year compared to none in previous years. “The fact that they’re now asking for long-term capital market assumptions means that they’ve shifted their view: It’s no longer a one-off for the fringes of the portfolio; it’s starting to be considered for the core,” Hougan said in the memo. He attributed this change to greater accessibility through regulated ETFs and approval by large account platforms managing trillions in client assets. Bitwise also emphasized that Bitcoin’s path toward institutional recognition has been gradual, requiring both regulatory clarity and infrastructure improvements . The launch of spot ETFs in January 2024 created a new on-ramp for traditional allocators, and subsequent approvals across national platforms have since accelerated the process. Hougan described the transition as occurring “brick by brick,” as Bitcoin gains a foothold in professional investment strategies. Outlook for the Next Decade Looking ahead, Bitwise forecasts that BTC will not only outperform but stand apart from traditional assets in terms of expected returns. The firm projects a 28.3% CAGR over the next decade, significantly higher than the long-term expectations placed on equities, bonds, and private credit by leading Wall Street institutions. At the same time, while volatility is expected to remain elevated relative to other asset classes, Bitwise anticipates a steady decline as market depth expands and liquidity continues to improve. The implications of such a forecast extend beyond performance projections. A consistent inclusion of BTC in LTCMAs could formalize its role in balanced portfolios, shaping how pensions, endowments, and wealth managers approach diversification. Hougan cautioned that while risks remain, the framework is designed to give professional allocators a basis for strategic decision-making rather than a speculative outlook.

The asset continues to hold above $0.35, reflecting steadiness when compared to other major altcoins. On a longer time frame, TRON remains in an upward trend, posting a 4.7% gain in the last two weeks. This performance stands out against a backdrop of volatility across the broader cryptocurrency market. Analysts suggest that part of this resilience may be tied to TRX’s relative strength against Bitcoin (BTC). Market data indicates that while most leading altcoins have shown weakness in their BTC pairs, TRON has demonstrated consistent momentum. This divergence has drawn closer attention from traders and investors seeking assets that maintain performance during corrective phases in the crypto sector. Related Reading: TRON’s Futures Map Says “Not Overheated” — Could Another Rally Be Coming? TRX Outperforms Altcoins in BTC Pairs According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk, TRON has outpaced other major altcoins in weekly BTC pair performance. The TRX/BTC ratio recorded a 2.66% increase, while ETH/BTC remained nearly flat at 0.02%, XRP/BTC dropped by 2.28%, and SOL/BTC rose by just 0.85%. This distinction suggests stronger market demand for TRX compared to its peers. The analyst explained that TRON’s sustained performance in its BTC pair highlights growing investor interest and resilience at a time when other altcoins continue to struggle. “While most altcoins continue to face uncertainty in their BTC pairs, TRON stands out with consistent positive momentum, suggesting stronger demand and resilience,” Crazzyblockk noted. He further added that monitoring TRX’s strength against Bitcoin could provide signals of broader capital rotation toward TRON, especially if the trend continues over the coming weeks. TRON Network Expands as USDT Adoption Surges Beyond price performance, the TRON network has seen notable growth in its role as a leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Arab Chain, highlighted that TRON has consolidated its position as the primary network for USDT transactions. From January to August 2025, the number of cumulative addresses receiving USDT on TRON surged from about 5 million to over 35 million. This expansion shows TRON’s increasing use case for remittances and digital payments, supported by its low-cost and high-speed infrastructure. While the number of addresses may not precisely reflect individual user counts, the steady increase points toward broad adoption across exchanges, wallets, and decentralized applications. Arab Chain observed that the consistent rise indicates genuine demand and organic network growth, with new participants entering the ecosystem rather than merely reusing existing accounts. The trend also points to a maturing ecosystem for TRX as a central hub for stablecoin flows. The analyst notes that the platform’s ability to capture a large share of the stablecoin market reinforces its strategic role in the wider cryptocurrency sector. If this momentum continues, TRX could further establish itself as a foundational layer in the digital asset economy, particularly in the context of global stablecoin adoption.
