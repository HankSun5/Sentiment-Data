The world’s largest cryptocurrency holds a market cap of $2.27 trillion, with 19.9 million BTC in circulation out of a capped supply of 21 million. Despite the recent rebound, the charts show BTC struggling to hold above its short-term support zones. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Key Levels Ahead On the technical front, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC has slipped beneath its 50-day moving average ($116,033), which has flipped into resistance. The rejection near $124,450 carved a bearish engulfing candle, signaling momentum loss after July’s rally. Traders are now watching the neckline of a potential head-and-shoulders pattern around $112,000. A breakdown below this level could accelerate declines toward $108,000 and possibly $105,150, as shown in TradingView’s projected path. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum signals back this caution. The MACD has crossed into negative territory, while the RSI at 44 leaves room for further downside. Consecutive bearish candlesticks resemble the start of a three black crows pattern, often linked with deeper pullbacks. Yet, the longer-term structure is less bleak. Since June, Bitcoin has defended a series of higher lows, with small-bodied dojis near $113K showing indecision rather than panic selling. Should buyers retake $116,150, the path opens toward $120,900, then $124,450, with a breakout potentially extending to $127,540 and the long-anticipated $130K level. Fundamental Outlook: Armstrong’s $1M Call While the charts point to short-term caution, fundamentals remain highly supportive. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on August 20 that he expects Bitcoin to reach $1 million per coin by 2030. Armstrong described this as the “rough idea” in his head, highlighting adoption, innovation, and technological improvements as drivers of exponential growth. JUST IN: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicts Bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 by 2030. pic.twitter.com/rT95DfJbTG — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 20, 2025 No model, but the bigger picture is accumulation, supply is shrinking, and use cases are expanding. So long term investors can be confident even if short term traders are navigating volatility. Outlook for Traders and Investors For traders the playbook is clear: close above $116K and long to $124K-$130K, close below $112K and short to $108K. For investors this is an accumulation zone in a bigger bull run. In the bigger picture Armstrong’s $1M call shows how market leaders see Bitcoin not as a speculative asset but as a long term foundation of digital finance. Whether BTC retests $108K or goes to $130K in the short term the road ahead is higher over the next few years. New Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $10.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012755—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

50410625,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788645,1755730770,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50410625.jpeg,Coinbase bets everything on stablecoins becoming the backbone of AI-driven payments,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-bets-everything-on-stablecoins/,"Coinbase has decided that stablecoins are now the center of everything. The company is banking on these digital dollars to become the financial engine behind AI-powered apps, bots, and machines. And it’s already started pushing that future. According to Bloomberg, the company hosted a hackathon in Brooklyn during a boiling-hot August weekend where around 100 developers from places like Malaysia and Italy coded tools that let software send and receive payments using stablecoins. Developers built prototypes like a publishing platform that pays writers instantly, a chatbot that charges a few cents per answer, and a group-chat marketplace where users can buy and sell with each other, without ever touching traditional finance. The event was all about building financial infrastructure for AI systems that will need to handle payments on their own; buying services, paying cloud fees, and making micro transactions automatically, around the clock. Coinbase pushes x402 as AI’s payment backbone Coinbase is trying to lead this charge with x402, an open-source protocol it named after a long-unused internet error code: “402 Payment Required.” It’s built for bots, apps, or any connected software to charge and settle instantly using stablecoins over the internet. Whether it’s a couple of pennies for an AI tool or a few dollars for digital content, the goal is real-time payment without needing PayPal, Visa, or a bank wire. Nemil Dalal, who runs the Coinbase Developer Platform, said this strategy goes straight back to what Brian Armstrong wrote in his “Secret Master Plan” almost a decade ago, a plan that started with speculation, moved to infrastructure, and ends with a fully open, global financial system. “Like literally, that’s exactly what we’re doing,” said Nemil. “Now we’re in the app era. People are creating tons of different apps. And then we’re going to see a large amount of things come up from that.” During the Brooklyn hackathon, developers were encouraged to use x402 in their projects. Ben Reilly’s team added it to a chatbot that could collect payments directly from users. “The killer app for crypto, that’s very obvious, is stablecoin payments,” said Ben. His teammate, Alvaro Echevarria Cuesta, said the reason was simple: “Building your whole financial system on top of stablecoins gives you a lot more freedom than being bound by Stripe, PayPal, and all the restrictions they put in there.” Coinbase is making a hard push to become the go-to toolkit for developers, the same way Amazon Web Services became the silent backbone of the internet. Their pitch is simple: forget casino coins, and start wiring software to make payments using tools that actually work at scale. Congress clears the way as competitors close in Coinbase isn’t alone, and the race is getting tight. Stripe acquired a company called Bridge that builds stablecoin infrastructure and is now working on its own blockchain. PayPal has already launched its own stablecoin, leaning on its huge user base to drive usage. Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard are still sitting on decades of built-in merchant systems, regulatory capital, and global reach. What’s pushing Coinbase to act fast is Washington. Congress passed the first US law regulating stablecoins this summer. It forces issuers to hold reserves and gives developers a clear legal pathway to build on top of them. That legal clarity is already pulling more builders into the space. Vishal Gupta, a former Coinbase and Circle executive who judged the hackathon, said it flatly: “Anytime you have clarity, it enables the next wave.” Now Vishal is running a firm called True Markets that’s also backing stablecoin payment systems. His view? Crypto isn’t just trading anymore. It’s becoming something people can use. “We can actually use some of these native crypto rails in real consumer products and real B2B products,” he said. Coinbase still makes most of its money from trading, which is volatile and competitive. The company also shares stablecoin revenue with Circle, which went public earlier this summer. But none of this is guaranteed. Most people still rely on existing payment rails. AI is still unpredictable. Consumer habits change slowly. And the old financial systems have deep roots. Still, for that weekend in Brooklyn, the builders dreamt. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Some are thriving on community power, others on ecosystem growth, and a few on presale traction. Among the best cryptocurrencies to buy today, four projects lead the list: Cold Wallet (CWT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Cold Wallet is advancing with a live app and cashback utility, while DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE stay popular for their strong communities and active trading. Together, they offer a mix of early-entry potential, meme-driven hype, and real-world use cases worth following this month. 1. Cold Wallet: Presale Growth, Cashback Rewards, & Big ROI Potential Cold Wallet is proving why many see it as the best crypto to buy today. Now in Stage 17 of its presale, CWT is priced at $0.00998. So far, it has raised $6.3 million and sold more than 740 million tokens, showing strong traction. With a fixed launch price of $0.3517, current buyers could see up to 37× returns, or about 3,600%, if the target is hit. Early buyers at $0.007 during Stage 1 could potentially make up to 50×. Cold Wallet is also listed on CoinMarketCap, giving users live updates on progress, sales, and funds raised. What sets Cold Wallet apart is that it’s not waiting until launch to prove itself. The wallet app is already live on both Android and iOS. Users get cashback in CWT for gas fees, swaps, bridges, and on/off-ramps, with no staking or lockups required. This means that everyday activity turns into earnings instead of costs. Security audits are being carried out by Hacken, with CertiK reviewing the platform as well. Adoption was boosted further when Cold Wallet acquired Plus Wallet for $270 million, instantly adding more than 2 million active users. On top of that, a referral program gives users immediate USDT payouts and future CWT rewards, adding both short-term incentives and long-term value. This mix of live product, growing user base, referral mechanics, and strong presale momentum makes Cold Wallet a rare presale project delivering actual utility today. With early entry pricing and clear adoption strategies, it stands out as the best crypto to buy today for those looking at both ROI potential and a product that already works. 2. Dogecoin: Meme Power With Staying Strength Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the top meme coin by recognition. Trading around $0.199 with a $28.6 billion market cap and daily volumes of $1.2 billion, DOGE has gained 3% in the past 24 hours. It’s not just hype; it’s widely used for tipping, online payments, and merchandise. With recent updates aimed at lowering transaction fees and boosting efficiency, DOGE stays relevant. Backed by deep liquidity and loyal fans, it remains one of the best cryptos to buy today for traders seeking volatility and meme-driven momentum. 3. Shiba Inu: Expanding Beyond Meme Status Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at about $0.00002185, with a $12.9 billion market cap and daily trading volume near $6.34 million. It’s up 4% in the past day, supported by heavy activity and ecosystem progress. The launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution for faster and cheaper transactions, is key to SHIB’s growth. Combined with its token burn strategy, which steadily reduces supply, SHIB is moving beyond simple speculation. For those chasing community-backed projects with evolving use cases, SHIB remains one of the best cryptos to buy today. 4. Pepe: Meme Liquidity and Market Buzz Pepe (PEPE) trades near $0.000012 with a $5.1 billion market cap and $1.5 billion in daily trading volume. It has posted gains of 5–8% in the last day, proving meme demand is still alive. Analysts are split: some expect a dip, while others think a sharp rally could follow if sentiment spikes mid-month. High liquidity, rapid moves, and community hype keep PEPE firmly in play as one of the best cryptos to buy today for short-term traders chasing volatility. Final Thoughts Cold Wallet, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe each bring something different to the table this August. Cold Wallet blends presale ROI potential with a live product and a large user base. DOGE continues to thrive on brand strength, SHIB grows through Layer-2 and token burns, and PEPE keeps attention with sharp price action. For traders and holders alike, these picks are among the best crypto presale to buy , balancing meme energy with real adoption and presale opportunity.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has suffered a sell-off in the past six days, with its price falling to as low as $4,074 in the last 24 hours. The decline is occurring alongside institutional investors beginning to pull money from Spot Ethereum ETFs at a record pace, a trend that casts doubt on the sustainability of Ethereum’s price surge above $4,800 and into new all-time highs. $422.3 Million Pulled In A Single Day According to data from SosoValue, Tuesday, August 19, was one of the worst days on record for Spot Ethereum ETFs based in the US. Notably, about $422.30 million was withdrawn in a single session, making it the second-largest daily outflow since these funds were created. The only bigger exodus was on August 4, when outflows came to $465 million. Among the issuers, Grayscale and Fidelity led the exodus with outflows of $122 million and $156.32 million, respectively. BlackRock’s flagship, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), saw its holdings slip from 3.6 million ETH (around $15.8 billion) to about $14.7 billion on Tuesday. The timing of this wave of withdrawals in the past 24 hours could not be more damaging, as Ethereum was already sliding from its recent peak. The outflow immediately amplified downward pressure on the market, which caused Ethereum to crash below $4,100. Tuesday’s outflow numbers were not an isolated incident but the culmination of an outflow trend that has now stretched across three consecutive trading sessions. On Monday, Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded outflows of $196.62 million, which itself was one of the highest single-day exits since launch. This came immediately after Friday’s $59 million outflow, which ended the prior streak of record inflows. In just four days, these withdrawals have drained more than $677 million from Spot Ethereum ETFs. Record Inflows To Quick Reversal In the eight trading sessions leading up to last Friday, Spot Ethereum ETFs had attracted an unprecedented $3.7 billion in inflows, with August 11 even surpassing $1 billion in net inflow. That surge in demand was an important factor behind Ethereum’s rally to its $4,776 multi-year high, and this brought along with it predictions that the $4,800 level could soon be breached. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,167, having bounced up at $4,070 and trending a bit upward. In terms of percentage points, the leading cryptocurrency is down by 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 10% in the past seven days. The leading altcoin is now witnessing a domination of sellers, with on-chain data showing that hedge funds have almost doubled their short positions in the past seven days. The wave of outflows from Spot Ethereum ETFs carries significant implications for Ethereum’s near-term price outlook. If the exodus continues, Ethereum could struggle to maintain its footing above the $4,000 support level and enter into a deeper retracement toward the mid-$3,000 range.",Ethereum|Active Realized Price|BlackRock|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ETHA|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Fidelity|Grayscale|iShares Ethereum Trust|Sosovalue|spot Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 23:00:24

Open Interest Surpasses $40 Billion As Longs Crowd In,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-open-interest-40-billion-longs/,"After hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,474 on Binance on August 13, Bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled toward $113,000, with the next major support zone around $110,000. Analysts warn that more downside could still be ahead for the top cryptocurrency. Bitcoin To Fall More? Crowded Long Trade Gives Hint According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin open interest across all exchanges has surged past $40 billion, nearing ATH territory. This rise shows both whales and short-term traders are piling into leveraged positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $115,000 As Binance Buying Power Ratio Collapses The chart below highlights the recent spike in BTC open interest, now hovering at $40.6 billion. Compared to August 2024 levels of $15 billion, open interest has grown by more than 150%. The CryptoQuant contributor added that despite this surge, the funding rate has remained positive, showing a strong long bias. While this reflects market optimism, it also signals a crowded trade, with most participants betting on further BTC appreciation. As a result, the risk of a long squeeze – forced liquidations of long positions due to aggressive leverage – has risen. XWIN Research Japan explained in their analysis: A sudden price drop can trigger a cascade of forced selling, amplifying volatility. In other words, Bitcoin’s short-term moves remain at the mercy of speculative flows. BTC Fund Holding By Institutions Rises Despite speculative froth from excessive leverage in the market, BTC fund holdings by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional investors continue to surge, exceeding 1.3 million according to latest data. Spot ETFs and corporate treasuries absorbing BTC provides the digital asset a structural bid that steadily reduces its available supply. According to data from SoSoValue, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold $146 billion in net assets – representing 6.47% of BTC’s market cap. Related Reading: Market Jitters Rise As Bitcoin Pulls Back—Is $135K Still Possible? That said, this week alone has seen more than $645 million in outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, following two consecutive weeks of inflows totaling nearly $800 million. Among the ETFs, BlackRock’s IBIT leads with $84.78 billion in net assets as of August 19. Still, not all signals are bearish. For instance, while BTC slipped below $115,000, its spot trading volume surged past $6 billion, giving bulls hope for a potential rebound. Similarly, technical analyst AO recently suggested that BTC could be mirroring gold’s trajectory, with an ambitious target of $600,000 by early 2026. At press time, BTC trades at $113,845, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

Investors are focusing on coins that combine community strength, proven technology, and clear growth potential. The most compelling choices tend to balance innovation with measurable results, proving they are more than short-term hype. This analysis looks at four projects currently standing out, BlockDAG, Stellar, Hyperliquid, and Chainlink. Each is approaching growth differently, but together, they highlight why these names are among the top crypto assets for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $377M Raised & Global Adoption in Motion BlockDAG has quickly become one of the most discussed presales in the market. Its hybrid design, combining Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability with Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, creates a network that is both reliable and high-performing. With EVM compatibility, it also makes Ethereum-based applications easy to integrate, strengthening its developer appeal. The presale metrics stand out. BlockDAG has raised more than $377 million so far, placing it among the largest ongoing sales. Coins are priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, with early participants from Batch 1 already up over 2,600% on paper. Projections suggest a post-listing price near $1, a 36× gain from today’s levels, making it a focal point for investors assessing the top crypto assets . Adoption supports the hype. The X1 mobile miner app has 2.5 million users, more than 19,300 ASIC miners are already distributed, and the community includes over 200,000 holders and 4,500 developers building 300 decentralized apps. A demo trading platform is live, offering practical use before the mainnet launch. BlockDAG has also launched a 200 ETH competition worth nearly $1 million to drive engagement. With 20 confirmed listings and ambitions for Coinbase and Gemini, it is positioning for global expansion. 2. Hyperliquid: Building a Futures Market Edge Hyperliquid is gaining attention as a decentralized platform specializing in perpetual futures trading. It enables traders to access advanced financial products without relying on centralized exchanges, providing both security and speed. This niche approach is gaining traction as more users seek decentralized alternatives for sophisticated trading. Its volumes have been climbing, driven by user demand for decentralized trading solutions. The roadmap includes new product offerings and integrations to attract both retail traders and institutional participants. Though still relatively early in its journey, the strong interest in its futures market places Hyperliquid firmly among the top crypto assets for 2025. 3. Stellar: Driving Efficiency in Payments Stellar (XLM) was designed to make payments faster, more affordable, and widely accessible, especially across borders. Its blockchain processes transactions at near-instant speeds and with extremely low fees, making it ideal for remittances and small-scale transfers. Compared to traditional systems such as SWIFT, Stellar offers a streamlined solution that resonates with both individuals and institutions. Adoption has grown through collaborations with fintechs and payment providers, along with developers using Stellar for asset issuance and token transfers. While XLM’s price reflects overall market conditions, its utility in gbal payments sustains its relevance. For those exploring the top crypto assets for 2025, Stellar represents a project with proven functionality and long-term potential. 4. Chainlink: Powering Smart Contracts With Real Data Chainlink (LINK) has cemented its role as a vital piece of blockchain infrastructure. Its decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts with real-world data, from asset prices to weather and financial information. This function is essential, particularly in DeFi, where reliable external data is critical for accurate execution. Over time, Chainlink has become the dominant oracle provider, supporting thousands of projects and securing billions in value. It is now expanding into cross-chain interoperability, enterprise applications, and even traditional finance integrations. Demand for decentralized data continues to rise, reinforcing LINK’s long-term importance. For investors evaluating the top crypto assets in 2025, Chainlink remains one of the most dependable choices. Assessing the Top Crypto Assets For 2025 Each of these four projects highlights a different strength in today’s market. BlockDAG has raised $377 million, attracted millions of users, and created major presale momentum, putting it on track to be one of the most watched launches in years. Stellar continues to prove itself in global payments with its fast, low-cost transactions. Hyperliquid is tapping into the perpetual futures space with decentralized solutions. Chainlink remains essential infrastructure, powering smart contracts with real-world data. For those assessing the top crypto assets for 2025, this mix of presale potential, payment solutions, futures trading, and core infrastructure provides a balanced perspective. BlockDAG is leading with scale and adoption, while Stellar, Hyperliquid, and Chainlink strengthen the market with proven use cases. Together, they form a lineup of assets that could play a major role in shaping the year ahead.

Angie Craig (D-Minn.) “It’s no secret that my side of the aisle would prefer not to see any sitting President — I won’t name one — participating in this market while a sitting president unless those assets are in a sealed trust,” Craig said on stage at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday. Trump, as well as his family, particularly Eric Trump, who was present at the venue during Craig’s appearance, have both built businesses in the industry, particularly since Trump retook office this past January. Trump has issued several meme coins tied to his name and his social media platform, Truth Social, has applied for several exchange-traded funds. Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, a mining company owned by Hut 8. Craig, who was joined by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wi.), spoke on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act which the House passed with a massive bipartisan vote last month. The Senate Banking Committee is working on its own version of crypto market structure legislation. While the majority of Republicans are in favor of the bill, many Democrats remain skeptical, and a big reason for that is the Trump family’s involvement in the industry, Craig said. “The elephant in the room here is the President’s family’s participation in this marketplace and that’s a stumbling block to get more Democrats to support the legislation,” she said. Craig said that while there is some language in the legislation that limits this conflict of interest, a stronger tone is needed to convince some lawmakers. “If we could find some language that would allow or prevent conflicts of interest to occur, from our perspective, I think you would see a whole lot more Democrats support it,” she said. Craig is the ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee, meaning she is the leading Democrat on that committee. This isn't the first time she's referenced the Trump family's crypto tie-ups — during a committee hearing in June on the Clarity Act, she said his crypto actions were ""making this debate more difficult"" and suggested that Congress should add restrictions on how the U.S. president can trade in markets overseen by the CFTC, including crypto. Despite her comments, Craig still voted to advance the Clarity Act without any such language being added.

This rare level of profitability has historically preceded sharp declines, but some analysts believe this cycle may follow a different trajectory. High Profitability Levels Raise Concerns XRP continues to trade above $3, close to its record highs, after climbing from $0.40 to $3.11 within a year, a gain of more than 500%. According to on-chain figures published by Glassnode, this surge has pushed nearly every XRP wallet into positive territory. Market commentator Winny cautioned that such widespread profitability has been a warning signal in the past. He pointed to two historical examples where a similar setup preceded major crashes. Markets have memory. And every time XRP hits a major milestone it feels like déjà vu. Think of it like climbing a mountain: the higher you go, the thinner the air. XRP just touched $3.11 a 500% run from $0.40 in less than a year. 94% of all supply is now in profit ( @glassnode ).… https://t.co/7LhOwyxepM — Winny (@0xWINNYx) August 18, 2025 In early 2018, profitability exceeded 90% as XRP approached $3.30, after which the token fell by more than 95%. Again in 2021, when XRP reached $1.95, profitability was at similar levels before an 85% decline followed. Given these precedents, Winny argues that investors should be cautious, stressing that when most market participants are in profit, selling pressure becomes difficult to avoid. Factors That Could Prevent a Repeat Despite the risks, Winny acknowledged that current conditions show important differences from prior cycles. Notably, large holders , wallets with more than one million XRP, have reached record levels, suggesting stronger long-term conviction among major investors. Network activity is also at its highest point in years, with daily active addresses rising to 225,000, the largest figure in three years. Technical data adds to this outlook, as XRP is consolidating around $3.05 in a triangle formation. A downside break below this area could open the door to $2.40, but if the price moves upward, Elliott Wave projections suggest a possible advance toward $6 or beyond. Winny concluded that these factors could create stronger support levels than in previous cycles, potentially reducing the scale of any correction even if profit-taking occurs.

He argued that while XRP may experience a further rally in the near term, a significant retracement remains likely. He presented two possible scenarios: if XRP rises to $9, he expects a pullback of about 85%, which would return the token to $1.30. In a more bullish case, if XRP surges to $27, he foresees a correction of roughly 97%, which could push the price back to $0.80, similar to the collapse seen in 2018. The market’s next move remains uncertain as XRP investors weigh high profitability against new technical and on-chain developments. While historical data suggests that such levels of profit often precede steep declines, analysts argue that increased whale accumulation and stronger network activity may change the outcome this time. Whether XRP can sustain its current momentum or repeat past patterns will likely be determined by how the market reacts in the coming weeks.

The studio appointed Rod Fergusson to lead the production of the upcoming game, which has been in development for several years now. The project is yet to receive an official title or release date despite being in production for some time now, with multiple restarts and adjustments. The layoffs are reportedly cutting across the development team behind the game, with no precise details on the scale of the cuts. Uncertainty still surrounds BioShok 4 after six years of development. The restructuring announcement follows the recent appointment of Rod Fergusson, former head of the Diablo franchise at Blizzard. Fergusson has worked on several projects, and he is recognized as a veteran in the industry for delivering finished, high-quality games rather than rushed releases. After BioShok 4 failed the recent internal review, the studio head, Kelley Gilmore, was fired, and creative director Horgath de la Plante was taken to publishing. Would you kindly allow me to share some news? Some of you guessed it, I’m returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. I’ll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with… — Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) August 19, 2025 The project is facing drastic changes, which have triggered reactions from fans. Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two CEO, admitted that the game development has faced ups and downs, but asked the fans to honour the BioShock legacy. He attributed the longer cycles in development to the industry’s focus on quality, saying that they are prioritizing exceptional entertainment over sheer output. Cloud Chamber was established in 2019 by 2K Games, a brand of Take-Two Interactive, to revive the BioShock series, which has been on hold for several years now. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that the project has been restarted more than once as the studio sought to fine-tune its creative direction. The latest project, dubbed BioShock 4, has been in the works for nearly six years now. BioShock has delivered several games in its series, including Irrational Games’ debut in 1997, BioShock 2, and BioShock Infinite. The pioneer of the series, Ken Levine, is currently working on his project, Judas, with his studio, Ghost Story Games, and he will not participate in the development of BioShock 4. Fergusson brings renewed hope for the BioShock series Rod Fergusson’s previous works have given him a stable reputation across the gaming industry. Before moving to Blizzard , He worked on the Gears of War series at Epic Games and The Coalition. He is known across the industry for his focus on production management and delivering projects on schedule. His leadership style has been characterized as pragmatic for avoiding prolonged development cycles currently experienced at Cloud Chamber studio. Fergusson revealed his excitement for returning to 2K Games while acknowledging the studio’s ongoing restructuring. He applauded the work done so far at BioShock and committed himself to building a game that gamers will love. He confirmed that he will be the head of the BioShock Franchise and overseeing the development of BioShock 4, plus extensions like the in-development Netflix movie. The BioShock Franchise is expanding into film with the upcoming game receiving a live-action BioShock adaptation currently in production at Netflix. Francis Lawrence, who directed The Hunger Games and I AM Legend, is the current director of the BioShock adaptation film. The film is expected to incorporate visual and thematic style drawn from the original games, which combined dystopian storytelling with art deco. Cloud Chamber and 2K have not issued any comment so far on the status of the upcoming project, which remains in development with its future tied to Fergusson’s leadership. However, the 2K Games studio revealed it aims to preserve the spirit of the Franchise while exploring new settings and themes. It also remains unclear how the staff reduction will affect the progress of the game after the confirmation from Fergusson. Get seen where it counts.

Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6023 Market cap $453.37M Trading volume $42.82 Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.6118 24-hour low $0.5873 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 7.09% 50-day SMA $0.6348 200-day SMA $0.6848 Sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (August 20), APE’s price dropped by 6.04% in one week and rose 0.64% in the last 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market (1.48%). The market recorded less trading interest as trading volumes dropped by 28.10%. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. This week, the coin traded along the William Alligator moving averages with little momentum as shown by the MACD histograms (0.0003). The RSI (48.71) suggests neutral momentum. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s run and its support at $0.58. Its volatility is dropping with a three white soldier candlestick pattern. The next 8 hours are critical to whether APE will continue upwards or reverse.

APE price analysis shows that the coin is bearish with little volatility. Lower trading volumes confirm less conviction in the current market trend. Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. driven by the APE bridge to ApeChain and growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction August 2025 The APE August price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $0.70, with an average of $0.59.

XRP, developed by Ripple, has been one of the most prominent examples, designed to streamline international payments at lower cost and with faster settlement than traditional channels. Today, analysts argue that this resistance is losing ground, as calls for an updated financial infrastructure are becoming mainstream, even from political leaders. Growing Tensions Between Banks and Digital Assets Traditional banking institutions have long opposed innovations that challenge their dominance, particularly products that could replace or undermine savings accounts and cross-border transfers. Rupert, an analyst from All In Crypto, explained on the Paul Barron Podcast that banking associations fought extensively against proposals such as paying yield on stablecoins. The reason is straightforward: if consumers can earn interest directly on digital assets, banks risk losing one of their primary advantages. This pushback reflects how threatened the financial sector feels by blockchain-based solutions that give customers cheaper and more efficient alternatives. However, recent political commentary suggests that momentum is shifting in favor of modernizing financial rails. President Donald Trump recently criticized the outdated infrastructure underpinning the U.S. financial system, describing it as several decades behind current technology. He advocated for an upgrade built on “crypto technology” to prepare the United States for a 21st-century economy. Although he did not reference Ripple by name, his remarks align closely with what Ripple has developed. The XRP Ledger is specifically designed to enable fast, inexpensive international transfers, addressing exactly the shortcomings that Trump highlighted. Analysts note that Trump’s comments underscore a broader recognition among policymakers that legacy systems no longer meet modern demands. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SWIFT Faces Mounting Pressure At the center of this discussion is SWIFT , the dominant international payments messaging system. Despite its long-standing role, critics argue that it is slow, expensive, and unsuitable for the digital era. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even likened reliance on SWIFT to relying on outdated communications methods, emphasizing the need for alternatives. Ripple’s system provides a clear contrast. By using the XRP Ledger, institutions can complete cross-border settlements within seconds, eliminating the reliance on intermediary banks. If widely adopted, this model could offer the liquidity and scalability necessary to challenge SWIFT’s dominance and transform global finance. Ripple’s Broader Significance While Bitcoin was created as a decentralized form of money, Ripple’s purpose has always been narrowly defined: to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments. This mission places it in direct competition with banks, which profit from the fees and delays inherent in the existing system. Rupert cautioned that while price predictions for XRP often generate skepticism , the true impact of Ripple’s network is still unknown. The scale of adoption will ultimately determine how disruptive the technology becomes. What is clear, however, is that Ripple represents one of the most credible challenges yet to traditional banking infrastructure. The global financial system is under increasing pressure to modernize. While banks have resisted blockchain technology for years, recent political support for crypto-based solutions highlights a shift in direction. Ripple’s technology fits squarely into this conversation, offering the speed, efficiency, and scalability that leaders like Trump are now demanding.

August crushed the rally these firms enjoyed just weeks ago, slamming names that had become investor magnets during the sideways bitcoin market. The sell-off arrives just before the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where whatever the hell Jerome Powell says next could drag these stocks even deeper, or spark a quick rebound. This entire picture was reported by CNBC, who tracked every company in the space holding crypto as treasury. Some of these companies had only just started their crypto play. Ethzilla, which used to be a biotech firm called 180 Life Sciences, jumped into the game on July 29. Investors reacted fast. The stock exploded in early August and is now showing a 114% gain for the month, the highest return in the group. Right behind it is BitMine Immersion Technologies, which focused on ether instead of bitcoin, followed by DeFi Development Corp, a company that went all-in on Solana back in April. Biggest gains tied to timing and tokens DeFi Development made its move on April 7 and has climbed 2,600% since then. Even in August, while others tanked, it’s still up 8%. That kind of gain almost matches what Strategy pulled off since launching its now-famous bitcoin treasury plan in June 2020. But Strategy’s current numbers are ugly; it’s down 16% this month. The timing of each company’s crypto shift clearly matters. No two firms announced their strategies at the same time, making head-to-head comparisons messy. Still, some stocks burned fast. CEA Industries, a vape company out of Canada, jumped 550% on July 28 just for saying it was accumulating Binance Coin. The hype didn’t last. The stock is now down 28% in August. Bit Digital tried switching things up by ditching bitcoin mining in June to go full ether treasury and staking. The results? Meh. Since the announcement, shares are up 11%, but in August alone, they’re already down 6.5%. High-profile investors fuel confidence and volume Some names have got famous backers putting their faces on the line. Tom Lee, from Fundstrat Global Advisors, became chairman of BitMine Immersion in late June. Just after that, Peter Thiel picked up a 9% stake in the company, then added a 7.5% slice of Ethzilla too. That kind of support does more than look pretty in a press release. Michael Bucella, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital, said, “Large names extend their reputation to the vehicle and instill confidence that the backers of these assets — alongside executives and board members with legal ties — will operate them as real businesses, growing revenue while managing risks.” He added, “That investor confidence creates momentum and market depth, which fuels volume and options activity. This in turn enables these companies to establish sizable ATM programs, raising large sums of capital to acquire more of the asset and gain greater prominence in its ecosystem.” Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, said it’s not just about who invests but who runs the company. Galaxy, which has backed firms like SharpLink Gaming and ReserveOne, sees management as a key driver for whether a crypto treasury stock can actually survive. “Those that raise more capital with the right partners, with the right business model, with the right management teams have a much better shot of achieving some escape velocity with their ultimate treasury management companies, which also can become ecosystem companies that are bigger than just the immediate launch moment,” Kurz said . The Ether crowd is holding up better than the bitcoin players. There are reasons for that. The IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, the passing of the GENIUS Act, and an explosion of institutional interest in stablecoins (most of which live on Ethereum) have all helped ether-linked companies gain an edge.

Trump, who co-founded bitcoin mining company American Bitcoin earlier this year, reiterated his excitement for bitcoin during an appearance at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday. He even called himself a “bitcoin maxi.” The businessman and executive vice president of the Trump organization said he now spends over 50% of his time on crypto projects. He said he believes that the crypto asset will be worth $175,000 a token by the end of the year, sticking with his earlier prediction. Trump told several personal stories pointing out what he described as the flaws of the current financial system and how bitcoin and blockchain technology can solve those issues, including faster transactions and payment settlements. American Bitcoin, which merged with Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr-owned American Data Center in March, is expected to go public on Nasdaq via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). The brothers own 20% of the company while bitcoin miner Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%. Trump's comments came hours after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made a similar prediction .

50412502,561256,1755734410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50412502.jpeg,Bitcoin STH Capitulate: $5.69B In Losses Hit Exchanges In 48 Hours,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sth-capitulate-5-69b-losses-hit-exchanges/,"Bitcoin is trading at a critical support level after reaching a new all-time high of $124,500 before swiftly losing the $115K level in less than a week. The sudden reversal underscores the sharp rise in volatility, with bulls and bears locked in a battle for momentum. While some analysts argue that BTC could reclaim its highs in the coming days, others expect the market to cool off further, with consolidation potentially dragging the price into lower ranges. Key insights from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn reveal that Bitcoin just faced one of the heaviest loss-driven moves in weeks. Short-term holders (STHs) have been under pressure, with billions in BTC flowing into exchanges at a loss, signaling capitulation among speculative investors. Historically, such moments of intense selling either trigger deeper corrections or set the stage for recovery rallies, depending on how quickly markets absorb the supply. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to stabilize above the $115K–$113K support zone will likely determine the short-term trajectory. If buyers step in aggressively, a rebound toward $120K+ could materialize. However, failure to defend current levels may leave BTC vulnerable to a deeper retracement before any attempt to retest its all-time highs. Short-Term Holders Capitulate as Bitcoin Faces Pressure According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Bitcoin’s short-term holders (STHs) are showing signs of serious capitulation . Over just two days, a staggering 50,026 BTC — worth approximately $5.69 billion — flowed from STHs to exchanges at a loss. This marks the deepest loss-driven move in more than a month, underscoring how quickly sentiment can shift in an overheated market. STHs selling at a loss is a critical signal. Historically, these moments often align with market stress points where speculative investors exit positions under pressure. Bulls, however, are looking for a different outcome. They want this to represent a sharp flush-out of weak hands, followed by renewed accumulation and a swift price rebound. In this view, the sell-off would simply be a reset — a profit-taking event that clears the path for more sustainable gains. If that fails to materialize, the risk grows that this episode could mirror the prolonged loss realization seen from late February through late May, when persistent capitulation dragged Bitcoin through an extended consolidation phase. For now, bulls are defending the $115K region, but many analysts point to $110K as a decisive level. Losing that support could expose BTC to a deeper retracement, while holding it could provide the springboard for a renewed push back toward all-time highs. BTC Price Analysis: Testing Key Moving Average The 8-hour Bitcoin chart shows that BTC is under strong selling pressure after failing to hold above the $120K–$123K resistance area. The chart highlights multiple rejections at the $123,217 level, establishing it as a critical ceiling. After the most recent failed breakout attempt, price has sharply retraced, now trading around $113,486. On the downside, BTC is testing the 200-period moving average (red line), currently sitting near $113,292. This zone has acted as a key support level in previous consolidations. If the price manages to defend this area, it could form a base for a potential rebound toward the mid-range levels around $117K–$118K. However, failure to hold this moving average would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward the $110K psychological level. The 50-period (blue) and 100-period (green) moving averages are now above the price, acting as resistance, signaling a short-term bearish bias. Market structure suggests consolidation is underway, with momentum shifting toward bears.

50412548,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79451,1755734413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Says XRP Is Preparing for the Next Pump to $5. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-preparing-for-the-next-pump-to-5-heres-why/,"XRP is once again drawing attention from traders as its price structure points to a potential breakout. Market analyst JackTheRippler recently argued on X that XRP is “preparing for the next pump,” projecting a move beyond $5. A closer look at the charts suggests that his forecast is grounded in the asset’s current technical formation. A Strong Ascending Channel The weekly BITSTAMP chart shows XRP moving within a clearly defined ascending channel that has been intact since late 2024. This structure is characterized by higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a market that continues to build strength over time. As of report time, XRP trades at $2.95, positioned near the middle of this channel after retreating from resistance just above $3.30 earlier in the summer. The preservation of this upward channel underscores a strong underlying trend, as each pullback has been met with renewed demand at higher levels. #XRP IS PREPARING FOR THE NEXT PUMP! $5+ IMMINENT pic.twitter.com/wJrsI6XICS — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 20, 2025 Testing Support and Eyeing Resistance The channel has established consistent zones where traders respond. Each time XRP has approached the lower boundary in the $2.50 to $2.60 region, buyers have defended the level, reaffirming it as a reliable base of support. On the other hand, resistance has been repeatedly felt near the channel’s upper edge, which currently lies in the $3.30 to $3.50 range . Price now sits at a pivotal mid-channel position, where momentum typically begins to build before the next decisive move. If buyers regain control and drive the price above the upper boundary, the chart implies an extension that naturally projects toward the $5 level. Why the $5 Target Holds Weight JackTheRippler’s $5 call aligns with the measured move potential that often follows channel breakouts. When an asset consistently trends within parallel rails, a breakout to the upside typically produces gains equal to the width of the channel. In XRP’s case, the projected path from the current formation places the next significant resistance zone near $5. This target is not arbitrary—it follows directly from the geometry of the trend and the strength of recurring support that has underpinned XRP’s rise throughout 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Integrity of the Pattern The credibility of this setup lies in its consistency. Both the support and resistance levels of the channel have been tested multiple times, confirming the validity of the structure. As long as XRP continues to respect these levels, the broader bias remains bullish. A decisive breakout above resistance would confirm market conviction and pave the way toward $5 , while a sustained drop below $2.50 would be required to invalidate the pattern. Final Outlook XRP’s technical outlook provides a clear explanation for JackTheRippler’s $5 projection. The cryptocurrency is locked within a disciplined ascending channel, consolidating near its midpoint and preparing for its next directional move. With the trend firmly intact and resistance levels within reach, a breakout could propel XRP into the $5 region in the near term. The case is not built on speculation but on the strength of the chart itself, which continues to show resilience and upward momentum.

With presales often linked to major updates, wallet releases, or new blockchain features, choosing the right ones can deliver strong growth potential. In 2025, a few projects are gaining momentum through adoption, funding, and standout ideas. BlockDAG has attracted strong attention with its hybrid framework and large-scale fundraising, while Nexchain AI has stepped up as an ambitious AI-powered blockchain. Best Wallet is changing how wallets operate by rewarding user activity in ways not seen before, and Remittix is building its place in the PayFi sector with real-world payment use cases. Each of these presales adds something unique, but BlockDAG’s scale, adoption, and presale record make it especially noteworthy. This article explores why these are the top crypto presale for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Strength in Hybrid Design and $378M Presale BlockDAG is gaining speed with a hybrid Directed Acyclic Graph and Proof-of-Work model, creating a system that supports high-speed transactions while keeping decentralization. It is also EVM-compatible, allowing Ethereum-based apps to run without barriers. Adoption has been impressive even before launch, with over 2.5 million users joining via the X1 mobile miner app. More than 19,300 ASIC miners have also been distributed, creating one of the most inclusive mining setups in the industry. This dual mining option enables casual mobile users and large-scale miners to take part, strengthening the network and driving adoption further. The presale has moved quickly, raising $378 million in Batch 29, with BDAG priced at $0.0276. Early buyers have already seen paper returns of around 2,660% as prices rose with each batch. Analysts project a possible $1 listing price, which could mean about 36× growth from the current stage, making it a key presale to watch. Adding to this, BlockDAG (BDAG) has introduced a 200 ETH competition worth nearly $1 million, aimed at boosting community involvement and rewarding active presale buyers. With strong technology, rapid adoption, and notable financial milestones, BlockDAG has positioned itself as a leader in the top crypto presale of 2025, setting up one of the most anticipated launches of the year. 2. Nexchain AI: Speed, Security, and AI-driven Features Nexchain AI is making progress as an AI-powered Layer-1 blockchain created for scalability, high speed, and advanced smart contract use. It runs with a hybrid Proof-of-Stake plus AI-driven consensus and is designed to reach up to 400,000 transactions per second at fees as low as $0.001. The system enhances smart contracts through fraud detection and real-time adjustment, offering use cases in finance, logistics, and healthcare. Security is also central, using post-quantum cryptography and AI-driven error checks. The network has passed a CertiK audit, which improves trust in its framework. The presale is currently in Stage 25, with NEX priced at $0.10 and about $8.5–$8.8 million raised toward a $9.27 million goal. Supporters benefit from community programs, testnet activities, and codes like TESTNET100 offering extra bonuses. Nexchain AI has also launched a $5 million airdrop campaign to expand adoption. With estimates that NEX could rise to $0.30 at launch, there is speculation of a 300% increase. These elements place Nexchain AI as one of the key projects in the top crypto presale for 2025. 3. Best Wallet: Turning Usage into Real Rewards Best Wallet changes the idea of a crypto wallet by offering rewards for user activity instead of just storage. It gives back to the community whenever users swap, transfer, or ramp crypto. With cashback on transactions, referral programs, and rewards through its CWT coin, it transforms self-custody into a way to earn. Plans also include rebates for gas fees, stronger transparency on transactions, and eventually a Layer-2 scaling path to add more speed. Its presale has drawn attention for its clear model and accessible setup. CWT is the base of this reward-focused system, and demand has grown as the network moves closer to launch. Best Wallet’s presale pricing and design make it a platform that goes beyond storage, acting as a hub for daily crypto utility. With its presale open, Best Wallet stands out as one of the leading names in the top crypto presale, especially for those seeking simple use combined with real benefits. 4. Remittix: Building Global PayFi Solutions Remittix is working to improve global payments, positioning itself as a PayFi service that connects crypto with standard banking systems. Its Web3 wallet, set for beta release on September 15, 2025, will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies with instant conversion. This creates a practical way to send funds worldwide, offering zero foreign exchange fees and same-day settlement across 30+ countries. With only 50 testers chosen for the beta launch, anticipation continues to grow. The presale is close to reaching $20 million, with RTX priced around $0.092–$0.0944 and bonus offers of 40–50%. A major centralized exchange listing is expected once the $20 million mark is crossed, driving momentum. Passing a CertiK audit with no critical issues has added more trust. Analysts project the chance for 100× growth in 2025 due to its real-world payment model and low market cap. With giveaways and community activity included, Remittix secures its place as a notable name in the top crypto presale this year. Final Thoughts: Four Presales Defining 2025 Presales remain one of the strongest ways to access crypto projects early, and 2025 brings several promising names. BlockDAG leads with unmatched presale fundraising, adoption through mobile and ASIC miners, and a unique hybrid model mixing DAG with Proof-of-Work. Nexchain AI adds a future-focused AI blockchain, Best Wallet converts regular usage into active rewards, and Remittix delivers practical PayFi services for global use. With BlockDAG’s $378 million raised, Nexchain AI’s advanced Layer-1 setup, Best Wallet’s cashback model, and Remittix’s near $20 million milestone with an upcoming wallet launch, these projects represent the top crypto presale for 2025 . Each has distinct strengths, but together they show how presales are driving the next wave of adoption. Choosing the right one now could mean joining some of the most important launches in the coming cycle.

Currently trading at $2.8, XRP has made a 3.68% decline in the past 24 hours, with trading volume rising slightly by 0.82% to $6.85 billion. Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ The latest downturn comes after on-chain data revealed that whales offloaded 470 million XRP tokens over the past 10 days, slashing their cumulative holdings to just 7.63 billion coins. Large-scale exits by wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP suggest institutional desks and high-net-worth traders are taking profits after XRP’s recent rally to above $3.39 earlier this month. XRP Price Action: $2.85–$2.90 Becomes Key Battleground Price action data shows XRP’s sharpest drop occurred between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC on August 19, when it slid from $3.04 to $2.93 as volume spiked to 137 million, nearly double the daily average. Despite heavy selling, buyers repeatedly defended the $2.85–$2.88 zone, preventing further collapse. Currently, XRP is consolidating near $2.85–$2.90, a sign that short-term selling pressure may be easing. Still, resistance at $3.04 has been confirmed, making a bullish recovery difficult without stronger demand. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Can Bulls Hold the Line at $2.8? For traders, the $2.8 level is now the most critical support to watch. A breakdown could open the door for a deeper decline, while reclaiming $3.00 would signal renewed buyer strength. Analysts note that a recovery above $3.19 is essential for momentum to shift back in favor of the bulls. Adding to the pressure, a security audit ranked the XRP Ledger lowest among 15 major blockchains, sparking concerns over long-term resilience. Meanwhile, the U.S. SEC has delayed decisions on several XRP ETF applications, including Nasdaq’s CoinShares filing, until October, deepening regulatory uncertainty.

XRP has entered a fresh bullish phase, while SHIB has reignited excitement with a massive burn rate surge. Both are trending and creating short-term opportunities. But for long-term plays, the question remains: which project blends momentum with lasting adoption? That’s where Cold Wallet enters. Rather than chasing hype, it is building adoption through strategy, most notably, the $270M Plus Wallet acquisition. This deal instantly positioned Cold Wallet as a serious contender in self-custody, backed by both a strong presale and a ready-made user base. Ripple (XRP) Technicals Indicate Strong Breakout Potential Ripple is once again drawing headlines as XRP price charts point to a potential breakout. Its structure is pressing against resistance, and momentum is supported by the expanding stablecoin market. More stablecoin usage boosts demand for networks like XRP that support fast liquidity transfers. Analysts highlight XRP consolidating near a key zone that, if broken, could send prices to record highs. With volume increasing and Ripple’s reputation as a payment solution leader, its case for further upside is strong. For long-term holders, Ripple’s resilience against legal challenges and relevance in cross-border payments give it credibility. But the pace of adoption will still decide its next big move. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Fuels Price Forecast Shiba Inu delivered a 5% price jump in just 24 hours after an 83,000% surge in burn rate. This sharp reduction in supply lit up the SHIB community, with many predicting more upside. SHIB’s model has always leaned on its loyal community and token burns. This latest move proves retail appetite for high-volatility coins is still alive in 2025. But questions remain about sustainability. Burn events may create scarcity, but without deeper utility or ecosystem growth, momentum risks fading. Projects like Shibarium help, but SHIB still depends on community energy more than long-term fundamentals. Cold Wallet’s Plus Wallet Acquisition Powers Adoption and Presale Growth While XRP and SHIB thrive on cycles, Cold Wallet is building something more durable. At its core, it is a self-custody wallet powered by the $CWT token, rewarding users for on-chain actions like swaps, transfers, and bridging. What makes 2025 different is its bold adoption play, the $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet. This move brought over 2 million users into Cold Wallet’s ecosystem instantly. For a presale-stage project, that’s unheard of. Instead of waiting years for adoption, Cold Wallet starts with a large user base and expands faster than rivals. At the presale level, Cold Wallet is priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, with over $6.3M raised and more than 740 million tokens sold. Unlike many presales, this one is paired with real adoption pipelines. It isn’t just speculation; it’s a product that people can use from day one. Referral bonuses add another layer of growth. Users receive 10% of their referrals’ purchases in $CWT, and referees earn 5%. Both are vested under the same terms as bought tokens, creating fairness and sustainability. With 25% of supply allocated to rewards and team tokens locked for years, inflation is avoided. The acquisition and presale momentum align perfectly with rising demand for self-custody wallets. Cold Wallet offers users full control of their assets while rewarding everyday activity, setting it apart from hype-driven projects. Final Words Ripple brings payment use cases and a strong setup for traders, while Shiba Inu thrives on community and burns. Both have appeal, but they remain tied to cycles. Cold Wallet, with its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition and $6.3M raised, is building differently. By combining real adoption with presale success, it creates long-term value while rewarding users daily. For anyone searching for the best long-term crypto investment, Cold Wallet stands out as the project built to scale.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin steadied in Asia Thursday at $114,610 (+1.4%), clawing back some ground after last week’s slide, while ether outpaced with a 5.8% jump to $4,370.73 as investors rotated selectively across the market. The CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the performance of the largest crypto assets, is up 3.5%, trading above 4,078. OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin said in a note to CoinDesk that the rising ETH/BTC ratio shows capital shifting into ether’s relative strength while Bitcoin consolidates. ""Crypto capital is getting more selective,"" Lin told CoinDesk. She stressed that this is not a broad “altseason,” but a targeted move into ETH as macro catalysts like the Jackson Hole conference and U.S. inflation data loom. Fresh figures from CryptoQuant underline why Bitcoin’s rally has cooled. Apparent demand has dropped from 174,000 BTC in July to 59,000 BTC today, while ETF inflows have slowed to their weakest since April,"" the firm wrote in a recent report. Profit-taking remains heavy, with whales realizing $2 billion in gains on Aug. 16 alone, bringing total realized profits since July to $74 billion. CryptoQuant analysts now classify the market as in a “bullish cooldown” phase, with $110,000 flagged as an important support level. In a note to CoinDesk, analysts at Enflux, a Singapore-based market maker noted that retail enthusiasm for altseason has dropped sharply compared to last week, even as strategic bets like BNB hitting all-time highs and Hyperliquid’s operational strength continue to draw capital. “This indicates that the altcoin market is no longer a uniform beta trade, as macro conviction is forming, but more selective and concentrated, also on the institutional side,” the firm said. The result is a market less defined by broad rallies and more by selective winners, with ETH setting the tone as capital stays in crypto but moves with sharper focus, favoring resilience over speculation. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin edged up 1.4% to just above $114,000 while U.S. stocks slipped, and altcoins showed unusual resilience as BTC dominance nears a six-month low. ETH: Ether outperformed bitcoin, climbing 5.8% as traders rotated into majors despite slowing BTC demand. Gold: UBS raised its gold price target to $3,600 per ounce in Q1 2026, citing the strongest bullion demand since 2011 driven by U.S. macro risks, de-dollarization, and heavy ETF and central bank buying. S&P 500: The Nasdaq fell 0.68% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.26% Wednesday as investors rotated out of tech stocks into sectors like energy, healthcare, and consumer staples ahead of the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium.

Switzerland has become the latest hotspot for mainstream integration, with SPAR enabling crypto payments across more than 100 stores and growing to 300 sites soon. Using DFX.swiss and Binance Pay, clients may now settle invoices with over 100 tokens, including stablecoins, with quick confirmation and no gas fees. Ripple is also making news, appearing in Gemini’s IPO filing with a fresh $75 million credit facility. The deal not only gives Gemini more cash before its market debut, but it also sets Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin up for wider use by businesses. XRP is selling well, and people are now beginning to speculate if the coin could eventually hit $10 or more in 2025. Investors are also interested in projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that are trying to get in early before the next important spike. Crypto Payments Go Mainstream in Switzerland SPAR’s launch is being lauded as one of the most visible indicators that digital assets are no longer limited to trading desks. Merchants pay around two-thirds less in transaction fees than they would with a credit card, while customers get their money quickly and without having to pay for gas. Another strong inducement for adoption is Switzerland’s planned five-year tax exemption on cryptocurrency revenues, which will start in 2025. The Top New Crypto Contender Gains Momentum In line with XRP’s growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads within the market. With only a few tokens available and a lot of people wanting them, the presale has quickly sold out in several phases. Analysts are already comparing it to the early days of Shiba Inu, claiming that people who get in now could make a lot of money when the project goes live on big exchanges. Its quick development in the community and early success make it one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on in 2025. Ripple’s Strategy Beyond IPO Buzz The IPO filing by Gemini exposes not only financial pressure, but also Ripple’s strategic impact. The deal might go up to $150 million, which is more than the first $75 million facility. It could also include Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which came out in late 2024 and is already getting a lot of attention from institutions. Ripple isn’t trying to go public; instead, it’s focusing on buying other companies and growing its ecosystem. This keeps XRP in a strong position for future growth. Conclusion: Eyes on $10 XRP The case for XRP reaching $10 by 2025 is getting stronger as more people in Switzerland use crypto and Ripple pushes for more businesses to use it. Bullish mood is growing because more people are using Ripple, transactions are cheaper, and Ripple’s ecosystem is getting bigger. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-growth bet , providing investors with a rare early-stage chance before the next bull surge begins.

Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high of $123,000 last week. It has since pulled back, falling nearly 9% from that peak. After approaching a new record high last week, Ether's closing price experienced a significant retreat, dropping over 14% from that peak. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high of $123,000 last week. It has since pulled back, falling nearly 9% from that peak. BTC is now up ~20% year to date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. After approaching a new record high last week, Ether's closing price experienced a significant retreat, dropping over 14% from that peak. ETH is now ~21% year to date and is ~15% below its record high from November 2021 XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), and Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

50413681,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788672,1755735450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50413681.jpeg,"Palantir’s six-session slump erases $73 billion in value, as short sellers finally win",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/palantirs-six-session-slump-erases-73b/,"Palantir just got dragged through six painful days on Wall Street, losing $73 billion in market value and giving short sellers a rare payday after months of losses. This losing streak, which started after the stock hit a record high on August 12, marks the company’s worst run since April 2024. Shares are now down over 17%, putting them on track for the ugliest week since the tariff-driven drop earlier this year. Despite being the biggest loser in the S&P 500 over the last six sessions, Palantir is still the top performer on the index in 2025, holding a 106% gain since the start of the year. That explosive rally led to a sky-high valuation, which most short sellers couldn’t handle. But this latest slide finally gave them room to breathe, and collect. Shorts pocket gains after long beating The decline handed $1.6 billion in profits to traders who bet against the Denver-based company, data from S3 Partners LLC showed. But those profits don’t undo the $4.5 billion in total losses short sellers have suffered this year betting against Palantir. The overall trend had been brutal for contrarians—until now. Matthew Unterman, managing director at S3, said short interest as a percentage of Palantir’s float dropped to 2.5%, down from nearly 5% a year ago. That means many traders had already exited their short positions as the stock kept rising. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC, said those traders either “wanted to avoid being run over by a monster momentum trade or were forced out after the freight train hit.” Vikram Rai, a portfolio manager and macro trader at Fny Capital Management LP, made it clear that the current drop wasn’t caused by bears taking control. “The selloff that we’re seeing in Palantir, it’s long overdue and it’s not because the short sellers have taken over,” Vikram said . He pointed to broader market weakness, especially in tech names like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which are also under pressure. “When you have the likes of Google, Meta and Microsoft declining, then obviously the high-beta stocks, which are hopelessly overvalued, will decline more.” Most of Palantir’s rise in 2025 came from long-only investors rather than a short squeeze. But with the stock finally showing some weakness, some contrarians are stepping back in. Short interest has grown by around 10 million shares since June, according to S3. That’s still a small chunk of Palantir’s 2.3 billion shares outstanding, but it’s a sign of growing pressure. Tech under pressure as investors rotate out The hit to Palantir isn’t happening in a vacuum. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.76 points, or 0.68%, ending at 21,170.19. The S&P 500 slipped 16.40 points, or 0.26%, closing at 6,394.97. Only the Dow Jones held flat, edging up by 1.48 points to 44,923.75. Investors are rotating away from tech into cheaper sectors like energy, healthcare, and consumer staples. The pullback comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where traders expect to hear new signals about policy direction. At the same time, worries are building across the tech space. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently warned that AI stocks are “in a bubble,” triggering more selloffs. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology added to the panic, showing that many tech companies aren’t yet turning their AI investments into actual profits. That’s not the only concern. President Donald Trump’s administration is now weighing the idea of taking equity stakes in chipmakers like Intel, just weeks after pushing revenue-sharing deals with Nvidia and AMD. That idea rattled investors. Shares of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Micro all fell in response. Traders are watching Nvidia’s earnings set for August 27, hoping to get a better sense of demand in the AI space. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Investor sentiment is buoyed by fading legal overhangs, renewed institutional interest, and strong technical setups forming on the charts. Analysts’ predictions vary, with moderate targets pointing toward $4 and more aggressive outlooks extending to the $5–$7 range or higher if momentum holds. This optimism has pulled traders back into XRP, but many also recognize the limitations of large-cap assets. While XRP may offer double- or triple-digit gains, the kind of exponential upside that defines bull market legends is usually found in smaller , earlier-stage projects. That’s why presale opportunities are attracting increasing attention. Investors are not just hunting for tokens with upside – they are looking for projects that can capture narrative power in a way that drives attention, liquidity, and long-term community growth. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE begins to stand apart. Key Catalysts Supporting XRP’s Momentum First, regulatory clarity is improving: the long-running SEC legal battle with Ripple is winding down, improving confidence in the token’s legitimacy. Second, U.S. legislative developments – including the GENIUS Act and Digital Markets Clarity Act – as well as plans to open crypto to retirement accounts like 401(k)s, are energizing institutional sentiment and encouraging broader adoption. Third, technical resistance near the $3.40–$3.60 range could be tested as momentum builds; some analysts even envision a clean breakout toward $4 or higher for XRP. Furthermore, veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt has forecasted a possible 60% rally toward $4.47 , while Standard Chartered anticipates XRPs could reach $5.50 by year-end, $8 in 2026, and even $12.50 by 2028. These bullish projections highlight a growing expectation that hype, adoption, and macro tailwinds may drive XRP to new highs. Amid this rally, many investors are pivoting their attention to presale opportunities outside XRP—seeking upside before markets become crowded. One such play gaining attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With XRP climbing toward record highs, a different countdown is capturing attention in presale markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the verge of closing its latest round, with allocations nearly gone. What sets it apart isn’t just the rapid sellout pace but the way early adopters are locking in positions before major exchange exposure begins . Each presale stage has introduced scarcity-driven demand, and thousands of participants have already joined in anticipation of the next pricing jump . The project’s unique political branding adds another layer of visibility, ensuring it resonates far beyond typical crypto circles. For investors looking at XRP’s surge as proof of capital rotation into altcoins, MAGACOIN represents a chance to secure exposure at presale prices before the next pump phase ignites. Altcoins in the Spotlight as XRP Gains Traction XRP’s strength often sets the tone for broader altcoin sector movements. A breakout could catalyze renewed interest across mid-cap and narrative-driven tokens. Markets frequently rotate from major movers into high-potential presale opportunities, especially those with political or cultural nuance. As attention converges on XRP’s new highs, MAGACOIN sits at the crossroads: benefiting from the spotlight while offering clean branding, capped supply, and growth clarity. Conclusion XRP is setting up for a compelling push toward new highs before summer ends, supported by regulatory clarity, bullish technical patterns, and strong analyst projections. That build-up could spark a sector-wide shift toward similarly dynamic altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with presale rounds nearly sold out and extra allocations incentivizing early participation, offers a scaled-down , branded entry point poised to leverage the mainstream momentum of this rally. For investors seeking to ride the wave both on-chain and in political-themed token storytelling, it might just be the most strategic bet of the season .

Mechanism: Foundation-led $260M buyback (6-week schedule) Start Date: July 21, 2025 Cumulative Impact: ~$150M executed in ~30 days Supply Effect: ~3.48% of circulating supply, ~1.53% of total supply This is one of the largest foundation-managed buybacks in crypto so far. CoinMarketCap: $ENA trades at $0.71, market cap $4.32B. Why Buybacks Matters Buybacks sound bullish, but execution is what matters. In equities, they reduce shares and boost EPS. In crypto, the impact depends on how buybacks are funded and whether they can last. $HYPE: sustainable, tied to protocol fees. $PUMP: turns meme-driven traffic into token support. $ENA: foundation-backed, showing scale and structure. But buybacks are not guaranteed. Protocols can stop anytime. If revenue slows, the mechanism loses weight. Bigger Picture To Monitor The rise of buybacks shows crypto maturing. Projects are now recycling profits back into their tokens, instead of relying only on emissions or hype. That creates a loop: user activity drives fees, fees drive buybacks, and buybacks support tokens. It’s the closest crypto has come to equity-style capital returns. Still, there are risks. Some projects may announce programs and underdeliver. Others could overcommit and hurt their treasuries. The key question remains: is the buyback funded by real revenue? Buybacks are one of the clearest tokenomics trends in 2025. They don’t automatically make a token bullish, but they change the narrative. $HYPE proves scale. $PUMP adds a backbone to memes. $ENA shows how foundations can run structured buybacks. What matters is sustainability. A buyback backed by fees is stronger than one backed by reserves. The real winners will be projects that align buybacks with long-term revenue.

The move is designed to make global market access faster, cheaper, and more seamless for millions of users. TRON’s high-volume network, known for its low fees and fast settlement times, is well-suited for asset tokenization. With this integration, xStocks extends beyond its initial Solana and BNB Chain launches, giving traders and investors more options and less friction across blockchains. Kraken first introduced xStocks on June 1, 2025, allowing users to trade tokenized shares of leading US companies directly on-chain. Each xStock is fully backed 1:1 by the corresponding underlying equity. Through this latest expansion, eligible clients can soon deposit and withdraw xStocks via the TRON network, offering the same ease as transferring stablecoins. Issued by Swiss-based Backed Finance in the form of TRC-20 tokens, each xStock remains securely tied to its real-world counterpart. TRON DAO will further support adoption by integrating the tokens across its wide ecosystem of applications and partners. Since launch, xStocks has seen rapid adoption, with combined centralized and decentralized trading volumes surpassing $2.5 billion . Kraken’s co-CEO Arjun Sethi emphasized that deploying xStocks on three blockchains in under 60 days demonstrates the power of open, multichain architecture. He added that TRON’s global scale, speed, and low fees significantly value Kraken’s vision for tokenized markets. TRON offers speed, scale, and global access TRON is no stranger to traffic. It already dominates global stablecoin transfers , which it processes daily in the billions. Today, TRON is in the top five blockchains according to total value locked, including over USD 6 billion on its network. This scale and efficiency made the high-volume blockchain an obvious choice for an xStocks app. The founder of TRON, Justin Sun, said the integration would help make finance more inclusive: “Tokenized equities represent a natural evolution for crypto, bridging traditional markets with blockchain. As demand for popular equities meets a global base of previously excluded users, we’ll see a more efficient, flexible, and accessible market.” Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said the move aligned with the main strength of high-volume blockchain. He explained that TRON users were already transferring millions in stablecoins at very low cost, and the next step was to extend that use case to tokenized equities. According to him, this shift would allow people worldwide to access traditional markets with the same ease as sending digital dollars. Kraken seizes a global market opportunity The integration of TRON by Kraken is part of its broader goal of replatforming Wall Street on the blockchain. The company already has customers in more than 140 countries. More locations will be rolled out over the coming weeks, providing access to tokenized stocks for an even larger user base. It’s a simple idea: Let people trade stocks the way the internet lives — boundaryless, permissionless, and interoperable for every chain. With multichain yStake, Kraken is knocking down similar walls that have all too often made traditional markets off limits to all. That often represents their first chance to have exposure to US stocks. That could be life-changing in places where savers have limited or costly access to a traditional brokerage account.

He aped into @Solana’s newest memecoin, $YZY, with $768K. The chart ripped. Market cap touched $134M (CMC) before crashing. By the time he rage-sold, his stack was worth just $56K. The wipeout lit Crypto Twitter on fire. NEW: A whale bought $768K of @Solana memecoin $YZY , its market cap spiked to $134M and then dropped instantly. Just 4 hours later, he sold it for $56K — a ~$712K loss. pic.twitter.com/RpTFW2uIw8 — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 20, 2025 Finnbags and the Kanye Play Behind $YZY is @finnbags, Founder & CEO of @BagsApp . Last night he launched the token himself. CT says he pulled a Sahil move: making memes, farming his own referrals, and steering liquidity. hey @kanyewest we made a $YZY coin for you on @BagsApp You get 100% of royalties earned from the trading volume of the coin. $50K has already been raised for you in the first 10 minutes. 70% of the supply is locked and can be transferred to you on a vesting schedule.… — FINN (@finnbags) August 19, 2025 The setup was wild: FINN bought 70% of supply at launch. 100% of trading fees went straight to Kanye West’s wallet. Market went full PvP. Cap nearly hit $13M (CMC) within hours. Then Finn tweeted at @kanyewest, telling him to “claim” the fees. Traders weren’t laughing. The chart nuked. Market cap dumped to $1.5M (CMC) overnight. Theories flew. Some pointed at Wintermute, calling it a money laundering op. Others just said it felt like a clout grab gone wrong. CT Starts Digging The backlash didn’t stop at the token. Clips of Finn’s old stream with @MrBeast resurfaced, no crypto talk in sight. Later, his appearance on @notthreadguy’s stream made things worse. Excuses didn’t land. Trust cratered. Every token tied to him bled. The “launch for Ye” meme collapsed before it even got traction. A few influencers like @SOL_IDNESS defended him, arguing intentions weren’t bad. But the larger CT consensus? If Kanye is already a billionaire, why would he ever need a memecoin fee drop? The Pumpfun Angle To Note As the drama grew, @StalkHQ traced the $YZY chart. Turns out, much of the run was botted. The dev botted the fake $yzy chart and pushed it all the way to $82M market cap, yet only made $3.62K in Pumpfun @pumpdotfun creator rewards. This shows the dev isn’t making much from rewards, meaning their main profit path could be through rugging the token instead. https://t.co/cFstowO0Nm pic.twitter.com/5EMgRiwVGr — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) August 20, 2025 On Pumpfun , the dev pushed the chart all the way to $82M market cap, but only earned $3.62K in creator rewards. That mismatch tells a story. If devs don’t make money from Pumpfun rewards, their main incentive leans toward rugging. Compare it to imperfect, another Pumpfun token. Market cap sits at just $1.27M (CMC). Yet its creator already pulled $3.53K in rewards. Smaller, but more sustainable. The difference is clear: organic community-driven growth pays creators better. Botted pumps may look strong, but they usually collapse fast, leaving exit scams as the only profit path. What This Shows 1. Pumpfun doesn’t reward fake pumps. When a chart rockets but creator rewards stay tiny, it’s often bot-driven. 2. Organic traction is king. Tokens that build communities see rewards track closely with their growth. 3. Red flag signal. High market cap + low rewards = botting risk, and often rugs. It’s exactly what happened with $YZY. The chart went vertical, but the mismatch gave it away. And when the smoke cleared, the whale’s $768K entry became a $56K exit. The Bigger Picture For CT, the episode blends two familiar storylines: whales getting torched chasing hype, and founders turning launchpads into personal casinos. The Kanye angle just made it messier. What was pitched as a “token for Ye” ended up as another quick pump, another crash, another bag burned. And it leaves a blunt takeaway: If a billionaire like Kanye isn’t claiming it, maybe you shouldn’t either. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

They let early buyers join before major listings, often at more favorable prices. Yet not every presale delivers. The most promising ones show strong funding, active communities, and clear plans that look solid for the long run. Some depend on cultural hype but still succeed in drawing attention from traders aiming for fast moves. This article highlights four projects gaining traction: BlockDAG, Maxi Doge ($MAXI), Snorter Bot ($SNORT), and PepeNode ($PEPENODE). Each brings different strengths, ranging from real technical progress to heavy community buzz. For anyone scanning the top crypto presales, these four stand out for combining adoption trends with high speculation appeal. 1. BlockDAG: $376M Secured and Still Rising BlockDAG has emerged as one of the largest presales of 2025. It merges Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) design with Proof-of-Work (PoW) for a system that balances speed with decentralization. It also supports EVM compatibility, letting developers launch Ethereum-based apps and contracts with ease. The presale has crossed $376 million, with BDAG priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29. Early participants from Batch 1 are already up more than 2,660%, and projections suggest the price could move toward $1 after listing, offering about a 36× jump. Adoption metrics are also compelling. The X1 mobile miner app has brought in more than 2.5 million users, while over 19,300 ASIC miners have been delivered, creating one of the most inclusive mining setups today. The project already counts more than 200,000 holders and a developer group of 4,500+ building 300 decentralized apps ahead of the mainnet. To build momentum further, BlockDAG launched a 200 ETH competition worth around $1 million. Those who expand their holdings during the presale can join for a chance to win, adding more excitement. With 20 exchange listings secured and plans for Coinbase and Gemini in motion, BlockDAG (BDAG) is positioned well. For anyone evaluating the top crypto presales, this is a clear standout as its framework and community are already established before trading begins. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Culture with Extra Features Maxi Doge takes inspiration from meme culture but adds plans that go beyond humor. While rooted in the same community energy that drove past meme coin surges, $MAXI aims to combine fun with a roadmap that includes staking, reward systems, and a small NFT marketplace. This gives it more depth than projects relying on memes alone. The presale has been set up to attract both casual buyers and early participants, using low barriers and frequent community activities. Strong social media engagement has boosted interest, and its identity resonates across different groups. Even though it is still in presale, Maxi Doge is getting attention by blending cultural relevance with modest utility features. For those who value both hype and long-term ideas, $MAXI stands out among the top crypto presales as a project mixing fun with potential staying power. 3. Snorter Bot ($SNORT): Designed for Fast Access Snorter Bot is focused on improving speed and ease of use in crypto. Its goal is to deliver low-cost, high-speed transactions paired with a clear interface that can work for experienced traders as well as newcomers. By building cross-chain compatibility, it is shaping a platform that connects with multiple networks while keeping costs efficient. The presale has drawn notice by offering rewards to early users and setting out a roadmap that includes incentives for active participation. This approach could help build a loyal user base that values both speed and perks. At today’s presale price, it presents an affordable entry before listing on exchanges. While the project still needs to prove itself, $SNORT’s balance of function and simplicity gives it appeal. For those reviewing the top crypto presales, Snorter Bot is a project that offers both utility and opportunity. 4. PepeNode ($PEPENODE): Viral Energy with Broader Goals PepeNode aims to harness meme-driven hype while adding plans for functional growth. Building around the viral Pepe theme, it uses community energy to drive attention while outlining a platform that could provide rewards and limited integration with decentralized projects. This approach allows it to ride the popularity of memes while adding extra features for users. Its presale has been made widely accessible, with low entry levels designed for broad participation. Online groups and meme communities have helped spread its reach, putting $PEPENODE in a position to stand out if the team follows through on its plans. Though not as advanced as larger presales, the project’s mix of meme strength and functional aims makes it notable. For those who like community-driven projects but want some added utility, $PEPENODE ranks among the top crypto presales worth watching in 2025. Closing Thoughts Presales offer early chances to join, but the strongest ones combine real adoption with clear paths forward. BlockDAG has already set itself apart, raising more than $376 million, attracting millions of users, thousands of developers, and launching a $1M competition to boost activity. Maxi Doge blends meme power with staking and NFT features. Snorter Bot targets speed, simplicity, and cross-chain links, while PepeNode mixes viral culture with light functional goals. For anyone searching the top crypto presales , these four show how hype and fundamentals can work together. BlockDAG especially stands out since it already has major funding, an active ecosystem, and multiple exchange listings in motion. If it reaches $1 after launch as analysts suggest, it could deliver some of the strongest results in 2025.

Two names drawing attention are Arbitrum (ARB) and XRP. Arbitrum’s charts show technical breakouts pointing to higher targets, while XRP stays in focus thanks to fresh updates on exchange activity and shifting positions among holders. Both tokens play important roles in the crypto space, giving analysts plenty to follow. But the real question for most buyers isn’t which coin makes the loudest headline; it’s which has staying power. In that search for the top crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet is making its mark. With a presale built around adoption, structured tokenomics, and proven demand, it offers something many projects lack: a design built to last. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Momentum Draws Trader Interest Arbitrum gained attention in August as bullish momentum lifted its price above key technical levels. Analysts highlight a breakout that opened targets as high as $1.20, giving it strength while other altcoins stall. This Arbitrum price momentum has traders suggesting it could spark renewed capital flow into Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, where ARB holds a lead. Its relevance goes beyond short-term moves. Arbitrum powers one of Ethereum’s largest scaling systems, handling fast and cheap transactions. With DeFi apps expanding and developers committed, ARB sits at the centre of the infrastructure conversation. If it sustains momentum toward higher levels, it could remain a strong candidate for the top crypto to buy now. Still, risks remain. $1.20 is a key target, and failure to hold support could trigger setbacks. Investors will need to weigh its technical signals against wider market trends. XRP News Highlights Market Uncertainty And Potential XRP continues to grab headlines, this time with Coinbase cutting its holdings by over 50%. Some took this as a negative, but analysts suggest it reflects risk management more than rejection. Even so, XRP’s price shows both resilience and hesitation. The bullish case points to Ripple’s improving legal clarity, which could attract institutions. Bears, however, argue that XRP’s inability to sustain breakouts remains a concern. These opposing views make XRP a battleground, yet its place among the biggest crypto assets ensures it stays relevant. For those deciding if XRP is the top crypto to buy right now, much depends on whether institutions expand adoption. Without new triggers, the token risks stagnation even with its strong reputation. Cold Wallet Presale Delivers Real Utility & ROI Potential Cold Wallet is offering something different: a presale tied to real-world function, not just hype. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, it has raised $6.3M and sold more than 740M tokens. Instead of relying on speculation, it rewards users directly. Every gas fee, swap, or transfer turns into cashback paid in $CWT, making everyday crypto use a source of return. This utility-first design sets it apart. Cold Wallet operates as a self-custody mobile app with no KYC, no waiting, and full control of assets. Planned Layer-2 integration will lower or even remove gas fees, making rewards instant and cost-free. Unlike meme-driven projects, Cold Wallet ties adoption to real benefits, ensuring users have reasons to keep engaging long term. Its tokenomics reinforce this structure: 40% allocated to presale, 25% to rewards, with team allocations locked for years. This reduces inflation risk and aligns growth with user participation. The presale’s 150-stage design ensures steady scaling, with early entrants enjoying the strongest ROI potential, up to 4,900%. Cold Wallet shows why structure matters. By turning costs into earnings and offering a sustainable model, it is positioning itself as the top crypto to buy right now, especially for those seeking value beyond hype. Final Outlook: Why Cold Wallet’s Design Sets It Apart Arbitrum’s momentum signals strength in Ethereum scaling, while XRP’s ongoing news proves its market presence. Both hold potential but rely on external triggers to deliver gains. Cold Wallet instead focuses on usability and reward mechanics. With $6.3M raised, 740M+ tokens sold, and cashback that grows with adoption, it is building long-term value from the ground up. For 2025, the best performers may be those designed for daily use, and Cold Wallet looks ready to lead that category.

50414699,561445,1755738048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50414699.jpeg,Argentina’s Capital Adopts Crypto For Tax Payments,https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-capital-adopts-crypto-for-tax-payments/,"Buenos Aires has switched on “BA Cripto,” a policy package that lets residents and businesses settle city taxes and administrative fees using cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Rolled out on Tuesday, August 19, 2025, the program covers municipal levies such as ABL (property tax), Patentes (vehicle tax), and Ingresos Brutos (turnover tax), as well as non-tax procedures like driver’s licenses and traffic fines, payable via a city QR flow. Buenos Aires Goes Crypto City Hall’s move is broader than a payments toggle. Officials unveiled four measures: adding crypto-linked activities to the city’s economic-activity nomenclator to simplify filings; excluding virtual-asset service providers (PSAVs) from certain bank-collection regimes under the turnover tax; shifting the taxable base for crypto trading from gross transaction value to the net spread; and enabling QR crypto payments for both taxes and administrative services. The government framed the package as a regulatory tune-up that reduces frictions while aligning taxation with how digital-asset markets actually operate. Mayor Jorge Macri presented the initiative as an institutional modernization designed to attract investment and make compliance easier. “The goal is for the City to be a world leader in crypto,” he said, adding: “We already have the human capital, and now we are building the tools by reducing bureaucracy to make taxpayer compliance easier and to support the arrival of new companies setting up here.” The remarks were delivered at The Slow Kale in Colegiales, a venue that accepts crypto payments. Macri also argued the package signals a friendlier posture toward the sector: “These measures ensure the crypto world sees that the City is increasingly friendly. The digital economy compels us to update and adapt with a modern, agile, efficient and intelligent State. We want talent to find a place to grow, innovate and lead without obstacles.” The backdrop is growing usage. According to city data cited at launch, roughly 10,000 people in Buenos Aires receive income from abroad via crypto or PayPal , and the use of PIX rails has been rising. Nationwide, Argentina counts “more than 10 million” crypto accounts—about 22% of Latin America’s total—figures the city says justify tailored rules and public-service rails that natively accommodate digital assets. For firms, the classification update matters because it gives crypto activities an explicit slot in the tax nomenclator, improving clarity “without fiscal cost” and easing cross-jurisdiction information matching. Excluding PSAVs from bank-collection regimes is intended to curb automatic withholdings that can tie up working capital, while the new spread-based tax base acknowledges the mismatch between high-volume, low-margin trading and a gross-receipts framework. Together, these steps amount to what the city calls a more “agile” and “transparent” environment for digital-asset businesses to operate in the capital. On the consumer side, the payment experience is meant to be straightforward: scan a city QR and pay the selected tax or fee with a compatible wallet. Officials said only some wallets currently support crypto payments, but a Buenos Aires–provided “aggregator” is in the works to let “neighbors and companies” pay “from any wallet, directly, faster, and simpler.” The government did not publish a technical spec or list of supported assets at launch. Hernán Lombardi, the city’s Economic Development Minister, cast the reforms as a recalibration of legal and tax treatment for digital assets. “These reforms mark a change in the legal and tax treatment of digital assets. Less bureaucracy, greater legal certainty, and clear rules will translate into more investment,” he said, noting the updated nomenclator will help “determine and clarify the activities of companies and individual crypto-asset users, and thus avoid withholdings that compromise the sector’s working capital.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.77 trillion.",Crypto News|Argentina|bitcoin|bitcoin news|Buenos Aires|crypto|crypto news|Crypto News Argentina,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 01:00:48

Expert Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-treasury-bubble-popping/,"In a thread on August 19, analyst Miles Deutscher argued that MicroStrategy’s market-implied net asset value (mNAV) premium—the core gear in Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin acquisition flywheel—has compressed sharply, weakening the feedback loop that helped the company outpace Bitcoin through most of the cycle. “Michael Saylor built the craziest BTC flywheel in history. But his buying power is starting to fade. The market is now asking one question: ‘Is the BTC treasury bubble finally popping?’” MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Premium Is Fading Deutscher grounds the discussion in how investors currently value MicroStrategy. “People often overlook that MicroStrategy has a legacy software business, which continues to generate revenue. However, MicroStrategy has essentially become a company whose valuation is primarily influenced by its BTC holdings. The entire system is powered by mNAV (Market-Implied NAV).” In practical terms, the mNAV multiple is the premium investors pay over the company’s look-through Bitcoin value to access leveraged BTC exposure via MSTR. “An mNAV of ~1.58x means the market is paying a 58% premium for their BTC.” According to Deutscher, that premium “was once a 3.4x mNAV” when Bitcoin was surging, but it has “now decreased to 1.58x. Demand is slowing down.” In other words, what had been a powerful flywheel—high premium enabling cheap equity issuance that funded more Bitcoin purchases, which in turn kept NAV rising and the premium elevated—now spins with much less torque. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts The Collapse Of Bitcoin In This Timeframe That shift intersected with a contentious corporate action. “Recently, Saylor sparked controversy by revealing that Strategy had revised its MSTR Equity ATM Guidance to offer greater ‘flexibility’ in executing its capital markets strategy.” The implication, Deutscher argues, is that greater issuance flexibility “may dilute shareholder value and increase financial risk tied to Bitcoin’s volatility.” He notes that “the market is quite divided” on the change. On the constructive side, he quotes @thedefivillain’s take—“Slower concentration of supply in Saylor’s hands,” “Greater leverage to justify mNAV,” and “Reduced buying pressure for BTC in dollar terms”—as reasons the revision could ultimately be benign. But critics worry about “the possibility of a ‘death spiral.’ The removal of the 2.5x mNAV safeguard for equity issuance may allow MicroStrategy to sell shares at lower valuations.” Reflexivity, in Deutscher’s telling, is the operative risk factor: “Reflexivity is a brutal force that operates in both directions.” A Hypothetical Scenario Deutscher then sets up a stress-test to illustrate how that reflexivity could bite if Bitcoin weakens and the premium compresses to parity. “If BTC’s price drops 20% and MicroStrategy’s mNAV multiple falls to 1.0x, the stock might plummet by 46.5%.” He walks through the arithmetic from a notional baseline of $115,000 per BTC, which on a 20% decline would fall to $92,000. On MicroStrategy’s “226,331 BTC,” he calculates that would put look-through NAV at $20.82 billion. To align an mNAV of exactly 1.0x, he backs into enterprise value and market cap under that scenario: “Starting with an enterprise value of $20.82 billion, we subtract MicroStrategy’s $2.2 billion in debt and add its $0.1 billion in cash. This calculation unveils the company’s market cap, hitting $18.72 billion, a significant pullback from its original $35 billion market cap.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Hinges On Trump’s Pick For Fed Chair: Analyst The conclusion he draws from the modeled path—BTC −20% to ~$92,000, mNAV → 1.0x, MSTR market cap −46.5%—is that MicroStrategy’s equity remains a leveraged instrument with an outcome path that can be materially worse than Bitcoin itself when the premium compresses. Beyond the scenario math, Deutscher links recent spot price action to changing marginal demand. “I think BTC’s recent weakness can be attributed to the market starting to price in reduced Saylor demand/tail potential risk of the revised ATM guidance.” In parallel, he highlights how the proliferation of spot ETFs erodes the original rationale for paying a large listed-company premium to own BTC “beta”: “Spot Bitcoin ETFs are plentiful now. Why would you pay a 58% premium for MSTR’s leveraged exposure when you can grab IBIT at a clean ~1.0x NAV?” By his framing, the mNAV premium itself “was indicative of the market’s view that MSTR was going to outperform BTC.” With that view fading, the premium looks less like an enduring structural feature and more like a belief-sensitive variable. “In my opinion, the MSTR premium is essentially a gamble. You’re betting on three fragile things: unwavering market confidence, open capital markets, and Saylor’s leadership. If any of those pillars start to wobble, the premium collapses.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,624.

The idea mirrors Amazon’s early move into cloud computing nearly two decades ago, when it began offering excess capacity to outside businesses. That experiment evolved into Amazon Web Services (AWS), now a multibillion-dollar powerhouse and a cornerstone of the modern internet. For OpenAI, the logic is similar. The company has poured resources into cutting-edge chips, servers, and cooling systems to power its large-scale AI workloads. Allowing others to rent that infrastructure could open the door for startups and smaller firms to access high-performance computing without building it themselves—while creating a lucrative business line for OpenAI. Still, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar emphasized the idea remains speculative. With demand for ChatGPT and other AI products soaring, OpenAI’s immediate priority is securing enough capacity for its needs. In a recent interview, Friar confirmed the company isn’t actively pursuing the plan yet but sees it as a possible opportunity in the future. CFO eyes infrastructure leasing down the road OpenAI has become good at building data centers tailored for artificial intelligence. This know-how could be productized. Friar said that OpenAI is trying to take more control of its infrastructure design instead of relying on external vendors , cautioning that if the company only purchased equipment from others, it would risk giving away its intellectual property. The company has raised tens of billions for ultrapowerful AI chips and facilities. Its Stargate project with SoftBank and Oracle promises to construct some of the largest data centers in the world, in the United States and beyond. Excitement is running high after CEO Sam Altman promised ambitious plans, saying that people should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on infrastructure shortly. He added that the company is working on an interesting new financial instrument to fund these mega-projects, though he did not provide further details. Until now, OpenAI has depended on Microsoft and the technology company Oracle to cover most of its infrastructure costs . But Friar said banks and private equity firms are now piling in, providing debt financing. In addition to debt, the company is considering innovative financing mechanisms. But even with such aspirations, OpenAI still loses money. Data centers and GPUs are very expensive. But growth is rapid. In July, the firm surpassed a $1 billion monthly revenue for the first time — buoyed by surging global demand for ChatGPT and its enterprise tools. Altman frames bold plans, warns of AI hype Despite his push for massive spending, Altman has also acknowledged that AI may be in a bubble. In an interview last week, he compared the current enthusiasm to the dot-com era, noting that smart people often go overboard on a kernel of truth. Still, expansion is moving ahead. The project, Stargate, is a $500 billion joint venture and is already starting with projects in the US, Norway, and the UAE. The aim is to secure AI capacity to a level no company has ever achieved. Altman has suggested we need 100 million AI GPUs to power future models. It could cost $3 trillion. For reference, that’s more than the GDPs of many countries. According to recent accounts, OpenAI is reportedly gearing up for a second stock sale. It would enable current and former employees to cash out their shares at an estimated valuation of around $500 billion. That would be almost double its last disclosed valuation of $300 billion, in a financing round by SoftBank. Investor appetite remains strong. OpenAI secured $41 billion in its latest round, exceeding its initial goal of $40 billion because of strong demand.

Among such a token is Mutuum Finance (MTU), causing massive frenzy among traders and DeFi participants alike. Over 15400 investors have invested in the project presale to date, and over $14.65 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already up to Stage 6 of Presale priced at $0.035. Stage 7 will be a 14.29% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance is arousing anticipations of a potential 50x rally from its $0.035 starting point, thus forming a gem in a market where well-established assets like Cardano may experience short-term consolidation. Cardano Price Outlook Cardano (ADA) currently trades at about $0.92, making slight intraday oscillations around a $0.92–$0.98 range as it consolidates at resistance levels without extreme movements. Market analysts indicate ADA is passing through a symmetrical triangle pattern, constricting between roughly $0.85 and $0.98, and this indicates that a breakout will happen soon—either to the $0.80 support or to a potential push to $1.10–$1.15 resistance, depending on the direction of the market. In this tranquil build-up, interest in Mutuum Finance remains present. Mutuum Finance Presale Proceeds to Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has completed Phase 5 of presale and proceeded to Phase 6, in which its tokens sell at $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has surpassed $14.65 million already and over 15400 holders have participated. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Partners with CertiK to Run $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is partnering with CertiK for its Bug Bounty Program. The reward pool of the program shall be $50,000 USDT. The program shall be rewarded under four categories, i.e. low, minor, major and critical. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) had reached a full audit by Certik for user funds security and blockchain integrity. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a $100,000 giveaway where 10 of its participants will be given $10,000 MUTM tokens worth. It has also made public that a leaderboard system will reward the top 50 token holders of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with a bonus. Mutuum Finance is a P2C and P2P lending protocol in which uses are in control of their funds. It is an end-to-end DeFi experience highly tailored to the customer’s requirements and more transparent, secure, and flexible compared to the centralized lending product. The project is gaining popularity as a DeFi project with the potential of delivering more returns than most of the established older altcoins. As Cardano (ADA) is hovering at $1, technical indicators are anticipating short-term stabilization with a window of opportunity for new DeFi platforms to gain popularity among investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking advantage of this, with Stage 6 presale at $0.035, over 15,400 participants, and raised funds of $14.65 million. Backed by a CertiK-audited bug bounty and a $100,000 community giveaway, along with its Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending dual model, MUTM is positioned for a possible 50x upside, and it’s one of the front-runners in a space where established altcoins such as ADA may lose steam. Early investors should find good returns if the project maintains its current momentum and adoption.

Among the highlights is Magic Cue, an intelligent assistant designed to make everyday tasks more seamless. The feature scans Gmail, Calendar, Messages, and other apps in real time to provide context-aware suggestions—reminders, quick replies, or relevant information. For instance, if you call an airline, Magic Cue can instantly recognize the number and pull up details about your upcoming flight from Gmail or Calendar. When a friend texts about dinner, the tool can check your availability, suggest a reply, and even include reservation information. This level of integration shows how Google is pushing AI beyond convenience, transforming it into a practical assistant capable of handling real-world scenarios . The Pixel 10 debuts Camera Coach for professional-grade photo guidance and real-time Voice Translate, further underscoring Google’s push to lead the smartphone AI race. Pixel 10 series puts privacy first while packing pro-level AI photography Google built Magic Cue to provide maximum privacy . Users’ data will never leave their phones unless they explicitly allow it, because all data remains stored in a secure enclave on their device. Similarly, apps won’t access any information that Magic Cue collects unless users permit them. The phones will also feature another AI tool, Camera Coach, that helps users take professional photos. The tool suggests the best photo angles, lighting conditions, and lens modes to capture high-quality images. Super Res Zoom on the Pro models allows users to zoom in on distant objects. It uses AI to enhance clarity and seamlessly merge multiple images to produce more detailed pictures. Google also made these advanced features accessible to different users by maintaining competitive pricing for the Pixel 10 series. The base model starts at $800, the Pixel 10 Pro at $1,000, the Pixel 10 Pro XL at $1,200, and the foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold at $1,800. The standard Pixel 10 models will be available in stores from August 28, and the foldable version on October 9. Google highlights AI features and improvements at event Google integrated the Gemini AI platform into the Pixel 10 series to allow users to access its interactive and proactive features. Take visual overlays, for example. With it, Gemini can recognize objects through the camera and point out helpful information like street signs while travelling or important details in documents. Another interactive tool, Gemini Live, can detect the tone of a user’s voice in conversation and provide more natural and personal replies. With these abilities, the Pixel 10 phones can provide more human-like interaction between users and their devices. Voice Translat can translate phone calls across multiple languages in real-time while preserving the natural tone of each speaker. Users don’t need third-party translation apps or awkward delays while interpreting conversations. The Pixel 10 series also includes Pixel Journal and other AI-driven productivity tools to help users organize their work, track personal goals, and manage everyday tasks more efficiently. There are more AI-powered tools across apps like Photos, Messages, and Gboard that allow users to edit images with natural language commands, draft messages or emails faster, and receive intelligent suggestions based on context. Google’s advanced features with the Pixel 10 series surpass Apple’s offerings, whose next-generation Siri is not expected until 2026. Analysts say Google’s steady integration of AI could have potential ripple effects on other Android devices like Samsung smartphones.

Litecoin is lining up for a breakout toward $175–$180, backed by strong wallet activity and record futures open interest. Avalanche is flashing bullish signals with a double-bottom and a huge surge in stablecoin and DEX volumes. While these setups look attractive, not every project relies on charts or catalysts. Cold Wallet is shaping its own future with a mobile-first, self-custody app that pays users for activity. With $6.3 million raised and more than 740 million tokens sold at $0.00998, Cold Wallet’s design offers everyday value in a way technical rallies alone cannot. Litecoin (LTC) Price Target: Signs of Breakout Strength Litecoin (LTC) is drawing attention as its technical and on-chain signals align. Futures open interest recently hit $1.26 billion, while active wallets have risen 12% month-on-month. Over 60% of LTC supply remains with long-term holders, a bullish sign of confidence. The network has also processed more than 250 million transactions, showing continued usage. On charts, LTC is holding just under $137–$138 resistance. Analysts believe a clean break could lift prices toward $150 soon and extend to $175–$180 by the end of August. Weekly indicators like the Supertrend have flipped bullish, and RSI readings are climbing toward overbought, hinting at an explosive move if volume supports. With broader crypto strength, LTC could even test $200 later this year. Avalanche Price Forecast: Ecosystem Growth Adds Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is building momentum after forming a bullish double-bottom near $15.60 and pushing above its 50-day EMA. The neckline sits at $27.40, and a breakout could send AVAX toward $40, a potential 65% move higher. Supporting this are real growth metrics: stablecoin volumes on Avalanche have surged 715% in just a month, while DEX activity and total value locked are also climbing. Dinari Global’s launch of tokenised U.S. stocks on Avalanche further boosts utility, adding real-world use cases. With both technical and ecosystem expansion driving it, AVAX is shaping up as one of the top crypto picks for 2025. Cold Wallet: Utility, Self-Custody, and Real Rewards Unlike coins that depend on hype or chart breakouts, Cold Wallet is building long-term value through usability. It is a self-custody, mobile-first wallet that removes onboarding hurdles, no external wallets or lengthy KYC needed. You control your keys, and the app is designed for everyday use. What sets it apart is its rewards system. Every action inside the app, swaps, bridging, paying gas fees, earns cashback in native CWT. This design flips costs into earnings, meaning the more you use it, the more you gain. The referral program adds another layer, rewarding both the inviter and the new user with cashback, creating compounding growth across the network. Currently in Stage 17 at $0.00998, Cold Wallet has raised $6.3 million and sold over 740 million tokens. Unlike speculative assets that need whales or news events to rally, Cold Wallet’s value expands through user activity. Adoption builds naturally, making it less dependent on outside sentiment. This blend of self-custody, access, and reward gives Cold Wallet a lasting edge. For those asking about the best crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet isn’t just another name on a chart. It’s a system that grows stronger with every user, aligning ownership with utility and financial benefit. The Final Verdict Litecoin is eyeing a breakout toward $175–$180, supported by strong fundamentals and rising activity. Avalanche shows promise with its double-bottom and real ecosystem expansion. Both coins are attractive plays in 2025. But Cold Wallet offers something different: a user-driven system where self-custody meets rewards. With $6.3 million raised and over 740 million tokens sold, its model creates lasting value by rewarding everyday usage. For those weighing options, Cold Wallet may be the best crypto to buy now, driven not by speculation, but by a design that pays back its community.

Why BlockDAG, Stellar, Ondo & Hyperliquid Are 2025’s Big Shots!",https://thecoinrise.com/looking-for-the-next-altcoins-to-explode-why-blockdag-stellar-ondo-hyperliquid-are-2025s-big-shots/,"The crypto market is gearing up for what could be its strongest cycle yet, and attention is shifting to the next altcoin to explode before valuations take off. This time it’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum, newer, utility-driven projects with strong adoption are lining up for center stage. Getting in early could mean the difference between modest profits and life-changing returns. Four names are standing out right now: BlockDAG, the presale powerhouse with staggering ROI potential; Stellar (XLM), showing strong technical setups; Ondo Finance (ONDO), leading the way in tokenized assets; and Hyperliquid (HYPE), setting trading volume records in DeFi. Together, these projects highlight innovation, adoption-ready ecosystems, and momentum that could dominate 2025 headlines. For those scanning the horizon for the next altcoin to explode, these four deserve top priority. 1. BlockDAG: 25 Billion Coins Sold Before Launch! BlockDAG’s presale is moving fast, with each batch bringing higher prices and stronger demand. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG coins are available for $0.0276, with analysts calling for a $1 launch value, an eye-catching 36x upside. Buyers from Batch 1 have already locked in gains of 2,660% compared to today’s rate, and momentum is far from slowing down. The numbers are impressive, $378 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a rapidly expanding base of holders. BlockDAG ’s appeal isn’t just its presale, though. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design allows lightning-fast, secure, and scalable transactions while staying decentralized. Adoption is already underway with 19,000 ASIC miners sold and more than 2.5 million active users on the X1 mobile miner app. Developers are busy ahead of mainnet, ensuring utility from day one. Once Batch 29 sells out, the entry point jumps instantly, making hesitation costly. History shows the next altcoin to explode usually rewards early movers, and BlockDAG looks primed to be one of 2025’s breakout names. 2. Stellar: Eyes on $0.50 Breakout Level Stellar is showing real momentum after climbing 12.4% this week, holding between $0.43–$0.45. All eyes are on the $0.50 resistance, where an inverse head-and-shoulders and bullish engulfing candle pattern signal a potential breakout. Analysts predict that a push past $0.50 could trigger a rally of 43%, targeting $0.60–$0.77. On-chain signals confirm the trend, with Stellar’s TVL surging nearly 80% to $152 million, highlighting growing adoption in cross-border transactions. Still, maintaining volume and support above $0.50 is key for sustained momentum. With solid fundamentals backing its technical strength, Stellar stands out as the next altcoin to explode for traders looking for short-term upside. 3. Ondo Finance: $309M Daily Volume Boosts Liquidity Ondo Finance is steadily building its position as a leader in the tokenized asset sector. Priced around $1.02, ONDO is trading with $309 million in daily volume, a 26% jump in just one day. The team is scaling aggressively with its $250M Ondo Catalyst initiative, targeted acquisitions, and new alliances that expand the Global Markets Alliance to 25 members. These moves strengthen its Real-World Asset (RWA) ecosystem, giving it a foothold in what many expect to be a trillion-dollar market. While its weekly chart looks steady, ONDO’s long-term setup is what’s driving confidence. For those chasing future growth in finance, Ondo is among the clearest picks for the next altcoin to explode. 4. Hyperliquid: RSI and MACD Signal Breakout Hyperliquid is shaking up DeFi like few others. On August 15, it smashed records with $29 billion in daily trading volume and $7.7M in fees generated. HYPE has gained 19% this week, trading at $48.57, just 1.1% under its all-time high. Indicators like an RSI of 63 and a strong MACD are pointing toward a move to $55. Meanwhile, institutional involvement is scaling fast. TVL now sits at $610M, with inflows jumping from $21M in June to $349M in July, showing accelerating adoption. With record-setting trading and liquidity, Hyperliquid has carved out its place as the next altcoin to explode, riding the wave of DeFi scalability. Final Thoughts In a fast-changing market, catching the next altcoin to explode before mainstream attention hits can mean the biggest rewards. BlockDAG is leading the way with unmatched presale traction and scalable design. Stellar is closing in on a breakout with strong technical and adoption growth. Ondo Finance is securing its role in the tokenization boom, and Hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of DeFi growth. All four combine innovation, adoption, and strong momentum, key ingredients for high-performing digital assets in 2025. While risks always exist, aligning early with these projects could be transformative as the next bull run gathers steam. The post Looking For The Next Altcoins to Explode?

Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ The total ranks among the largest weekly inflows seen recently, CoinShares data shows. Prices rose, but the main driver was money moving into funds rather than a broad retail rush. Concentrated Flows From A Single Product Based on reports from CoinShares, almost all of the inflows came through one provider. The US accounted for $3.73 billion, almost the entire week’s total. Canada added $33.7 million, Hong Kong close to $21 million, and Australia $12 million. By contrast, Brazil and Sweden recorded outflows of $10.6 million and $50 million. Market participants say the bulk of the cash was funneled into a single iShares product, which helps explain how a relatively narrow set of flows moved overall AUM so sharply. Ethereum Draws The Most Money Ethereum attracted the lion’s share of last week’s inflows at $2.87 billion, or 77% of the total. That brings year-to-date net inflows into ETH to about $11 billion. Ethereum now makes up nearly 30% of assets under management, versus Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Bitcoin’s weekly intake was $552 million. Other moves included Solana taking $176.5 million and XRP adding $126 million, while Litecoin and Ton showed small outflows of $0.4 million and $1 million, respectively. These numbers point to a clear shift in where institutional money is parked this week. Corporate Holdings And Supply Notes Reports have disclosed that more than 16 companies have added Ethereum to their balance sheets, according to CryptoQuant. Together they hold about 2.45 million ETH, valued at roughly $11 billion, and those coins are effectively out of circulation while locked in treasuries or cold storage. It’s worth noting that Ethereum does not have a fixed supply like Bitcoin; about one million ETH was added to supply last year, and supply dynamics can vary with network activity. Watch Futures And Large Holders Futures open interest sits near $38 billion, a sizeable figure that raises the chance of swift price moves when positions are closed. Related Reading: Cardano Climbs To 8th, Pushing Dogecoin And TRON Down The Ranks Large, concentrated holders and sudden shifts in futures positions have shown they can push prices sharply in either direction. For now, this is a flow-driven event more than a broad retail surge. If the same product keeps taking in large sums, it will keep adding upward pressure. At the same time, thin liquidity and big positions can flip gains into losses fast. Investors and traders should keep an eye on weekly fund flows, futures open interest, and on-chain movements to see whether the trend spreads beyond a few big buyers.

The purchases, made through the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), highlight Ark’s conviction in digital asset infrastructure even as broader crypto stocks tumbled. According to Ark’s latest filing, the fund acquired 356,346 shares of Bullish and 150,908 shares of Robinhood. This marks the third consecutive trading day Ark boosted its Robinhood position, following earlier buys of $14 million on Monday and $9 million last Friday. The moves expand Ark’s exposure to platforms shaping the future of trading and digital finance. Bullish and Robinhood Slide Amid Market Sell-Off Despite Ark’s heavy buying, both stocks ended sharply lower on the day. Bullish dropped 6.09% to $59.51, slipping an additional 3.24% in after-hours trading, while Robinhood fell 6.54% to $107.50 and lost another 1.23% post-market. The sell-off wasn’t isolated. Other crypto-linked equities also suffered, with Coinbase down 5.82%, Galaxy Digital plunging 10.06%, Strategy sliding 7.43%, and Circle off 4.49%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.46% as investors pulled back ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where policy signals are expected to shape market sentiment. A Strategic Bet on Crypto’s Long-Term Growth Ark’s latest move builds on a $172 million allocation to Bullish last week, when the Cayman Islands-based exchange made its highly anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange. With Ark now holding more than 1.1 million Bullish shares valued at roughly $73.85 million, the firm is betting big on the platform’s role in the evolution of crypto markets. Similarly, Robinhood has become one of Ark’s most consistent crypto-adjacent holdings. The recent spree increases its share of ARKK’s portfolio to over 4%, highlighting Ark’s belief in the platform’s long-term potential despite short-term volatility. Wood’s investment strategy mirrors confidence in crypto’s ongoing institutional adoption, as firms like Gemini, OKX, and Kraken explore IPOs. Ark also maintains significant positions in Circle and Coinbase, further engraving its role as one of Wall Street’s most vocal champions of digital assets. As volatility shakes out weaker hands, Ark’s contrarian bets may position it to capitalize if crypto markets rebound, raising the question: is this a bold gamble, or a long game in the market?

The PAC, named the Digital Freedom Fund, openly aligns with Republicans. Its mission is to defeat Democrats and bolster Republican efforts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The Winklevoss twins contributed 188.45 BTC, roughly $21.5 million, to launch the fund. Tyler Winklevoss said the donation will support candidates who champion “President Trump’s crypto agenda” in primaries and midterm races. The brothers warned that a Democratic takeover of the House or Senate could threaten Trump’s initiatives. Tyler suggested that Democrats, based on past actions, might resort to tactics he described as “bad-faith,” including impeachments and lawsuits. Their policy priorities focus on advocating for a light-touch, regulation-lite “skinny” crypto bill, blocking the creation of a US central bank digital currency, and ensuring protections for developers to build open-source tools without liability risks safely. The Winklevosses also emphasized the need for a “Bitcoin and Crypto Bill of Rights” to safeguard fundamental principles such as self-custody, peer-to-peer transfers, and clear ownership rights. For them, these measures are more than policy—they represent the foundation of what they call an “American Golden Age.” Winklevoss twins break from bipartisan crypto lobbying The decision sets them apart from much of the crypto industry. Others, like Fairshake, which raised over $300 million in 2024, have tried to remain bipartisan, backing Republicans and pro-crypto Democrats. The Winklevoss twins, however, have taken a different route. They have explicitly tied their new PAC to Trump’s reelection campaign and Republican victories, convinced that a GOP-led Congress is the only path to achieving their goals. Their hardline approach signals a shift in crypto politics. While many executives still frame their lobbying as “agnostic,” the influence of major players increasingly mirrors the tightening grip of Trump-era politics, as he nears the close of his second—and possibly final—term. Even figures like Mr. Fox, once a critic of Bitcoin, now embrace it as part of his economic vision. Cameron and Tyler were among the first industry leaders to throw their support behind Trump for 2024, months before others followed. That early loyalty is now being rewarded with political clout and financial backing. Winklevoss brothers turn Bitcoin into political muscle The $21 million Bitcoin gift is among the biggest individual crypto contributions in the history of digital-currency contributions to political causes. It reflects how much the industry is now invested in shaping Washington’s course. Leaders in crypto had long been people who operate at the fringes of politics, quietly lobbying and donating when the time called for it. The move amounts to a new level of ambition and an acknowledgment that digital wealth can be used as political capital. At the same time, the plan comes with major risks. By so blatantly allying themselves with Republicans and President Trump, the Winklevoss brothers are helping to make cryptocurrency a partisan issue. That is a dangerous path for many in the industry. But, though the Republicans have adopted a pro-Bitcoin stance, some democrats are friendly to innovation and blockchain-based initiatives. Alienating them might box in the industry if political power changes. The Digital Freedom Fund is poised to receive its first real exam in the 2026 midterms. If it can help the party win Republican victories, it could help build momentum for moves to loosen regulations, ban a U.S. international digital currency, and protect developers and investors. If it fails, it may reveal deep divisions among the crypto community, diminishing the industry’s power in Washington.

For years, it traded for virtually nothing—fractions of a cent—before the market suddenly turned its attention to the coin. The real turning point came in early 2021, when Dogecoin surged from around $0.02 to nearly $0.74 in just a few months. That explosive rally delivered over 3,600% gains , fueled by retail enthusiasm, community power, and mainstream cultural momentum. What DOGE taught us: Timing and narrative drive exponential gains Dogecoin’s breakout proved that timing is everything in crypto. Infrastructure mattered less than narrative, and those who entered early saw their positions multiply dramatically. DOGE’s rise underscored how branding, community, and sentiment can ignite growth faster than traditional fundamentals. It set the stage for meme-driven assets to dominate headlines and capture capital flows during peak speculative cycles. Who is poised for the next narrative surge As Ethereum and Bitcoin consolidate at higher ranges, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a new contender with parallels to DOGE’s early trajectory. Currently in presale, the project is building momentum before broader awareness and tier-1 exchange listings arrive. What makes it distinct is its politically infused branding , giving it cultural weight beyond the crypto world. Each presale round has sold out quickly, showing strong demand from investors who see this as a second chance at catching an early-stage moonshot. Breaking through DOGE’s ceiling Some investors are going even further, openly betting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could surpass Dogecoin’s historic records. Their argument rests on scale and timing: DOGE exploded during a period when meme coins were new, but MAGACOIN enters a market already conditioned to chase culturally branded assets. If DOGE could reach a market cap in the tens of billions without a clear utility, many argue a politically infused token with global recognition has the potential to push even higher . The presale’s rapid pace has only reinforced this view, with traders framing MAGACOIN FINANCE as not just the next DOGE – but the project that might finally outdo it. Market rotation: Where capital flows next Crypto cycles often follow a familiar pattern: Bitcoin rallies, Ethereum stabilizes, and liquidity seeks out new stories with high-upside potential. This rotation is where meme-driven and culturally branded projects thrive. With the market primed for a new speculative wave, capital is already starting to circle around tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that combine hype with strong community traction. Conclusion: A new altcoin chapter inspired by DOGE’s legacy Dogecoin’s rise from near-worthless meme to household name showed the power of timing and culture in crypto markets. Today, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself with similar ingredients – strong branding, community backing, and explosive presale momentum .

50418169,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79447,1755743621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Record Performance Overshadows Ethereum After Recent Price Crash,https://timestabloid.com/magacoin-finances-record-performance-overshadows-ethereum/,"Ethereum’s sharp pullback last week has reignited debate about whether the second-largest cryptocurrency has already reached the limits of its near-term growth. After climbing toward the mid-$4,700 range earlier in August, ETH tumbled back below $4,300 in a matter of hours, erasing billions in market value. This rapid downturn came despite steady ETF inflows and long-term forecasts placing Ethereum between $6,000 and $8,000 over the next cycle. While committed holders point to resilience, shorter-term traders are questioning whether the same outsized gains that once defined ETH’s rallies are still achievable in such a mature market. This uncertainty is pushing capital further down the risk curve, toward early-stage projects where exponential upside remains possible. Analysts note that the familiar rotation cycle appears to be repeating: Bitcoin rallies first, Ethereum follows with strong but measured gains, and then liquidity begins flowing into smaller-cap tokens with higher risk but greater potential rewards. With Ethereum now facing heavy resistance near its recent highs, attention is shifting to projects that can capture the narrative of the next wave. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most discussed names. Still in presale, the project is benefiting from its timing – offering investors an entry point before listings – and from its unique positioning at the crossroads of crypto and politics. Analysts argue that politically-branded tokens carry additional momentum in an election cycle, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has leveraged that backdrop to build rapid community traction. Unlike Ethereum, which is battling overhead resistance, this project is being positioned by early supporters as a ground-floor opportunity with far greater headroom for growth. Ethereum’s limitations become clear Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts, but size is becoming a double-edged sword. Pushing ETH from its current levels to $6,000 represents a return of under 50%, far below the outsized gains traders saw in earlier cycles. Even with network upgrades and institutional adoption, Ethereum’s trajectory reflects a maturing asset, strong, but no longer explosive. This is why investors often begin to rotate into alternative tokens once Ethereum stalls. Smaller projects provide the volatility and growth potential that established coins can’t replicate, particularly as presales and early listings draw huge capital. Amid this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a unique position by combining presale momentum with political branding that resonates far beyond traditional crypto audiences. Unlike many presales that fade after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly developed an active and expanding community, with each round selling out faster than the last. Its roadmap emphasizes features designed to reward holders long-term, creating a stronger foundation than typical launches. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s narrative is aligning perfectly with the broader market cycle. As traders look for the next 10,000% play while mainstream attention grows, projects with clear branding, rapid adoption, and utility-based mechanics stand out. In this environment, MAGACOIN is increasingly seen as a potential outperformer – mirroring the early excitement of breakout tokens in previous cycles but with added cultural relevance that gives it wider reach. Market outlook favors rotation If Ethereum continues to consolidate, capital is likely to keep moving into smaller-cap projects with aggressive growth potential. The same pattern played out in 2017 and 2021, when altcoins delivered historic runs after the majors slowed. With MAGACOIN FINANCE building both hype and community infrastructure, it could be one of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation. Institutional money may keep flowing into Ethereum, but retail investors searching for transformative gains are now scanning for the next breakout. That divergence of strategies is what often fuels dramatic surges in promising altcoins. Conclusion: The early-stage edge Ethereum will likely remain a pillar of the crypto ecosystem, but its growth ceiling is becoming clearer. For investors seeking exponential upside, the conversation has shifted toward newer names with political resonance and strong community energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies those qualities, and its rapid momentum suggests it could deliver the kind of breakout that defined past market cycles. With analysts eyeing a potential 10,000% upside before late-stage euphoria sets in, the project is capturing attention as a serious alternative to large-cap consolidation plays.

Our goal is to support President Trump and his Administration’s efforts to continue to usher in America’s Golden Age.” Winklevoss Twins Back Republican Causes The Winklevosses have been long-time vocal members of the Republican Party, backing U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The duo donated $5 million to crypto-focused super PAC Fairshake and $2 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign. Most recently, Politico reported that the twins pressed Trump to reject Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman nominee Brian Quintenz despite Tyler praising his nomination earlier this year. “Congratulations Brian,” Tyler said in a February X post. “Well deserved. Great choice for crypto and for America.” The Winklevoss brothers’ $21 million Bitcoin donation marks their latest effort to influence U.S. crypto policy, reinforcing their support for Trump’s agenda and signaling continued engagement in shaping the political landscape around digital assets.

50419091,561500,1755745243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50419091.jpeg,Will Bitcoin Beat Every Asset Class? Bitwise Says Institutions Are Taking Notice,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-beat-every-asset-class-bitwise-institutions/,"Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios is continuing to evolve, with new research from Bitwise Asset Management suggesting the asset could become the strongest-performing major investment class in the years ahead. According to a preview of the firm’s forthcoming Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), Bitwise expects Bitcoin to deliver an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% over the next 10 years while experiencing gradually declining volatility . The report, authored by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, frames Bitcoin not as an opportunistic play but as a maturing asset that is increasingly being considered a core portfolio component. Hougan noted that the launch and adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked a turning point, prompting large investment platforms and allocators to begin requesting long-term models for Bitcoin alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Hougan explained that long-term capital market assumptions serve as the foundation for how major financial institutions design portfolios. Each year, firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock release detailed outlooks that guide asset allocation strategies . For the first time in 2025, professional investors have begun requesting that Bitcoin be included in these frameworks, with Bitwise reporting 12 such inquiries this year compared to none in previous years. “The fact that they’re now asking for long-term capital market assumptions means that they’ve shifted their view: It’s no longer a one-off for the fringes of the portfolio; it’s starting to be considered for the core,” Hougan said in the memo. He attributed this change to greater accessibility through regulated ETFs and approval by large account platforms managing trillions in client assets. Bitwise also emphasized that Bitcoin’s path toward institutional recognition has been gradual, requiring both regulatory clarity and infrastructure improvements . The launch of spot ETFs in January 2024 created a new on-ramp for traditional allocators, and subsequent approvals across national platforms have since accelerated the process. Hougan described the transition as occurring “brick by brick,” as Bitcoin gains a foothold in professional investment strategies. Outlook for the Next Decade Looking ahead, Bitwise forecasts that BTC will not only outperform but stand apart from traditional assets in terms of expected returns. The firm projects a 28.3% CAGR over the next decade, significantly higher than the long-term expectations placed on equities, bonds, and private credit by leading Wall Street institutions. At the same time, while volatility is expected to remain elevated relative to other asset classes, Bitwise anticipates a steady decline as market depth expands and liquidity continues to improve. The implications of such a forecast extend beyond performance projections. A consistent inclusion of BTC in LTCMAs could formalize its role in balanced portfolios, shaping how pensions, endowments, and wealth managers approach diversification. Hougan cautioned that while risks remain, the framework is designed to give professional allocators a basis for strategic decision-making rather than a speculative outlook.

Plenty of projects appear promising, but only a select few combine technology, user activity, and strong positioning to stand out. As the next market rally takes shape, those spotting opportunities early could capture some of the biggest gains. This year, four projects are commanding serious attention. BlockDAG is preparing for one of the most anticipated launches of 2025 after a record-breaking presale. Binance Coin is hovering near its all-time high with momentum building from institutional backing. Uniswap is rolling out trading upgrades to sharpen its lead in the DeFi space. Hyperliquid is setting new benchmarks in on-chain trading with record-breaking volumes. Together, they show how different strategies, early adoption or established dominance, can play out in today’s crypto market. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Beast Nears $600M Target! BlockDAG is introducing a Layer-1 framework built on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) merged with Proof-of-Work (PoW), plus full EVM compatibility. This design delivers high-speed transactions while maintaining the security of PoW and allows developers to run Ethereum-style smart contracts. Its presale has already generated over $378 million, selling 25 billion BDAG coins across 29 batches, aiming for a $600 million cap. Early Batch 1 buyers have seen 2,660% returns compared to the Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Even current participants could see an 81% uplift if the launch price hits $0.05. With some analysts suggesting a possible move toward $1, the buzz continues to grow. The project’s community and ecosystem are already well-established. Over 2.5 million users are actively mining daily through the X1 Mobile Miner App. A demo trading tool is live to help users prepare before the official rollout. More than 4,500 developers are contributing across 300+ decentralized apps, and 19,000+ mining rigs have been sold. The project already counts 200,000 holders and is targeting listings on 20 exchanges, with Coinbase and Gemini seen as key goals. For anyone eyeing early-stage momentum with tangible progress, BlockDAG stands out as one of the best cryptos for the future in 2025. 2. Binance Coin: Nearing ATH With Strong Liquidity Binance Coin (BNB) currently trades around $850.77, moving between $827.09 and $868.18. In mid-August, it set fresh highs of $864–$870, underpinned by strong trading activity. The coin also received a boost from Abu Dhabi’s MGX, which injected $2 billion, while ETF speculation is adding fuel to the rally. Over the past month, BNB is up 18% and has climbed 54% over the year, ranking among the strongest large-cap performers in 2025. Its strength comes from being central to the Binance ecosystem, powering fee payments and acting as the platform’s base currency. Even though some trading volumes have shown slight dips, its liquidity depth and extensive user activity keep BNB in high demand. Analysts now point to a potential $1,000 milestone if altcoin enthusiasm holds steady. With utility, scale, and consistent demand on its side, Binance Coin continues to be viewed as one of the best cryptos for the future, especially for those who value stability combined with upside potential. 3. Uniswap: UNI Aims for $20 Breakout Uniswap (UNI) is priced at about $11.03 after slipping 8–9% over two trading days. Despite the short-term dip, the coin’s broader 2025 trend remains positive, with $8–$9 acting as reliable support. Analysts suggest that if UNI breaks $14.50, the next rally could take it toward $19–$20 in the short term, and even as high as $27–$30 with sustained momentum. That leaves its current range attractive for those looking for a rebound play. The platform’s biggest upgrade this year, Flashblocks pre-confirmation on Unichain, has slashed swap times to around 200 milliseconds. This makes trading nearly as fast as centralized exchanges, an important edge for DeFi adoption. Combined with Uniswap’s reputation as a primary hub for token launches and ICO entries, this puts UNI in a strong position. For traders focused on liquidity, speed, and influence in the decentralized market, Uniswap still earns its place as one of the best crypto for the future. 4. Hyperliquid: Whale Activity Fuels Growth Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is trading near $48.57, just under its July peak of $49.75. Recently, the platform smashed records with $29 billion in daily trading volume and $7.7 million in fees earned in a single session. This wave of activity was supported by inflows such as Galaxy Digital’s $125 million USDC allocation for hedging strategies and another wallet’s purchase of 466,000 HYPE plus 2.16 million Fartcoin within hours. The result has pushed total value locked to roughly $610 million. The network is built on its own Layer-1 with HyperBFT consensus and HyperEVM, enabling sub-second finality and high-performance on-chain order books. This setup brings the efficiency of centralized trading while staying decentralized. With technical signals suggesting a potential move toward $55 and steady whale accumulation, Hyperliquid is showing both staying power and growth prospects. For those drawn to high-speed DeFi platforms, HYPE remains one of the best cryptos for the future. The Bottom Line These four projects highlight different paths to growth. BlockDAG is still in presale, yet already shows huge traction across users, developers, and planned exchange listings. Binance Coin is nearing highs backed by institutional demand. Uniswap is strengthening its role in DeFi with faster swaps. Hyperliquid is scaling decentralized trading to record-breaking levels. Spotting the best crypto for the future often means diversifying between early-stage projects with explosive upside and established players offering steady growth. In 2025, blending picks like BlockDAG, BNB, Uniswap, and Hyperliquid could capture both short-term opportunities and longer-term resilience in the crypto space.

Multiple projects are seeing strong attention. Some are rising because of active communities, others because of new use cases or exciting presale results. Right now, four names are leading the discussion: Cold Wallet (CWT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Cold Wallet is pushing forward with a clear presale plan and real-world features, while DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE keep pulling in huge numbers through trading activity and loyal followings. From meme-driven appeal to secure wallet tech, each project brings a unique angle. For anyone deciding which crypto to buy now, this mix offers different paths to possible growth and strong engagement worth tracking. 1. Cold Wallet: Presale Power with Real Features Cold Wallet is charging ahead in its presale, already at Stage 17 out of 150. The project has raised $6.32 million and sold more than 749.33 million CWT, showing rising demand. Unlike many presales that stay stuck in planning, Cold Wallet already has a live app on Android and iOS. It is fully functional, security-checked by Hacken, and currently under CertiK review. This allows people to try the product before the coin even lists. At the presale price of $0.00998, the gap to the confirmed launch price of $0.3517 leaves a huge upside. That means a possible 37× return, or about 3,600%, for those who get in now. Stage 1 buyers at $0.007 could be looking at gains as high as 4,900% if the numbers hold. Utility is built into the design. Holders get CWT cashback on gas fees, swaps, and ramps, without any need for staking or lockups. On top of that, Cold Wallet bought Plus Wallet for $270 million, instantly gaining access to two million active users. Referral rewards make it even sweeter, with USDT payouts and future CWT rewards offered. The mix of a working app, a fast-growing user base, and strong presale results makes Cold Wallet one of the standout picks for August. With both entry potential and real-world usage, it is high on the list of answers to which crypto to buy now. 2. Dogecoin: Meme Legend Still in Play Dogecoin remains one of the most well-known meme coins in circulation. Right now, DOGE trades at about $0.199, with a market cap of $28.6 billion and daily trading over $1.2 billion. It has ticked up around 3% in the past 24 hours. Its charm is not only in memes. DOGE is widely used for tipping, online shopping, and payments, which keeps it moving across markets daily. Recent tweaks to the network have cut fees and improved speed. DOGE may not have the hype of a new presale, but it offers deep liquidity and a huge community. Those two factors have powered massive runs in the past. With meme coins still active this season, DOGE holds its spot as a top choice for those who like volatility and fast trades. For those debating which crypto to buy now, DOGE’s liquidity and staying power give it ongoing relevance. 3. Shiba Inu: Expanding the Ecosystem Shiba Inu trades close to $0.00002185, holding a market cap of about $12.9 billion and daily volumes near $6.34 million. SHIB is up about 4% in the past day, pushed by strong trading and progress in its ecosystem. The project is moving beyond meme status thanks to Shibarium, a Layer-2 network that reduces costs and speeds up activity. This upgrade also makes space for more decentralized apps to build on it. Another feature boosting SHIB is its burn program, which steadily cuts supply. Fewer coins in circulation over time can help support price stability. Combined with DeFi activity and community-driven projects, SHIB is showing it can do more than ride on hype. While its chart still reacts strongly to sentiment, Shiba Inu’s growth plans and supply control give it appeal. For those asking which crypto to buy now, SHIB is worth watching because it blends meme strength with actual ecosystem use. 4. Pepe: Volume Keeps It Hot Pepe is currently trading near $0.000012, with a market cap of $5.1 billion and daily trade volume at around $1.5 billion. In just one day, it jumped 5–8%, powered by steady demand and meme coin excitement. Its large liquidity and steady trading base keep it competing in a crowded market. Analysts are split on what’s next. Some think PEPE could dip toward $0.0000096, while others expect a possible push higher if social buzz picks up again. For short-term traders, this makes it a prime pick because of constant price swings. Its mix of strong branding, quick moves, and high liquidity keeps it visible. For those wondering which crypto to buy now, PEPE still pulls heavy attention and remains on the shortlist. Final Takeaway Cold Wallet, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe each bring different strengths this August. Cold Wallet combines strong presale results, real cashback utility, and millions of new users from its Plus Wallet purchase. DOGE still benefits from unmatched brand awareness and daily use. SHIB is working to expand with Shibarium and its burn model, giving it both meme power and growth steps. PEPE keeps the action lively with heavy trade volumes and constant price shifts. Each option has its own level of risk, but all are pulling strong attention in August 2025. Watching them closely could help time the next move. For anyone asking which crypto to buy now , these four names deserve a spot on the radar.

The asset continues to hold above $0.35, reflecting steadiness when compared to other major altcoins. On a longer time frame, TRON remains in an upward trend, posting a 4.7% gain in the last two weeks. This performance stands out against a backdrop of volatility across the broader cryptocurrency market. Analysts suggest that part of this resilience may be tied to TRX’s relative strength against Bitcoin (BTC). Market data indicates that while most leading altcoins have shown weakness in their BTC pairs, TRON has demonstrated consistent momentum. This divergence has drawn closer attention from traders and investors seeking assets that maintain performance during corrective phases in the crypto sector. Related Reading: TRON’s Futures Map Says “Not Overheated” — Could Another Rally Be Coming? TRX Outperforms Altcoins in BTC Pairs According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk, TRON has outpaced other major altcoins in weekly BTC pair performance. The TRX/BTC ratio recorded a 2.66% increase, while ETH/BTC remained nearly flat at 0.02%, XRP/BTC dropped by 2.28%, and SOL/BTC rose by just 0.85%. This distinction suggests stronger market demand for TRX compared to its peers. The analyst explained that TRON’s sustained performance in its BTC pair highlights growing investor interest and resilience at a time when other altcoins continue to struggle. “While most altcoins continue to face uncertainty in their BTC pairs, TRON stands out with consistent positive momentum, suggesting stronger demand and resilience,” Crazzyblockk noted. He further added that monitoring TRX’s strength against Bitcoin could provide signals of broader capital rotation toward TRON, especially if the trend continues over the coming weeks. TRON Network Expands as USDT Adoption Surges Beyond price performance, the TRON network has seen notable growth in its role as a leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Arab Chain, highlighted that TRON has consolidated its position as the primary network for USDT transactions. From January to August 2025, the number of cumulative addresses receiving USDT on TRON surged from about 5 million to over 35 million. This expansion shows TRON’s increasing use case for remittances and digital payments, supported by its low-cost and high-speed infrastructure. While the number of addresses may not precisely reflect individual user counts, the steady increase points toward broad adoption across exchanges, wallets, and decentralized applications. Arab Chain observed that the consistent rise indicates genuine demand and organic network growth, with new participants entering the ecosystem rather than merely reusing existing accounts. The trend also points to a maturing ecosystem for TRX as a central hub for stablecoin flows. The analyst notes that the platform’s ability to capture a large share of the stablecoin market reinforces its strategic role in the wider cryptocurrency sector.

DBS said Thursday in a release that it will distribute the instruments through local Singapore exchanges ADDX, DigiFT and HydraX, marking its first time offering tokenized products to accredited and institutional investors outside its own client base. The debut product is a crypto-linked participation note that pays out in cash when digital asset prices rise, while limiting downside exposure. Structured notes traditionally carry minimum investments of $100,000 and are often customized, making them non-fungible. By tokenizing each instrument into $1,000 units, DBS said the securities become fungible and easier to trade, offering greater flexibility for portfolio management. Demand for such instruments has been strong as investors seek to incorporate advanced investment strategies in their digital asset portfolios, the bank said in a release. In the first half of 2025, DBS clients executed over $1 billion of trades involving these instruments, with trade volumes growing almost 60% from Q1 2025 to Q2 2025. The bank sees this as particularly useful for family offices and professional investors, which have grown rapidly in Singapore. The number of single-family offices in the city-state topped 2,000 in 2024, up 43% year on year, it said in a release. The move comes as Singapore deepens its role as a hub for tokenized finance. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been advancing industry pilots through Project Guardian , which explores tokenization of assets across fixed income, FX and funds, while developing cross-border infrastructure like Global Layer One to pool global liquidity. DBS has been one of the most active banks participating in these initiatives, often using permissioned blockchains for pilots before expanding into public chains. While the initial focus is on crypto-linked notes, DBS said it will also tokenize more traditional equity- and credit-linked notes. “Asset tokenization is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure,” said Li Zhen, head of foreign exchange and digital assets at DBS. “Our first tokenized product addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets. With this initiative, a broader segment of investors can now tap our digital asset ecosystem to build exposure to the asset class,” Zhen continued.",Markets|DBS|Singapore|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|ASIA|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-21 03:04:19

ETH is now back above $4,220 but it faces many hurdles near $4,400. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,150 and $4,220 levels. The price is trading below $4,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $4,220 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price extended losses after there was a close below the $4,250 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained bearish momentum and traded below the $4,150 support zone. The bears were able to push the price below the $4,120 support zone . Finally, the price tested the $4,065 zone. A low was formed at $4,065 and the price recently started a recovery wave above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,580 swing high to the $4,065 low. However, the bears are active near the $4,350 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,580 swing high to the $4,065 low. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,355 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,350 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,380 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,460 level. A clear move above the $4,460 resistance might send the price toward the $4,500 resistance. An upside break above the $4,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,550 resistance zone or even $4,565 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,380 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,240 level. The first major support sits near the $4,200 zone. A clear move below the $4,200 support might push the price toward the $4,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Falling Prices Ark Invest, the investment management firm with more than $6 billion in assets under management (AUM), reduced the size of its ARKB (ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF) by 559.85 BTC, or approximately $64.4 million, as reported by the market watcher page Whale Insider yesterday. The crypto community responded with mixed feelings about the sale, with some indicating that it was a regular rebalancing of the fund. In contrast, others outright questioned it or even mocked it. Data collected at print time from CoinGlass also indicates a wave of sell-offs across exchange-traded funds, coinciding with the recent price slump for the leading cryptocurrency, which was preceded by a new all-time high of over $124,000. Source: Coinglass The ARKB stock seems to have reacted negatively to the sale, with the most recent data indicating a 2.79% daily decline, as reported by Google Finance. Source: Google Finance Buying Opportunity The company has not only been selling, though, because today, the ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) scooped up 356,346 shares of Bullish, with an estimated cost of $21.2 million, and 150,908 shares of Robinhood Markets shares, worth about $16.2M. This is a continuation of last week’s purchase of 2.53 million Bullish shares, worth roughly $172 million, following the exchange’s debut on the NYSE, and several buying sessions of Robinhood stock, with the last two being $14 million and $9 million, respectively. This fund’s stock is also plummeting, not reacting to the stocking up, posting a slightly more significant 3.99% daily drop, which is in line with the currently shaky markets, with investors and institutions preparing for the upcoming Fed speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, which will likely set the tone for the markets for the coming weeks and months.

But behind every story of overnight success, there are thousands of traders who burn out, lose money, or simply can’t keep up with the nonstop volatility. The truth is that making money in crypto doesn’t always equate to gazing at charts 24/7 or trying to catch every dip and every rally. Much of the biggest wealth in this space has been accumulated by people who simply got in position early , weathered the noise, and let the market happen for them. That is why passive strategies are increasingly being talked about. Investors are beginning to understand that money is usually accumulated by being patient, not busy all the time. The goal is no longer about catching every micro-move – it’s about identifying high-upside opportunities before the rest of the market notices them . And right now, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as prime examples of how to play this strategy without the stress of daily trading. Why trading less can make you more The idea of profiting without trading every day may seem counterintuitive at first. After all, crypto is one of the most volatile markets on earth. But that very volatility is why trying to out-trade algorithms, whales, and professionals is often a losing game. Rather, early investors in ventures such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Solana demonstrated that holding on patiently can be much more lucrative than fiddling around continuously. Take Dogecoin’s early investors. Those who purchased and just held through the volatility made astronomical profits, while the overwhelming majority who attempted to trade each swing generally ended up with less than they began with. Likewise, Solana’s early traders who held from 2020 up to the 2021 high made thousands of percent in profit without having to make dozens of trades. The lesson is clear: sometimes doing less actually delivers more. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the presale advantage This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the spotlight. The project is currently in presale and has already gained a reputation for being one of the most discussed opportunities in the market. Analysts point to its potential 55x upside , fueled by strong branding, political relevance, and fast-moving community momentum. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE especially compelling is how it offers investors the chance to position themselves early – before broader awareness, exchange listings, and mainstream adoption drive prices higher. Presale participants are even securing 50% bonus allocations , rewarding those who recognize the value of getting in before the crowd. This dynamic mirrors the early days of other breakout tokens that rewarded patience over constant trading. Why presales work for passive strategies Crypto cycles tend to follow a well-known rhythm: Bitcoin rallies, Ethereum consolidates, and eventually liquidity flows into newer projects with higher upside potential. The investors who win big are usually those who place their bets during the quiet stages, long before social media hype takes over. Presales are one of the few places where this advantage is still possible. By buying into a presale, investors are essentially locking in early exposure without needing to constantly monitor charts. The focus shifts from trading every fluctuation to simply holding and waiting for the broader market to catch up. For projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which combine strong community energy with cultural branding, the stage is set for that next big surge. Building wealth the smarter way It’s great to see that you don’t have to ignore the market entirely with this strategy. The key is to invest wisely, be cautious of the risk, and understand that crypto wealth is rarely built overnight. Successful investors are those who think long-term and enter at the right moments and are more importantly not burned out with day-to-day trading. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an ideal candidate for this strategy to a T. Its presale is already creating hype for how quickly it’s selling out each round, demonstrating that demand is naturally building up. The branding gives it longevity beyond being just another speculative meme coin, and its trajectory is taking the same paths we’ve witnessed from early-cycle plays which continued to drive talk in later cycles. Conclusion: wealth without the stress of daily trades For those who are wondering how to make money from crypto without having to trade on a daily basis, the response grows clearer day by day: position early, hold wisely, and let the natural cycles of the market do the work for you. The desperate search for short-term gain usually amounts to nothing, but long-term wagers still reward. With returns on investment projected to be 55x and pre-sale buyers rewarded with enormous bonuses, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the way to making money in this market the smart way – without the headache of trying to out-trade the masses.

This optimism comes on the heels of significant regulatory developments, most notably the recent introduction of the GENIUS Act, which aligns state and federal frameworks for stablecoin regulation. ‘Stablecoin Gold Rush’ US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence in the role of stablecoins, suggesting they could significantly boost the market for US Treasuries. According to a report from the Financial Times, Bessent has indicated that the government may increase the sale of short-term debt to meet the anticipated demand for these cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Expert Touts Chainlink Advantage Over XRP In Institutional Adoption Race Goldman Sachs views this moment as the dawn of a “stablecoin gold rush.” In a recent research paper authored by Will Nance and his team, the bank noted that the global market for stablecoins currently stands at approximately $271 billion. They anticipate significant growth, particularly for Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, which they believe will gain market share both on and off the Binance platform. The report estimates that USDC could see an impressive $77 billion increase, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% from 2024 to 2027. The Potential Impact Of Dollar-Pegged Cryptocurrencies The potential market for stablecoins is vast, with Goldman Sachs highlighting that Visa estimates the addressable market for payments at around $240 trillion in annual payment volume. Consumer payments alone account for about $40 trillion, while business-to-business (B2B) payments and person-to-person (P2P) transactions make up the remainder. The unique structure of stablecoins—requiring them to be backed one-to-one with US dollars or government bonds—means that each stablecoin issued directly increases demand for the bonds that back them. Some market analysts believe this approach will have a profound impact on the bond market, particularly for short-dated bonds, which often yield low interest rates. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Takes Major Step With Community Governance Model — Details A research paper from the Bank for International Settlements also supports Goldman Sach’s view, suggesting that significant inflows into the stablecoin market could lower three-month Treasury yields by 2 to 2.5 basis points within a short time frame. However, the bank’s paper also notes that the effects of stablecoin outflows are disproportionately greater, causing yields to rise by two to three times as much. Amid significant regulatory progress from the Trump administration, including the passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC bill, there have been increased inflows in the broader crypto market. Significant capital has entered Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and there is a new trend of adopting cryptocurrencies as treasury reserves. These factors have led to a new all-time high in total crypto market capitalization of $4.17 trillion. As of this writing, the figure has dropped to $3.81 trillion, as the market’s largest cryptocurrencies have led the correction witnessed since last week.

The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $3.00 zone. XRP Price Recovery Faces Hurdles XRP price remained in a bearish zone after a close below the $3.050 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price extended losses and traded below the $3.00 support zone. The price even declined below $2.90. Finally, it tested the $2.820 support zone. A low was formed at $2.820 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $2.90 level. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.095 swing high to the $2.820 low. However, the bears are active below the $3.00 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.095 swing high to the $2.820 low. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.950 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.9650 level. A clear move above the $2.9650 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.9650 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.90 level. The next major support is near the $2.850 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.850 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.820 support. The next major support sits near the $2.780 zone, below which there could be a sustained drop. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.90 and $2.850. Major Resistance Levels – $2.9650 and $3.00.",XRP|Ripple|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-08-21 04:08:18

The forecast drew attention because Armstrong rarely issues public price targets, despite leading one of the industry’s most influential exchanges. From Dorsey To Wood, Big Names Push Bold Bitcoin Forecasts His call aligns with several other well-known advocates . Former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey has also said Bitcoin could climb to $1m by 2030 and continue rising from there. I think we'll see $1M per bitcoin by 2030. Regulatory clarity is finally emerging, the US government is keeping a BTC reserve, there's a growing interest for crypto ETFs, among many other factors. (Not financial advice of course, it's impossible to guarantee) pic.twitter.com/w5EfcYFvVp — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) August 20, 2025 ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood has gone further, projecting a possible $1.5m price in her firm’s “bull case” scenario. Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy has argued the milestone could be reached when Wall Street allocates 10% of its reserves to Bitcoin. Author Robert Kiyosaki, known for Rich Dad Poor Dad , has likewise cited inflation and debt concerns as drivers of a seven-figure valuation. Regulatory Clarity In US Seen As Major Milestone For Crypto Coinbase CEO explained that several developments are strengthening Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. He pointed to regulatory clarity emerging in the US, including legislation on stablecoins and a pending market structure bill in the Senate. “Fingers crossed, something could happen by the end of this year. That would be a huge milestone,” he said. He also noted that the US government now holds a strategic Bitcoin reserve , a move he once considered unthinkable. According to him, the major risks that once clouded Bitcoin’s future are receding. Concerns about governments banning the asset have eased, while the Bitcoin protocol has withstood more than a decade of scrutiny. Armstrong acknowledged the need for upgrades to protect against advances in quantum computing but said the developer community is already exploring proposals. Large Funds Hold 1% Bitcoin Allocations, With Room To Grow At the same time, institutional demand is building. Armstrong said many large funds currently hold about 1% of their portfolios in Bitcoin. He argued that once clear rules are in place, capital inflows will accelerate. Exchange-traded funds have already driven a wave of adoption, attracting significant institutional money into the asset class. Armstrong expects that trend to continue as regulatory milestones are achieved and sovereign interest grows. Bitcoin’s potential to reach $1m has long been a lightning rod in financial debates. The cryptocurrency has repeatedly defied skeptics, setting fresh all-time highs before sharp corrections. For believers such as Armstrong, the case for seven-figure valuations rests on the interplay of limited supply, institutional adoption and macroeconomic uncertainty. Supporters argue that Bitcoin could emerge as a global reserve asset, similar to digital gold, if mainstream financial institutions and governments continue to build exposure. For now, Bitcoin remains well below that target. But with institutional money waiting on the sidelines and regulatory clarity edging closer, the idea of a million-dollar Bitcoin no longer sits on the fringes of speculation.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/this-unearthed-ripple-document-causes-buzz-among-xrp-army-heres-why/,"A post by crypto proponent Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) recently circulated with the claim that the United States had patented XRP in 2013, declaring it a payment method for financial services. Her tweet captions an official-looking certificate from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. At first glance, the document’s seal and bold heading might give the impression of a government patent. However, the claim does not withstand scrutiny. The certificate in question is authentic, but it does not represent a patent, nor does it indicate government ownership of XRP. Instead, it records a trademark registration made by Ripple in the early days , when it operated under the name OpenCoin. This filing is historically significant, but its meaning is different from what has been suggested online. WOW! A DOCUMENT HAS SURFACED: THE U.S. HAS PATENTED #XRP & DECLARED IT AS A PAYMENT METHOD FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES! THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED IN 2013! XRP IS A DONE DEAL! https://t.co/SEFWCHOFj8 pic.twitter.com/OFpBl4P1Kc — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) August 20, 2025 What the Filing Shows The certificate is a service mark registration issued on December 31, 2013. It was filed in May of that year by OpenCoin, Inc., based in San Francisco. The description reads, “providing secure payment options to members of an online community via a global computer network through the use of traditional currency and virtual currency.” This wording demonstrates that from the very beginning, Ripple positioned XRP as a digital asset designed to facilitate secure transactions. By filing for trademark protection, Ripple established exclusive rights to the XRP name in connection with financial services, ensuring brand recognition and legal safeguards as it developed its technology. Why the 2013 Filing Still Matters The registration does not grant government ownership, technical protection, or policy endorsement. It does, however, show how Ripple articulated XRP’s purpose at the outset. That scope remains consistent with XRP’s current positioning for cross-border value transfer and institutional settlement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The language in the filing emphasizes security, internet delivery, and compatibility with both “traditional currency and virtual currency.” By setting these aims in a formal filing more than a decade ago, Ripple documented an early focus on utility in the payment sector . The Distinction Between Patent and Trademark A patent protects a specific invention or process, while a trademark protects words, names, or symbols that identify goods or services. The XRP filing is the latter. It is a legal acknowledgment of Ripple’s right to use the XRP name within its field, not a government endorsement. Ripple has many patents. Some of these prove XRP’s efficiency in cross-border finance , among other advantages. However, this particular document has a different purpose. It does not imply that the U.S. government created or owns XRP, nor does it confirm XRP as an official national payment method.

This cheap crypto asset is generating significant presale momentum. Solana delivered astonishing returns after a quiet 2020. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now positioned for a similar trajectory. Its presale has advanced rapidly through six phases. Investor participation is exceptionally strong. Consequently, analysts are increasingly optimistic about its potential. This sentiment mirrors early confidence in Solana before its surge. Solana’s meteoric ascent Solana traded below $1 in late 2020. Few investors recognized its capabilities then. Its innovative proof-of-history mechanism gained traction later. Consequently, SOL experienced a phenomenal price explosion throughout 2021. Prices soared dramatically from under $2 to an all-time peak exceeding $259. This represented a staggering return exceeding 12,000%. Solana became a top ten cryptocurrency by market cap. Its journey demonstrates how unknown assets can achieve massive growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now occupies a similar early-stage position. Furthermore, its presale structure offers accessible entry. Mutuum Finance presale progress Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has achieved remarkable success. Phase 6 is actively underway presently. Tokens sell quickly at $0.035 each. This price reflects a substantial 250% increase since Phase 1 began at $0.01. Investors have contributed over $14,700,000 so far. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,450 participants. Phase 6 represents a closing window for this pricing tier. Availability is diminishing rapidly. Subsequently, Phase 7 will introduce a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. The official launch price is firmly set at $0.06. Therefore, current buyers anticipate significant returns exceeding 340% post-launch. Mutuum Finance utility foundation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructing a robust decentralized lending platform. It features a dual-lending model combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer protocols. This structure aims for high capital efficiency. Users gain control over lending and borrowing activities.

While established coins like ADA, DOGE, and MATIC are consolidating, analysts are eyeing innovative projects with strong fundamentals that can outperform during these quieter periods. Among the projects gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol that is uniquely positioned to capture investor interest and deliver strong returns. Capitalizing on dual lending and borrowing features Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a dual-lending approach, allowing users to participate in P2C pools with mainstream assets while also offering P2P loans for higher-risk tokens. In the P2C environment, lenders deposit bluechip cryptocurrencies or stablecoins into pooled liquidity, earning interest that automatically adjusts based on pool utilization. For example, a lender contributing $25,000 worth of BNB into a pool operating at 65% utilization will earn 19% APY, translating to $4,750 annually. This provides a compelling, low-maintenance option for crypto investing, especially during market pullbacks when capital can be allocated strategically. Borrowers in the P2C system also benefit by obtaining liquidity without selling their underlying assets. Consider an investor locking $12,000 in ETH and borrowing $9,000 in DAI at a 75% loan-to-value ratio. This arrangement allows them to meet immediate financial needs or pursue additional crypto investments while maintaining exposure to ETH’s potential upside. With no fixed loan term, borrowers have the flexibility to repay at any time as long as their collateral remains sufficient. For high-risk or less liquid tokens like DOGE or FLOKI, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) facilitates P2P lending. In this model, lenders and borrowers negotiate terms directly, setting interest rates and loan durations tailored to individual risk profiles. A lender providing FLOKI for a short-term loan can set an APR of 30%, securing higher returns while keeping the risk contained within the P2P framework. This ensures that the protocol’s main liquidity pools remain stable while providing diversified earning opportunities. Presale momentum and early investor gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035 per token. The project has successfully raised $14.68 million to date, with 22% of this phase’s supply sold and more than 15,500 holders already onboard. The next phase will increase the price by 15%, bringing the token to $0.04 and creating a limited window for investors to acquire tokens at the current discounted price. Early participants in Phase 1 have already seen substantial unrealized gains. For instance, an investor who swapped $4,000 worth of BTC into MUTM during the initial phase now holds tokens valued at $14,000 at $0.035. With the anticipated listing price of $0.06, this investment will grow to nearly $24,000, demonstrating the significant upside available for those acting early. Trust and security are critical in crypto investing, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has addressed this with a comprehensive CertiK audit. The project achieved a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, reflecting the platform’s strong code security and operational integrity. Additionally, the $50,000 USDT bug bounty program incentivizes white-hat researchers with rewards based on severity, including $2,000 for critical findings, $1,000 for major, $500 for medium, and $200 for low-level vulnerabilities. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway , which awards ten participants $10,000 in MUTM tokens each, further strengthens community engagement and excitement around the project. Looking ahead, the upcoming beta launch will coincide with the token listing, giving users the opportunity to interact with the platform’s full features before it goes live. Layer-2 integration is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs and increase speed, enhancing usability. The introduction of a stablecoin will provide additional utility for both lending and borrowing, while anticipated listings on top exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will broaden visibility, attract more participants, and drive demand.

News Background DOGE has faced pressure this month after reports tied to Qubic’s potential 51% attack spooked retail traders and drove selling. Despite those risks, on-chain data shows whale cohorts accumulated more than 680 million DOGE in August, offsetting retail outflows. Broader market sentiment has been mixed, with Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidating near highs, leaving memecoins trading with outsized volatility. Price Action Summary DOGE advanced 5% in the 24 hours ending Aug. 21, 04:00, recovering from an intraday bottom of $0.21 to close at $0.22. The token hit its session low around 13:00 UTC on Aug. 20 before reversing course in a V-shaped recovery. Trading volume spiked to 9.29 million in the final hour, adding 0.45% in the last stretch and confirming institutional-sized flows. Whales accumulated 680 million DOGE through August, positioning despite ongoing concerns around Qubic’s potential 51% attack. Technical Analysis Key support held at $0.21, tested at mid-session before high-volume reversal. Resistance emerged at $0.22, setting a $0.01 trading range for the session. A breakout was triggered at 04:31 UTC with the 9.29 million volume spike marking the session pivot. Sustained turnover at 6.8 million per minute during the final hour points to larger buyers driving momentum.

50426608,https://invezz.com/?p=2845348,1755755210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,TRX’s MetaMask integration stirs market but this token steals hype after 250% gains,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/21/trxs-metamask-integration-stirs-market-but-this-token-steals-hype-after-250-gains/,"Tron (TRX)’s recent MetaMask integration has grabbed headlines, creating a stir in the crypto community as investors scrutinize its potential impact on network adoption and usage. While flashy announcements like these often dominate media cycles, long-term value in crypto markets lies with projects offering real utility and sustainable growth mechanisms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a prime example, quietly building a platform that combines innovation, security, and early adoption advantages, allowing investors to capture substantial paper gains and position for future growth. Tron (TRX)’s MetaMask integration Tron (TRX) surged 4.2% to ~$0.3495, driven by its native integration with MetaMask, announced August 19, 2025. The integration, making TRON the third non-Ethereum chain supported after Solana and Sei, unlocks access to TRON’s $26 billion TVL and $22 billion daily settlement for MetaMask’s 100 million users. Trading volume jumped 10% to $1.25 billion, with whale accumulation of 500 million TRX ($174M) signaling strong confidence. Technical indicators show TRX breaking $0.34 resistance, with RSI at 60 and support at $0.32. TRON’s dominance in DeFi and USDT transactions further fuels bullish sentiment. Analysts project a $0.40 target if $0.37 holds, but macro pressures like US tariffs pose risks. A drop below $0.32 could test $0.31. Presale momentum and utility driving long-term growth Unlike Tron (TRX)’s announcement-driven hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating measurable results through its presale performance. Early Phase 1 investors who entered at $0.01 are already enjoying 250% paper gains as the token advances into Phase 6 at $0.035. The presale itself has raised over $14.68 million, with 22% of tokens sold and a growing community of more than 15,500 holders. With the next phase set to introduce a 15% price increase, this marks a critical window for investors looking to secure an entry point before costs rise. This creates a unique opportunity to join the project ahead of broader market awareness, contrasting with more speculative or news-driven rallies seen with other crypto coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to offer real utility beyond speculative trading. The platform combines P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, allowing users to earn interest on bluechip and stablecoin deposits while also lending or borrowing across various crypto assets. Deposited assets are converted into mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, which grow in value with accrued interest and can be staked to earn additional MUTM rewards. This buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures that as platform activity increases, token demand is reinforced, creating sustained growth for users. Layer-2 integration will drastically improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, making the platform more attractive for retail and institutional users. Additionally, the beta launch coinciding with the token listing will give early adopters hands-on experience with the platform, allowing them to see the lending, borrowing, and staking utilities in action. Alongside this, a $1 stablecoin under development will facilitate overcollateralized lending, providing predictable borrowing and hedging opportunities while maintaining exposure to crypto asset growth. Trust and credibility are central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s approach. CertiK’s audit, with a Token Scan score of 95 and Skynet at 78, validates the platform’s security, while a $50,000 bug bounty incentivizes thorough vulnerability reporting. A $100,000 giveaway for ten winners also engages the community and encourages early participation. The four-phase roadmap—spanning presale and marketing, building core technology, beta testnet, and live platform launch—positions MUTM for successful exchange listings on Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and MEXC, further enhancing liquidity and visibility in the market. Conclusion The contrast between Tron (TRX)’s headline-driven moment and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s structured growth highlights a crucial lesson for investors: long-term returns often come from platforms with clear utility, technical robustness, and strategic rollout plans. Phase 1 participants in MUTM already demonstrate the advantages of early entry, while those joining in Phase 6 will still secure substantial upside ahead of the $0.06 listing. The combination of staking rewards, Layer-2 efficiency, buyback-distribute mechanics, and stablecoin integration creates a sustainable ecosystem where token growth is directly tied to platform adoption. As crypto prices today fluctuate and broader market sentiment questions why crypto is down, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer a clear path for investors seeking more than short-term hype. The presale momentum, Layer-2 advantages, and robust roadmap will help solidify MUTM as a top candidate for long-term growth, attracting both retail and institutional interest. While Tron (TRX)’s MetaMask integration makes waves in news cycles, MUTM is quietly setting the foundation for mass adoption and sustainable value creation, ensuring that early investors reap the rewards of participating in a project with tangible utility and structured growth.

Bitcoin Has Continued Its Recent Drawdown Since setting a new all-time high (ATH) above $124,000 one week ago, Bitcoin has been facing a downtrend. The bearish momentum has only furthered during the past day, with BTC hitting a low under $113,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Coils Up: Triangle Break Could Spark 40% Move, Analyst Says Below is a chart that shows how the coin’s recent performance has looked. From the graph, it’s visible that BTC has seen a bit of recovery after forming a low around $112,400, but at the current price of $113,800, the asset is still notably below the levels from the last few days. As is usually the case, the bearish price action has worsened the sentiment among investors. Fear & Greed Index Is Now Suggesting A Fearful Market The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index determines the investor mentality using the data of five factors: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. It then represents it as a score lying between zero and hundred. When the metric has a value greater than 53, it means the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. On the other hand, it being under 47 implies the presence of fear in the market. A level lying between the two thresholds naturally corresponds to a net neutral mentality. Now, here is how the sentiment in the sector currently looks according to the Fear & Greed Index: As displayed above, the index is sitting at a value of 44, indicating that Bitcoin investors are fearful. This is a shift from how the mood has been like in the market for the past couple of months. The Fear & Greed Index was previously in the greed zone since June, but the latest decline in BTC’s price has meant the investors have finally let go of bullish sentiment. If history is anything to go by, this flip in trader mentality could actually turn out to be a positive sign for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The market often tends to move in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority, with an excess of FUD facilitating bottoms and overhype resulting in tops. This effect was seen in action during the aforementioned June sentiment low, which coincided with BTC’s bottom under $99,000. The turnaround in the asset only required an index value of 42, but generally, a more powerful fear sentiment is needed before a bottom can occur.

50426231,561652,1755756055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50426231.jpeg,Crypto Ponzi Scheme Ruling: EminiFX Founder Ordered To Repay $228 Million,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-eminifx-founder-228-million-ponzi/,"Yesterday, a federal judge in New York ordered Eddy Alexandre, founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency platform EminiFX, to pay $228 million in restitution for orchestrating a Ponzi scheme that defrauded tens of thousands of investors. EminiFX CEO To Pay $228 Million In Restitution According to a court filing published on August 19, US District Judge Valerie Caproni ruled that Alexandre and EminiFX must repay $228 million in restitution along with $15 million in disgorgement. The ruling stated: Defendants Alexandre and EminiFX are jointly and severally liable to pay restitution in the total amount of $228,576,962. Defendant Alexandre is liable to pay disgorgement in the amount of $15,049,500. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured the summary judgment more than three years after Alexandre was first charged. In a separate 2023 criminal case, the former entrepreneur pleaded guilty to commodities fraud. For background, EminiFX was founded in 2021, raising over $262 million in just about eight months. In the same duration, the platform attracted more than 25,000 investors looking for quick returns. The platform claimed it could deliver 5% to 9.99% in weekly returns through a so-called “Robo-Advisor Assisted Account.” This account allegedly relied on automated strategies for trading in crypto and forex markets. Court filings revealed that EminiFX suffered net losses of at least $49 million. The platform also never deployed the trading technology it advertised to investors. Investigators found that Alexandre diverted at least $15 million for personal use, covering credit card bills, luxury cars, and cash withdrawals. At the same time, investor payouts were funded with money from new participants, a classic trait of Ponzi schemes. Judge Caproni’s order finally brings the EminiFX case to a close, requiring Alexandre to pay $228 million in restitution. The order also states that any payments toward restitution will offset his disgorgement obligation. Crypto Scams On A Steady Rise Despite tighter regulations and enhanced security measures, scams and fraud continue to plague the crypto industry. In May 2025, law authorities arrested an individual from Wellington, New Zealand, for association with a $265 million crypto scam. A month earlier, a Brazilian court punished a leader of a crypto Ponzi scheme syndicate by sentencing him to 128 years in prison. The Ponzi scheme promised its investors guaranteed returns of 8% per month. A report earlier this month noted that the crypto industry lost a whopping $3.1 billion to hacks during the first half of 2025. This is an increase of almost 100% compared to losses incurred during the first half of 2024. Meanwhile, US prosecutors in Nevada indicted a Las Vegas business owner in connection with a multimillion-dollar crypto fraud earlier this year. At press time, BTC trades at $114,242, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto scam|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto investment|crypto ponzi scheme|Crypto Scam|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|EminiFX|fraud,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 06:00:55

Here Are the Predictions and Possible Effects on the Market,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-say-on-friday-here-are-the-predictions-and-possible-effects-on-the-market/,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to hold his own against making a clear commitment to cut interest rates in September during his speech at the Jackson Hole meeting on Friday. While markets are strongly pricing in a rate cut, Powell may avoid giving definitive signals, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the process. Research firm LHMeyer suggested Powell could temper expectations to prevent markets from fully locking in on the cut. Powell's speech will come under even greater pressure than usual this year. US President Donald Trump has been criticizing the Fed chair for months, calling him a “stubborn mule” and “unintelligent,” and harshly criticizing his resistance to interest rate cuts. Trump is poised to challenge the Fed's internal balance of power by nominating economist Stephen Miran, a figure aligned with his political affiliation, to fill the vacant seat at the Fed. Miran, who supports Trump's calls for interest rate cuts, also advocates for reforms within the Fed that would empower chairmen to dismiss figures like Powell. Related News: Binance Makes New Airdrop Announcement: Quota Filled Within Minutes - May Reopen TS Lombard Chief Economist Steven Blitz commented, “Miran is not one to be swayed by tradition. He will be Trump's provocateur at the FOMC, and he will not hide it.” Powell's job isn't just made more difficult by Trump's pressure and Miran's potential influence. At the Fed's last meeting, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, considered among his successor candidates, voted against the majority to cut interest rates. On the data front, the picture is mixed. A weak July employment report signaled a slowdown in the labor market, while a rise in the producer price index fueled concerns that Trump's tariffs would push up consumer prices. “The tariffs have created a stagflationary effect and seriously complicated the Fed's job,” said Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. Barclays Chief Economist Marc Giannoni, however, noted that Powell's approach to assessing the unemployment rate will be decisive. Recalling Powell's warnings after the July meeting, Giannoni said, “If Powell reiterates that the unemployment rate could remain low due to supply-side factors like immigration, despite the weakening employment, the probability of a rate cut could be lowered to 50%.” Market expectations for a September interest rate cut have recently declined. Following producer price index data and cautious statements from Fed members, expectations have fallen to 85%. *This is not investment advice.

Developers embraced its high throughput, retail investors chased its rallies, and institutions gradually added exposure. From NFT booms to DeFi integrations, Solana became a household name in crypto markets, validating the idea that early entry is where exponential gains are made. Riding the waves: Solana’s market volatility The path to today’s valuation wasn’t smooth. Solana endured sharp crashes, including a brutal 2022 collapse when it dipped under $10. Yet, every major recovery has been more powerful, with cycles driving it back into the top ranks. In 2024 and 2025, Solana consolidated as one of the leading altcoins, trading in a volatile yet strong range between $150 and $200. Analysts now forecast potential upside toward $250–$300 by early 2026, though much of the parabolic growth may already be priced in. For investors just discovering Solana today, the challenge is timing. While the blockchain remains a strong player, its biggest multiple gains are likely behind it. This is where many begin to look at earlier-stage opportunities with higher upside potential, rather than chasing a name that has already delivered its moonshot. Where early-stage momentum is building This brings us to the growing conversation about MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike Solana, which has matured into a top-tier blockchain, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase. Investors who feel they missed Solana’s 46x run are eyeing MAGACOIN as a second-chance play. The project has already drawn attention for its audited smart contracts, transparency standards, and rapidly sold-out presale rounds , echoing early-stage conditions seen in Solana’s rise. But what sets MAGACOIN apart is its cultural branding and community momentum. In a market where narrative often drives value as much as technology, that combination has sparked comparisons to DOGE’s meme-driven breakout and Solana’s underdog ascent. Why the rotation favors new contenders Crypto market cycles tend to follow a predictable pattern: top assets like Solana and Ethereum rally, consolidate, and then capital rotates into fresh stories. Right now, that rotation is underway. While Solana may continue climbing steadily, the speculative wave is increasingly shifting toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer both strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN’s presale positioning, political narrative, and expanding community give it the right mix to become the next breakout name. Forecasts even suggest a possible 58x ROI from presale entry , rivaling Solana’s early trajectory. Conclusion: Solana’s legacy, MAGACOIN’s moment If Solana proved anything, it’s that early conviction pays off. A $1,000 bet in 2020 has turned into a huge reward by 2025 . The lesson is clear: the next major altcoin success may not be today’s established leaders but rather a new name rising in the shadows. With presale demand accelerating and audits building investor trust, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as that next candidate for huge ROI. For those who missed Solana’s early rocket ride, this may be the moment they’ve been waiting for. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

50426517,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788818,1755756590,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50426517.jpeg,Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer unveiled plans to expand its U.S. crypto mining rig manufacturing operations,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitdeer-seeks-to-ride-trump-tariff/,"Singapore-based crypto mining platform Bitdeer announced plans to expand the manufacturing of its mining rigs in the U.S. amid dropping profits. Jeff LaBerge, Bitdeer’s CFA, said his company hoped to ride on Trump’s tariff headwinds, even if his trade policies hurt the miner’s supply chain. LaBerge praised Trump’s approach, saying it had created more things to consider. He also mentioned that the policies were supportive of energy. LaBerge believes a Bitcoin-friendly tariff resolution will be made to allow companies like Bitdeer to thrive. The Cryptopolitan recently reported that Tether had invested over $400M to acquire a 21.4% (31.8M shares) stake in Bitdeer. The miner hopes to start manufacturing mining rigs in the U.S. this year, eventually helping its self-mining business to grow. Bitdeer pointed out that many of its competitors were similarly considering shifting their production to the U.S. However, it clarified that there were no plans to reposition itself as a treasury firm, even as its BTC holdings continued to increase. LaBerge says Bitdeer is more practical The CFA said his company was not trying to be seen as a BTC treasury, adding that the miner was more practical than idealistic about including BTC on its balance sheet. He added that having Bitcoin on the company’s balance sheet was not part of their identity. The company also acknowledged that BTC mining faced challenges ranging from rising costs to dwindling rewards and growing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. One financial analyst claimed that the miner’s Q2 results demonstrated that the company’s bet on vertical integration was paying off. The analyst believes the company has transformed from solely a BTC miner to a key industry technology provider. The manufacturing and commercialization of their SEALMINER A2 miners provided a cost advantage and a growth engine for the company’s operations. However, the analyst observed that bears were likely to point to the company’s high cash burn from R&D and SG&A, growing debt balance, and risks associated with its expansion plans. The analyst believes the high operating expenses of $42.3 million reported in Q2 represented a significant quarterly cash burn. Bitdeer’s spending needs to be supported by sustained revenue growth, but its profitability is still sensitive to BTC prices and high innovation costs. The analyst also thinks the company should take care of its growing debt load, which has reached $533 million. Bitdeer focuses on rapid growth Matt Kong, Bitdeer’s Chief Business Officer, said on August 18 that his company was now looking forward to rapid growth, especially in its self-mining hashrate. He pointed out that Q2 marked a key point of inflection, and his company was on track to achieve its targets throughout the remainder of the year. Kong added that his company expected sequentially improved financial results in H2 2025. The CBO also claimed that its company aimed to achieve its end-of-October 40EH/s target. He explained the company was likely to exceed its 2025 targets because its foundry’s wafer supply allocation had improved. Kong continued revealing his company’s R&D plans, disclosing that the miner was targeting a 5 J/TH chip efficiency for its SEALMINER A4 project. He pointed out that his company also made significant progress in July with the expansion of its U.S. engineering team and the development of customized silicon software. Kong said these developments firmly positioned his company as a leading supplier of the industry’s most energy-efficient mining rigs. The CBO believes this will help improve the company’s competitiveness and unlock value for its customers and shareholders. Kong concluded by saying his company was keen on energizing more data centers. He pointed out that the miner had energized a self-mining data center capacity of 361 MW, bringing the miner’s electrical capacity to roughly 1.3 GW. Kong expects this will increase to over 1.6 GW by the end of this year. The Clarington, Ohio, site is almost at its full 570 MW capacity.

A significant development is unfolding in Asia, where a groundbreaking South Korean stablecoin bill has just been proposed. This legislative effort aims to bring much-needed clarity and stability to the rapidly growing stablecoin market, impacting both domestic and international players. What Does the South Korean Stablecoin Bill Propose? South Korean lawmaker Kim Hyun-jung of the ruling Democratic Party has put forward the nation’s first comprehensive bill specifically targeting stablecoins. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a foundational step towards formal oversight for value-stabilized digital assets. The core idea is to foster healthy market growth while robustly protecting consumers. Minimum Capital Requirement: Issuers would need to hold at least 5 billion won (approximately $3.6 million) in capital. This significant barrier aims to ensure only serious, well-capitalized entities can operate. Sound Business Plan: Companies must present a clear, viable business strategy to the authorities. Qualified Staff & Facilities: Issuers need to demonstrate they have the necessary human resources and infrastructure to manage stablecoin operations effectively. FSC Approval: Obtaining approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) would become mandatory, bringing stablecoin issuance under strict regulatory scrutiny. Foreign Stablecoin Registration: Even stablecoins issued abroad would be required to register with the FSC before they can be distributed within South Korea. This provision extends the bill’s reach beyond national borders. Why is This Regulation Crucial for Stablecoins? You might wonder, why now? The push for this South Korean stablecoin bill stems from a clear desire to prevent financial instability and safeguard investors. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a consistent value, are vital bridges between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. However, without proper oversight, they can pose risks, as seen in past market events. This proposed legislation reflects a global trend towards regulating digital assets. By setting clear rules, South Korea aims to: Enhance Consumer Protection: Mandating capital and approval processes helps ensure that stablecoin issuers are legitimate and capable of meeting their obligations. Promote Market Integrity: Formal oversight reduces the risk of fraud and market manipulation, building trust among users and institutions. Foster Innovation Responsibly: A regulated environment can encourage innovation by providing a secure framework for businesses to operate within, rather than stifling it. What Impact Will the South Korean Stablecoin Bill Have? The implications of this South Korean stablecoin bill are far-reaching. For existing stablecoin issuers, particularly smaller ones, meeting the 5 billion won capital requirement could be a significant challenge. However, for larger, well-established entities, it could solidify their position by weeding out less compliant competitors. This move could also set a precedent for other nations in Asia and beyond, influencing how they approach digital asset regulation. South Korea is demonstrating a proactive stance, moving beyond simple warnings to implement concrete legislative measures. This kind of robust framework is essential for the long-term viability and mainstream adoption of stablecoins. In conclusion, the proposed South Korean stablecoin bill represents a monumental step towards creating a safer, more transparent, and more stable digital asset ecosystem. It underscores the growing recognition among global policymakers that digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, require careful integration into existing financial frameworks for the benefit of all. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or to a commodity like gold. Q2: Who proposed the new stablecoin bill in South Korea? The bill was proposed by South Korean lawmaker Kim Hyun-jung of the ruling Democratic Party. Q3: What is the minimum capital requirement for stablecoin issuers under this bill? The proposed bill requires stablecoin issuers to hold at least 5 billion won, which is approximately $3.6 million. Q4: Will foreign-issued stablecoins be affected by this South Korean stablecoin bill? Yes, the proposal includes provisions requiring foreign-issued stablecoins to register with the Financial Services Commission before being distributed domestically in South Korea.

50426128,https://cryptonews.com/?p=411924,1755756635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50426128.jpeg,BNB Treasury Firm Windtree Plunges 77% as Nasdaq Moves to Delist Over Compliance Failure,https://cryptonews.com/news/windtree-plunges-77-as-nasdaq-moves-to-delist-biotech-over-compliance-failure/,"Windtree Therapeutics saw its shares collapse on Wednesday after Nasdaq said it would delist the biotech for failing to comply with listing standards. Key Takeaways: Windtree Therapeutics’ stock collapsed 77% after Nasdaq moved to delist the biotech for failing to meet the $1 minimum bid price rule. The company had recently launched a BNB treasury strategy, but shares have since dropped over 90% from their July peak. While Windtree faces uncertainty, BNB surged to a new all-time high of $876. The company’s stock (WINT) plunged 77.2% to $0.11, with another 4.7% drop in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission , Windtree disclosed that Nasdaq cited Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires companies to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Windtree Vows to Keep Reporting as Nasdaq Suspension Looms Trading of WINT will be suspended on Thursday. Chief Executive Jed Latkin said the company would continue to meet its reporting obligations despite the delisting. Windtree’s market struggles come only a month after the company rolled out a BNB treasury strategy, aimed at providing investors exposure to Binance’s native token without directly holding it. On July 16, the firm unveiled a $60 million purchase agreement with Build and Build Corp, with the option to expand by an additional $140 million. The announcement briefly lifted its stock by 32.2% before the downtrend began. A week later, Windtree secured a $500 million equity line of credit from an undisclosed investor and a separate $20 million stock-purchase deal with Build and Build Corp to expand its BNB position. However, shares have since collapsed more than 90% from their July 18 peak, erasing those early gains. The company has not disclosed how much BNB it currently holds or whether it plans to continue the strategy after the delisting notice. How is no one on my timeline talking about the fact that Windtree Therapeutics, the first Nasdaq-listed company to hold $BNB directly in its treasury, was just delisted from Nasdaq! It failed to maintain the minimum bid price requirement of $1/share for 30 consecutive business… — Raghav Agarwal (@0xRaghav) August 20, 2025 Other public firms have faced similar setbacks on Nasdaq. Argo Blockchai n, for example, was previously suspended but managed to regain compliance and relist. Windtree’s path back remains uncertain. Meanwhile, BNB itself is thriving. The token surged 5.6% on Wednesday to $876.26, hitting a new all-time high and standing out as one of the few blue-chip altcoins to break past 2021 levels this cycle. XRP and Solana are the only other major tokens to do so, while Ether, Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Cardano remain below their previous peaks. BNC Becomes Largest Corporate Holder of BNB with $160M Purchase Earlier this month, BNB Network Company (BNC) bought 200,000 BNB tokens for $160 million, making it the largest corporate holder of Binance Coin. The Nasdaq-listed firm is repositioning itself as a crypto-first treasury, focusing exclusively on BNB as its primary reserve asset. The acquisition comes amid a surge in corporate adoption of BNB, with companies increasingly using the token as a treasury tool. To drive this shift, BNC revamped its leadership team. David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital, was named CEO, joined by former CalPERS CIO Russell Read and ex-Kraken director Saad Naja. The board also welcomed Hans Thomas and Alexander Monje of 10X Capital. Their strategy mirrors moves by other firms like Nano Labs and Windtree Therapeutics, which have allocated hundreds of millions into BNB holdings to emulate the Bitcoin playbook pioneered by Strategy.

This move sent shockwaves through the community, culminating in a dramatic 93% price crash on Upbit. Understanding such rapid market shifts is crucial for any crypto enthusiast navigating this dynamic space. What Triggered the STRIKE Token Delisting and Crash? Investors watched in disbelief as the STRIKE token experienced a precipitous decline. On South Korea’s Upbit exchange, STRIKE plummeted an astounding 93.09% within a single day, settling at 438 won ($0.31). This massive selloff occurred just before its official delisting, scheduled for 06:00 UTC on August 21. The immediate catalyst for this freefall was the announcement from Upbit and its competitor, Bithumb. Both prominent South Korean exchanges declared their intention to delist the token. Such decisions are rarely made lightly and often stem from significant concerns about the project itself. Why Did Exchanges Initiate the STRIKE Token Delisting? The decision by Upbit and Bithumb to proceed with the STRIKE token delisting was not arbitrary. They cited serious concerns regarding the project’s foundational elements. Specifically, the exchanges raised issues with: Project Disclosures: A lack of transparency or insufficient information provided by the STRIKE project team. Business Model Viability: Doubts about the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of the token’s underlying business model. Overall Sustainability: Concerns about the project’s ability to maintain operations and deliver on its promises in the future. These factors collectively painted a picture of a project that might not meet the stringent standards required for continued listing on major exchanges. For investors, these warnings are critical signals about potential risks in the digital asset space. What Lessons Can We Learn from the STRIKE Token Delisting? The rapid decline of STRIKE token serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in the volatile crypto space. Interestingly, this dramatic crash followed a peculiar market behavior just weeks prior. After the initial delisting notice, STRIKE actually saw its price nearly triple, suggesting speculative trading or a misunderstanding of the delisting’s implications. This scenario highlights several key takeaways for crypto participants: Due Diligence is Paramount: Always thoroughly research any project before investing. Understand its whitepaper, team, technology, and business model. Exchange Announcements Matter: Pay close attention to official statements from exchanges regarding token listings, warnings, or delistings. These often precede significant price movements. Avoid FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): The temporary price surge post-delisting notice was a classic example of speculative bubbles. Chasing such pumps can lead to substantial losses. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate single-asset risks. The STRIKE token delisting is a powerful case study in market dynamics and the importance of informed decision-making for every investor. The recent STRIKE token delisting and subsequent crash on South Korean exchanges underscore the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be alarming, they also provide invaluable lessons for investors. Prioritizing thorough research, staying informed about exchange policies, and practicing disciplined risk management are essential for navigating this dynamic landscape successfully. Always remember that transparency and sustainability are cornerstones of a healthy crypto project. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the STRIKE token to crash so dramatically? The STRIKE token crashed primarily due to its announced delisting from major South Korean exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. These exchanges cited concerns over the project’s disclosures, business model, and overall sustainability. Which exchanges delisted the STRIKE token? Upbit and Bithumb, two prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, announced the delisting of the STRIKE token. When was the STRIKE token officially delisted from Upbit? The official delisting of the STRIKE token from Upbit was set to take effect at 06:00 UTC on August 21. Did the STRIKE token’s price react before the delisting notice? Yes, interestingly, after the initial delisting notice was issued, the STRIKE token’s price nearly tripled last month before its eventual catastrophic crash. This suggests speculative trading. What does a token delisting mean for investors? A token delisting means the cryptocurrency exchange will no longer support trading of that specific token. This often leads to a sharp decline in price as investors rush to sell their holdings before trading ceases, and it can significantly reduce the token’s liquidity and accessibility.

In his commentary, Rietveld urged the XRP community to listen closely to Mallers’ insights, even though Mallers is widely regarded as a Bitcoin maximalist. Rietveld explained that many of Mallers’ arguments regarding Bitcoin could also be applied to XRP, suggesting that by replacing “Bitcoin” with “XRP” in his reasoning, holders of XRP could gain valuable perspectives on the digital asset’s long-term potential. Rietveld emphasized that while Mallers often speaks in favor of Bitcoin, his broader points on financial markets, investment strategies, and the failures of traditional portfolios have implications that go beyond a single digital asset. According to Rietveld, this crossover of reasoning highlights why XRP may stand at a similar point today as Bitcoin did in earlier years. The MOMENT This Happens, XRP GOES NUCLEAR – Jack Mallers #XRP pic.twitter.com/59XXG4E4rx — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 19, 2025 Jack Mallers on the State of Traditional Portfolios Mallers began his analysis by criticizing the conventional 60/40 investment portfolio of stocks and bonds, declaring it to be “dead.” He stressed that such traditional strategies cannot deliver sustainable returns in the current economic climate, particularly as U.S. pensions, endowments, and retirement accounts face mounting losses from bonds and underperforming equities. Mallers cited examples of commercial real estate being marked down significantly and noted that many institutional savings accounts are now severely underwater. He argued that Bitcoin provides an essential alternative, citing both private sector adoption and shifts in government policy. Mallers referenced Harvard University’s decision to purchase over $100 million worth of Bitcoin. He highlighted President Donald Trump’s executive order allowing Bitcoin and gold to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts. He framed these developments as critical steps toward securing financial portfolios in an environment where fiat currency continues to lose value through inflation and monetary debasement. Levi Rietveld’s Application to XRP Rietveld, while acknowledging Mallers’ Bitcoin advocacy, positioned XRP as being in a similar situation to Bitcoin in 2018, when skepticism about its long-term value was widespread. He argued that while institutional attention is currently centered on Bitcoin, XRP is quietly outperforming other cryptocurrencies in terms of relative strength during both market declines and recoveries. Rietveld suggested that XRP could soon become a primary choice for investors, particularly as wealth advisors begin considering its inclusion in retirement and investment portfolios through potential exchange-traded funds. He reinforced the idea that digital assets as a class are gaining legitimacy, noting that Treasury Secretary Besson recently affirmed the government’s intention to support digital assets under high regulatory standards. According to Rietveld, this confirms that the U.S. government is not only prioritizing Bitcoin but also creating a path for broader digital asset adoption, which directly benefits XRP’s market positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Both Mallers and Rietveld agreed on the fundamental point that traditional financial instruments are no longer sufficient to safeguard wealth. Mallers advocated for Bitcoin as the solution, while Rietveld argued that XRP offers a superior option . He pointed out that while fiat currencies continue to be devalued, digital assets present an alternative system that preserves value and resists inflationary pressures. Rietveld concluded his analysis by reiterating that XRP represents a unique opportunity for investors who want to enter before liquidity cycles shift away from Bitcoin toward other digital assets. He maintained that XRP’s performance metrics already demonstrate its strength compared to competitors, reinforcing his view that XRP is the more compelling long-term option.

Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with existing financial groups, as indicated by Tarbert’s meetings, can accelerate integration. Demand for Stable Assets: The inherent stability of USDC could appeal to a market seeking reliable digital assets amidst volatility. This strategic move by Circle underscores the company’s commitment to global expansion and its belief in the long-term potential of the South Korean market. The Road Ahead for Circle South Korea Investment The discussions between Circle’s President Heath Tarbert and South Korean financial leaders are crucial. These meetings are likely to cover a range of topics, including regulatory compliance, market entry strategies, and potential partnership models. The outcome of these discussions will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of Circle’s presence in the country. Investors and market watchers will be keenly observing for official announcements regarding any finalized investment or strategic alliances. The success of a Circle South Korea investment could set a precedent for other global stablecoin issuers looking to expand their reach into key Asian economies. It’s a testament to the growing global interconnectedness of the crypto world. Summary: A Strategic Leap for Stablecoins Circle’s reported interest in a direct Circle South Korea investment signifies a significant strategic move. It highlights South Korea’s burgeoning importance in the global crypto economy and Circle’s ambition to solidify USDC’s position worldwide.

A prominent Bitcoin whale , identified by the address starting with 0xCa2D, executed a massive trade. This influential entity sold a substantial 400 BTC, valued at approximately $45.5 million at the time, on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. What’s even more intriguing is their immediate rotation of these funds into Ethereum (ETH), now holding 11,744 ETH worth an impressive $50.57 million. Understanding the Bitcoin Whale’s Strategic Shift This significant move, reported by Onchain Lens on X, highlights the dynamic nature of large-scale crypto investments. When a Bitcoin whale makes such a substantial transaction, it often sparks discussion and analysis across the crypto community. These large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ possess enough capital to potentially influence market sentiment and even price action, making their movements a key data point for traders and analysts. The decision to divest from Bitcoin and accumulate Ethereum is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a strategic re-evaluation of market positions by this specific Bitcoin whale . Such shifts can be driven by various factors, from anticipating future price movements to seeking different investment opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem. Why Do Bitcoin Whales Make Such Bold Moves? The motivations behind a Bitcoin whale ‘s decision to swap a significant portion of their holdings from one major cryptocurrency to another are complex. Several reasons could explain this particular rotation from BTC to ETH: Anticipation of Outperformance: The whale might believe Ethereum is poised for stronger growth or a more favorable market cycle compared to Bitcoin in the near future. Diversification Strategy: While both are major cryptocurrencies, they serve different primary purposes. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, while Ethereum powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. Yield Opportunities: Ethereum’s ecosystem offers numerous opportunities for staking, lending, and participating in DeFi protocols, which can generate yield on holdings. This might be more attractive than simply holding Bitcoin. Market Sentiment: A general shift in sentiment favoring altcoins or specific narratives around Ethereum’s technological advancements could also play a role. It is important to remember that while on-chain data provides transparency, the exact rationale of any individual Bitcoin whale remains speculative. However, observing these large transactions offers valuable insights into the broader market’s undercurrents. The Ripple Effect: What Does This Bitcoin Whale Swap Mean for You? While one large trade does not single-handedly dictate the market’s direction, the actions of a prominent Bitcoin whale can certainly create ripples. When such a significant amount of capital moves, it can: Influence Sentiment: Other market participants might interpret the move as a bullish signal for ETH or a bearish one for BTC, potentially leading to similar trades. Impact Liquidity: Large sell orders can temporarily increase selling pressure on the asset being sold (BTC in this case) and buying pressure on the asset being acquired (ETH). Highlight Trends: Consistent patterns of whales shifting assets can signal emerging trends or shifts in institutional and large-investor interest. For the average investor, this event serves as a reminder of the market’s constant evolution and the importance of staying informed. While following a Bitcoin whale ‘s every move is not a guaranteed strategy, understanding these significant transactions contributes to a more comprehensive market perspective. In conclusion, the recent 400 BTC to ETH swap by a major Bitcoin whale on Hyperliquid is a compelling example of strategic asset reallocation in the crypto space. It underscores the ongoing dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum, two pillars of the digital asset economy. As the market continues to mature, observing these large-scale movements remains a crucial aspect of informed participation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Their actions are closely watched by analysts. Why did this specific whale sell Bitcoin for Ethereum? While the exact reasons are private, common motivations for such a swap include anticipating stronger future performance for Ethereum, diversifying a portfolio, seeking yield opportunities within the Ethereum ecosystem, or reacting to broader market sentiment shifts. How does a Bitcoin whale’s activity affect cryptocurrency prices? Large trades by a Bitcoin whale can impact market sentiment, create temporary buying or selling pressure, and influence liquidity.

After introducing its voice bot, the CBA first confirmed job cuts in July, commenting, “Our investment in technology, including AI, is making it easier and faster for customers to get help, especially in our call centers.” However, the bank has now conceded that axing 45 customer service roles on the grounds of AI automation was an “error” and confirmed it had apologized to affected workers. It insists the jobs are still needed alongside its AI-powered “voice-bot.” The CBA says it didn’t take everything into account in its decision to cut jobs In a statement released Thursday, the Finance Sector Union said it had earlier lodged a complaint against CBA with the workplace relations tribunal for not being open about call volumes. According to the union, call volumes were climbing rather than falling, with CBA staff asked to work overtime and team leaders told to step in, contradicting the bank’s assertion that the voice bot would reduce weekly calls by 2,000. Holding onto the notion that the voice bot would make work easier, the bank was prepared to shed 45 customer service jobs. However, the recent reversal acknowledged that it had not properly considered all business implications. It added that its assessment of which roles were required should have been more rigorous. Moreover, it stated that affected employees can either stay on, transition to other positions within the bank, or choose to leave. It also pledged to examine its internal processes to refine its approach. So far, the union has hailed the bank’s reversal as a major victory. However, it stressed that damage had already been done. FSU National Secretary Julia Angrisano said that CBA attempts to present job cuts as innovation. She described using AI as a cover for eliminating secure jobs as a cynical cost-cutting move that workers are fully aware of. Nevertheless, the union claimed it would gather more accounts of how offshoring, automation, and AI have influenced workloads and job security, with the matter set to go before Fair Work next week. Matt Comyn said they employed 2,000 more staff in the last few months CBA’s lead Matt Comyn has been advocating for more tech infusion in the country’s banking industry. Earlier this month, the bank even partnered with OpenAI to introduce advanced AI tools for customers and employees. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has urged Australia to accelerate its AI adoption and position itself as a global AI leader. He also expressed excitement about the partnership, highlighting the opportunity to put AI in the hands of more Australians. Altman noted that OpenAI highly rated Commbank as one of Australia’s largest institutions serving millions of people and businesses daily. He noted that they were thrilled to work together to put advanced AI into the hands of more Australians. He noted that the union would make AI more useful and impactful for people and businesses across the nation. Even so, Comyn admitted the long-term implications of AI for employment are uncertain, adding that it would take years to uncover the full potential of the technology. Other global banks are confronting similar challenges, with AI chipping away employment prospects. For instance, Singapore’s DBS Holdings is set to cut close to 4,000 contract and temporary staff over the next three years as AI increasingly takes over human functions. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , global banks will slash as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years due to artificial intelligence. So far, CEO Comyn said they’ve added another 2,000 workers in recent months, noting that a large share of those roles were based in India as part of its technology build-out.

Understanding these substantial Ethereum treasury holdings offers crucial insights into the evolving market dynamics and the growing institutional confidence in ETH. Who is Amassing These Significant Ethereum Treasury Holdings? A new report, citing data from StrategicETHReserve, reveals that 69 distinct entities, each holding more than 100 Ethereum (ETH), collectively own an astonishing 4.1 million ETH. This figure represents approximately 3.39% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. This concentration underscores a clear trend of strategic accumulation by major players in the crypto space. Who are these key players? Let’s break down the leaders: BitMine Immersion Technologies: This entity holds roughly 1.5 million ETH, valued at an impressive $6.6 billion. Notably, BitMine strategically shifted its focus from Bitcoin (BTC) mining to prioritize ETH accumulation, signaling a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential. SharpLink Gaming: Following closely, SharpLink Gaming possesses about 740,800 ETH, worth approximately $3.2 billion. The Ether Machine: This holder controls 345,400 ETH. Ethereum Foundation: The foundational organization itself holds 231,600 ETH. These figures highlight a diverse range of organizations recognizing the value of Ethereum. What Do These Ethereum Treasury Holdings Mean for ETH’s Future? The accumulation of such substantial Ethereum treasury holdings by these entities carries significant implications for the broader market. When large amounts of a cryptocurrency are held off exchanges by long-term investors or foundations, it naturally reduces the available circulating supply. This can, in turn, contribute to price stability and potentially foster future appreciation. It’s not just about holding; it’s about strategic positioning within the rapidly expanding digital economy. It is also insightful to compare these private corporate holdings with other major ETH reserves. For instance, U.S. spot ETH ETFs, which are a newer development, collectively hold an even larger share: around 6.7 million ETH. This accounts for approximately 5.5% of the total supply. This comparison emphasizes the dual nature of institutional involvement in Ethereum – through direct corporate balance sheets and via regulated investment vehicles. Both types of Ethereum treasury holdings indicate robust demand. How Do Significant Ethereum Holdings Influence Market Confidence? The growing trend of significant Ethereum treasury holdings by various entities, from technology firms to gaming companies and the Ethereum Foundation itself, clearly signals strong institutional confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. This long-term perspective from major players is crucial. It contributes directly to the network’s stability and ongoing development. It also suggests that these entities are not merely speculating on short-term price movements, but are instead investing in the fundamental utility and future potential of Ethereum as a platform. Moreover, such concentrated holdings can profoundly influence market sentiment. When large, established entities are known for their substantial ETH positions, it often inspires confidence among smaller, retail investors. This, in turn, can attract even further institutional capital, creating a powerful positive feedback loop. Ultimately, this dynamic could drive greater adoption and continued innovation within the entire Ethereum network, solidifying its role in the decentralized world. In summary, the revelation that 69 entities collectively hold over 4.1 million ETH, coupled with the substantial reserves held by U.S. spot ETH ETFs, paints a compelling picture. Institutional and corporate interest in Ethereum is not just growing; it is becoming a foundational pillar of its market structure. These significant Ethereum treasury holdings stand as a testament to the network’s enduring appeal and its promising future as a cornerstone of the decentralized economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are “Ethereum treasury holdings”?

Bitcoin briefly knifed below $113K intraday before bouncing, as traders hedge into Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s high-stakes Jackson Hole address (Aug 21–23) . With dollar strength creeping back and leveraged longs getting rinsed, the question is simple: is this a healthy bull-market pause, or the start of a deeper Bitcoin correction driven by crypto market volatility? Bitcoin dropped below $113,000, source: Bitcoin Liquid Index The Dip explained: Why Bitcoin fell below $113K Profit-taking after recent highs After a powerful summer run toward new highs, fast money trimmed risk ahead of a pivotal macro catalyst (Powell). Futures data show today’s low near $112.8K before stabilizing, classic “sell the rumor” behavior into event risk. $500M+ liquidations across derivatives In the last 24 hours, >$500 million in crypto longs were liquidated as the drawdown accelerated-evidence that over-leveraged positioning amplified the move. (Source: CoinGlass, reported by Unchained.) Traders hedging ahead of Fed news The Jackson Hole symposium is a macro bellwether; Powell’s tone on growth and policy can reset risk appetite across assets, so crypto desks lightened up and added hedges into the event. Powell at Jackson Hole: Why it matters for crypto Market expectations of rate cuts or a dovish pivot Recent Fed coverage highlights growing market hopes for cuts, especially around the theme of Fed rate cuts Bitcoin correlation-but the speech is expected to be the defining macro event of the summer. A more hawkish-than-hoped message could pressure risk assets; a dovish lean could re-ignite momentum. Potential impact on risk assets like Bitcoin A firmer U.S. dollar into the event is a headwind for BTC in the short run; crypto rallies tend to breathe easier when the dollar softens. Today, a major dollar index ticked higher ahead of Powell. Historical Jackson Hole precedents and crypto moves While 1:1 causality is messy, prior Jackson Hole speeches that tilted hawkish have coincided with cross-asset risk-off days; the reverse is also true. Traders respect the event because forward-guidance shifts can ripple through yields, liquidity, and sentiment, making it a key focus for Jackson Hole Powell speech crypto analysis. Is this a pause or the start of a correction? Bull case Rate-cut hopes resurface if Powell acknowledges softer growth risks. Spot Bitcoin ETF complex remains an institutional on-ramp; flows have been choppy in August, but the wrapper is sticky demand over a multi-month horizon, even as traders debate whether this dip marks a temporary pause or signals a broader Bitcoin correction in August 2025. Bear case Macro uncertainty & stronger dollar into Jackson Hole. Over-leveraged longs just got tagged; another wave is possible if $110K fails. Technical levels to watch (spot/futures confluence) $110K: psychological round number + recent intraday wash area. $115K: near today’s bounce zone; reclaiming it flips short-term momentum neutral. $120K: first meaningful resistance; a daily close above suggests the dip was a shakeout. (Levels are for trading context, not advice.) What traders are watching next Powell’s tone, UST yields, and the dollar index (DXY) over the next 24–48 hours for knee-jerk direction. Altcoin performance (ETH, XRP, SOL): high-beta coins typically magnify BTC’s move post-event. October ETF catalysts: The SEC just pushed back decisions on several crypto ETFs-including Solana (Oct 16) and XRP (Oct 19) , clustering catalysts in October that could re-focus flows and volatility. Quick, actionable playbook (not financial advice) Into the speech: Expect wider spreads + wicks. If trading, reduce leverage, size with caution, and pre-define invalidation levels. If dollar spikes on hawkish vibes: BTC can probe $110K; watch for liquidation cascades and funding resets as a potential fade setup, only if momentum stalls. If dollar fades on dovish hints: A swift reclaim of $115K–$120K opens room for a squeeze; monitor ETF flow prints in the following sessions for confirmation. Get seen where it counts.

50428030,561622,1755759603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50428030.jpeg,Crypto Lobbyists Resist Banking Industry’s GENIUS Stablecoin Law Proposal,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-lobbyists-banking-genius-stablecoin-proposal/,"In the wake of the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a new law regulating stablecoins, tensions have emerged between traditional banking associations and cryptocurrency advocacy groups. While the US banking associations representing all fifty states have raised alarms about potential vulnerabilities in the law, two crypto organizations, the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council, have pushed back against proposed changes. Crypto Advocates Warn Against Uncompetitive Environment In a joint statement , the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council expressed their strong opposition to the letters issued on August 12, 2025, by the Bank Policy Institute and various state bankers associations. These letters aim to revisit issues that they argue were thoroughly addressed during the legislative process of the GENIUS Act. The groups contend that the proposals threaten to create an uncompetitive environment for stablecoins, prioritizing the interests of banks over broader industry growth, competition, and consumer choice. They argue that payment stablecoins are fundamentally different from bank deposits or investment products, and therefore should not be regulated in the same way. According to the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers are required to maintain one-to-one reserves in cash or high-quality liquid assets and operate under federal or qualified state licensing and supervision. The crypto groups highlight that this regulatory framework is designed to ensure that stablecoins do not function like traditional bank deposits or money market funds, emphasizing their unique role in the financial ecosystem. The advocacy groups also addressed claims that certain practices, such as exchanges sharing rewards, undermine the GENIUS Act’s prohibition on issuer-paid interest. They argue that a level playing field is essential, allowing both banks and crypto firms to innovate and compete, particularly for underbanked consumers who increasingly rely on digital wallets. Stablecoins Under Scrutiny The letter further warns that eliminating features available to stablecoin users, while permitting them for banks, would unfairly favor larger legacy institutions that often fail to provide competitive returns. One contentious point is Section 16(d) of the GENIUS Act, which allows subsidiaries of state-chartered institutions to conduct money transmission to support lawful stablecoin issuer activities across state lines. The advocacy groups argue that repealing this provision would hinder stablecoin redemption rights for out-of-state holders, potentially creating a fragmented regulatory environment that stifles interstate commerce. Additionally, the call to ban non-financial companies from issuing payment stablecoins is seen as an extreme measure that could stifle innovation. In their statement, the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council emphasize that stablecoins operate under strict reserve and supervisory requirements, with their reserves largely remaining within the traditional financial system. They argue that allowing responsibly regulated platforms to share benefits with customers is not a loophole but rather a feature that enhances financial inclusion and fosters innovation.

A recent study highlights Binance’s extraordinary lead in Binance new token trading , showcasing its powerful position in the market. This dominance is not just significant; it is truly unrivaled, reshaping how new projects gain visibility and liquidity. Unpacking Binance’s Remarkable Lead in New Token Trading According to an analysis by CryptoQuant, shared by The Data Nerd on X, Binance has cemented its status as the go-to platform for new token listings. The figures speak volumes about Binance’s commanding presence. Binance processed a staggering $133 billion in new token trading volume this year alone. This figure dwarfs its closest competitors: HTX, which handled $38 billion, and Bybit, with $35 billion. Binance’s daily market share for new token trading has also been consistently high, reaching 34% on August 13th and peaking at an impressive 54% on July 10th. This data clearly illustrates Binance’s extensive reach and the immense trust users place in the platform for accessing the latest crypto innovations. What Drives Binance’s New Token Trading Dominance? Why does Binance consistently outperform its rivals in the new token market? Several factors contribute to its formidable lead: Unmatched Liquidity: Binance offers deep liquidity pools, making it easier for traders to buy and sell new tokens without significant price slippage. This attracts both large institutional players and individual investors. Vast User Base: With millions of active users globally, Binance provides an immediate and massive audience for newly listed projects. This built-in demand is crucial for price discovery and initial adoption. Robust Listing Process: While rigorous, Binance’s listing process is perceived as a stamp of approval, lending credibility to new tokens. Projects often aspire to list on Binance due to the prestige and exposure it offers. Innovative Launchpad Initiatives: Binance Launchpad and Launchpool programs have successfully incubated and introduced numerous popular tokens, creating a strong pipeline of new assets that naturally gravitate towards the exchange for trading. These elements collectively create a powerful ecosystem that fosters robust Binance new token trading activity. Implications for the Crypto Market and Investors Binance’s overwhelming lead in new token trading has significant implications for the broader crypto market. For new projects, securing a listing on Binance can be a game-changer, providing unparalleled exposure and liquidity. This often leads to strong initial performance, though it does not guarantee long-term success. For investors, Binance’s dominance means that many of the most anticipated and high-volume new token launches will likely occur on its platform. However, investors must always exercise caution. While opportunities abound, the volatility inherent in new tokens requires thorough research and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Diversifying investments and not solely relying on initial listing pumps are wise strategies. Navigating the New Token Landscape on Binance Given Binance’s strong position in Binance new token trading , how can participants navigate this landscape effectively? It is essential to approach new token investments with a strategic mindset. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and use case before investing. Understand Volatility: New tokens are highly volatile. Be prepared for significant price swings. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Binance and the projects themselves to stay updated on developments. By adopting a disciplined approach, you can better position yourself within this exciting yet challenging segment of the crypto market. In conclusion, Binance’s impressive $133 billion in new token trading volume solidifies its position as the undisputed leader in this critical segment of the crypto market. Its vast user base, deep liquidity, and strategic listing initiatives create an environment where new tokens thrive. While this dominance offers significant opportunities, responsible investing remains paramount. Binance continues to shape the future of new token accessibility and liquidity, making it a pivotal player for anyone interested in the latest crypto innovations.

This initiative follows the recent enactment of several significant laws, including the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC bills, all aimed at shaping the future of digital assets in the United States. Keys Behind The Responsible Financial Innovation Act Since the House of Representatives passed these key crypto bills last month, the Senate Banking Committee has been crafting its version of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Under the leadership of Chairman Tim Scott and alongside Senators Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Bernie Moreno, the committee introduced the draft of the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025.” This piece of crypto legislation seeks to provide much-needed regulatory clarity, promote innovation, and address the significant risks often associated with the evolving digital asset landscape. Related Reading: Expert Touts Chainlink Advantage Over XRP In Institutional Adoption Race The Senate’s proposed framework builds on the foundation laid by the Clarity Act, which primarily aimed to empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and classify digital assets as commodities. In contrast, the Senate bill grants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) primary regulatory oversight over what it terms “ancillary assets.” Notably, the bill specifies that these ancillary assets should not be classified as securities, and transactions involving them would not fall under federal securities laws, including the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. This comes on the heels of statements from SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who suggested that only a small number of tokens could be classified as securities, depending on how they are packaged and marketed. Crypto Legislation’s Thanksgiving Deadline The bill also takes a stance on combating illicit financial activities associated with digital assets. It mandates new regulations for anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and countering the financing of terrorism. The draft unveils that one of the most pressing challenges in developing a robust digital asset market is determining how traditional banks and financial institutions fit into this evolving ecosystem.

Ye’s X account posted about the token in early Asian hours on Thursday, raising immediate concerns about it being a compromised account. It later posted a video showing Ye talking about and confirming the issuance (it is unclear if it is the real Ye or an AI generation). The token briefly touched $3.16 in early trading — a surge of nearly 6,800% from its issue price — with some trackers claiming it briefly commanded a $3 billion market cap. Behind the frenzy supposedly sits the broader YZY ecosystem, which Ye’s team has pitched as including a YZY token, a Ye Pay processor for transactions, and a YZY Card for global spending of YZY and USDC. YZY’s structure was first revealed by CoinDesk in February , which reported that 70% of supply would go directly to Ye personally, with 10% for liquidity and 20% for public sale. At the time, insiders said Ye had initially demanded an 80% stake — the same allocation structure tied to Donald Trump’s TRUMP token — before being negotiated down. The project has also carried heavy baggage from the start. Ye had previously declared that “coins prey on the fans with hype” before backtracking and approving YZY. Sources told CoinDesk the token was meant to mimic TRUMP’s success, even as Argentina was roiled by a similar scandal when President Javier Milei’s endorsed LIBRA coin collapsed as a pump-and-dump. Critics flagged then — and now — that such insider-heavy distributions tilt risk squarely toward retail buyers, especially when paired with a single-sided liquidity pool. The token distribution shows 20% allocated to the public, 10% to liquidity, and 70% to Yeezy Investments LLC, locked for 24 months under a structured vesting arrangement via Jupiter Lock. To prevent bot-driven manipulation, 25 contract addresses were initially deployed, with only one randomly selected as the official token. That 1-in-25 anti-sniping setup was billed as a fairer launch — but on-chain data suggests insiders still had advance access. Analytics account Lookonchain identified wallet 6MNWV8 as knowing the contract address in advance. The wallet even attempted to buy YZY before launch. Once live, it spent 450,611 USDC to acquire 1.29 million tokens at roughly $0.35 each. It later sold 1.04 million YZY for 1.39 million USDC, leaving 249,907 tokens worth about $600,000 — booking a profit of more than $1.5 million. “Insider wallet 6MNWV8 knew the contract address in advance and even tried buying yesterday,” Lookonchain wrote on X. OnChain Lens flagged an even larger whale who invested 12,170 SOL (about $2.28 million) for 2.67 million YZY. Current holdings are valued at $8.29 million — an unrealized gain of about $6 million. Only YZY tokens were seeded into the liquidity pool, without pairing against USDC. That single-sided setup allows developers or large holders to add and remove liquidity in ways that effectively let them cash out, a structure similar to the controversial LIBRA token. “Only $YZY was added to the liquidity pool with no $USDC. Dev may sell $YZY by adding/removing liquidity, similar to $LIBRA,” Lookonchain noted. The hype and quick gains show how much speculation still drives Solana’s memecoins. Meanwhile, YZY has already slipped to nearly $1, with some early buyers taking heavy hits. On-chain data shows wallet 6ZFnRH spent 1.55 million USDC to buy 996,453 YZY at $1.56, only to sell at $1.06 for 1.05 million USDC — booking a loss of nearly $500,000 in under two hours.

To put it to the test, we asked ChatGPT for its top picks for the next cryptos to explode . And to our delight, the AI dug deep into online chatter across platforms like X and Reddit and recent performance data from sources like CoinMarketCap to churn out a mix of utility-driven altcoins and pure community-backed meme coins. These could deliver returns strong enough to outshine the mainstream picks combined. That’s the true power of an altcoin season. Keep reading to discover ChatGPT’s top altcoins to buy right now , including what they bring to the table, their past performance, and their explosive potential ahead. 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Dogecoin on Steroids, Built for 1000x Gains Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is ChatGPT’s top pick for the best crypto to buy now . Right off the bat the AI is backing projects with low-cap, high-upside potential. Exactly the kind of explosive plays you want in this altcoin cycle. Think of Maxi as Dogecoin on pre-workout. On the surface, he looks a lot like Doge, but under the hood, he’s a different beast altogether. While Doge thrives on wholesome, cutesy vibes, Maxi is the anti-Doge. His aura is built around lifting heavy at the gym, chugging protein shakes and caffeine, and pulling all-nighters staring at charts, hunting the next 1000x crypto . That’s what $MAXI represents: raw, unfiltered, degen energy. The crypto community has rallied around Maxi’s mindset of never skipping leg day, never skipping a pump. In their eyes, there’s no point chasing 5-10% gains when the real opportunity is in 1000x returns if you’re bold enough to take the bet. So how does $MAXI plan to get those max gains? By going viral. The roadmap is built around heavy marketing and community engagement. $MAXI holders, for instance, gain access to exclusive weekly trading competitions, leaderboards, prizes, and events designed to drive demand and hype. On top of that, a huge 40% of the token’s supply is reserved for PR events, paid campaigns, and influencer collaborations, all aimed at cementing $MAXI as a top trending crypto . And the degen energy doesn’t stop there. The devs also plan to push Maxi onto major futures platforms, giving loyal $MAXI traders the perfect chance to crank up their leverage and shoot for sky-high gains. Why chase safe plays when you can go 1000x long! That’s the $MAXI ethos: life is short, crypto is wild, and the only way forward is full throttle. Currently in presale, Maxi Doge has already raised over $1.3M from early investors, with each token available at just $0.000253. Get in while it’s still under the radar! For more information, check out $MAXI’s official website or read our guide on How to Buy Maxi Doge 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Leveling the Playing Field in Meme Coin Trading Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the hottest new altcoins in presale, offering the perfect opportunity to ride the explosive growth of the meme coin market. Over the past year, meme coins have surged, with market capitalization climbing more than 81% and trading volume skyrocketing 165% , proving that this segment is attracting fresh participants and spawning thousands of new tokens daily. So how does Snorter plan to capture this momentum? By powering the Snorter Bot, a next-generation Telegram trading bot built to give retail traders the same edge as institutions. Unlike other bots in the industry, Snorter Bot offers automated execution of buy/sell limit/stop orders, letting you snipe liquidity in newly listed meme coins, beating institutions with their advanced tools. While competing with institutional whales might sound complicated, Snorter keeps things simple. Since it runs directly on Telegram, using it is as easy as sending a regular message. Place orders, monitor your crypto portfolio, or even copy trades from seasoned pros, all with straightforward chat commands. Snorter is just as secure as it is easy to use. The bot is designed with top-tier safeguards to protect you from on-chain threats like rug pulls, honeypots, and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks. With Snorter, you can dive into the meme coin arena with confidence, knowing you won’t lose your funds to malicious actors. Interested? Buy $SNORT , which also unlocks a bunch of exclusive perks, including: No daily sniping limits Lowest trading fees in the industry – just 0.85% Advanced analytics Staking rewards – currently yielding 135% The best part? Since Snorter Token is currently in presale ($3.2M+ raised), you can grab it for an ultra-low price of $0.1019. Our price prediction suggests $SNORT could reach $1.92 by 2026 – a 1,784% or nearly 18x return on your initial investment if you buy today. Visit $SNORT’s official website for more information . 3. Tutorial ($TUT) – AI-Powered Crypto Educator Turned Market Star Launched in February this year, Tutorial ($TUT) has quickly become one of the steadiest performers in the altcoin market. Since its debut, $TUT has surged over 23,300%, with most of that explosive growth credited to its massive rally in March. As the name suggests, Tutorial isn’t just another meme or speculative token; it’s built with a mission to educate users on the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and especially the BNB Chain ecosystem. At the heart of this project is the Tutorial Agent, an AI-powered educational tool designed to simplify complex crypto concepts, like trading on the best decentralized exchanges (DEXs), creating a crypto wallet, or writing smart contracts. After two months of virtually no action, $TUT surged over 9% yesterday alongside a significant spike in trading volume. This move could signal the end of its consolidation phase and the start of renewed upward momentum, fueled by growing participation in the broader crypto market. 4. Comedian ($BAN) – Chaos, Controversy, and a Fresh Breakout If you’re looking for a proven performer that has just kicked off a new rally, Comedian is a fantastic choice. The token recently broke out of a long-standing consolidation zone that had been in place since early May. Even better, it did so with a fat green candle, surging 22% in a single day . Now, Comedian looks set to retest its recent all-time highs of around $0.20, which would mean another 130% upside from current levels. So, what exactly is Comedian? At its core, it’s a hype-driven meme coin built on irony and social commentary. Its inspiration comes from the infamous modern art piece featuring a banana taped to a wall. If you’ve been on the internet long enough, you might remember how this work sparked heated debates about whether modern art is genius or just plain ridiculous. As a good community-driven meme coin, Comedian doesn’t take sides. Instead, it thrives on the chaos of internet culture, using controversy and conversation as fuel for massive investor gains. And while that might sound nonsensical to a traditional Wall Street analyst, it’s exactly this raw, unpredictable momentum that meme coins use to rocket portfolios in today’s market. Conclusion When asked to ditch the obvious choices and pick a high-risk, high-reward portfolio, ChatGPT cut through the noise and spotlighted high-upside plays with return potential no self-respecting crypto guru list will ever give you. The AI’s top suggestions include Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , Tutorial ($TUT), and Comedian ($BAN). That said, kindly keep in mind that none of the above is financial advice.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-get-ready-for-biggest-pump-of-your-lifetime-heres-why/,"A recent post by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) suggested that XRP is on the verge of a massive upward move. The analyst shared a two-week chart from Bitstamp showing the price pressing against an ascending resistance drawn from the 2021 peak through the early 2025 high and the asset’s recent all-time high, which it reached in July . At the time of the analysis, XRP was traded at $3.13, and Steph believes the current technical setup can bring significant gains. According to the analyst, “Once XRP breaks this multi-year resistance, you’ll witness the biggest pump of your lifetime.” Once #XRP breaks this multi-year resistance, you'll witness the biggest pump of your lifetime! pic.twitter.com/zvGV9p5uzP — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 20, 2025 What the Technical Setup Implies The chart highlights a classic test of the higher-time-frame resistance. On the multi-year timeline, closing above a line that has capped advances since 2021 can shift market structure. Closing above the 2021 peak of $1.96 in late 2024 helped XRP surge above $3 in early 2025, and that level has served as a crucial support throughout the year. The multi-year price compression suggests a massive move could follow the breakout, and the two-week candle reduces noise, outlining a clear direction for the asset. A breakout would trigger a transition from range behavior to a price discovery phase , and potentially, rapid expansion. The slope of the resistance line also shows progressively higher highs, which reinforces the idea that sellers have defended a moving target. If the price settles above that boundary, it would indicate a structural change with the potential to drive further movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How a Breakout Could Be Validated Analysts typically look for a decisive two-week close over the line, followed by continued strength or a successful retest that holds as support. Confirmation would be strengthened by rising participation and a clean price structure, such as higher highs and higher lows on the same timeframe. Because the presented chart focuses on structure, the key evidence is purely price-based. It asks whether XRP can print sustained closes above the 2021-2025 trendline. Well-respected analysts have set bullish targets for XRP, suggesting it could hit double digits in a few months . While the post does not predict a date or target, it isolates a clean break of a multi-year resistance line on the two-week chart as the only condition for growth. If XRP achieves that, the analyst expects outsized upside, which could contribute significantly to this double-digit target, potentially helping the asset hit even higher targets.

Cardano price today is hovering at $0.88, easing 0.3 percent in the last session. The token can’t get past the $0.93 resistance zone, and buyers are still protecting support around $0.85.

This shows that bears are still active in the $0.93–$1.00 range.

Regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act and SEC's Project Crypto boost legitimacy and institutional adoption of Ethereum. Retail and institutional interest in ether is rising, with Google Trends and ARK Invest's positions signaling growing momentum. ETH's technical setup is attractive, with $4100 as key support; a breakout above $4866 could trigger significant upside into 2025. Earlier this month, I outlined a cautious near-term stance on bitcoin . I own the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and recently took a position in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ). Today, I’m analyzing ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. To preface, I am not a crypto expert, but I like to think I’m savvy with charts and broader macro trends. So, let’s take a look at the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF ( ETH ). I have a buy rating on the product. I see a slew of bullish fundamental developments in recent months, while the chart sets up well for a year-end rally. You might recall that Fundstrat’s Tom Lee sent shockwaves across the investment world in August, calling for a $10,000 to $12,000 price target by the end of 2025. I’m not sure if I see that much upside, but with ether tagging key support, I think a bounce is quite likely over the ensuing months. ETH-USD, Bitcoin Outpacing the S&P 500 YTD StockCharts.com According to the issuer , ETH is solely and passively invested in ether. Its investment objective is to reflect the value of ether held by the Fund, less expenses and other liabilities. Ether is a digital asset that is created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Ethereum Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. The Ethereum Network allows people to exchange tokens of value, called ether, which are recorded on a public transaction ledger known as a blockchain. ETH is a moderate-sized ETF with $2.9 billion in assets under management as of August 19, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is low at just 15 basis points, and there is, of course, no yield. The fund’s share price momentum is very strong, earning it a stellar A+ ETF Grade in that category by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. Historical standard deviation metrics are very high, however, so it is a highly risky product . Finally, from a liquidity perspective , tradability is solid—average daily volume is above 3 million shares, while the 30-day median bid/ask spread is just three basis points per Grayscale. Now, turning to the bullish catalysts. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, effectively standardizing digital currencies, paving the way for wider adoption. Its passage helped bring about a fresh wave of crypto buying, with particular gains in ether. The Act brings clarity and legitimacy for stablecoins, specifically, and that should open the floodgates for wider crypto volumes, along with more institutional usage of blockchain technology and networks. The GENIUS Act's Passage Was A Watershed Moment For Crypto The White House At about the same time, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) embarked on its Project Crypto. Its aim is to establish a regulatory framework for crypto trading by giving guidance to big banks and other firms to merge onto the blockchain. The SEC will coordinate with the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to offer further directives and rulemaking across the cryptosphere. The SEC Launches ""Project Crypto"" SEC With this regulatory lattice taking shape, one of ether’s biggest champions, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, has outlined her bull case. She sees Ethereum becoming the primary institutional protocol. ARK ETFs have reportedly taken sizable stakes in ether, too. Cathie Wood Takes a ""Solid Position"" in ETH-USD X Tom Lee and Cathie Wood are obviously on board, but how is retail interest? It’s perking up, at least according to Google Search trends. Around the world, there has been a major jump in searches for “Ethereum” and “eth.” Thus, I assert that dips will be buying opportunities, particularly if we see a new all-time high in ether (more on that to come). The FOMO effect could take root. Google Trends: Ethereum and ETH Shoot Higher This Summer Google As far as large global portfolio managers’ holdings, crypto is just a small piece of the pie. According to the August 2025 BofA Global Research Global Fund Manager Survey, just 9% of investors own crypto assets of any kind. The average crypto allocation among that small group is just 3.2%. While the entire cryptocurrency market cap is only near $4 trillion, investors remain lightly allocated to the niche. BofA FMS: Light Allocation to Crypto BofA Global Research Seasonally, ether has tended to trade poorly in September, so this is a notable risk heading into the end of the third quarter. ETH-USD: Weak September Seasonality Barchart The Technical Take As regulatory frameworks get enacted and institutions begin to embrace ether, the technical situation offers a solid opportunity today, in my opinion. Notice in the chart below that ETH-USD pulled back to key support at the previous resistance level of $4100. I, in fact, added ether exposure on Tuesday, so I’m putting my money where my mouth is. Still, I’d like to see the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency climb above its November 2021 all-time high of $4866. If that were to occur, then Tom Lee’s forecast of a five-figure price could come into play. Another potential price target is near $6800. Here’s how I calculate that: If we take the $2700 depth of the December 2024 to April 2025 plunge and add that on top of the $4100 breakout that took place recently, then we get $6800. I like that the long-term 200-day moving average is back on the rise, while a high amount of volume by price is now below the current level. Moreover, take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph—it is ranging in a bullish zone between 40 and 90, just as price retreats to the polarity point. For now, $4100 is support, and $4800-$4900 is resistance.

They have officially designated RAI Finance (SOFI) as a SOFI closely monitored asset . This move signals a serious review of the project’s health and operational transparency, impacting investors and the broader market alike. What Does SOFI Closely Monitored Asset Status Mean? When a major exchange like Bithumb labels an asset as ‘closely monitored,’ it’s a clear signal to the market. This status indicates that the exchange has identified specific concerns regarding the project behind the asset. It’s not an immediate delisting, but rather a warning sign, placing the asset under intensified scrutiny. For users, this means increased risk and uncertainty. Bithumb’s decision follows a thorough review process, highlighting the exchange’s commitment to protecting its users and maintaining market integrity. Therefore, understanding the implications of this status is vital for anyone holding or considering trading SOFI. Why Was SOFI Designated a Closely Monitored Asset ? Bithumb’s official announcement detailed several key reasons for placing SOFI under close monitoring. These concerns primarily revolve around the project’s fundamental health and operational transparency. The exchange specifically cited: Deficiencies in Business Reality: Questions arose regarding the actual progress and viability of RAI Finance’s stated business model. Sustainability Issues: Concerns were raised about the long-term sustainability of the project, including its economic model and ability to maintain operations. Operational Progress Lags: Bithumb observed insufficient progress in the project’s development and operational milestones. Insufficient Transparency: A lack of clarity in project communications and financial dealings was noted. Irrational Business Plan Changes: Changes to the project’s business plan were deemed lacking in rationality and proper justification. These points collectively paint a picture of a project struggling to meet the standards expected by a leading cryptocurrency exchange. The designation as a SOFI closely monitored asset is a direct consequence of these identified shortcomings. Implications for SOFI Holders and the Market The designation of SOFI as a closely monitored asset carries significant weight. For current holders of SOFI, this status introduces considerable uncertainty and potential volatility. Historically, such announcements can lead to price declines as investors react to the increased risk. Moreover, this status often precedes more severe actions, such as a warning designation or even delisting, if the project fails to address the identified issues. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to stay informed and consider their positions carefully. The broader market also observes these actions, as they reflect on the due diligence practices of major exchanges like Bithumb. Navigating the Future of SOFI: What Should You Do? If you are holding SOFI, it’s natural to feel concerned. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcements and RAI Finance’s updates. Transparency from the project will be key to resolving this status. Assess Your Risk: Evaluate your personal risk tolerance. Given the increased uncertainty, you might consider reducing your exposure to the SOFI closely monitored asset . Diversify: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with single assets. Understand the Process: Familiarize yourself with Bithumb’s monitoring and delisting policies. Knowing the potential next steps can help you prepare. Ultimately, the onus is on RAI Finance to demonstrate significant improvements in their business reality, sustainability, and transparency to have the SOFI closely monitored asset status lifted. Until then, caution is advised. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to designate SOFI as a closely monitored asset underscores the importance of rigorous due diligence in the crypto space. This move highlights the exchange’s role in safeguarding investor interests by flagging projects that fall short of operational and transparency standards. For SOFI, this is a critical juncture, demanding immediate and substantial corrective action to regain trust and stability. The future of SOFI on Bithumb, and potentially other exchanges, now hinges on its ability to address these profound deficiencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘closely monitored asset’ mean on a crypto exchange? A ‘closely monitored asset’ status means an exchange has identified significant issues with a cryptocurrency project, such as deficiencies in business operations, sustainability, or transparency. It’s a warning signal that the asset is under intense review and could face further action, including delisting, if the problems are not resolved. Q2: Why did Bithumb specifically designate SOFI as a closely monitored asset? Bithumb designated SOFI due to identified deficiencies in RAI Finance’s business reality, sustainability, and operational progress. Additionally, concerns were raised about insufficient transparency and rationality in changes to its business plan. Q3: What are the potential consequences for SOFI after this designation? The primary consequence is increased risk and uncertainty for SOFI holders. The asset’s price may become more volatile. If RAI Finance fails to address Bithumb’s concerns, the asset could face a ‘warning designation’ or, ultimately, delisting from the exchange. Q4: Should I sell my SOFI holdings immediately? The decision to sell or hold SOFI depends on your individual risk tolerance and investment strategy. It is crucial to stay informed about official announcements from Bithumb and RAI Finance. Consider consulting a financial advisor to make an informed decision based on your personal circumstances. Q5: How can I stay updated on SOFI’s status?

What Next?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/21/shiba-inu-bulls-defend-dual-support-with-1t-volume,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained over 2% in the past 24 hours, with bulls defending key support levels on the back of strong volumes. The meme cryptocurrency fell early Wednesday as BTC and the broader market witnessed de-risking ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's impending speech. Buyers, however, stepped in closer to the $0.00001200 level, ensuring that the psychological support was maintained. The subsequent recovery also lifted prices back above the ascending trendline connecting June 22 and Aug. 2 lows, and the key level of $0.00001231, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the June-July rally. Bulls fuel SHIB comeback SHIB shakes off volatility, powers from $0.000012295 to $0.000012574 close on heavy bullish flow. Token holds critical support, smashes through resistance barriers. Next target: $0.000012700 psychological level. According to CoinDesk's AI technical insights model, $0.000012700 is the next level to beat for the bulls. Technical data points to a bullish breakout SHIB traded within a $0.000012089-$0.000012705 range, which represents a 5% spread between session extremes. Institutional interest peaked between 13:00 and 14:00, andvolume surged past 1 trillion tokens. The price held above $0.000012250, confirming a strong demand floor. Mid-session selling pressure at 13:00 failed to crack $0.000012089 support. Resistance at $0.000012600 was penetrated, triggering a volume surge to 12.8 billion tokens. CD20 Index Holds Steady Amid Token Volatility CD20 maintained range-bound trading as SHIB volatility spiked. The Index reflected institutional selectivity across major crypto holdings, with the broader market confidence persisting despite individual token swings and near-term uncertainty.

The launch, billed by Ye himself as the start of “a new economy, built on chain,” comes just months after he publicly dismissed rumors of creating a token. A New Economy or a Familiar Scheme? The token’s rollout has already stirred some controversy, with journalist Colin Wu sharing data from the GMGN trading platform, which allegedly shows that 90% of its supply is in the hands of just six wallets, raising concerns about heavy concentration and insider activity. Blockchain trackers also flagged suspicious liquidity pool setups reminiscent of the Libra coin rug pull from earlier in the year, where developers retained disproportionate control of liquidity. Additionally, Lookonchain reported that one insider flipped $450,000 worth of USDC into $3.37 million in just hours, highlighting how early entrants capitalized on privileged access. However, even with the skepticism, Kanye’s star power shone, with YZY quickly listed on CoinMarketCap while also securing exchange listings, including Bitget. Furthermore, the official site introduced not only the token but also Ye Pay, a crypto payment processor, and YZY Card, a debit solution aimed at everyday spending in YZY and USDC. It also indicated that the supply breakdown allocated 70% to Yeezy Investments LLC, 20% to public buyers, and 10% to liquidity, with vesting handled by Jupiter Lock contracts. Nonetheless, community sentiment on the meme coin is split. Pseudonymous crypto trader Defi Mochi warned that YZY’s fully diluted valuation between $2 and $3 billion was “bad risk-reward” given the fate of other meme tokens, while also pointing to suspicious timing tied to unfrozen Libra funds. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju drew comparisons to the Official Trump token, which spiked after launch but later collapsed by 88%, suggesting YZY may face a similar trajectory. Price Action and Market Outlook Data from CoinMarketCap shows YZY hit an all-time high of $3.16 within hours of its introduction before tumbling more than 66% to just under $1.00, briefly marking its all-time low at $0.91 the same day. In the last 24 hours, the meme asset has dropped over 54%, with hourly swings as sharp as 31%. At the time of this writing, its market cap had nosedived from its previous multi-billion-dollar peak to sit at around $349 million according to CMC. Traders have been both long and shorting the token aggressively. Spot On Chain reported one trader on Hyperliquid managed a $202,000 gain by shorting the token with leverage, while another repeatedly attempted long positions, racking up more than $159,000 in losses.

Unilabs Leads Google Searches With Mining Yield,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-primed-to-recapture-2024-rally-unilabs-leads-google-searches-with-mining-yield/,"The Cardano price has entered a make-or-break zone, with ADA coin traders closely watching if the crypto giant can replicate its 2024 rally. As uncertainty looms over whether ADA coin will break resistance or slip further, another name is quietly stealing the spotlight: Unilabs Finance . Surging in Google searches due to its impressive mining yield and AI-powered strategies, Unilabs is emerging as the project investors are calling the next big opportunity. Continue reading this article to find out more about Cardano price and Unilabs. Cardano Price Forecast: Breakout or Breakdown? The Cardano price is at a critical point, with ADA coin trading around $0.94 and stuck in a tightening triangle pattern. The coming sessions will determine if the Cardano price will break out or continue in retreat. The crucial resistance level to monitor is $0.98, which, if overcome, may signal the commencement of a big bullish rise for the ADA coin. A new Cardano price forecast identifies this level as the crucial threshold, where ADA coin has previously failed to break out, leaving traders cautious. As the ADA coin range narrows, the pressure to move in either direction increases. If the Cardano price can maintain its price over $0.90, momentum traders will flock to the ADA coin, driving the Cardano price higher. However, a dip below $0.85 would indicate the reverse. This would fuel bearish sentiment and perhaps send ADA coin towards new lows. Why Investors Call Unilabs the “All-Green Portfolio Builder” With the Cardano price showing a dip in its momentum, which pushed it to new heights, smart investors are looking towards new opportunities that can yield them better gains. Unilabs Finance has emerged as one such project that is currently leading search engines owing to its mining yields and its USP, which is AI-powered investment tools and strategies. Unilabs Finance is the world’s first AI-driven asset management platform that stands out with its integrated AI algorithm-driven portfolio management with a decentralized system. Despite being a new entry in the market, the platform has over $32 million in AUM, spread across 4 funds. These include BTC Fund, AI Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. This model lets investors get exposure to high-potential sectors without taking a lot of risks. This AI-powered platform eliminates the need for investors to manually screen the market for emerging opportunities. The protocol handles it for them using AI algorithms at a speed that humans can never match. Furthermore, Unilabs Finance has its Early Access Scoring System (EASS) that helps traders find upcoming crypto projects with the most growth potential. Using this, investors will have a chance to invest in emerging investments before they hit the mainstream market. The same system exists for meme coins, named the Meme Coin Identification Tool. It uses liquidity metrics, virality parameters, and listing data to detect trending meme coins before they deliver massive gains. These features combined offer investors everything that an investor needs for an all-green portfolio, minimizing risk exposure and chances of losses in deals. Unilabs Presale Crosses $14.6M: Investors Rush In Unilabs Finance is currently trending on different platforms due to its impressive mining yield, which has never been offered before. Furthermore, its presale is also behind its being trending. The presale has managed to surpass $14.6 million in presale selling over 2 billion UNIL tokens. Currently, each UNIL token is priced only at $0.0108, all set to surge to $0.012 in the subsequent round, and massively on its tier-1 exchange listing. Furthermore, by holding UNIL tokens, investors can get governance rights and also take part in their staking program. Additionally, token holders can rake in up to 30% of the platform fees as passive income, which makes Unilabs a perfect PassiveFi platform.

But Analysts Warn!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/famous-american-rapper-who-was-allegedly-involved-in-partnership-with-binance-founder-cz-launches-his-own-altcoin-but-analysts-warn/,"Famous American rapper Kanye West, who previously made news that he would launch his own token and even partner with Binance founder CZ for this token, announced the launch of his Solana (SOL)-based token called “YZY”. The price of YZY experienced a meteoric rise in just a few hours, reaching an all-time high of $3.16. However, it quickly fell back to the $1 level. According to GMGN data, the token's market capitalization has surpassed $3 billion. The six largest holders collectively control 90.38% of the token's supply. “Yeezy Money is here… A new economy built on chains,” West X said in a post on his account. West also included an image showing YZY's address and a link to a website where people can buy, sell and send YZY. “YZY Money is a concept that aims to give you control without relying on a central authority,” the website states. In addition to the YZY token, the project's official website also features a crypto payment processor called YE Pay and a debit card tool called YZY Card. It was stated that 70% of YZY’s total supply will remain under Kanye West’s control, while the remaining 30% will be shared between liquidity (10%) and investors (20%). This mirrors the trends of other famous coins, such as the TRUMP memecoin, which has encouraged West to join the crypto world. Analysts Warn About AGI! While YZY has garnered significant interest, analysts have warned that its liquidity pool is built solely using its own token, rather than being backed by a stablecoin like USDC. This, they said, opens the door to potential price manipulation by developers in the future. Coinbase's Conor Grogan also warned that 94% of Kanye West's YZY token is held by insiders. Coinbase Director of Product Strategy Conor Grogan said in a post on X that he estimates that at least 94% of YZY, Kanye West's new Solana-based memecoin, is held by company insiders. According to Grogan, 87% of YZY was initially held in a single multi-signature wallet before being split across multiple addresses, more than 3% was purchased in a single transaction by prepared wallets at market open, and approximately 7% was added to liquidity pools (LPs). *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin and other major altcoins are in the green, with altcoins particularly outperforming BTC over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin temporarily climbed above $114k while Ether hit the $4,300 mark after bouncing off the $4,100 region earlier on Wednesday. Ether could now be heading to a new all-time high as whales maintain buying pressure. Whales keep prices higher despite profit-taking Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 3% in the last 24 hours, similar to other leading altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA. The positive performance came after two days of steady declines, with the rally sparking an increase in short liquidations, with positions worth over $100 million liquidated over the past few hours. Ether’s bounce can be attributed to the resilience of whales during the market correction. Whales holding between 10K and 100K ETH grew their collective stash by 550K ETH over the past week, despite Ether losing 10% of its value during that period. However, small-scale holders embarked on massive profit-taking, with about 380k ETH sold over the last few days. Institutions continue to add ETH and BTC to their treasuries despite the market correction. Data obtained from StrategicETHReserve.xyz. showed that Ethereum digital asset treasuries (DATs) led by BitMine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming, collectively bought about 520K ETH last week In addition to that, Singapore’s largest bank, DBS, is extending its blockchain strategy by offering tokenized structured notes on the Ethereum public blockchain. DBS revealed that this latest development will mark its first time offering tokenized products to accredited and institutional investors outside its client base. Ether targets the $4,793 high if the bullish trend strengthens The ETH/USD 4-hour chart is bearish despite Ether halting its bearish run on Wednesday as it added over 4% to its value. The bulls defended the support near $4,100 and could now push the price to a new yearly high. The technical indicators are showing signs of recovery following days of weakening momentum. The RSI of 50 shows that Ether is no longer in the bearish region, while the MACD lines have also crossed over into the positive territory. At press time, ETH is trading at $4,306 per coin. If ETH continues to rise, it could recover above the $4,500 key level and retest its all-time high resistance at $4,868. An extended bullish run would ensure a new all-time high for ETH, validating another bullish pennant pattern for the top altcoin. Analysts still believe ETH could hit $6k in the medium term, but the price action remains choppy at the moment. However, if the bulls fail to build on yesterday’s momentum, ETH could bounce back from its current 4-hour TLQ level and retest the $4,070 support zone. The bulls would defend this region as failure to do so could see ETH drop to the $,3862 low.

The 20–50 EMAs at $2.96–$3.03 act as resistance, while $2.85 remains the key support. RSI near 39 signals bearish pressure, explaining why XRP price going down recently. XRP is currently trading at $2.90, down 1.5% for the day as sellers keep pushing the price down to $3.00. The token is stuck in a triangle shape that is getting smaller. The bottom support is at $2.85 and the top resistance is near $3.20.

If $2.85 fails to hold, the next demand zone rests around $2.65, where prior accumulation was seen earlier in the summer.

Announced on Thursday, DBS will initially rollout tokenized notes to eligible investors of digital platforms, including ADDX, DigiFT and HydraX. However, it plans to expand to investors on other third-party digital investment platforms. Singapore has been deepening its role as a hub for tokenized finance. The city-state’s central bank, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has been advancing industry trials under Project Guardian . It explores how asset tokenization can be integrated with existing market infrastructure. The bank’s recent move has broadened access to complex financial products, which were once reserved for its private clients. DBS’s First Tokenized Product: Crypto-Linked Notes The bank has launched new crypto-linked notes that provide access to the asset class through DBS’s digital asset ecosystem. The notes pay out in cash when there is a rise in the prices of crypto. “[This] enables them to build exposure to the asset class without having to manage any cryptocurrency,” the announcement read. “The note is also structured to mitigate potential losses should cryptocurrency prices decline.” DBS initially launched crypto-linked structured notes in September 2024, alongside crypto options trading. DBS Responds to Rising Demand There has been a strong demand for such instruments among investors, the bank said. “In the first half of 2025, DBS clients executed over US$1 billion of trades involving these instruments.” Further, trade volumes increased almost 60% from Q1 2025 to Q2 2025. Additionally, DBS will also tokenize common structured notes, including equity-linked and credit-linked notes. “Asset tokenization is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure,” said Li Zhen, Head of Digital Assets at DBS. “Our first tokenized product, a crypto-linked note, also addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets.” The post Singapore’s DBS Bank to Issue Tokenized Crypto Notes on Ethereum Blockchain appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Asset tokenization|DBS|Singapore,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-08-21 07:32:00

Whales Say Remittix Has More Upside,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepe-coin-price-prediction-can-pepe-outperform-doge-whales-say-remittix-has-more-upside/,"Over the past few days, interest in meme coins seems to have resurged, with investors betting on Pepe Coin and Dogecoin ahead of the next leg up. Retail investors have raised questions, such as whether PEPE can outperform DOGE. While retail investors continue to deliberate on meme coins, the whales look elsewhere. They are investing in a PayFi project, Remittix (RTX), which is believed to deliver more gains than PEPE and DOGE combined. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Is Meme Rally incoming? Although Pepe Coin (PEPE) has broken below the current floor, it is a high-volatility meme-coin that can be triggered by anything. Pepe coin price predictions foresee that the current pattern suggests an incoming breakout. Analysts point out that PEPE is under bullish tension and PEPE may be looking to $0.000017 in the near future. A Pepe coin price prediction by Pepethwhale stated that $PEPE is sitting right on a key support zone. If the support holds, we could see an uptrend to $0.000015. But if it breaks down, there’s a chance of a deeper pullback into lower levels. Source: Pepethwhale via X. There’s no need to rush; just wait for confirmation before making any moves. Why DOGE Still Holds Edge in Meme Rally It is probably unsurprising that Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the leading meme coin. It has maintained its unparalleled brand power, liquidity and institutional focus. PEPE has the hype, but DOGE has the market depth and the exchange capacity, which provides stability. Remember, DOGE is an established token with over $32 billion market cap. A 2x means a high amount of capital flow, which is impossible. Pepe coin price prediction, on the other hand, also points to modest gains. Hence, Remittix (RTX) seems to be the best option. Remittix (RTX), The Payfi Project Set To Outshine DOGE And PEPE with Real Utility Amid meme chatter, a surprising altcoin is gaining traction among whale investors. Remittix (RTX) is positioned as a PayFi token. It allows crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, supports multiple currencies and offers real-time FX conversion. Users send cryptocurrencies automatically converted with live FX rate on the app and recipients receive fiat instantly in their bank accounts. It bridges a $19 trillion gap between traditional payment (Web2) and cryptocurrency (Web3). Remittix highlights: Remittix is built for global remittances and freelancer payments and is used by merchant platforms. Built on trust and transparency, security is tight with a CertiK audit and locked liquidity/team tokens. An upcoming wallet (currently in beta) will launch in Q3. Remittix is built for adoption and real use, not speculations like meme coins.

Analyst Javon Marks sees repeating patterns that could send the asset to $8, a 740% gain. ADA futures funding rate flipped positive, signaling increased bullish positioning despite recent trading volume decline. Whale Accumulation Signals Renewed Interest Cardano (ADA) is showing renewed activity after large investors accumulated a substantial amount of tokens. Data from Santiment shared by analyst Ali Martinez shows that whale wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million ADA added 100 million coins in the past 24 hours. This move increased total holdings in that range to about 18.65 billion ADA. 100 million Cardano $ADA scooped up by whales in the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/nA8qNyGBkB — Ali (@ali_charts) August 20, 2025 Meanwhile, ADA’s price has been trading between $0.86 and $0.88, after pulling back from recent highs near $1. The increase in whale accumulation during this dip suggests that larger investors are positioning at lower levels. Historically, this type of buying has sometimes provided support during market corrections. Price Action and Technical Outlook At the time of press, ADA was trading at $0.88, up 3% in the last 24 hours, but remained 10% down during the last week. The recovery at crucial support zones has anchored the token after sustained drops in the recent past. Analyst Javon Marks noted that Cardano’s current price structure is showing similarities to its previous market cycle. Charts comparing past and present cycles indicate that ADA may be forming the same corrective and impulsive phases that preceded its earlier rally. Marks suggested that if the pattern continues, ADA could move toward $8, representing more than a 740% increase from current levels. Source: X Derivatives Market Activity Futures and derivatives data also point to rising trader interest. Coinglass reported that ADA open interest dropped 4% to $1.61 billion, while trading volume fell 18% to $5.27 billion. Despite this, the funding rate flipped positive to 0.0072%, meaning long traders are paying shorts. Remarkably, such shifts have often been followed by price rallies, as seen in early July. Source: Coinglass Additionally, CryptoPotato recently reported that ADA futures volume surged on August 14 to $7 billion, the highest level since March 2025. This sharp rise suggests a growing focus on ADA within the derivatives market. Beyond whale buying and derivatives activity, Cardano has also attracted institutional attention. Grayscale recently created a Delaware-based trust for ADA, sparking discussion about a possible spot ETF in the future. This has fueled speculation that ADA may continue to see increased interest from larger investors.

50429217,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79465,1755761606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"SUI and ADA Have Been on Fire in 2025, but This New Crypto Might be Better",https://timestabloid.com/sui-and-ada-have-been-on-fire-in-2025-but-this-new-crypto/,"The 2025 market cycle has already delivered fireworks for altcoin investors, with projects like SUI and Cardano (ADA) ranking among the standout performers. SUI’s rapid ascent has been fueled by its reputation as a scalable, developer-friendly Layer 1, attracting attention from DeFi and gaming ecosystems. Cardano, meanwhile, has continued its slow but steady climb, leveraging upgrades to its smart contract functionality and growing institutional interest in its staking model. For traders who positioned themselves early, the rewards have been substantial. Yet as both projects gain traction, some analysts argue the biggest profits of this cycle may not come from established names like ADA or SUI. Instead, attention is shifting toward emerging small-cap contenders , where modest inflows can ignite exponential upside. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. SUI’s Rise Reflects Growing Appetite for Scalable Layer 1s SUI has quickly gained recognition as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems of 2025. Its architecture emphasizes scalability and transaction speed, offering an attractive environment for both developers and users frustrated by congestion on other networks. NFT platforms, gaming projects, and DeFi protocols have increasingly chosen SUI as their base, helping the token achieve double-digit percentage gains month after month. Analysts highlight that SUI’s trajectory underscores how much demand exists for performance-driven blockchains. However, the coin’s expanding market capitalization also makes it harder to deliver the kind of parabolic moves early investors crave. For traders chasing 20x or 50x gains , the focus inevitably turns to assets with smaller valuations and greater room to grow. Cardano Shows the Power of Patience Cardano has also been a key player in 2025. The launch of long-awaited governance upgrades, combined with the expansion of decentralized applications on its network, has renewed confidence in ADA’s potential. Its community-first approach and emphasis on academic rigor have paid dividends, allowing Cardano to maintain its reputation as one of the most credible Layer 1s in the market. Still, while ADA’s price appreciation has been meaningful, many in the market acknowledge its upside is constrained compared to its early years. With billions already invested and a long track record of adoption, ADA now competes as a “blue-chip” altcoin – offering stability but not necessarily the meteoric returns many investors seek in a bull market. Momentum shifts when established giants consolidate, and this is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is beginning to separate itself. Unlike ADA and SUI, which already require massive inflows to move the needle, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the earliest stage of its lifecycle. Its presale has generated intense interest, with rounds selling out in record time as investors recognize the potential to catch a coin before it lists on major exchanges. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE unique is how it blends crypto’s profit potential with cultural momentum, tapping into the political conversation shaping headlines globally. Analysts argue this creates a perfect storm: scarcity-driven tokenomics, explosive demand , and cultural resonance that mirrors the early days of DOGE and SHIB. The result is a setup where small amounts of capital can generate the kind of exponential upside no longer possible for larger-cap assets. Why Smaller Caps Can Deliver Bigger Returns The difference between projects like ADA or SUI and early-stage coins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE comes down to market dynamics. Established projects must attract billions in liquidity to sustain major rallies, while smaller caps can move dramatically on much less. This is why seasoned traders often allocate a portion of their portfolios to emerging names – the risk-to-reward ratio can far outpace what’s available with larger players. As MAGACOIN FINANCE approaches the close of its presale, with scarcity tightening and demand accelerating, many investors view it as the kind of rare opportunity that only appears once every few cycles. Its ability to combine branding strength, presale enthusiasm, and a supportive macro environment has positioned it as a standout contender heading into 2025’s bull market expansion. Conclusion SUI and ADA’s performances in 2025 highlight the enduring strength of established ecosystems. Both coins continue to play critical roles in the broader market, with strong communities and robust technology to back them. Yet for those searching for the next big wealth generator , the spotlight is turning toward smaller projects with the ability to multiply quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents that kind of opportunity – an altcoin still in its infancy but already generating traction that resembles the early trajectories of crypto’s greatest success stories . For investors who missed the initial waves of ADA or SUI, this may be the second chance they’ve been waiting for.

Key Takeaways: A dormant Bitcoin whale shifted over $90M in BTC, selling on Hyperliquid and rotating into Ethereum. The whale opened massive leveraged long positions worth $295M across four wallets. This comes as Ethereum faces $678M in ETF outflows and sharp price volatility near $4,000. According to data from Onchain Lens , a wallet that withdrew 14,837 BTC ($94.9 million) seven years ago recently deposited 660 BTC into decentralized exchange Hyperliquid over the past 20 hours. The whale sold a large portion and later opened leveraged long positions in Ethereum. Whale Shifts $45.5M in BTC to ETH on Hyperliquid Fresh activity shows an additional 400 BTC ($45.5 million) was deposited into Hyperliquid, with the funds swapped for ETH on the spot market. The whale then bridged the ETH back to the Ethereum mainnet, consolidating a holding of 11,744 ETH worth $50.6 million. Onchain data reveals even larger bets in play. The whale opened long positions totaling 68,130 ETH ($295 million) across four different wallets, using 3x and 10x leverage. Screenshots shared by Onchain Lens show open positions valued between $90 million and $99 million each.

Ethereum recently surged alongside Bitcoin, attracting attention from whales seeking higher upside potential in leveraged derivatives markets. As reported, Ethereum tumbled to $4,063 on Wednesday after a wave of forced liquidations and heavy selling by ETF giants BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, who collectively dumped over $422 million worth of ETH in just 24 hours. The move has shaken investor confidence and sparked debate over whether Ethereum’s 200% rally in recent months has finally run out of steam. Data from SoSoValue shows the withdrawals marked the third consecutive day of ETF outflows, totaling $678 million over three sessions. Fidelity led with $156 million in redemptions, followed by Grayscale with $122 million, while Bitwise, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton posted smaller but notable sell-offs. Although ETH briefly recovered to around $4,223 after testing the $4,063 level, pressure remains high. Ethereum Investors to Shift Back to Bitcoin as ETH Soars As reported, Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow has suggested that Ethereum’s latest rally could be setting up a reversal , with capital eventually flowing back into Bitcoin. Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm Jan3, claimed that many long-term ETH holders, particularly early insiders from the ICO era, already own significant amounts of Bitcoin. According to him, these investors are rotating BTC into ETH to “pump it on new narratives” such as the emergence of Ethereum treasury companies. Once prices rise sufficiently, he predicts they will sell their ETH, leaving “new generational bagholders,” and move the profits back into Bitcoin. “No one wants ETH in the long run,” he said.

Amidst the bullish sentiments, STG extended its rally as the race to purchase Stargate Finance takes an unexpected turn. The Wormhole Foundation has confirmed its intent to acquire the cross-chain liquidity network, challenging LayerZero’s $110 million offer . The move renewed interest in the deal, with STG holders anticipating increased benefits with a competitive acquisition. Wormhole Foundation @WormholeFdn · Follow At the WF, we have respect for the @StargateFinance protocol, its team, and especially its holders. Stargate is a leader in multichain asset transfers. That’s why we’re stepping up with our intent to acquire Stargate – to ensure holders get the fair deal they deserve. 7:03 PM · Aug 20, 2025 1.3K Reply Copy link Read 358 replies Wormhole highlighted that it trusts LayerZero’s valuation undermines Stargate’s ecosystem potential and growth trajectory. Thus, the foundation has requested a hiatus in the ongoing LayerZero proposal snapshot vote (for five business days) to create time for a massive acquisition bid for Stargate. Besides making the bidding competitive, Wormhole’s claims suggest that Stargate’s worth in the cross-chain sector exceeds the initial $110 million offer. LayerZero’s proposal under scrutiny LayerZero’s bid to acquire Stargate attracted attention as it signals a bold move toward cementing its position as a dominant cross-chain interoperability and messaging platform. Stargate operates as a liquidity transport layer, and its functionalities match LayerZero’s strategy of facilitating seamless asset movements and communications across blockchains. LayerZero’s proposal added: This offer is designed to accelerate both Stargate and LayerZero, giving Stargate the resources to ship on an aggressive roadmap that expands its prerogative outside of bridging, while tying as an incredible, revenue-generating protocol that touches the end-consumer deeper into the LayerZero ecosystem. Nevertheless, Wormhole Foundation’s new move challenges the initial deal. Wormhole stated that LayerZero’s valuation underestimates the cross-chain’s long-term potential, especially as multi-chain platforms gain traction in the evolving blockchain sector. The request to pause ZRO’s community vote hints at a more formal, attractive offer that could ensure more value for STG investors and the Stargate partners. Why does Wormhole want Stargate? Wormhole is an interoperability network that facilitates billions in cross-chain transactions, while connecting over 30 blockchains. In April, it collaborated with Mercado Bitcoin to fuel the tokenization sector. With Stargate’s acquisition, Wormhole will integrate a lucrative liquidity layer to supercharge its messaging ecosystem. That could enrich Wormhole’s ecosystem beyond security and messaging to incorporate liquidity provision, which remains paramount in the DeFi world. STG price outlook Stargate’s native token soared over 10% from $0.1642 to a $0.1813 intraday peak. STG hovers at $0.1730 after a slight correction from 24-hour highs. Its daily trading volume jumped 435%, signaling intensified trader activity in the past few sessions. Chart by Coinmarketcap The remarkable performance signals enthusiasm among the Stargate community. STG holders likely believe that competitive bidding might unlock more benefits for investors and recognition of Stargate as a key player in the interoperability movement. Meanwhile, broad market performance will shape STG’s trajectory. Continued recoveries would trigger extended gains for the alt, while another downside would erase the recent gains and possibly catalyze substantial price dips.

Amazon is developing a higher-end Fire tablet that will, for the first time, run on the Android operating system, according to six people familiar with the matter. The effort, internally code-named “Kittyhawk,” could debut as early as next year. Amazon will use the Android OS to revamp fire tablets Fire tablets have long lacked access to the full range of apps available on Google’s Play Store , which discouraged developers as they’d have to build separate versions of their apps for Fire devices. “Consumers have always expressed a concern about not having access to the latest Android versions, not having access to some of their apps because Amazon used their own store,” said Jitesh Ubrani, a researcher at IDC. “It’s meant more work for developers in this day and age of largely free apps or services.” Despite these drawbacks, Amazon has sold millions of Fire tablets by pursuing a low-cost strategy. The devices have typically been priced near manufacturing cost. According to IDC, Amazon holds 8% of the global tablet market, just behind Lenovo at 8.2%. Apple and Samsung remain the leaders with 33.1% and 18.7% respectively. The new Android-based Fire tablet would be a notable shift for Amazon, as it has historically avoided relying on third-party software. One version under discussion carries a price tag of about $400 which is nearly double the current top-end Fire Max 11 at $230. By comparison, Apple’s iPads range from $350 to $1,200. Specific technical details about the device remain undisclosed. Amazon’s Fire Phone was first launched in 2014. It failed to gain traction and was discontinued at a loss of $170M. But in recent years, the company has shown more openness to external technology. For example, it has integrated Anthropic’s Claude AI system into Alexa+ and other services. The Kittyhawk project is expected to start with a premium model, while lower-cost Fire tablets will continue to use Amazon’s Linux-based Vega operating system in the near term. Over time, however, Amazon plans to shift the full lineup to Android. Amazon declined to comment on the project, saying it does not respond to rumors or speculation. Insiders caution that Kittyhawk could still face delays or even cancellation due to financial or strategic concerns. Google introduces Pixel 10 with expanded AI features In related news, Alphabet’s Google unveiled its latest Pixel 10 smartphones and a suite of connected devices at its annual “Made by Google” event in New York. The Pixel 10 lineup features new AI tools, including a “coach” in the camera app that guides users to take better photos and an assistant that surfaces contextually relevant information, such as displaying a flight confirmation email when a user calls an airline without requiring explicit input. Pricing begins at $799 for the standard model and $1,799 for the foldable version, holding steady despite concerns about U.S. tariffs. Google also introduced the Pixel Watch 4 and updated Pixel Buds 2a earbuds, while the higher-end Pixel Buds Pro 2 received only minor updates. Although Android powers more than 80% of smartphones worldwide, Google’s Pixel brand remains a small player in the market. In the second quarter, it accounted for just 1.1% of global shipments, up slightly from 0.9% a year earlier, according to IDC. In its largest market, the United States, Pixel’s share slipped from 4.5% to 4.3%. Industry observers have noted that Google’s hardware efforts are as much about showcasing Android’s potential as they are about direct competition with Apple. The company moved its event to the summer last year in an attempt to preempt Apple in promoting AI-enabled features on phones. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Pullback linked to U.S. inflation and producer price index data, not structural weakness. Ethereum maintains key support above $4,100, keeping its bullish outlook intact. After a sharp pullback, the crypto market is showing early signs of recovery. The global market cap stands at $3.87 trillion, up 1.2% in the past day, with Bitcoin trading near $113,700 and Ethereum above $4,290. According to Coinbase’s Head of Research, David Duong, the recent market pullback began with U.S. economic data. Inflation numbers from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) looked fine earlier last week at 2.7%. But then came the Producer Price Index (PPI), which surprised the market. At the same time, traders are watching the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, where the Federal Reserve could deliver “hawkish” signals about interest rates. This created the perfect excuse for a cool-off after months of gains in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. In short, the pullback was less about disaster and more about timing.

50430126,561711,1755763200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50430126.jpeg,US Treasury Secretary Expects Stablecoin Industry To Boost Government Bonds Demand – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-secretary-stablecoin-boost-bonds/,"The US Treasury Secretary has reportedly contacted leading crypto industry players to discuss the potential impact of the stablecoin sector on the demand for US government bonds in the coming years. Treasury Secretary Bets On The Crypto Industry On Wednesday, the Financial Times (FT) reported that the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is “betting” on the crypto industry to become a key buyer of US Treasuries in the coming years. Following the enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in July, digital assets pegged to the US dollar are required to be backed on a one-to-one basis by US dollars or Treasury bills. Sources familiar with the discussions told the news media outlet that Secretary Bessent has signaled to Wall Street that he expects the industry to “become an important source of demand for US government bonds” as Washington seeks to bolster demand for a surge of new US government debt. According to FT, Bessent has contacted leading stablecoin issuers , including Circle and Tether, for information, revealing the Treasury Department’s alleged plans to increase sales of short-term bills for the coming quarters. The report noted that the focus on the sector follows investors’ concerns about the US’s deteriorating public finances, adding that the Treasury Department’s hopes are also a sign of the White House’s “drive to bring crypto to the heart of US finance.” “The recent passage of the Genius Act is a significant development which we are monitoring as it will promote innovation in stablecoins and grow demand for short-term Treasury securities” the Treasury Department told FT, explaining that “issuance plans will continue to be informed by a variety of inputs including that from investors, primary dealers and the Treasury borrowing advisory committee”. Jay Barry, head of global rates strategy at JPMorgan Chase, told FT that “[Secretary Bessent and the Treasury department] absolutely think that stablecoins will be a real source of new demand for Treasuries. And that is absolutely why [Bessent] is comfortable weighting issuance towards [short-term debt].” A Multi-Trillion ‘Gold Rush’ Era? Notably, the Treasury Secretary previously affirmed that “this groundbreaking technology will buttress the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, expand access to the dollar economy for billions across the globe, and lead to a surge in demand for U.S. Treasuries, which back stablecoins.” Adding that “The GENIUS Act provides the fast-growing market with the regulatory clarity it needs to grow into a multitrillion-dollar industry.” Similarly, Goldman Sachs asserted that the industry is “at the beginning of a stablecoin gold rush,” which could potentially bring the $271 billion global market to trillions of dollars, Fortune reported . “Stablecoins are a $271bn global market, and we believe USDC (…) benefits from market share gains on and off of partner Binance’s platform, as ongoing stablecoin legislation legitimizes the ecosystem, and the crypto ecosystem expands, also potentially catalyzed by legislation,” the report highlighted, citing the bank’s research paper from August 20. Payments are the most obvious source of (total accessible market) expansion for stablecoins over the longer term. This opportunity is largely untapped so far, with the majority of stablecoin activity being driven by crypto trading activity and demand for dollar exposure outside of the U.S. Nonetheless, not everyone in the financial sector believes that the sector will boost the demand for US government bonds. Global Chief Economist at financial services firm UBS, Paul Donovan, shared a more skeptical approach with clients on Wednesday morning. According to Fortune, Donovan noted that the Treasury Secretary is “reportedly getting excited that stablecoins might increase demand for short-dated U.S. Treasuries, helping finance the unsustainable U.S. fiscal position. However, stablecoins are more about redistributing money supply.” “Someone selling Treasury bills to buy stablecoins, which invest the money in Treasury bills, does not change demand for U.S. debt instruments,” he concluded.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Circle|Crypto legislation|GENIUS Act|Scott Bessent|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoins|Tether|us bonds|US Treasury Department|US Treasury Secretary,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 08:00:00

Some analysts suggested that the altcoin is ready to break out to new highs, but warned that a rejection from the current levels could lead to volatile retests. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop Below $110,000 Despite Bounce – Is A 15% Pullback Coming? Chainlink Reclaims Key Levels On Wednesday, Chainlink led the crypto market as it started to recover from the recent pullback, which saw most cryptocurrencies retest their range lows for the first time in two weeks. LINK recorded the second-best performance among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, with an 11% increase in the past day. Notably, the altcoin hit a six-month high of $26.76 on Monday, after recovering 14% from the weekend lows. As it hit its multi-month high, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Chainlink added nearly 3,000 new addresses. According to the post, 2,995 new LINK addresses were created on August 18, the highest growth in 5 months. However, the start-of-week correction halted the bullish momentum, sending the cryptocurrency’s price to retest its breakout zone, around the $23.50 mark on Tuesday. After testing this area as support, Chainlink rebounded and reclaimed the $24.50-$25 range, briefly hitting the $26.50 barrier on Wednesday morning before retracing. Analyst Rekt Capital asserted that LINK is attempting to reclaim the $23.86-$34 price area after the recent performance. He highlighted that the lows of this range have historically been a “key support and successful retests here have enabled rallies to the Range High around $34.” Chainlink’s continued stability at the $23.86 level will be crucial for the rally to the range high. The market watcher noted that volatility below this range is possible as part of a volatile retesting process. LINK’s Levels To Watch The cryptocurrency’s monthly close is one of the most important levels to watch, as closing above the range low would position Chainlink for a bullish rally continuation. On the contrary, failing to reclaim this area in the monthly timeframe could lead to a deeper pullback toward the $19.41 level, not seen since the early August breakout. Rekt Capital explained that this level “has often acted as a volatile retest zone in bullish cycles, serving as a base for successful reversals, most prominently in mid-2021,” concluding that the cryptocurrency’s next move will be determined by a reclaim of the $23.86 resistance or a volatile retest of the $19.41 support. Altcoin Sherpa suggested that Chainlink will continue its path to the $30 barrier if the flagship cryptocurrency continues its uptrend. He affirmed that if Bitcoin loses the $110,000 support, LINK will likely see another dip.

Meanwhile, market watcher CW asserted that Chainlink faces one more key area before rallying to $30. According to the post, if LINK breaks through the current sell wall, around the $26.25-$26.75 levels, it will continue its run toward the $30 resistance, where another selling wall is situated. As of this writing, Chainlink trades at $26.15, a 35% increase in the monthly timeframe.

50430718,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/what-happened-to-mags-500m-tokenization-deal-with-mantra,1755764277,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/50430718.jpeg,What Happened to MAG’s $500M Tokenization Deal with Mantra?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/what-happened-to-mags-500m-tokenization-deal-with-mantra,"In July 2024, MAG Group announced a $500 million tokenization pilot with blockchain platform Mantra , aiming to bring Dubai’s luxury real estate on-chain. The plan turned heads across both crypto and property markets, promising high-yield vaults targeting 8% APY, boosted by $OM token incentives, and a showpiece property — a $75 million Ritz-Carlton mansion — designed to symbolize the dawn of a new era. For months, Mantra rode a wave of publicity. Panels, interviews, and headlines framed the partnership as the start of “democratized” real estate investing. But as 2025 began, reality looked less dramatic. The vaults never materialized, the Ritz-Carlton remained off-chain, and updates grew fewer. By spring, the once-hyped project seemed stalled. Industry chatter pointed to hurdles: complex regulatory requirements, an overly retail-focused approach, and possible strategic friction with MAG itself. The pioneering announcement had given Mantra visibility, but visibility alone wasn’t enough to sustain momentum. This May, MAG surprised the market with a new declaration: the $500 million pilot had been replaced by a $10 billion mandate, this time powered by Mavryk Network and backed by Multibank . The same Ritz-Carlton mansion that once headlined Mantra’s deal was back — only now part of a vastly larger portfolio including landmark developments like The Ritz-Carlton Residences and Keturah Reserve. What began as a $500 million experiment is now a $10 billion transformation. In the words of MAG’s leadership, Mavryk is “the clear leader in real estate tokenization” and has been appointed as MAG’s exclusive blockchain partner in the GCC. While Mantra positioned itself with retail-style products and token rewards, Mavryk’s approach has been institutional from the start. Its purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain provides the compliance, scalability, and security needed for multi-billion-dollar transactions. Paired with Multibank’s upcoming RWA Exchange, Mavryk offers not just tokenization, but a functioning ecosystem for trading, lending, and borrowing against real estate assets. That kind of infrastructure appealed to MAG, which needed more than a marketing narrative — it needed a partner who could deliver. With $10 billion in assets moving on-chain , Mavryk and MAG now account for roughly half of the global RWA tokenization market. The leap from a $500 million pilot to a $10 billion commitment represents not just growth but confidence — a 20x increase in deal flow that signals institutional trust in Mavryk’s capabilities. This isn’t simply about flashy properties. It’s about liquidity, compliance, and investor access. Through MultiBank.io, assets will trade on a regulated platform, enabling capital markets to interact with tokenized real estate in ways that were promised but never realized under Mantra. Industry observers note that Mantra’s original deal was important in opening the conversation. It proved that developers like MAG were serious about blockchain adoption. But without execution, the vision remained theory. Mavryk’s arrival changes the equation. By taking over the same properties Mantra once promised to tokenize — and scaling that promise twentyfold — Mavryk is positioned to deliver where its predecessor could not. The baton has been passed, but the race is far from over. For investors, this moment marks the shift from “what if” to “what’s next.” With MAG and Multibank backing Mavryk, the $10 billion initiative could set a global benchmark for how real-world assets are brought to blockchain. The story of Mantra is not one of total failure, but of groundwork laid and lessons learned. The story of Mavryk is about execution — and about transforming those lessons into the largest real estate tokenization deal in history.
