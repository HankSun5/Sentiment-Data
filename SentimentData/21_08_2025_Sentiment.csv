The world’s largest cryptocurrency holds a market cap of $2.27 trillion, with 19.9 million BTC in circulation out of a capped supply of 21 million. Despite the recent rebound, the charts show BTC struggling to hold above its short-term support zones. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Key Levels Ahead On the technical front, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC has slipped beneath its 50-day moving average ($116,033), which has flipped into resistance. The rejection near $124,450 carved a bearish engulfing candle, signaling momentum loss after July’s rally. Traders are now watching the neckline of a potential head-and-shoulders pattern around $112,000. A breakdown below this level could accelerate declines toward $108,000 and possibly $105,150, as shown in TradingView’s projected path. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum signals back this caution. The MACD has crossed into negative territory, while the RSI at 44 leaves room for further downside. Consecutive bearish candlesticks resemble the start of a three black crows pattern, often linked with deeper pullbacks. Yet, the longer-term structure is less bleak. Since June, Bitcoin has defended a series of higher lows, with small-bodied dojis near $113K showing indecision rather than panic selling. Should buyers retake $116,150, the path opens toward $120,900, then $124,450, with a breakout potentially extending to $127,540 and the long-anticipated $130K level. Fundamental Outlook: Armstrong’s $1M Call While the charts point to short-term caution, fundamentals remain highly supportive. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on August 20 that he expects Bitcoin to reach $1 million per coin by 2030. Armstrong described this as the “rough idea” in his head, highlighting adoption, innovation, and technological improvements as drivers of exponential growth. JUST IN: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicts Bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 by 2030. pic.twitter.com/rT95DfJbTG — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 20, 2025 No model, but the bigger picture is accumulation, supply is shrinking, and use cases are expanding. So long term investors can be confident even if short term traders are navigating volatility. Outlook for Traders and Investors For traders the playbook is clear: close above $116K and long to $124K-$130K, close below $112K and short to $108K. For investors this is an accumulation zone in a bigger bull run. In the bigger picture Armstrong’s $1M call shows how market leaders see Bitcoin not as a speculative asset but as a long term foundation of digital finance. Whether BTC retests $108K or goes to $130K in the short term the road ahead is higher over the next few years. New Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $10.8 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012755—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

50410625,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788645,1755730770,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50410625.jpeg,Coinbase bets everything on stablecoins becoming the backbone of AI-driven payments,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-bets-everything-on-stablecoins/,"Coinbase has decided that stablecoins are now the center of everything. The company is banking on these digital dollars to become the financial engine behind AI-powered apps, bots, and machines. And it’s already started pushing that future. According to Bloomberg, the company hosted a hackathon in Brooklyn during a boiling-hot August weekend where around 100 developers from places like Malaysia and Italy coded tools that let software send and receive payments using stablecoins. Developers built prototypes like a publishing platform that pays writers instantly, a chatbot that charges a few cents per answer, and a group-chat marketplace where users can buy and sell with each other, without ever touching traditional finance. The event was all about building financial infrastructure for AI systems that will need to handle payments on their own; buying services, paying cloud fees, and making micro transactions automatically, around the clock. Coinbase pushes x402 as AI’s payment backbone Coinbase is trying to lead this charge with x402, an open-source protocol it named after a long-unused internet error code: “402 Payment Required.” It’s built for bots, apps, or any connected software to charge and settle instantly using stablecoins over the internet. Whether it’s a couple of pennies for an AI tool or a few dollars for digital content, the goal is real-time payment without needing PayPal, Visa, or a bank wire. Nemil Dalal, who runs the Coinbase Developer Platform, said this strategy goes straight back to what Brian Armstrong wrote in his “Secret Master Plan” almost a decade ago, a plan that started with speculation, moved to infrastructure, and ends with a fully open, global financial system. “Like literally, that’s exactly what we’re doing,” said Nemil. “Now we’re in the app era. People are creating tons of different apps. And then we’re going to see a large amount of things come up from that.” During the Brooklyn hackathon, developers were encouraged to use x402 in their projects. Ben Reilly’s team added it to a chatbot that could collect payments directly from users. “The killer app for crypto, that’s very obvious, is stablecoin payments,” said Ben. His teammate, Alvaro Echevarria Cuesta, said the reason was simple: “Building your whole financial system on top of stablecoins gives you a lot more freedom than being bound by Stripe, PayPal, and all the restrictions they put in there.” Coinbase is making a hard push to become the go-to toolkit for developers, the same way Amazon Web Services became the silent backbone of the internet. Their pitch is simple: forget casino coins, and start wiring software to make payments using tools that actually work at scale. Congress clears the way as competitors close in Coinbase isn’t alone, and the race is getting tight. Stripe acquired a company called Bridge that builds stablecoin infrastructure and is now working on its own blockchain. PayPal has already launched its own stablecoin, leaning on its huge user base to drive usage. Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard are still sitting on decades of built-in merchant systems, regulatory capital, and global reach. What’s pushing Coinbase to act fast is Washington. Congress passed the first US law regulating stablecoins this summer. It forces issuers to hold reserves and gives developers a clear legal pathway to build on top of them. That legal clarity is already pulling more builders into the space. Vishal Gupta, a former Coinbase and Circle executive who judged the hackathon, said it flatly: “Anytime you have clarity, it enables the next wave.” Now Vishal is running a firm called True Markets that’s also backing stablecoin payment systems. His view? Crypto isn’t just trading anymore. It’s becoming something people can use. “We can actually use some of these native crypto rails in real consumer products and real B2B products,” he said. Coinbase still makes most of its money from trading, which is volatile and competitive. The company also shares stablecoin revenue with Circle, which went public earlier this summer. But none of this is guaranteed. Most people still rely on existing payment rails. AI is still unpredictable. Consumer habits change slowly. And the old financial systems have deep roots. Still, for that weekend in Brooklyn, the builders dreamt. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Some are thriving on community power, others on ecosystem growth, and a few on presale traction. Among the best cryptocurrencies to buy today, four projects lead the list: Cold Wallet (CWT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Cold Wallet is advancing with a live app and cashback utility, while DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE stay popular for their strong communities and active trading. Together, they offer a mix of early-entry potential, meme-driven hype, and real-world use cases worth following this month. 1. Cold Wallet: Presale Growth, Cashback Rewards, & Big ROI Potential Cold Wallet is proving why many see it as the best crypto to buy today. Now in Stage 17 of its presale, CWT is priced at $0.00998. So far, it has raised $6.3 million and sold more than 740 million tokens, showing strong traction. With a fixed launch price of $0.3517, current buyers could see up to 37× returns, or about 3,600%, if the target is hit. Early buyers at $0.007 during Stage 1 could potentially make up to 50×. Cold Wallet is also listed on CoinMarketCap, giving users live updates on progress, sales, and funds raised. What sets Cold Wallet apart is that it’s not waiting until launch to prove itself. The wallet app is already live on both Android and iOS. Users get cashback in CWT for gas fees, swaps, bridges, and on/off-ramps, with no staking or lockups required. This means that everyday activity turns into earnings instead of costs. Security audits are being carried out by Hacken, with CertiK reviewing the platform as well. Adoption was boosted further when Cold Wallet acquired Plus Wallet for $270 million, instantly adding more than 2 million active users. On top of that, a referral program gives users immediate USDT payouts and future CWT rewards, adding both short-term incentives and long-term value. This mix of live product, growing user base, referral mechanics, and strong presale momentum makes Cold Wallet a rare presale project delivering actual utility today. With early entry pricing and clear adoption strategies, it stands out as the best crypto to buy today for those looking at both ROI potential and a product that already works. 2. Dogecoin: Meme Power With Staying Strength Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the top meme coin by recognition. Trading around $0.199 with a $28.6 billion market cap and daily volumes of $1.2 billion, DOGE has gained 3% in the past 24 hours. It’s not just hype; it’s widely used for tipping, online payments, and merchandise. With recent updates aimed at lowering transaction fees and boosting efficiency, DOGE stays relevant. Backed by deep liquidity and loyal fans, it remains one of the best cryptos to buy today for traders seeking volatility and meme-driven momentum. 3. Shiba Inu: Expanding Beyond Meme Status Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at about $0.00002185, with a $12.9 billion market cap and daily trading volume near $6.34 million. It’s up 4% in the past day, supported by heavy activity and ecosystem progress. The launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution for faster and cheaper transactions, is key to SHIB’s growth. Combined with its token burn strategy, which steadily reduces supply, SHIB is moving beyond simple speculation. For those chasing community-backed projects with evolving use cases, SHIB remains one of the best cryptos to buy today. 4. Pepe: Meme Liquidity and Market Buzz Pepe (PEPE) trades near $0.000012 with a $5.1 billion market cap and $1.5 billion in daily trading volume. It has posted gains of 5–8% in the last day, proving meme demand is still alive. Analysts are split: some expect a dip, while others think a sharp rally could follow if sentiment spikes mid-month. High liquidity, rapid moves, and community hype keep PEPE firmly in play as one of the best cryptos to buy today for short-term traders chasing volatility. Final Thoughts Cold Wallet, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe each bring something different to the table this August. Cold Wallet blends presale ROI potential with a live product and a large user base. DOGE continues to thrive on brand strength, SHIB grows through Layer-2 and token burns, and PEPE keeps attention with sharp price action. For traders and holders alike, these picks are among the best crypto presale to buy , balancing meme energy with real adoption and presale opportunity.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has suffered a sell-off in the past six days, with its price falling to as low as $4,074 in the last 24 hours. The decline is occurring alongside institutional investors beginning to pull money from Spot Ethereum ETFs at a record pace, a trend that casts doubt on the sustainability of Ethereum’s price surge above $4,800 and into new all-time highs. $422.3 Million Pulled In A Single Day According to data from SosoValue, Tuesday, August 19, was one of the worst days on record for Spot Ethereum ETFs based in the US. Notably, about $422.30 million was withdrawn in a single session, making it the second-largest daily outflow since these funds were created. The only bigger exodus was on August 4, when outflows came to $465 million. Among the issuers, Grayscale and Fidelity led the exodus with outflows of $122 million and $156.32 million, respectively. BlackRock’s flagship, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), saw its holdings slip from 3.6 million ETH (around $15.8 billion) to about $14.7 billion on Tuesday. The timing of this wave of withdrawals in the past 24 hours could not be more damaging, as Ethereum was already sliding from its recent peak. The outflow immediately amplified downward pressure on the market, which caused Ethereum to crash below $4,100. Tuesday’s outflow numbers were not an isolated incident but the culmination of an outflow trend that has now stretched across three consecutive trading sessions. On Monday, Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded outflows of $196.62 million, which itself was one of the highest single-day exits since launch. This came immediately after Friday’s $59 million outflow, which ended the prior streak of record inflows. In just four days, these withdrawals have drained more than $677 million from Spot Ethereum ETFs. Record Inflows To Quick Reversal In the eight trading sessions leading up to last Friday, Spot Ethereum ETFs had attracted an unprecedented $3.7 billion in inflows, with August 11 even surpassing $1 billion in net inflow. That surge in demand was an important factor behind Ethereum’s rally to its $4,776 multi-year high, and this brought along with it predictions that the $4,800 level could soon be breached. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,167, having bounced up at $4,070 and trending a bit upward. In terms of percentage points, the leading cryptocurrency is down by 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 10% in the past seven days. The leading altcoin is now witnessing a domination of sellers, with on-chain data showing that hedge funds have almost doubled their short positions in the past seven days. The wave of outflows from Spot Ethereum ETFs carries significant implications for Ethereum’s near-term price outlook. If the exodus continues, Ethereum could struggle to maintain its footing above the $4,000 support level and enter into a deeper retracement toward the mid-$3,000 range.",Ethereum|Active Realized Price|BlackRock|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ETHA|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Fidelity|Grayscale|iShares Ethereum Trust|Sosovalue|spot Ethereum ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-20 23:00:24

Open Interest Surpasses $40 Billion As Longs Crowd In,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-open-interest-40-billion-longs/,"After hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,474 on Binance on August 13, Bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled toward $113,000, with the next major support zone around $110,000. Analysts warn that more downside could still be ahead for the top cryptocurrency. Bitcoin To Fall More? Crowded Long Trade Gives Hint According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin open interest across all exchanges has surged past $40 billion, nearing ATH territory. This rise shows both whales and short-term traders are piling into leveraged positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $115,000 As Binance Buying Power Ratio Collapses The chart below highlights the recent spike in BTC open interest, now hovering at $40.6 billion. Compared to August 2024 levels of $15 billion, open interest has grown by more than 150%. The CryptoQuant contributor added that despite this surge, the funding rate has remained positive, showing a strong long bias. While this reflects market optimism, it also signals a crowded trade, with most participants betting on further BTC appreciation. As a result, the risk of a long squeeze – forced liquidations of long positions due to aggressive leverage – has risen. XWIN Research Japan explained in their analysis: A sudden price drop can trigger a cascade of forced selling, amplifying volatility. In other words, Bitcoin’s short-term moves remain at the mercy of speculative flows. BTC Fund Holding By Institutions Rises Despite speculative froth from excessive leverage in the market, BTC fund holdings by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional investors continue to surge, exceeding 1.3 million according to latest data. Spot ETFs and corporate treasuries absorbing BTC provides the digital asset a structural bid that steadily reduces its available supply. According to data from SoSoValue, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold $146 billion in net assets – representing 6.47% of BTC’s market cap. Related Reading: Market Jitters Rise As Bitcoin Pulls Back—Is $135K Still Possible? That said, this week alone has seen more than $645 million in outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, following two consecutive weeks of inflows totaling nearly $800 million. Among the ETFs, BlackRock’s IBIT leads with $84.78 billion in net assets as of August 19. Still, not all signals are bearish. For instance, while BTC slipped below $115,000, its spot trading volume surged past $6 billion, giving bulls hope for a potential rebound. Similarly, technical analyst AO recently suggested that BTC could be mirroring gold’s trajectory, with an ambitious target of $600,000 by early 2026. At press time, BTC trades at $113,845, down 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

Investors are focusing on coins that combine community strength, proven technology, and clear growth potential. The most compelling choices tend to balance innovation with measurable results, proving they are more than short-term hype. This analysis looks at four projects currently standing out, BlockDAG, Stellar, Hyperliquid, and Chainlink. Each is approaching growth differently, but together, they highlight why these names are among the top crypto assets for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: $377M Raised & Global Adoption in Motion BlockDAG has quickly become one of the most discussed presales in the market. Its hybrid design, combining Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability with Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, creates a network that is both reliable and high-performing. With EVM compatibility, it also makes Ethereum-based applications easy to integrate, strengthening its developer appeal. The presale metrics stand out. BlockDAG has raised more than $377 million so far, placing it among the largest ongoing sales. Coins are priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, with early participants from Batch 1 already up over 2,600% on paper. Projections suggest a post-listing price near $1, a 36× gain from today’s levels, making it a focal point for investors assessing the top crypto assets . Adoption supports the hype. The X1 mobile miner app has 2.5 million users, more than 19,300 ASIC miners are already distributed, and the community includes over 200,000 holders and 4,500 developers building 300 decentralized apps. A demo trading platform is live, offering practical use before the mainnet launch. BlockDAG has also launched a 200 ETH competition worth nearly $1 million to drive engagement. With 20 confirmed listings and ambitions for Coinbase and Gemini, it is positioning for global expansion. 2. Hyperliquid: Building a Futures Market Edge Hyperliquid is gaining attention as a decentralized platform specializing in perpetual futures trading. It enables traders to access advanced financial products without relying on centralized exchanges, providing both security and speed. This niche approach is gaining traction as more users seek decentralized alternatives for sophisticated trading. Its volumes have been climbing, driven by user demand for decentralized trading solutions. The roadmap includes new product offerings and integrations to attract both retail traders and institutional participants. Though still relatively early in its journey, the strong interest in its futures market places Hyperliquid firmly among the top crypto assets for 2025. 3. Stellar: Driving Efficiency in Payments Stellar (XLM) was designed to make payments faster, more affordable, and widely accessible, especially across borders. Its blockchain processes transactions at near-instant speeds and with extremely low fees, making it ideal for remittances and small-scale transfers. Compared to traditional systems such as SWIFT, Stellar offers a streamlined solution that resonates with both individuals and institutions. Adoption has grown through collaborations with fintechs and payment providers, along with developers using Stellar for asset issuance and token transfers. While XLM’s price reflects overall market conditions, its utility in gbal payments sustains its relevance. For those exploring the top crypto assets for 2025, Stellar represents a project with proven functionality and long-term potential. 4. Chainlink: Powering Smart Contracts With Real Data Chainlink (LINK) has cemented its role as a vital piece of blockchain infrastructure. Its decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts with real-world data, from asset prices to weather and financial information. This function is essential, particularly in DeFi, where reliable external data is critical for accurate execution. Over time, Chainlink has become the dominant oracle provider, supporting thousands of projects and securing billions in value. It is now expanding into cross-chain interoperability, enterprise applications, and even traditional finance integrations. Demand for decentralized data continues to rise, reinforcing LINK’s long-term importance. For investors evaluating the top crypto assets in 2025, Chainlink remains one of the most dependable choices. Assessing the Top Crypto Assets For 2025 Each of these four projects highlights a different strength in today’s market. BlockDAG has raised $377 million, attracted millions of users, and created major presale momentum, putting it on track to be one of the most watched launches in years. Stellar continues to prove itself in global payments with its fast, low-cost transactions. Hyperliquid is tapping into the perpetual futures space with decentralized solutions. Chainlink remains essential infrastructure, powering smart contracts with real-world data. For those assessing the top crypto assets for 2025, this mix of presale potential, payment solutions, futures trading, and core infrastructure provides a balanced perspective. BlockDAG is leading with scale and adoption, while Stellar, Hyperliquid, and Chainlink strengthen the market with proven use cases. Together, they form a lineup of assets that could play a major role in shaping the year ahead.

Angie Craig (D-Minn.) “It’s no secret that my side of the aisle would prefer not to see any sitting President — I won’t name one — participating in this market while a sitting president unless those assets are in a sealed trust,” Craig said on stage at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday. Trump, as well as his family, particularly Eric Trump, who was present at the venue during Craig’s appearance, have both built businesses in the industry, particularly since Trump retook office this past January. Trump has issued several meme coins tied to his name and his social media platform, Truth Social, has applied for several exchange-traded funds. Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, a mining company owned by Hut 8. Craig, who was joined by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wi.), spoke on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act which the House passed with a massive bipartisan vote last month. The Senate Banking Committee is working on its own version of crypto market structure legislation. While the majority of Republicans are in favor of the bill, many Democrats remain skeptical, and a big reason for that is the Trump family’s involvement in the industry, Craig said. “The elephant in the room here is the President’s family’s participation in this marketplace and that’s a stumbling block to get more Democrats to support the legislation,” she said. Craig said that while there is some language in the legislation that limits this conflict of interest, a stronger tone is needed to convince some lawmakers. “If we could find some language that would allow or prevent conflicts of interest to occur, from our perspective, I think you would see a whole lot more Democrats support it,” she said. Craig is the ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee, meaning she is the leading Democrat on that committee. This isn't the first time she's referenced the Trump family's crypto tie-ups — during a committee hearing in June on the Clarity Act, she said his crypto actions were ""making this debate more difficult"" and suggested that Congress should add restrictions on how the U.S. president can trade in markets overseen by the CFTC, including crypto. Despite her comments, Craig still voted to advance the Clarity Act without any such language being added.

This rare level of profitability has historically preceded sharp declines, but some analysts believe this cycle may follow a different trajectory. High Profitability Levels Raise Concerns XRP continues to trade above $3, close to its record highs, after climbing from $0.40 to $3.11 within a year, a gain of more than 500%. According to on-chain figures published by Glassnode, this surge has pushed nearly every XRP wallet into positive territory. Market commentator Winny cautioned that such widespread profitability has been a warning signal in the past. He pointed to two historical examples where a similar setup preceded major crashes. Markets have memory. And every time XRP hits a major milestone it feels like déjà vu. Think of it like climbing a mountain: the higher you go, the thinner the air. XRP just touched $3.11 a 500% run from $0.40 in less than a year. 94% of all supply is now in profit ( @glassnode ).… https://t.co/7LhOwyxepM — Winny (@0xWINNYx) August 18, 2025 In early 2018, profitability exceeded 90% as XRP approached $3.30, after which the token fell by more than 95%. Again in 2021, when XRP reached $1.95, profitability was at similar levels before an 85% decline followed. Given these precedents, Winny argues that investors should be cautious, stressing that when most market participants are in profit, selling pressure becomes difficult to avoid. Factors That Could Prevent a Repeat Despite the risks, Winny acknowledged that current conditions show important differences from prior cycles. Notably, large holders , wallets with more than one million XRP, have reached record levels, suggesting stronger long-term conviction among major investors. Network activity is also at its highest point in years, with daily active addresses rising to 225,000, the largest figure in three years. Technical data adds to this outlook, as XRP is consolidating around $3.05 in a triangle formation. A downside break below this area could open the door to $2.40, but if the price moves upward, Elliott Wave projections suggest a possible advance toward $6 or beyond. Winny concluded that these factors could create stronger support levels than in previous cycles, potentially reducing the scale of any correction even if profit-taking occurs.

He argued that while XRP may experience a further rally in the near term, a significant retracement remains likely. He presented two possible scenarios: if XRP rises to $9, he expects a pullback of about 85%, which would return the token to $1.30. In a more bullish case, if XRP surges to $27, he foresees a correction of roughly 97%, which could push the price back to $0.80, similar to the collapse seen in 2018. The market’s next move remains uncertain as XRP investors weigh high profitability against new technical and on-chain developments. While historical data suggests that such levels of profit often precede steep declines, analysts argue that increased whale accumulation and stronger network activity may change the outcome this time. Whether XRP can sustain its current momentum or repeat past patterns will likely be determined by how the market reacts in the coming weeks.

The studio appointed Rod Fergusson to lead the production of the upcoming game, which has been in development for several years now. The project is yet to receive an official title or release date despite being in production for some time now, with multiple restarts and adjustments. The layoffs are reportedly cutting across the development team behind the game, with no precise details on the scale of the cuts. Uncertainty still surrounds BioShok 4 after six years of development. The restructuring announcement follows the recent appointment of Rod Fergusson, former head of the Diablo franchise at Blizzard. Fergusson has worked on several projects, and he is recognized as a veteran in the industry for delivering finished, high-quality games rather than rushed releases. After BioShok 4 failed the recent internal review, the studio head, Kelley Gilmore, was fired, and creative director Horgath de la Plante was taken to publishing. Would you kindly allow me to share some news? Some of you guessed it, I’m returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. I’ll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with… — Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) August 19, 2025 The project is facing drastic changes, which have triggered reactions from fans. Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two CEO, admitted that the game development has faced ups and downs, but asked the fans to honour the BioShock legacy. He attributed the longer cycles in development to the industry’s focus on quality, saying that they are prioritizing exceptional entertainment over sheer output. Cloud Chamber was established in 2019 by 2K Games, a brand of Take-Two Interactive, to revive the BioShock series, which has been on hold for several years now. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that the project has been restarted more than once as the studio sought to fine-tune its creative direction. The latest project, dubbed BioShock 4, has been in the works for nearly six years now. BioShock has delivered several games in its series, including Irrational Games’ debut in 1997, BioShock 2, and BioShock Infinite. The pioneer of the series, Ken Levine, is currently working on his project, Judas, with his studio, Ghost Story Games, and he will not participate in the development of BioShock 4. Fergusson brings renewed hope for the BioShock series Rod Fergusson’s previous works have given him a stable reputation across the gaming industry. Before moving to Blizzard , He worked on the Gears of War series at Epic Games and The Coalition. He is known across the industry for his focus on production management and delivering projects on schedule. His leadership style has been characterized as pragmatic for avoiding prolonged development cycles currently experienced at Cloud Chamber studio. Fergusson revealed his excitement for returning to 2K Games while acknowledging the studio’s ongoing restructuring. He applauded the work done so far at BioShock and committed himself to building a game that gamers will love. He confirmed that he will be the head of the BioShock Franchise and overseeing the development of BioShock 4, plus extensions like the in-development Netflix movie. The BioShock Franchise is expanding into film with the upcoming game receiving a live-action BioShock adaptation currently in production at Netflix. Francis Lawrence, who directed The Hunger Games and I AM Legend, is the current director of the BioShock adaptation film. The film is expected to incorporate visual and thematic style drawn from the original games, which combined dystopian storytelling with art deco. Cloud Chamber and 2K have not issued any comment so far on the status of the upcoming project, which remains in development with its future tied to Fergusson’s leadership. However, the 2K Games studio revealed it aims to preserve the spirit of the Franchise while exploring new settings and themes. It also remains unclear how the staff reduction will affect the progress of the game after the confirmation from Fergusson. Get seen where it counts.

Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6023 Market cap $453.37M Trading volume $42.82 Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.6118 24-hour low $0.5873 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 7.09% 50-day SMA $0.6348 200-day SMA $0.6848 Sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (August 20), APE’s price dropped by 6.04% in one week and rose 0.64% in the last 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market (1.48%). The market recorded less trading interest as trading volumes dropped by 28.10%. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. This week, the coin traded along the William Alligator moving averages with little momentum as shown by the MACD histograms (0.0003). The RSI (48.71) suggests neutral momentum. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s run and its support at $0.58. Its volatility is dropping with a three white soldier candlestick pattern. The next 8 hours are critical to whether APE will continue upwards or reverse.

APE price analysis shows that the coin is bearish with little volatility. Lower trading volumes confirm less conviction in the current market trend. Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. driven by the APE bridge to ApeChain and growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction August 2025 The APE August price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $0.70, with an average of $0.59.

XRP, developed by Ripple, has been one of the most prominent examples, designed to streamline international payments at lower cost and with faster settlement than traditional channels. Today, analysts argue that this resistance is losing ground, as calls for an updated financial infrastructure are becoming mainstream, even from political leaders. Growing Tensions Between Banks and Digital Assets Traditional banking institutions have long opposed innovations that challenge their dominance, particularly products that could replace or undermine savings accounts and cross-border transfers. Rupert, an analyst from All In Crypto, explained on the Paul Barron Podcast that banking associations fought extensively against proposals such as paying yield on stablecoins. The reason is straightforward: if consumers can earn interest directly on digital assets, banks risk losing one of their primary advantages. This pushback reflects how threatened the financial sector feels by blockchain-based solutions that give customers cheaper and more efficient alternatives. However, recent political commentary suggests that momentum is shifting in favor of modernizing financial rails. President Donald Trump recently criticized the outdated infrastructure underpinning the U.S. financial system, describing it as several decades behind current technology. He advocated for an upgrade built on “crypto technology” to prepare the United States for a 21st-century economy. Although he did not reference Ripple by name, his remarks align closely with what Ripple has developed. The XRP Ledger is specifically designed to enable fast, inexpensive international transfers, addressing exactly the shortcomings that Trump highlighted. Analysts note that Trump’s comments underscore a broader recognition among policymakers that legacy systems no longer meet modern demands. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SWIFT Faces Mounting Pressure At the center of this discussion is SWIFT , the dominant international payments messaging system. Despite its long-standing role, critics argue that it is slow, expensive, and unsuitable for the digital era. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even likened reliance on SWIFT to relying on outdated communications methods, emphasizing the need for alternatives. Ripple’s system provides a clear contrast. By using the XRP Ledger, institutions can complete cross-border settlements within seconds, eliminating the reliance on intermediary banks. If widely adopted, this model could offer the liquidity and scalability necessary to challenge SWIFT’s dominance and transform global finance. Ripple’s Broader Significance While Bitcoin was created as a decentralized form of money, Ripple’s purpose has always been narrowly defined: to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments. This mission places it in direct competition with banks, which profit from the fees and delays inherent in the existing system. Rupert cautioned that while price predictions for XRP often generate skepticism , the true impact of Ripple’s network is still unknown. The scale of adoption will ultimately determine how disruptive the technology becomes. What is clear, however, is that Ripple represents one of the most credible challenges yet to traditional banking infrastructure. The global financial system is under increasing pressure to modernize. While banks have resisted blockchain technology for years, recent political support for crypto-based solutions highlights a shift in direction. Ripple’s technology fits squarely into this conversation, offering the speed, efficiency, and scalability that leaders like Trump are now demanding.

August crushed the rally these firms enjoyed just weeks ago, slamming names that had become investor magnets during the sideways bitcoin market. The sell-off arrives just before the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where whatever the hell Jerome Powell says next could drag these stocks even deeper, or spark a quick rebound. This entire picture was reported by CNBC, who tracked every company in the space holding crypto as treasury. Some of these companies had only just started their crypto play. Ethzilla, which used to be a biotech firm called 180 Life Sciences, jumped into the game on July 29. Investors reacted fast. The stock exploded in early August and is now showing a 114% gain for the month, the highest return in the group. Right behind it is BitMine Immersion Technologies, which focused on ether instead of bitcoin, followed by DeFi Development Corp, a company that went all-in on Solana back in April. Biggest gains tied to timing and tokens DeFi Development made its move on April 7 and has climbed 2,600% since then. Even in August, while others tanked, it’s still up 8%. That kind of gain almost matches what Strategy pulled off since launching its now-famous bitcoin treasury plan in June 2020. But Strategy’s current numbers are ugly; it’s down 16% this month. The timing of each company’s crypto shift clearly matters. No two firms announced their strategies at the same time, making head-to-head comparisons messy. Still, some stocks burned fast. CEA Industries, a vape company out of Canada, jumped 550% on July 28 just for saying it was accumulating Binance Coin. The hype didn’t last. The stock is now down 28% in August. Bit Digital tried switching things up by ditching bitcoin mining in June to go full ether treasury and staking. The results? Meh. Since the announcement, shares are up 11%, but in August alone, they’re already down 6.5%. High-profile investors fuel confidence and volume Some names have got famous backers putting their faces on the line. Tom Lee, from Fundstrat Global Advisors, became chairman of BitMine Immersion in late June. Just after that, Peter Thiel picked up a 9% stake in the company, then added a 7.5% slice of Ethzilla too. That kind of support does more than look pretty in a press release. Michael Bucella, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital, said, “Large names extend their reputation to the vehicle and instill confidence that the backers of these assets — alongside executives and board members with legal ties — will operate them as real businesses, growing revenue while managing risks.” He added, “That investor confidence creates momentum and market depth, which fuels volume and options activity. This in turn enables these companies to establish sizable ATM programs, raising large sums of capital to acquire more of the asset and gain greater prominence in its ecosystem.” Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, said it’s not just about who invests but who runs the company. Galaxy, which has backed firms like SharpLink Gaming and ReserveOne, sees management as a key driver for whether a crypto treasury stock can actually survive. “Those that raise more capital with the right partners, with the right business model, with the right management teams have a much better shot of achieving some escape velocity with their ultimate treasury management companies, which also can become ecosystem companies that are bigger than just the immediate launch moment,” Kurz said . The Ether crowd is holding up better than the bitcoin players. There are reasons for that. The IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, the passing of the GENIUS Act, and an explosion of institutional interest in stablecoins (most of which live on Ethereum) have all helped ether-linked companies gain an edge.

Trump, who co-founded bitcoin mining company American Bitcoin earlier this year, reiterated his excitement for bitcoin during an appearance at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday. He even called himself a “bitcoin maxi.” The businessman and executive vice president of the Trump organization said he now spends over 50% of his time on crypto projects. He said he believes that the crypto asset will be worth $175,000 a token by the end of the year, sticking with his earlier prediction. Trump told several personal stories pointing out what he described as the flaws of the current financial system and how bitcoin and blockchain technology can solve those issues, including faster transactions and payment settlements. American Bitcoin, which merged with Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr-owned American Data Center in March, is expected to go public on Nasdaq via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP). The brothers own 20% of the company while bitcoin miner Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%. Trump's comments came hours after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made a similar prediction .

50412502,561256,1755734410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50412502.jpeg,Bitcoin STH Capitulate: $5.69B In Losses Hit Exchanges In 48 Hours,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sth-capitulate-5-69b-losses-hit-exchanges/,"Bitcoin is trading at a critical support level after reaching a new all-time high of $124,500 before swiftly losing the $115K level in less than a week. The sudden reversal underscores the sharp rise in volatility, with bulls and bears locked in a battle for momentum. While some analysts argue that BTC could reclaim its highs in the coming days, others expect the market to cool off further, with consolidation potentially dragging the price into lower ranges. Key insights from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn reveal that Bitcoin just faced one of the heaviest loss-driven moves in weeks. Short-term holders (STHs) have been under pressure, with billions in BTC flowing into exchanges at a loss, signaling capitulation among speculative investors. Historically, such moments of intense selling either trigger deeper corrections or set the stage for recovery rallies, depending on how quickly markets absorb the supply. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to stabilize above the $115K–$113K support zone will likely determine the short-term trajectory. If buyers step in aggressively, a rebound toward $120K+ could materialize. However, failure to defend current levels may leave BTC vulnerable to a deeper retracement before any attempt to retest its all-time highs. Short-Term Holders Capitulate as Bitcoin Faces Pressure According to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Bitcoin’s short-term holders (STHs) are showing signs of serious capitulation . Over just two days, a staggering 50,026 BTC — worth approximately $5.69 billion — flowed from STHs to exchanges at a loss. This marks the deepest loss-driven move in more than a month, underscoring how quickly sentiment can shift in an overheated market. STHs selling at a loss is a critical signal. Historically, these moments often align with market stress points where speculative investors exit positions under pressure. Bulls, however, are looking for a different outcome. They want this to represent a sharp flush-out of weak hands, followed by renewed accumulation and a swift price rebound. In this view, the sell-off would simply be a reset — a profit-taking event that clears the path for more sustainable gains. If that fails to materialize, the risk grows that this episode could mirror the prolonged loss realization seen from late February through late May, when persistent capitulation dragged Bitcoin through an extended consolidation phase. For now, bulls are defending the $115K region, but many analysts point to $110K as a decisive level. Losing that support could expose BTC to a deeper retracement, while holding it could provide the springboard for a renewed push back toward all-time highs. BTC Price Analysis: Testing Key Moving Average The 8-hour Bitcoin chart shows that BTC is under strong selling pressure after failing to hold above the $120K–$123K resistance area. The chart highlights multiple rejections at the $123,217 level, establishing it as a critical ceiling. After the most recent failed breakout attempt, price has sharply retraced, now trading around $113,486. On the downside, BTC is testing the 200-period moving average (red line), currently sitting near $113,292. This zone has acted as a key support level in previous consolidations. If the price manages to defend this area, it could form a base for a potential rebound toward the mid-range levels around $117K–$118K. However, failure to hold this moving average would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward the $110K psychological level. The 50-period (blue) and 100-period (green) moving averages are now above the price, acting as resistance, signaling a short-term bearish bias. Market structure suggests consolidation is underway, with momentum shifting toward bears.

50412548,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79451,1755734413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Says XRP Is Preparing for the Next Pump to $5. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-preparing-for-the-next-pump-to-5-heres-why/,"XRP is once again drawing attention from traders as its price structure points to a potential breakout. Market analyst JackTheRippler recently argued on X that XRP is “preparing for the next pump,” projecting a move beyond $5. A closer look at the charts suggests that his forecast is grounded in the asset’s current technical formation. A Strong Ascending Channel The weekly BITSTAMP chart shows XRP moving within a clearly defined ascending channel that has been intact since late 2024. This structure is characterized by higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a market that continues to build strength over time. As of report time, XRP trades at $2.95, positioned near the middle of this channel after retreating from resistance just above $3.30 earlier in the summer. The preservation of this upward channel underscores a strong underlying trend, as each pullback has been met with renewed demand at higher levels. #XRP IS PREPARING FOR THE NEXT PUMP! $5+ IMMINENT pic.twitter.com/wJrsI6XICS — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 20, 2025 Testing Support and Eyeing Resistance The channel has established consistent zones where traders respond. Each time XRP has approached the lower boundary in the $2.50 to $2.60 region, buyers have defended the level, reaffirming it as a reliable base of support. On the other hand, resistance has been repeatedly felt near the channel’s upper edge, which currently lies in the $3.30 to $3.50 range . Price now sits at a pivotal mid-channel position, where momentum typically begins to build before the next decisive move. If buyers regain control and drive the price above the upper boundary, the chart implies an extension that naturally projects toward the $5 level. Why the $5 Target Holds Weight JackTheRippler’s $5 call aligns with the measured move potential that often follows channel breakouts. When an asset consistently trends within parallel rails, a breakout to the upside typically produces gains equal to the width of the channel. In XRP’s case, the projected path from the current formation places the next significant resistance zone near $5. This target is not arbitrary—it follows directly from the geometry of the trend and the strength of recurring support that has underpinned XRP’s rise throughout 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Integrity of the Pattern The credibility of this setup lies in its consistency. Both the support and resistance levels of the channel have been tested multiple times, confirming the validity of the structure. As long as XRP continues to respect these levels, the broader bias remains bullish. A decisive breakout above resistance would confirm market conviction and pave the way toward $5 , while a sustained drop below $2.50 would be required to invalidate the pattern. Final Outlook XRP’s technical outlook provides a clear explanation for JackTheRippler’s $5 projection. The cryptocurrency is locked within a disciplined ascending channel, consolidating near its midpoint and preparing for its next directional move. With the trend firmly intact and resistance levels within reach, a breakout could propel XRP into the $5 region in the near term. The case is not built on speculation but on the strength of the chart itself, which continues to show resilience and upward momentum.

With presales often linked to major updates, wallet releases, or new blockchain features, choosing the right ones can deliver strong growth potential. In 2025, a few projects are gaining momentum through adoption, funding, and standout ideas. BlockDAG has attracted strong attention with its hybrid framework and large-scale fundraising, while Nexchain AI has stepped up as an ambitious AI-powered blockchain. Best Wallet is changing how wallets operate by rewarding user activity in ways not seen before, and Remittix is building its place in the PayFi sector with real-world payment use cases. Each of these presales adds something unique, but BlockDAG’s scale, adoption, and presale record make it especially noteworthy. This article explores why these are the top crypto presale for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Strength in Hybrid Design and $378M Presale BlockDAG is gaining speed with a hybrid Directed Acyclic Graph and Proof-of-Work model, creating a system that supports high-speed transactions while keeping decentralization. It is also EVM-compatible, allowing Ethereum-based apps to run without barriers. Adoption has been impressive even before launch, with over 2.5 million users joining via the X1 mobile miner app. More than 19,300 ASIC miners have also been distributed, creating one of the most inclusive mining setups in the industry. This dual mining option enables casual mobile users and large-scale miners to take part, strengthening the network and driving adoption further. The presale has moved quickly, raising $378 million in Batch 29, with BDAG priced at $0.0276. Early buyers have already seen paper returns of around 2,660% as prices rose with each batch. Analysts project a possible $1 listing price, which could mean about 36× growth from the current stage, making it a key presale to watch. Adding to this, BlockDAG (BDAG) has introduced a 200 ETH competition worth nearly $1 million, aimed at boosting community involvement and rewarding active presale buyers. With strong technology, rapid adoption, and notable financial milestones, BlockDAG has positioned itself as a leader in the top crypto presale of 2025, setting up one of the most anticipated launches of the year. 2. Nexchain AI: Speed, Security, and AI-driven Features Nexchain AI is making progress as an AI-powered Layer-1 blockchain created for scalability, high speed, and advanced smart contract use. It runs with a hybrid Proof-of-Stake plus AI-driven consensus and is designed to reach up to 400,000 transactions per second at fees as low as $0.001. The system enhances smart contracts through fraud detection and real-time adjustment, offering use cases in finance, logistics, and healthcare. Security is also central, using post-quantum cryptography and AI-driven error checks. The network has passed a CertiK audit, which improves trust in its framework. The presale is currently in Stage 25, with NEX priced at $0.10 and about $8.5–$8.8 million raised toward a $9.27 million goal. Supporters benefit from community programs, testnet activities, and codes like TESTNET100 offering extra bonuses. Nexchain AI has also launched a $5 million airdrop campaign to expand adoption. With estimates that NEX could rise to $0.30 at launch, there is speculation of a 300% increase. These elements place Nexchain AI as one of the key projects in the top crypto presale for 2025. 3. Best Wallet: Turning Usage into Real Rewards Best Wallet changes the idea of a crypto wallet by offering rewards for user activity instead of just storage. It gives back to the community whenever users swap, transfer, or ramp crypto. With cashback on transactions, referral programs, and rewards through its CWT coin, it transforms self-custody into a way to earn. Plans also include rebates for gas fees, stronger transparency on transactions, and eventually a Layer-2 scaling path to add more speed. Its presale has drawn attention for its clear model and accessible setup. CWT is the base of this reward-focused system, and demand has grown as the network moves closer to launch. Best Wallet’s presale pricing and design make it a platform that goes beyond storage, acting as a hub for daily crypto utility. With its presale open, Best Wallet stands out as one of the leading names in the top crypto presale, especially for those seeking simple use combined with real benefits. 4. Remittix: Building Global PayFi Solutions Remittix is working to improve global payments, positioning itself as a PayFi service that connects crypto with standard banking systems. Its Web3 wallet, set for beta release on September 15, 2025, will support 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies with instant conversion. This creates a practical way to send funds worldwide, offering zero foreign exchange fees and same-day settlement across 30+ countries. With only 50 testers chosen for the beta launch, anticipation continues to grow. The presale is close to reaching $20 million, with RTX priced around $0.092–$0.0944 and bonus offers of 40–50%. A major centralized exchange listing is expected once the $20 million mark is crossed, driving momentum. Passing a CertiK audit with no critical issues has added more trust. Analysts project the chance for 100× growth in 2025 due to its real-world payment model and low market cap. With giveaways and community activity included, Remittix secures its place as a notable name in the top crypto presale this year. Final Thoughts: Four Presales Defining 2025 Presales remain one of the strongest ways to access crypto projects early, and 2025 brings several promising names. BlockDAG leads with unmatched presale fundraising, adoption through mobile and ASIC miners, and a unique hybrid model mixing DAG with Proof-of-Work. Nexchain AI adds a future-focused AI blockchain, Best Wallet converts regular usage into active rewards, and Remittix delivers practical PayFi services for global use. With BlockDAG’s $378 million raised, Nexchain AI’s advanced Layer-1 setup, Best Wallet’s cashback model, and Remittix’s near $20 million milestone with an upcoming wallet launch, these projects represent the top crypto presale for 2025 . Each has distinct strengths, but together they show how presales are driving the next wave of adoption. Choosing the right one now could mean joining some of the most important launches in the coming cycle.

Currently trading at $2.8, XRP has made a 3.68% decline in the past 24 hours, with trading volume rising slightly by 0.82% to $6.85 billion. Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ The latest downturn comes after on-chain data revealed that whales offloaded 470 million XRP tokens over the past 10 days, slashing their cumulative holdings to just 7.63 billion coins. Large-scale exits by wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP suggest institutional desks and high-net-worth traders are taking profits after XRP’s recent rally to above $3.39 earlier this month. XRP Price Action: $2.85–$2.90 Becomes Key Battleground Price action data shows XRP’s sharpest drop occurred between 13:00 and 15:00 UTC on August 19, when it slid from $3.04 to $2.93 as volume spiked to 137 million, nearly double the daily average. Despite heavy selling, buyers repeatedly defended the $2.85–$2.88 zone, preventing further collapse. Currently, XRP is consolidating near $2.85–$2.90, a sign that short-term selling pressure may be easing. Still, resistance at $3.04 has been confirmed, making a bullish recovery difficult without stronger demand. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Can Bulls Hold the Line at $2.8? For traders, the $2.8 level is now the most critical support to watch. A breakdown could open the door for a deeper decline, while reclaiming $3.00 would signal renewed buyer strength. Analysts note that a recovery above $3.19 is essential for momentum to shift back in favor of the bulls. Adding to the pressure, a security audit ranked the XRP Ledger lowest among 15 major blockchains, sparking concerns over long-term resilience. Meanwhile, the U.S. SEC has delayed decisions on several XRP ETF applications, including Nasdaq’s CoinShares filing, until October, deepening regulatory uncertainty.

XRP has entered a fresh bullish phase, while SHIB has reignited excitement with a massive burn rate surge. Both are trending and creating short-term opportunities. But for long-term plays, the question remains: which project blends momentum with lasting adoption? That’s where Cold Wallet enters. Rather than chasing hype, it is building adoption through strategy, most notably, the $270M Plus Wallet acquisition. This deal instantly positioned Cold Wallet as a serious contender in self-custody, backed by both a strong presale and a ready-made user base. Ripple (XRP) Technicals Indicate Strong Breakout Potential Ripple is once again drawing headlines as XRP price charts point to a potential breakout. Its structure is pressing against resistance, and momentum is supported by the expanding stablecoin market. More stablecoin usage boosts demand for networks like XRP that support fast liquidity transfers. Analysts highlight XRP consolidating near a key zone that, if broken, could send prices to record highs. With volume increasing and Ripple’s reputation as a payment solution leader, its case for further upside is strong. For long-term holders, Ripple’s resilience against legal challenges and relevance in cross-border payments give it credibility. But the pace of adoption will still decide its next big move. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Fuels Price Forecast Shiba Inu delivered a 5% price jump in just 24 hours after an 83,000% surge in burn rate. This sharp reduction in supply lit up the SHIB community, with many predicting more upside. SHIB’s model has always leaned on its loyal community and token burns. This latest move proves retail appetite for high-volatility coins is still alive in 2025. But questions remain about sustainability. Burn events may create scarcity, but without deeper utility or ecosystem growth, momentum risks fading. Projects like Shibarium help, but SHIB still depends on community energy more than long-term fundamentals. Cold Wallet’s Plus Wallet Acquisition Powers Adoption and Presale Growth While XRP and SHIB thrive on cycles, Cold Wallet is building something more durable. At its core, it is a self-custody wallet powered by the $CWT token, rewarding users for on-chain actions like swaps, transfers, and bridging. What makes 2025 different is its bold adoption play, the $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet. This move brought over 2 million users into Cold Wallet’s ecosystem instantly. For a presale-stage project, that’s unheard of. Instead of waiting years for adoption, Cold Wallet starts with a large user base and expands faster than rivals. At the presale level, Cold Wallet is priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, with over $6.3M raised and more than 740 million tokens sold. Unlike many presales, this one is paired with real adoption pipelines. It isn’t just speculation; it’s a product that people can use from day one. Referral bonuses add another layer of growth. Users receive 10% of their referrals’ purchases in $CWT, and referees earn 5%. Both are vested under the same terms as bought tokens, creating fairness and sustainability. With 25% of supply allocated to rewards and team tokens locked for years, inflation is avoided. The acquisition and presale momentum align perfectly with rising demand for self-custody wallets. Cold Wallet offers users full control of their assets while rewarding everyday activity, setting it apart from hype-driven projects. Final Words Ripple brings payment use cases and a strong setup for traders, while Shiba Inu thrives on community and burns. Both have appeal, but they remain tied to cycles. Cold Wallet, with its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition and $6.3M raised, is building differently. By combining real adoption with presale success, it creates long-term value while rewarding users daily. For anyone searching for the best long-term crypto investment, Cold Wallet stands out as the project built to scale.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin steadied in Asia Thursday at $114,610 (+1.4%), clawing back some ground after last week’s slide, while ether outpaced with a 5.8% jump to $4,370.73 as investors rotated selectively across the market. The CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the performance of the largest crypto assets, is up 3.5%, trading above 4,078. OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin said in a note to CoinDesk that the rising ETH/BTC ratio shows capital shifting into ether’s relative strength while Bitcoin consolidates. ""Crypto capital is getting more selective,"" Lin told CoinDesk. She stressed that this is not a broad “altseason,” but a targeted move into ETH as macro catalysts like the Jackson Hole conference and U.S. inflation data loom. Fresh figures from CryptoQuant underline why Bitcoin’s rally has cooled. Apparent demand has dropped from 174,000 BTC in July to 59,000 BTC today, while ETF inflows have slowed to their weakest since April,"" the firm wrote in a recent report. Profit-taking remains heavy, with whales realizing $2 billion in gains on Aug. 16 alone, bringing total realized profits since July to $74 billion. CryptoQuant analysts now classify the market as in a “bullish cooldown” phase, with $110,000 flagged as an important support level. In a note to CoinDesk, analysts at Enflux, a Singapore-based market maker noted that retail enthusiasm for altseason has dropped sharply compared to last week, even as strategic bets like BNB hitting all-time highs and Hyperliquid’s operational strength continue to draw capital. “This indicates that the altcoin market is no longer a uniform beta trade, as macro conviction is forming, but more selective and concentrated, also on the institutional side,” the firm said. The result is a market less defined by broad rallies and more by selective winners, with ETH setting the tone as capital stays in crypto but moves with sharper focus, favoring resilience over speculation. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin edged up 1.4% to just above $114,000 while U.S. stocks slipped, and altcoins showed unusual resilience as BTC dominance nears a six-month low. ETH: Ether outperformed bitcoin, climbing 5.8% as traders rotated into majors despite slowing BTC demand. Gold: UBS raised its gold price target to $3,600 per ounce in Q1 2026, citing the strongest bullion demand since 2011 driven by U.S. macro risks, de-dollarization, and heavy ETF and central bank buying. S&P 500: The Nasdaq fell 0.68% and the S&P 500 slipped 0.26% Wednesday as investors rotated out of tech stocks into sectors like energy, healthcare, and consumer staples ahead of the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium.

Switzerland has become the latest hotspot for mainstream integration, with SPAR enabling crypto payments across more than 100 stores and growing to 300 sites soon. Using DFX.swiss and Binance Pay, clients may now settle invoices with over 100 tokens, including stablecoins, with quick confirmation and no gas fees. Ripple is also making news, appearing in Gemini’s IPO filing with a fresh $75 million credit facility. The deal not only gives Gemini more cash before its market debut, but it also sets Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin up for wider use by businesses. XRP is selling well, and people are now beginning to speculate if the coin could eventually hit $10 or more in 2025. Investors are also interested in projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that are trying to get in early before the next important spike. Crypto Payments Go Mainstream in Switzerland SPAR’s launch is being lauded as one of the most visible indicators that digital assets are no longer limited to trading desks. Merchants pay around two-thirds less in transaction fees than they would with a credit card, while customers get their money quickly and without having to pay for gas. Another strong inducement for adoption is Switzerland’s planned five-year tax exemption on cryptocurrency revenues, which will start in 2025. The Top New Crypto Contender Gains Momentum In line with XRP’s growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads within the market. With only a few tokens available and a lot of people wanting them, the presale has quickly sold out in several phases. Analysts are already comparing it to the early days of Shiba Inu, claiming that people who get in now could make a lot of money when the project goes live on big exchanges. Its quick development in the community and early success make it one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on in 2025. Ripple’s Strategy Beyond IPO Buzz The IPO filing by Gemini exposes not only financial pressure, but also Ripple’s strategic impact. The deal might go up to $150 million, which is more than the first $75 million facility. It could also include Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which came out in late 2024 and is already getting a lot of attention from institutions. Ripple isn’t trying to go public; instead, it’s focusing on buying other companies and growing its ecosystem. This keeps XRP in a strong position for future growth. Conclusion: Eyes on $10 XRP The case for XRP reaching $10 by 2025 is getting stronger as more people in Switzerland use crypto and Ripple pushes for more businesses to use it. Bullish mood is growing because more people are using Ripple, transactions are cheaper, and Ripple’s ecosystem is getting bigger. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-growth bet , providing investors with a rare early-stage chance before the next bull surge begins.

Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high of $123,000 last week. It has since pulled back, falling nearly 9% from that peak. After approaching a new record high last week, Ether's closing price experienced a significant retreat, dropping over 14% from that peak. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price reached a new record high of $123,000 last week. It has since pulled back, falling nearly 9% from that peak. BTC is now up ~20% year to date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. After approaching a new record high last week, Ether's closing price experienced a significant retreat, dropping over 14% from that peak. ETH is now ~21% year to date and is ~15% below its record high from November 2021 XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), and Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

50413681,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788672,1755735450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50413681.jpeg,"Palantir’s six-session slump erases $73 billion in value, as short sellers finally win",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/palantirs-six-session-slump-erases-73b/,"Palantir just got dragged through six painful days on Wall Street, losing $73 billion in market value and giving short sellers a rare payday after months of losses. This losing streak, which started after the stock hit a record high on August 12, marks the company’s worst run since April 2024. Shares are now down over 17%, putting them on track for the ugliest week since the tariff-driven drop earlier this year. Despite being the biggest loser in the S&P 500 over the last six sessions, Palantir is still the top performer on the index in 2025, holding a 106% gain since the start of the year. That explosive rally led to a sky-high valuation, which most short sellers couldn’t handle. But this latest slide finally gave them room to breathe, and collect. Shorts pocket gains after long beating The decline handed $1.6 billion in profits to traders who bet against the Denver-based company, data from S3 Partners LLC showed. But those profits don’t undo the $4.5 billion in total losses short sellers have suffered this year betting against Palantir. The overall trend had been brutal for contrarians—until now. Matthew Unterman, managing director at S3, said short interest as a percentage of Palantir’s float dropped to 2.5%, down from nearly 5% a year ago. That means many traders had already exited their short positions as the stock kept rising. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC, said those traders either “wanted to avoid being run over by a monster momentum trade or were forced out after the freight train hit.” Vikram Rai, a portfolio manager and macro trader at Fny Capital Management LP, made it clear that the current drop wasn’t caused by bears taking control. “The selloff that we’re seeing in Palantir, it’s long overdue and it’s not because the short sellers have taken over,” Vikram said . He pointed to broader market weakness, especially in tech names like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which are also under pressure. “When you have the likes of Google, Meta and Microsoft declining, then obviously the high-beta stocks, which are hopelessly overvalued, will decline more.” Most of Palantir’s rise in 2025 came from long-only investors rather than a short squeeze. But with the stock finally showing some weakness, some contrarians are stepping back in. Short interest has grown by around 10 million shares since June, according to S3. That’s still a small chunk of Palantir’s 2.3 billion shares outstanding, but it’s a sign of growing pressure. Tech under pressure as investors rotate out The hit to Palantir isn’t happening in a vacuum. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.76 points, or 0.68%, ending at 21,170.19. The S&P 500 slipped 16.40 points, or 0.26%, closing at 6,394.97. Only the Dow Jones held flat, edging up by 1.48 points to 44,923.75. Investors are rotating away from tech into cheaper sectors like energy, healthcare, and consumer staples. The pullback comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where traders expect to hear new signals about policy direction. At the same time, worries are building across the tech space. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently warned that AI stocks are “in a bubble,” triggering more selloffs. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology added to the panic, showing that many tech companies aren’t yet turning their AI investments into actual profits. That’s not the only concern. President Donald Trump’s administration is now weighing the idea of taking equity stakes in chipmakers like Intel, just weeks after pushing revenue-sharing deals with Nvidia and AMD. That idea rattled investors. Shares of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Micro all fell in response. Traders are watching Nvidia’s earnings set for August 27, hoping to get a better sense of demand in the AI space. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Investor sentiment is buoyed by fading legal overhangs, renewed institutional interest, and strong technical setups forming on the charts. Analysts’ predictions vary, with moderate targets pointing toward $4 and more aggressive outlooks extending to the $5–$7 range or higher if momentum holds. This optimism has pulled traders back into XRP, but many also recognize the limitations of large-cap assets. While XRP may offer double- or triple-digit gains, the kind of exponential upside that defines bull market legends is usually found in smaller , earlier-stage projects. That’s why presale opportunities are attracting increasing attention. Investors are not just hunting for tokens with upside – they are looking for projects that can capture narrative power in a way that drives attention, liquidity, and long-term community growth. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE begins to stand apart. Key Catalysts Supporting XRP’s Momentum First, regulatory clarity is improving: the long-running SEC legal battle with Ripple is winding down, improving confidence in the token’s legitimacy. Second, U.S. legislative developments – including the GENIUS Act and Digital Markets Clarity Act – as well as plans to open crypto to retirement accounts like 401(k)s, are energizing institutional sentiment and encouraging broader adoption. Third, technical resistance near the $3.40–$3.60 range could be tested as momentum builds; some analysts even envision a clean breakout toward $4 or higher for XRP. Furthermore, veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt has forecasted a possible 60% rally toward $4.47 , while Standard Chartered anticipates XRPs could reach $5.50 by year-end, $8 in 2026, and even $12.50 by 2028. These bullish projections highlight a growing expectation that hype, adoption, and macro tailwinds may drive XRP to new highs. Amid this rally, many investors are pivoting their attention to presale opportunities outside XRP—seeking upside before markets become crowded. One such play gaining attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. With XRP climbing toward record highs, a different countdown is capturing attention in presale markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is on the verge of closing its latest round, with allocations nearly gone. What sets it apart isn’t just the rapid sellout pace but the way early adopters are locking in positions before major exchange exposure begins . Each presale stage has introduced scarcity-driven demand, and thousands of participants have already joined in anticipation of the next pricing jump . The project’s unique political branding adds another layer of visibility, ensuring it resonates far beyond typical crypto circles. For investors looking at XRP’s surge as proof of capital rotation into altcoins, MAGACOIN represents a chance to secure exposure at presale prices before the next pump phase ignites. Altcoins in the Spotlight as XRP Gains Traction XRP’s strength often sets the tone for broader altcoin sector movements. A breakout could catalyze renewed interest across mid-cap and narrative-driven tokens. Markets frequently rotate from major movers into high-potential presale opportunities, especially those with political or cultural nuance. As attention converges on XRP’s new highs, MAGACOIN sits at the crossroads: benefiting from the spotlight while offering clean branding, capped supply, and growth clarity. Conclusion XRP is setting up for a compelling push toward new highs before summer ends, supported by regulatory clarity, bullish technical patterns, and strong analyst projections. That build-up could spark a sector-wide shift toward similarly dynamic altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with presale rounds nearly sold out and extra allocations incentivizing early participation, offers a scaled-down , branded entry point poised to leverage the mainstream momentum of this rally. For investors seeking to ride the wave both on-chain and in political-themed token storytelling, it might just be the most strategic bet of the season .

Mechanism: Foundation-led $260M buyback (6-week schedule) Start Date: July 21, 2025 Cumulative Impact: ~$150M executed in ~30 days Supply Effect: ~3.48% of circulating supply, ~1.53% of total supply This is one of the largest foundation-managed buybacks in crypto so far. CoinMarketCap: $ENA trades at $0.71, market cap $4.32B. Why Buybacks Matters Buybacks sound bullish, but execution is what matters. In equities, they reduce shares and boost EPS. In crypto, the impact depends on how buybacks are funded and whether they can last. $HYPE: sustainable, tied to protocol fees. $PUMP: turns meme-driven traffic into token support. $ENA: foundation-backed, showing scale and structure. But buybacks are not guaranteed. Protocols can stop anytime. If revenue slows, the mechanism loses weight. Bigger Picture To Monitor The rise of buybacks shows crypto maturing. Projects are now recycling profits back into their tokens, instead of relying only on emissions or hype. That creates a loop: user activity drives fees, fees drive buybacks, and buybacks support tokens. It’s the closest crypto has come to equity-style capital returns. Still, there are risks. Some projects may announce programs and underdeliver. Others could overcommit and hurt their treasuries. The key question remains: is the buyback funded by real revenue? Buybacks are one of the clearest tokenomics trends in 2025. They don’t automatically make a token bullish, but they change the narrative. $HYPE proves scale. $PUMP adds a backbone to memes. $ENA shows how foundations can run structured buybacks. What matters is sustainability. A buyback backed by fees is stronger than one backed by reserves. The real winners will be projects that align buybacks with long-term revenue.

The move is designed to make global market access faster, cheaper, and more seamless for millions of users. TRON’s high-volume network, known for its low fees and fast settlement times, is well-suited for asset tokenization. With this integration, xStocks extends beyond its initial Solana and BNB Chain launches, giving traders and investors more options and less friction across blockchains. Kraken first introduced xStocks on June 1, 2025, allowing users to trade tokenized shares of leading US companies directly on-chain. Each xStock is fully backed 1:1 by the corresponding underlying equity. Through this latest expansion, eligible clients can soon deposit and withdraw xStocks via the TRON network, offering the same ease as transferring stablecoins. Issued by Swiss-based Backed Finance in the form of TRC-20 tokens, each xStock remains securely tied to its real-world counterpart. TRON DAO will further support adoption by integrating the tokens across its wide ecosystem of applications and partners. Since launch, xStocks has seen rapid adoption, with combined centralized and decentralized trading volumes surpassing $2.5 billion . Kraken’s co-CEO Arjun Sethi emphasized that deploying xStocks on three blockchains in under 60 days demonstrates the power of open, multichain architecture. He added that TRON’s global scale, speed, and low fees significantly value Kraken’s vision for tokenized markets. TRON offers speed, scale, and global access TRON is no stranger to traffic. It already dominates global stablecoin transfers , which it processes daily in the billions. Today, TRON is in the top five blockchains according to total value locked, including over USD 6 billion on its network. This scale and efficiency made the high-volume blockchain an obvious choice for an xStocks app. The founder of TRON, Justin Sun, said the integration would help make finance more inclusive: “Tokenized equities represent a natural evolution for crypto, bridging traditional markets with blockchain. As demand for popular equities meets a global base of previously excluded users, we’ll see a more efficient, flexible, and accessible market.” Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said the move aligned with the main strength of high-volume blockchain. He explained that TRON users were already transferring millions in stablecoins at very low cost, and the next step was to extend that use case to tokenized equities. According to him, this shift would allow people worldwide to access traditional markets with the same ease as sending digital dollars. Kraken seizes a global market opportunity The integration of TRON by Kraken is part of its broader goal of replatforming Wall Street on the blockchain. The company already has customers in more than 140 countries. More locations will be rolled out over the coming weeks, providing access to tokenized stocks for an even larger user base. It’s a simple idea: Let people trade stocks the way the internet lives — boundaryless, permissionless, and interoperable for every chain. With multichain yStake, Kraken is knocking down similar walls that have all too often made traditional markets off limits to all. That often represents their first chance to have exposure to US stocks. That could be life-changing in places where savers have limited or costly access to a traditional brokerage account.

He aped into @Solana’s newest memecoin, $YZY, with $768K. The chart ripped. Market cap touched $134M (CMC) before crashing. By the time he rage-sold, his stack was worth just $56K. The wipeout lit Crypto Twitter on fire. NEW: A whale bought $768K of @Solana memecoin $YZY , its market cap spiked to $134M and then dropped instantly. Just 4 hours later, he sold it for $56K — a ~$712K loss. pic.twitter.com/RpTFW2uIw8 — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) August 20, 2025 Finnbags and the Kanye Play Behind $YZY is @finnbags, Founder & CEO of @BagsApp . Last night he launched the token himself. CT says he pulled a Sahil move: making memes, farming his own referrals, and steering liquidity. hey @kanyewest we made a $YZY coin for you on @BagsApp You get 100% of royalties earned from the trading volume of the coin. $50K has already been raised for you in the first 10 minutes. 70% of the supply is locked and can be transferred to you on a vesting schedule.… — FINN (@finnbags) August 19, 2025 The setup was wild: FINN bought 70% of supply at launch. 100% of trading fees went straight to Kanye West’s wallet. Market went full PvP. Cap nearly hit $13M (CMC) within hours. Then Finn tweeted at @kanyewest, telling him to “claim” the fees. Traders weren’t laughing. The chart nuked. Market cap dumped to $1.5M (CMC) overnight. Theories flew. Some pointed at Wintermute, calling it a money laundering op. Others just said it felt like a clout grab gone wrong. CT Starts Digging The backlash didn’t stop at the token. Clips of Finn’s old stream with @MrBeast resurfaced, no crypto talk in sight. Later, his appearance on @notthreadguy’s stream made things worse. Excuses didn’t land. Trust cratered. Every token tied to him bled. The “launch for Ye” meme collapsed before it even got traction. A few influencers like @SOL_IDNESS defended him, arguing intentions weren’t bad. But the larger CT consensus? If Kanye is already a billionaire, why would he ever need a memecoin fee drop? The Pumpfun Angle To Note As the drama grew, @StalkHQ traced the $YZY chart. Turns out, much of the run was botted. The dev botted the fake $yzy chart and pushed it all the way to $82M market cap, yet only made $3.62K in Pumpfun @pumpdotfun creator rewards. This shows the dev isn’t making much from rewards, meaning their main profit path could be through rugging the token instead. https://t.co/cFstowO0Nm pic.twitter.com/5EMgRiwVGr — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) August 20, 2025 On Pumpfun , the dev pushed the chart all the way to $82M market cap, but only earned $3.62K in creator rewards. That mismatch tells a story. If devs don’t make money from Pumpfun rewards, their main incentive leans toward rugging. Compare it to imperfect, another Pumpfun token. Market cap sits at just $1.27M (CMC). Yet its creator already pulled $3.53K in rewards. Smaller, but more sustainable. The difference is clear: organic community-driven growth pays creators better. Botted pumps may look strong, but they usually collapse fast, leaving exit scams as the only profit path. What This Shows 1. Pumpfun doesn’t reward fake pumps. When a chart rockets but creator rewards stay tiny, it’s often bot-driven. 2. Organic traction is king. Tokens that build communities see rewards track closely with their growth. 3. Red flag signal. High market cap + low rewards = botting risk, and often rugs. It’s exactly what happened with $YZY. The chart went vertical, but the mismatch gave it away. And when the smoke cleared, the whale’s $768K entry became a $56K exit. The Bigger Picture For CT, the episode blends two familiar storylines: whales getting torched chasing hype, and founders turning launchpads into personal casinos. The Kanye angle just made it messier. What was pitched as a “token for Ye” ended up as another quick pump, another crash, another bag burned. And it leaves a blunt takeaway: If a billionaire like Kanye isn’t claiming it, maybe you shouldn’t either. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

They let early buyers join before major listings, often at more favorable prices. Yet not every presale delivers. The most promising ones show strong funding, active communities, and clear plans that look solid for the long run. Some depend on cultural hype but still succeed in drawing attention from traders aiming for fast moves. This article highlights four projects gaining traction: BlockDAG, Maxi Doge ($MAXI), Snorter Bot ($SNORT), and PepeNode ($PEPENODE). Each brings different strengths, ranging from real technical progress to heavy community buzz. For anyone scanning the top crypto presales, these four stand out for combining adoption trends with high speculation appeal. 1. BlockDAG: $376M Secured and Still Rising BlockDAG has emerged as one of the largest presales of 2025. It merges Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) design with Proof-of-Work (PoW) for a system that balances speed with decentralization. It also supports EVM compatibility, letting developers launch Ethereum-based apps and contracts with ease. The presale has crossed $376 million, with BDAG priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29. Early participants from Batch 1 are already up more than 2,660%, and projections suggest the price could move toward $1 after listing, offering about a 36× jump. Adoption metrics are also compelling. The X1 mobile miner app has brought in more than 2.5 million users, while over 19,300 ASIC miners have been delivered, creating one of the most inclusive mining setups today. The project already counts more than 200,000 holders and a developer group of 4,500+ building 300 decentralized apps ahead of the mainnet. To build momentum further, BlockDAG launched a 200 ETH competition worth around $1 million. Those who expand their holdings during the presale can join for a chance to win, adding more excitement. With 20 exchange listings secured and plans for Coinbase and Gemini in motion, BlockDAG (BDAG) is positioned well. For anyone evaluating the top crypto presales, this is a clear standout as its framework and community are already established before trading begins. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Culture with Extra Features Maxi Doge takes inspiration from meme culture but adds plans that go beyond humor. While rooted in the same community energy that drove past meme coin surges, $MAXI aims to combine fun with a roadmap that includes staking, reward systems, and a small NFT marketplace. This gives it more depth than projects relying on memes alone. The presale has been set up to attract both casual buyers and early participants, using low barriers and frequent community activities. Strong social media engagement has boosted interest, and its identity resonates across different groups. Even though it is still in presale, Maxi Doge is getting attention by blending cultural relevance with modest utility features. For those who value both hype and long-term ideas, $MAXI stands out among the top crypto presales as a project mixing fun with potential staying power. 3. Snorter Bot ($SNORT): Designed for Fast Access Snorter Bot is focused on improving speed and ease of use in crypto. Its goal is to deliver low-cost, high-speed transactions paired with a clear interface that can work for experienced traders as well as newcomers. By building cross-chain compatibility, it is shaping a platform that connects with multiple networks while keeping costs efficient. The presale has drawn notice by offering rewards to early users and setting out a roadmap that includes incentives for active participation. This approach could help build a loyal user base that values both speed and perks. At today’s presale price, it presents an affordable entry before listing on exchanges. While the project still needs to prove itself, $SNORT’s balance of function and simplicity gives it appeal. For those reviewing the top crypto presales, Snorter Bot is a project that offers both utility and opportunity. 4. PepeNode ($PEPENODE): Viral Energy with Broader Goals PepeNode aims to harness meme-driven hype while adding plans for functional growth. Building around the viral Pepe theme, it uses community energy to drive attention while outlining a platform that could provide rewards and limited integration with decentralized projects. This approach allows it to ride the popularity of memes while adding extra features for users. Its presale has been made widely accessible, with low entry levels designed for broad participation. Online groups and meme communities have helped spread its reach, putting $PEPENODE in a position to stand out if the team follows through on its plans. Though not as advanced as larger presales, the project’s mix of meme strength and functional aims makes it notable. For those who like community-driven projects but want some added utility, $PEPENODE ranks among the top crypto presales worth watching in 2025. Closing Thoughts Presales offer early chances to join, but the strongest ones combine real adoption with clear paths forward. BlockDAG has already set itself apart, raising more than $376 million, attracting millions of users, thousands of developers, and launching a $1M competition to boost activity. Maxi Doge blends meme power with staking and NFT features. Snorter Bot targets speed, simplicity, and cross-chain links, while PepeNode mixes viral culture with light functional goals. For anyone searching the top crypto presales , these four show how hype and fundamentals can work together. BlockDAG especially stands out since it already has major funding, an active ecosystem, and multiple exchange listings in motion. If it reaches $1 after launch as analysts suggest, it could deliver some of the strongest results in 2025.

Two names drawing attention are Arbitrum (ARB) and XRP. Arbitrum’s charts show technical breakouts pointing to higher targets, while XRP stays in focus thanks to fresh updates on exchange activity and shifting positions among holders. Both tokens play important roles in the crypto space, giving analysts plenty to follow. But the real question for most buyers isn’t which coin makes the loudest headline; it’s which has staying power. In that search for the top crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet is making its mark. With a presale built around adoption, structured tokenomics, and proven demand, it offers something many projects lack: a design built to last. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Momentum Draws Trader Interest Arbitrum gained attention in August as bullish momentum lifted its price above key technical levels. Analysts highlight a breakout that opened targets as high as $1.20, giving it strength while other altcoins stall. This Arbitrum price momentum has traders suggesting it could spark renewed capital flow into Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, where ARB holds a lead. Its relevance goes beyond short-term moves. Arbitrum powers one of Ethereum’s largest scaling systems, handling fast and cheap transactions. With DeFi apps expanding and developers committed, ARB sits at the centre of the infrastructure conversation. If it sustains momentum toward higher levels, it could remain a strong candidate for the top crypto to buy now. Still, risks remain. $1.20 is a key target, and failure to hold support could trigger setbacks. Investors will need to weigh its technical signals against wider market trends. XRP News Highlights Market Uncertainty And Potential XRP continues to grab headlines, this time with Coinbase cutting its holdings by over 50%. Some took this as a negative, but analysts suggest it reflects risk management more than rejection. Even so, XRP’s price shows both resilience and hesitation. The bullish case points to Ripple’s improving legal clarity, which could attract institutions. Bears, however, argue that XRP’s inability to sustain breakouts remains a concern. These opposing views make XRP a battleground, yet its place among the biggest crypto assets ensures it stays relevant. For those deciding if XRP is the top crypto to buy right now, much depends on whether institutions expand adoption. Without new triggers, the token risks stagnation even with its strong reputation. Cold Wallet Presale Delivers Real Utility & ROI Potential Cold Wallet is offering something different: a presale tied to real-world function, not just hype. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, it has raised $6.3M and sold more than 740M tokens. Instead of relying on speculation, it rewards users directly. Every gas fee, swap, or transfer turns into cashback paid in $CWT, making everyday crypto use a source of return. This utility-first design sets it apart. Cold Wallet operates as a self-custody mobile app with no KYC, no waiting, and full control of assets. Planned Layer-2 integration will lower or even remove gas fees, making rewards instant and cost-free. Unlike meme-driven projects, Cold Wallet ties adoption to real benefits, ensuring users have reasons to keep engaging long term. Its tokenomics reinforce this structure: 40% allocated to presale, 25% to rewards, with team allocations locked for years. This reduces inflation risk and aligns growth with user participation. The presale’s 150-stage design ensures steady scaling, with early entrants enjoying the strongest ROI potential, up to 4,900%. Cold Wallet shows why structure matters. By turning costs into earnings and offering a sustainable model, it is positioning itself as the top crypto to buy right now, especially for those seeking value beyond hype. Final Outlook: Why Cold Wallet’s Design Sets It Apart Arbitrum’s momentum signals strength in Ethereum scaling, while XRP’s ongoing news proves its market presence. Both hold potential but rely on external triggers to deliver gains. Cold Wallet instead focuses on usability and reward mechanics. With $6.3M raised, 740M+ tokens sold, and cashback that grows with adoption, it is building long-term value from the ground up. For 2025, the best performers may be those designed for daily use, and Cold Wallet looks ready to lead that category.

50414699,561445,1755738048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50414699.jpeg,Argentina’s Capital Adopts Crypto For Tax Payments,https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-capital-adopts-crypto-for-tax-payments/,"Buenos Aires has switched on “BA Cripto,” a policy package that lets residents and businesses settle city taxes and administrative fees using cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Rolled out on Tuesday, August 19, 2025, the program covers municipal levies such as ABL (property tax), Patentes (vehicle tax), and Ingresos Brutos (turnover tax), as well as non-tax procedures like driver’s licenses and traffic fines, payable via a city QR flow. Buenos Aires Goes Crypto City Hall’s move is broader than a payments toggle. Officials unveiled four measures: adding crypto-linked activities to the city’s economic-activity nomenclator to simplify filings; excluding virtual-asset service providers (PSAVs) from certain bank-collection regimes under the turnover tax; shifting the taxable base for crypto trading from gross transaction value to the net spread; and enabling QR crypto payments for both taxes and administrative services. The government framed the package as a regulatory tune-up that reduces frictions while aligning taxation with how digital-asset markets actually operate. Mayor Jorge Macri presented the initiative as an institutional modernization designed to attract investment and make compliance easier. “The goal is for the City to be a world leader in crypto,” he said, adding: “We already have the human capital, and now we are building the tools by reducing bureaucracy to make taxpayer compliance easier and to support the arrival of new companies setting up here.” The remarks were delivered at The Slow Kale in Colegiales, a venue that accepts crypto payments. Macri also argued the package signals a friendlier posture toward the sector: “These measures ensure the crypto world sees that the City is increasingly friendly. The digital economy compels us to update and adapt with a modern, agile, efficient and intelligent State. We want talent to find a place to grow, innovate and lead without obstacles.” The backdrop is growing usage. According to city data cited at launch, roughly 10,000 people in Buenos Aires receive income from abroad via crypto or PayPal , and the use of PIX rails has been rising. Nationwide, Argentina counts “more than 10 million” crypto accounts—about 22% of Latin America’s total—figures the city says justify tailored rules and public-service rails that natively accommodate digital assets. For firms, the classification update matters because it gives crypto activities an explicit slot in the tax nomenclator, improving clarity “without fiscal cost” and easing cross-jurisdiction information matching. Excluding PSAVs from bank-collection regimes is intended to curb automatic withholdings that can tie up working capital, while the new spread-based tax base acknowledges the mismatch between high-volume, low-margin trading and a gross-receipts framework. Together, these steps amount to what the city calls a more “agile” and “transparent” environment for digital-asset businesses to operate in the capital. On the consumer side, the payment experience is meant to be straightforward: scan a city QR and pay the selected tax or fee with a compatible wallet. Officials said only some wallets currently support crypto payments, but a Buenos Aires–provided “aggregator” is in the works to let “neighbors and companies” pay “from any wallet, directly, faster, and simpler.” The government did not publish a technical spec or list of supported assets at launch. Hernán Lombardi, the city’s Economic Development Minister, cast the reforms as a recalibration of legal and tax treatment for digital assets. “These reforms mark a change in the legal and tax treatment of digital assets. Less bureaucracy, greater legal certainty, and clear rules will translate into more investment,” he said, noting the updated nomenclator will help “determine and clarify the activities of companies and individual crypto-asset users, and thus avoid withholdings that compromise the sector’s working capital.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.77 trillion.",Crypto News|Argentina|bitcoin|bitcoin news|Buenos Aires|crypto|crypto news|Crypto News Argentina,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 01:00:48

Expert Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-treasury-bubble-popping/,"In a thread on August 19, analyst Miles Deutscher argued that MicroStrategy’s market-implied net asset value (mNAV) premium—the core gear in Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin acquisition flywheel—has compressed sharply, weakening the feedback loop that helped the company outpace Bitcoin through most of the cycle. “Michael Saylor built the craziest BTC flywheel in history. But his buying power is starting to fade. The market is now asking one question: ‘Is the BTC treasury bubble finally popping?’” MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Premium Is Fading Deutscher grounds the discussion in how investors currently value MicroStrategy. “People often overlook that MicroStrategy has a legacy software business, which continues to generate revenue. However, MicroStrategy has essentially become a company whose valuation is primarily influenced by its BTC holdings. The entire system is powered by mNAV (Market-Implied NAV).” In practical terms, the mNAV multiple is the premium investors pay over the company’s look-through Bitcoin value to access leveraged BTC exposure via MSTR. “An mNAV of ~1.58x means the market is paying a 58% premium for their BTC.” According to Deutscher, that premium “was once a 3.4x mNAV” when Bitcoin was surging, but it has “now decreased to 1.58x. Demand is slowing down.” In other words, what had been a powerful flywheel—high premium enabling cheap equity issuance that funded more Bitcoin purchases, which in turn kept NAV rising and the premium elevated—now spins with much less torque. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts The Collapse Of Bitcoin In This Timeframe That shift intersected with a contentious corporate action. “Recently, Saylor sparked controversy by revealing that Strategy had revised its MSTR Equity ATM Guidance to offer greater ‘flexibility’ in executing its capital markets strategy.” The implication, Deutscher argues, is that greater issuance flexibility “may dilute shareholder value and increase financial risk tied to Bitcoin’s volatility.” He notes that “the market is quite divided” on the change. On the constructive side, he quotes @thedefivillain’s take—“Slower concentration of supply in Saylor’s hands,” “Greater leverage to justify mNAV,” and “Reduced buying pressure for BTC in dollar terms”—as reasons the revision could ultimately be benign. But critics worry about “the possibility of a ‘death spiral.’ The removal of the 2.5x mNAV safeguard for equity issuance may allow MicroStrategy to sell shares at lower valuations.” Reflexivity, in Deutscher’s telling, is the operative risk factor: “Reflexivity is a brutal force that operates in both directions.” A Hypothetical Scenario Deutscher then sets up a stress-test to illustrate how that reflexivity could bite if Bitcoin weakens and the premium compresses to parity. “If BTC’s price drops 20% and MicroStrategy’s mNAV multiple falls to 1.0x, the stock might plummet by 46.5%.” He walks through the arithmetic from a notional baseline of $115,000 per BTC, which on a 20% decline would fall to $92,000. On MicroStrategy’s “226,331 BTC,” he calculates that would put look-through NAV at $20.82 billion. To align an mNAV of exactly 1.0x, he backs into enterprise value and market cap under that scenario: “Starting with an enterprise value of $20.82 billion, we subtract MicroStrategy’s $2.2 billion in debt and add its $0.1 billion in cash. This calculation unveils the company’s market cap, hitting $18.72 billion, a significant pullback from its original $35 billion market cap.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Hinges On Trump’s Pick For Fed Chair: Analyst The conclusion he draws from the modeled path—BTC −20% to ~$92,000, mNAV → 1.0x, MSTR market cap −46.5%—is that MicroStrategy’s equity remains a leveraged instrument with an outcome path that can be materially worse than Bitcoin itself when the premium compresses. Beyond the scenario math, Deutscher links recent spot price action to changing marginal demand. “I think BTC’s recent weakness can be attributed to the market starting to price in reduced Saylor demand/tail potential risk of the revised ATM guidance.” In parallel, he highlights how the proliferation of spot ETFs erodes the original rationale for paying a large listed-company premium to own BTC “beta”: “Spot Bitcoin ETFs are plentiful now. Why would you pay a 58% premium for MSTR’s leveraged exposure when you can grab IBIT at a clean ~1.0x NAV?” By his framing, the mNAV premium itself “was indicative of the market’s view that MSTR was going to outperform BTC.” With that view fading, the premium looks less like an enduring structural feature and more like a belief-sensitive variable. “In my opinion, the MSTR premium is essentially a gamble. You’re betting on three fragile things: unwavering market confidence, open capital markets, and Saylor’s leadership. If any of those pillars start to wobble, the premium collapses.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,624.

The idea mirrors Amazon’s early move into cloud computing nearly two decades ago, when it began offering excess capacity to outside businesses. That experiment evolved into Amazon Web Services (AWS), now a multibillion-dollar powerhouse and a cornerstone of the modern internet. For OpenAI, the logic is similar. The company has poured resources into cutting-edge chips, servers, and cooling systems to power its large-scale AI workloads. Allowing others to rent that infrastructure could open the door for startups and smaller firms to access high-performance computing without building it themselves—while creating a lucrative business line for OpenAI. Still, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar emphasized the idea remains speculative. With demand for ChatGPT and other AI products soaring, OpenAI’s immediate priority is securing enough capacity for its needs. In a recent interview, Friar confirmed the company isn’t actively pursuing the plan yet but sees it as a possible opportunity in the future. CFO eyes infrastructure leasing down the road OpenAI has become good at building data centers tailored for artificial intelligence. This know-how could be productized. Friar said that OpenAI is trying to take more control of its infrastructure design instead of relying on external vendors , cautioning that if the company only purchased equipment from others, it would risk giving away its intellectual property. The company has raised tens of billions for ultrapowerful AI chips and facilities. Its Stargate project with SoftBank and Oracle promises to construct some of the largest data centers in the world, in the United States and beyond. Excitement is running high after CEO Sam Altman promised ambitious plans, saying that people should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on infrastructure shortly. He added that the company is working on an interesting new financial instrument to fund these mega-projects, though he did not provide further details. Until now, OpenAI has depended on Microsoft and the technology company Oracle to cover most of its infrastructure costs . But Friar said banks and private equity firms are now piling in, providing debt financing. In addition to debt, the company is considering innovative financing mechanisms. But even with such aspirations, OpenAI still loses money. Data centers and GPUs are very expensive. But growth is rapid. In July, the firm surpassed a $1 billion monthly revenue for the first time — buoyed by surging global demand for ChatGPT and its enterprise tools. Altman frames bold plans, warns of AI hype Despite his push for massive spending, Altman has also acknowledged that AI may be in a bubble. In an interview last week, he compared the current enthusiasm to the dot-com era, noting that smart people often go overboard on a kernel of truth. Still, expansion is moving ahead. The project, Stargate, is a $500 billion joint venture and is already starting with projects in the US, Norway, and the UAE. The aim is to secure AI capacity to a level no company has ever achieved. Altman has suggested we need 100 million AI GPUs to power future models. It could cost $3 trillion. For reference, that’s more than the GDPs of many countries. According to recent accounts, OpenAI is reportedly gearing up for a second stock sale. It would enable current and former employees to cash out their shares at an estimated valuation of around $500 billion. That would be almost double its last disclosed valuation of $300 billion, in a financing round by SoftBank. Investor appetite remains strong. OpenAI secured $41 billion in its latest round, exceeding its initial goal of $40 billion because of strong demand.

Among such a token is Mutuum Finance (MTU), causing massive frenzy among traders and DeFi participants alike. Over 15400 investors have invested in the project presale to date, and over $14.65 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already up to Stage 6 of Presale priced at $0.035. Stage 7 will be a 14.29% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance is arousing anticipations of a potential 50x rally from its $0.035 starting point, thus forming a gem in a market where well-established assets like Cardano may experience short-term consolidation. Cardano Price Outlook Cardano (ADA) currently trades at about $0.92, making slight intraday oscillations around a $0.92–$0.98 range as it consolidates at resistance levels without extreme movements. Market analysts indicate ADA is passing through a symmetrical triangle pattern, constricting between roughly $0.85 and $0.98, and this indicates that a breakout will happen soon—either to the $0.80 support or to a potential push to $1.10–$1.15 resistance, depending on the direction of the market. In this tranquil build-up, interest in Mutuum Finance remains present. Mutuum Finance Presale Proceeds to Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has completed Phase 5 of presale and proceeded to Phase 6, in which its tokens sell at $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has surpassed $14.65 million already and over 15400 holders have participated. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Partners with CertiK to Run $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is partnering with CertiK for its Bug Bounty Program. The reward pool of the program shall be $50,000 USDT. The program shall be rewarded under four categories, i.e. low, minor, major and critical. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) had reached a full audit by Certik for user funds security and blockchain integrity. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a $100,000 giveaway where 10 of its participants will be given $10,000 MUTM tokens worth. It has also made public that a leaderboard system will reward the top 50 token holders of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with a bonus. Mutuum Finance is a P2C and P2P lending protocol in which uses are in control of their funds. It is an end-to-end DeFi experience highly tailored to the customer’s requirements and more transparent, secure, and flexible compared to the centralized lending product. The project is gaining popularity as a DeFi project with the potential of delivering more returns than most of the established older altcoins. As Cardano (ADA) is hovering at $1, technical indicators are anticipating short-term stabilization with a window of opportunity for new DeFi platforms to gain popularity among investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking advantage of this, with Stage 6 presale at $0.035, over 15,400 participants, and raised funds of $14.65 million. Backed by a CertiK-audited bug bounty and a $100,000 community giveaway, along with its Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending dual model, MUTM is positioned for a possible 50x upside, and it’s one of the front-runners in a space where established altcoins such as ADA may lose steam. Early investors should find good returns if the project maintains its current momentum and adoption.

Among the highlights is Magic Cue, an intelligent assistant designed to make everyday tasks more seamless. The feature scans Gmail, Calendar, Messages, and other apps in real time to provide context-aware suggestions—reminders, quick replies, or relevant information. For instance, if you call an airline, Magic Cue can instantly recognize the number and pull up details about your upcoming flight from Gmail or Calendar. When a friend texts about dinner, the tool can check your availability, suggest a reply, and even include reservation information. This level of integration shows how Google is pushing AI beyond convenience, transforming it into a practical assistant capable of handling real-world scenarios . The Pixel 10 debuts Camera Coach for professional-grade photo guidance and real-time Voice Translate, further underscoring Google’s push to lead the smartphone AI race. Pixel 10 series puts privacy first while packing pro-level AI photography Google built Magic Cue to provide maximum privacy . Users’ data will never leave their phones unless they explicitly allow it, because all data remains stored in a secure enclave on their device. Similarly, apps won’t access any information that Magic Cue collects unless users permit them. The phones will also feature another AI tool, Camera Coach, that helps users take professional photos. The tool suggests the best photo angles, lighting conditions, and lens modes to capture high-quality images. Super Res Zoom on the Pro models allows users to zoom in on distant objects. It uses AI to enhance clarity and seamlessly merge multiple images to produce more detailed pictures. Google also made these advanced features accessible to different users by maintaining competitive pricing for the Pixel 10 series. The base model starts at $800, the Pixel 10 Pro at $1,000, the Pixel 10 Pro XL at $1,200, and the foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold at $1,800. The standard Pixel 10 models will be available in stores from August 28, and the foldable version on October 9. Google highlights AI features and improvements at event Google integrated the Gemini AI platform into the Pixel 10 series to allow users to access its interactive and proactive features. Take visual overlays, for example. With it, Gemini can recognize objects through the camera and point out helpful information like street signs while travelling or important details in documents. Another interactive tool, Gemini Live, can detect the tone of a user’s voice in conversation and provide more natural and personal replies. With these abilities, the Pixel 10 phones can provide more human-like interaction between users and their devices. Voice Translat can translate phone calls across multiple languages in real-time while preserving the natural tone of each speaker. Users don’t need third-party translation apps or awkward delays while interpreting conversations. The Pixel 10 series also includes Pixel Journal and other AI-driven productivity tools to help users organize their work, track personal goals, and manage everyday tasks more efficiently. There are more AI-powered tools across apps like Photos, Messages, and Gboard that allow users to edit images with natural language commands, draft messages or emails faster, and receive intelligent suggestions based on context. Google’s advanced features with the Pixel 10 series surpass Apple’s offerings, whose next-generation Siri is not expected until 2026. Analysts say Google’s steady integration of AI could have potential ripple effects on other Android devices like Samsung smartphones.

Litecoin is lining up for a breakout toward $175–$180, backed by strong wallet activity and record futures open interest. Avalanche is flashing bullish signals with a double-bottom and a huge surge in stablecoin and DEX volumes. While these setups look attractive, not every project relies on charts or catalysts. Cold Wallet is shaping its own future with a mobile-first, self-custody app that pays users for activity. With $6.3 million raised and more than 740 million tokens sold at $0.00998, Cold Wallet’s design offers everyday value in a way technical rallies alone cannot. Litecoin (LTC) Price Target: Signs of Breakout Strength Litecoin (LTC) is drawing attention as its technical and on-chain signals align. Futures open interest recently hit $1.26 billion, while active wallets have risen 12% month-on-month. Over 60% of LTC supply remains with long-term holders, a bullish sign of confidence. The network has also processed more than 250 million transactions, showing continued usage. On charts, LTC is holding just under $137–$138 resistance. Analysts believe a clean break could lift prices toward $150 soon and extend to $175–$180 by the end of August. Weekly indicators like the Supertrend have flipped bullish, and RSI readings are climbing toward overbought, hinting at an explosive move if volume supports. With broader crypto strength, LTC could even test $200 later this year. Avalanche Price Forecast: Ecosystem Growth Adds Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is building momentum after forming a bullish double-bottom near $15.60 and pushing above its 50-day EMA. The neckline sits at $27.40, and a breakout could send AVAX toward $40, a potential 65% move higher. Supporting this are real growth metrics: stablecoin volumes on Avalanche have surged 715% in just a month, while DEX activity and total value locked are also climbing. Dinari Global’s launch of tokenised U.S. stocks on Avalanche further boosts utility, adding real-world use cases. With both technical and ecosystem expansion driving it, AVAX is shaping up as one of the top crypto picks for 2025. Cold Wallet: Utility, Self-Custody, and Real Rewards Unlike coins that depend on hype or chart breakouts, Cold Wallet is building long-term value through usability. It is a self-custody, mobile-first wallet that removes onboarding hurdles, no external wallets or lengthy KYC needed. You control your keys, and the app is designed for everyday use. What sets it apart is its rewards system. Every action inside the app, swaps, bridging, paying gas fees, earns cashback in native CWT. This design flips costs into earnings, meaning the more you use it, the more you gain. The referral program adds another layer, rewarding both the inviter and the new user with cashback, creating compounding growth across the network. Currently in Stage 17 at $0.00998, Cold Wallet has raised $6.3 million and sold over 740 million tokens. Unlike speculative assets that need whales or news events to rally, Cold Wallet’s value expands through user activity. Adoption builds naturally, making it less dependent on outside sentiment. This blend of self-custody, access, and reward gives Cold Wallet a lasting edge. For those asking about the best crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet isn’t just another name on a chart. It’s a system that grows stronger with every user, aligning ownership with utility and financial benefit. The Final Verdict Litecoin is eyeing a breakout toward $175–$180, supported by strong fundamentals and rising activity. Avalanche shows promise with its double-bottom and real ecosystem expansion. Both coins are attractive plays in 2025. But Cold Wallet offers something different: a user-driven system where self-custody meets rewards. With $6.3 million raised and over 740 million tokens sold, its model creates lasting value by rewarding everyday usage. For those weighing options, Cold Wallet may be the best crypto to buy now, driven not by speculation, but by a design that pays back its community.

Why BlockDAG, Stellar, Ondo & Hyperliquid Are 2025’s Big Shots!",https://thecoinrise.com/looking-for-the-next-altcoins-to-explode-why-blockdag-stellar-ondo-hyperliquid-are-2025s-big-shots/,"The crypto market is gearing up for what could be its strongest cycle yet, and attention is shifting to the next altcoin to explode before valuations take off. This time it’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum, newer, utility-driven projects with strong adoption are lining up for center stage. Getting in early could mean the difference between modest profits and life-changing returns. Four names are standing out right now: BlockDAG, the presale powerhouse with staggering ROI potential; Stellar (XLM), showing strong technical setups; Ondo Finance (ONDO), leading the way in tokenized assets; and Hyperliquid (HYPE), setting trading volume records in DeFi. Together, these projects highlight innovation, adoption-ready ecosystems, and momentum that could dominate 2025 headlines. For those scanning the horizon for the next altcoin to explode, these four deserve top priority. 1. BlockDAG: 25 Billion Coins Sold Before Launch! BlockDAG’s presale is moving fast, with each batch bringing higher prices and stronger demand. Currently in Batch 29, BDAG coins are available for $0.0276, with analysts calling for a $1 launch value, an eye-catching 36x upside. Buyers from Batch 1 have already locked in gains of 2,660% compared to today’s rate, and momentum is far from slowing down. The numbers are impressive, $378 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a rapidly expanding base of holders. BlockDAG ’s appeal isn’t just its presale, though. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design allows lightning-fast, secure, and scalable transactions while staying decentralized. Adoption is already underway with 19,000 ASIC miners sold and more than 2.5 million active users on the X1 mobile miner app. Developers are busy ahead of mainnet, ensuring utility from day one. Once Batch 29 sells out, the entry point jumps instantly, making hesitation costly. History shows the next altcoin to explode usually rewards early movers, and BlockDAG looks primed to be one of 2025’s breakout names. 2. Stellar: Eyes on $0.50 Breakout Level Stellar is showing real momentum after climbing 12.4% this week, holding between $0.43–$0.45. All eyes are on the $0.50 resistance, where an inverse head-and-shoulders and bullish engulfing candle pattern signal a potential breakout. Analysts predict that a push past $0.50 could trigger a rally of 43%, targeting $0.60–$0.77. On-chain signals confirm the trend, with Stellar’s TVL surging nearly 80% to $152 million, highlighting growing adoption in cross-border transactions. Still, maintaining volume and support above $0.50 is key for sustained momentum. With solid fundamentals backing its technical strength, Stellar stands out as the next altcoin to explode for traders looking for short-term upside. 3. Ondo Finance: $309M Daily Volume Boosts Liquidity Ondo Finance is steadily building its position as a leader in the tokenized asset sector. Priced around $1.02, ONDO is trading with $309 million in daily volume, a 26% jump in just one day. The team is scaling aggressively with its $250M Ondo Catalyst initiative, targeted acquisitions, and new alliances that expand the Global Markets Alliance to 25 members. These moves strengthen its Real-World Asset (RWA) ecosystem, giving it a foothold in what many expect to be a trillion-dollar market. While its weekly chart looks steady, ONDO’s long-term setup is what’s driving confidence. For those chasing future growth in finance, Ondo is among the clearest picks for the next altcoin to explode. 4. Hyperliquid: RSI and MACD Signal Breakout Hyperliquid is shaking up DeFi like few others. On August 15, it smashed records with $29 billion in daily trading volume and $7.7M in fees generated. HYPE has gained 19% this week, trading at $48.57, just 1.1% under its all-time high. Indicators like an RSI of 63 and a strong MACD are pointing toward a move to $55. Meanwhile, institutional involvement is scaling fast. TVL now sits at $610M, with inflows jumping from $21M in June to $349M in July, showing accelerating adoption. With record-setting trading and liquidity, Hyperliquid has carved out its place as the next altcoin to explode, riding the wave of DeFi scalability. Final Thoughts In a fast-changing market, catching the next altcoin to explode before mainstream attention hits can mean the biggest rewards. BlockDAG is leading the way with unmatched presale traction and scalable design. Stellar is closing in on a breakout with strong technical and adoption growth. Ondo Finance is securing its role in the tokenization boom, and Hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of DeFi growth. All four combine innovation, adoption, and strong momentum, key ingredients for high-performing digital assets in 2025. While risks always exist, aligning early with these projects could be transformative as the next bull run gathers steam. The post Looking For The Next Altcoins to Explode?

Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ The total ranks among the largest weekly inflows seen recently, CoinShares data shows. Prices rose, but the main driver was money moving into funds rather than a broad retail rush. Concentrated Flows From A Single Product Based on reports from CoinShares, almost all of the inflows came through one provider. The US accounted for $3.73 billion, almost the entire week’s total. Canada added $33.7 million, Hong Kong close to $21 million, and Australia $12 million. By contrast, Brazil and Sweden recorded outflows of $10.6 million and $50 million. Market participants say the bulk of the cash was funneled into a single iShares product, which helps explain how a relatively narrow set of flows moved overall AUM so sharply. Ethereum Draws The Most Money Ethereum attracted the lion’s share of last week’s inflows at $2.87 billion, or 77% of the total. That brings year-to-date net inflows into ETH to about $11 billion. Ethereum now makes up nearly 30% of assets under management, versus Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Bitcoin’s weekly intake was $552 million. Other moves included Solana taking $176.5 million and XRP adding $126 million, while Litecoin and Ton showed small outflows of $0.4 million and $1 million, respectively. These numbers point to a clear shift in where institutional money is parked this week. Corporate Holdings And Supply Notes Reports have disclosed that more than 16 companies have added Ethereum to their balance sheets, according to CryptoQuant. Together they hold about 2.45 million ETH, valued at roughly $11 billion, and those coins are effectively out of circulation while locked in treasuries or cold storage. It’s worth noting that Ethereum does not have a fixed supply like Bitcoin; about one million ETH was added to supply last year, and supply dynamics can vary with network activity. Watch Futures And Large Holders Futures open interest sits near $38 billion, a sizeable figure that raises the chance of swift price moves when positions are closed. Related Reading: Cardano Climbs To 8th, Pushing Dogecoin And TRON Down The Ranks Large, concentrated holders and sudden shifts in futures positions have shown they can push prices sharply in either direction. For now, this is a flow-driven event more than a broad retail surge. If the same product keeps taking in large sums, it will keep adding upward pressure. At the same time, thin liquidity and big positions can flip gains into losses fast. Investors and traders should keep an eye on weekly fund flows, futures open interest, and on-chain movements to see whether the trend spreads beyond a few big buyers.

The purchases, made through the firm’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), highlight Ark’s conviction in digital asset infrastructure even as broader crypto stocks tumbled. According to Ark’s latest filing, the fund acquired 356,346 shares of Bullish and 150,908 shares of Robinhood. This marks the third consecutive trading day Ark boosted its Robinhood position, following earlier buys of $14 million on Monday and $9 million last Friday. The moves expand Ark’s exposure to platforms shaping the future of trading and digital finance. Bullish and Robinhood Slide Amid Market Sell-Off Despite Ark’s heavy buying, both stocks ended sharply lower on the day. Bullish dropped 6.09% to $59.51, slipping an additional 3.24% in after-hours trading, while Robinhood fell 6.54% to $107.50 and lost another 1.23% post-market. The sell-off wasn’t isolated. Other crypto-linked equities also suffered, with Coinbase down 5.82%, Galaxy Digital plunging 10.06%, Strategy sliding 7.43%, and Circle off 4.49%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.46% as investors pulled back ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium, where policy signals are expected to shape market sentiment. A Strategic Bet on Crypto’s Long-Term Growth Ark’s latest move builds on a $172 million allocation to Bullish last week, when the Cayman Islands-based exchange made its highly anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange. With Ark now holding more than 1.1 million Bullish shares valued at roughly $73.85 million, the firm is betting big on the platform’s role in the evolution of crypto markets. Similarly, Robinhood has become one of Ark’s most consistent crypto-adjacent holdings. The recent spree increases its share of ARKK’s portfolio to over 4%, highlighting Ark’s belief in the platform’s long-term potential despite short-term volatility. Wood’s investment strategy mirrors confidence in crypto’s ongoing institutional adoption, as firms like Gemini, OKX, and Kraken explore IPOs. Ark also maintains significant positions in Circle and Coinbase, further engraving its role as one of Wall Street’s most vocal champions of digital assets. As volatility shakes out weaker hands, Ark’s contrarian bets may position it to capitalize if crypto markets rebound, raising the question: is this a bold gamble, or a long game in the market?

The PAC, named the Digital Freedom Fund, openly aligns with Republicans. Its mission is to defeat Democrats and bolster Republican efforts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The Winklevoss twins contributed 188.45 BTC, roughly $21.5 million, to launch the fund. Tyler Winklevoss said the donation will support candidates who champion “President Trump’s crypto agenda” in primaries and midterm races. The brothers warned that a Democratic takeover of the House or Senate could threaten Trump’s initiatives. Tyler suggested that Democrats, based on past actions, might resort to tactics he described as “bad-faith,” including impeachments and lawsuits. Their policy priorities focus on advocating for a light-touch, regulation-lite “skinny” crypto bill, blocking the creation of a US central bank digital currency, and ensuring protections for developers to build open-source tools without liability risks safely. The Winklevosses also emphasized the need for a “Bitcoin and Crypto Bill of Rights” to safeguard fundamental principles such as self-custody, peer-to-peer transfers, and clear ownership rights. For them, these measures are more than policy—they represent the foundation of what they call an “American Golden Age.” Winklevoss twins break from bipartisan crypto lobbying The decision sets them apart from much of the crypto industry. Others, like Fairshake, which raised over $300 million in 2024, have tried to remain bipartisan, backing Republicans and pro-crypto Democrats. The Winklevoss twins, however, have taken a different route. They have explicitly tied their new PAC to Trump’s reelection campaign and Republican victories, convinced that a GOP-led Congress is the only path to achieving their goals. Their hardline approach signals a shift in crypto politics. While many executives still frame their lobbying as “agnostic,” the influence of major players increasingly mirrors the tightening grip of Trump-era politics, as he nears the close of his second—and possibly final—term. Even figures like Mr. Fox, once a critic of Bitcoin, now embrace it as part of his economic vision. Cameron and Tyler were among the first industry leaders to throw their support behind Trump for 2024, months before others followed. That early loyalty is now being rewarded with political clout and financial backing. Winklevoss brothers turn Bitcoin into political muscle The $21 million Bitcoin gift is among the biggest individual crypto contributions in the history of digital-currency contributions to political causes. It reflects how much the industry is now invested in shaping Washington’s course. Leaders in crypto had long been people who operate at the fringes of politics, quietly lobbying and donating when the time called for it. The move amounts to a new level of ambition and an acknowledgment that digital wealth can be used as political capital. At the same time, the plan comes with major risks. By so blatantly allying themselves with Republicans and President Trump, the Winklevoss brothers are helping to make cryptocurrency a partisan issue. That is a dangerous path for many in the industry. But, though the Republicans have adopted a pro-Bitcoin stance, some democrats are friendly to innovation and blockchain-based initiatives. Alienating them might box in the industry if political power changes. The Digital Freedom Fund is poised to receive its first real exam in the 2026 midterms. If it can help the party win Republican victories, it could help build momentum for moves to loosen regulations, ban a U.S. international digital currency, and protect developers and investors. If it fails, it may reveal deep divisions among the crypto community, diminishing the industry’s power in Washington.

For years, it traded for virtually nothing—fractions of a cent—before the market suddenly turned its attention to the coin. The real turning point came in early 2021, when Dogecoin surged from around $0.02 to nearly $0.74 in just a few months. That explosive rally delivered over 3,600% gains , fueled by retail enthusiasm, community power, and mainstream cultural momentum. What DOGE taught us: Timing and narrative drive exponential gains Dogecoin’s breakout proved that timing is everything in crypto. Infrastructure mattered less than narrative, and those who entered early saw their positions multiply dramatically. DOGE’s rise underscored how branding, community, and sentiment can ignite growth faster than traditional fundamentals. It set the stage for meme-driven assets to dominate headlines and capture capital flows during peak speculative cycles. Who is poised for the next narrative surge As Ethereum and Bitcoin consolidate at higher ranges, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a new contender with parallels to DOGE’s early trajectory. Currently in presale, the project is building momentum before broader awareness and tier-1 exchange listings arrive. What makes it distinct is its politically infused branding , giving it cultural weight beyond the crypto world. Each presale round has sold out quickly, showing strong demand from investors who see this as a second chance at catching an early-stage moonshot. Breaking through DOGE’s ceiling Some investors are going even further, openly betting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could surpass Dogecoin’s historic records. Their argument rests on scale and timing: DOGE exploded during a period when meme coins were new, but MAGACOIN enters a market already conditioned to chase culturally branded assets. If DOGE could reach a market cap in the tens of billions without a clear utility, many argue a politically infused token with global recognition has the potential to push even higher . The presale’s rapid pace has only reinforced this view, with traders framing MAGACOIN FINANCE as not just the next DOGE – but the project that might finally outdo it. Market rotation: Where capital flows next Crypto cycles often follow a familiar pattern: Bitcoin rallies, Ethereum stabilizes, and liquidity seeks out new stories with high-upside potential. This rotation is where meme-driven and culturally branded projects thrive. With the market primed for a new speculative wave, capital is already starting to circle around tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that combine hype with strong community traction. Conclusion: A new altcoin chapter inspired by DOGE’s legacy Dogecoin’s rise from near-worthless meme to household name showed the power of timing and culture in crypto markets. Today, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself with similar ingredients – strong branding, community backing, and explosive presale momentum .

50418169,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79447,1755743621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Record Performance Overshadows Ethereum After Recent Price Crash,https://timestabloid.com/magacoin-finances-record-performance-overshadows-ethereum/,"Ethereum’s sharp pullback last week has reignited debate about whether the second-largest cryptocurrency has already reached the limits of its near-term growth. After climbing toward the mid-$4,700 range earlier in August, ETH tumbled back below $4,300 in a matter of hours, erasing billions in market value. This rapid downturn came despite steady ETF inflows and long-term forecasts placing Ethereum between $6,000 and $8,000 over the next cycle. While committed holders point to resilience, shorter-term traders are questioning whether the same outsized gains that once defined ETH’s rallies are still achievable in such a mature market. This uncertainty is pushing capital further down the risk curve, toward early-stage projects where exponential upside remains possible. Analysts note that the familiar rotation cycle appears to be repeating: Bitcoin rallies first, Ethereum follows with strong but measured gains, and then liquidity begins flowing into smaller-cap tokens with higher risk but greater potential rewards. With Ethereum now facing heavy resistance near its recent highs, attention is shifting to projects that can capture the narrative of the next wave. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most discussed names. Still in presale, the project is benefiting from its timing – offering investors an entry point before listings – and from its unique positioning at the crossroads of crypto and politics. Analysts argue that politically-branded tokens carry additional momentum in an election cycle, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has leveraged that backdrop to build rapid community traction. Unlike Ethereum, which is battling overhead resistance, this project is being positioned by early supporters as a ground-floor opportunity with far greater headroom for growth. Ethereum’s limitations become clear Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts, but size is becoming a double-edged sword. Pushing ETH from its current levels to $6,000 represents a return of under 50%, far below the outsized gains traders saw in earlier cycles. Even with network upgrades and institutional adoption, Ethereum’s trajectory reflects a maturing asset, strong, but no longer explosive. This is why investors often begin to rotate into alternative tokens once Ethereum stalls. Smaller projects provide the volatility and growth potential that established coins can’t replicate, particularly as presales and early listings draw huge capital. Amid this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has carved out a unique position by combining presale momentum with political branding that resonates far beyond traditional crypto audiences. Unlike many presales that fade after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly developed an active and expanding community, with each round selling out faster than the last. Its roadmap emphasizes features designed to reward holders long-term, creating a stronger foundation than typical launches. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s narrative is aligning perfectly with the broader market cycle. As traders look for the next 10,000% play while mainstream attention grows, projects with clear branding, rapid adoption, and utility-based mechanics stand out. In this environment, MAGACOIN is increasingly seen as a potential outperformer – mirroring the early excitement of breakout tokens in previous cycles but with added cultural relevance that gives it wider reach. Market outlook favors rotation If Ethereum continues to consolidate, capital is likely to keep moving into smaller-cap projects with aggressive growth potential. The same pattern played out in 2017 and 2021, when altcoins delivered historic runs after the majors slowed. With MAGACOIN FINANCE building both hype and community infrastructure, it could be one of the primary beneficiaries of this rotation. Institutional money may keep flowing into Ethereum, but retail investors searching for transformative gains are now scanning for the next breakout. That divergence of strategies is what often fuels dramatic surges in promising altcoins. Conclusion: The early-stage edge Ethereum will likely remain a pillar of the crypto ecosystem, but its growth ceiling is becoming clearer. For investors seeking exponential upside, the conversation has shifted toward newer names with political resonance and strong community energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE embodies those qualities, and its rapid momentum suggests it could deliver the kind of breakout that defined past market cycles. With analysts eyeing a potential 10,000% upside before late-stage euphoria sets in, the project is capturing attention as a serious alternative to large-cap consolidation plays.

Our goal is to support President Trump and his Administration’s efforts to continue to usher in America’s Golden Age.” Winklevoss Twins Back Republican Causes The Winklevosses have been long-time vocal members of the Republican Party, backing U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The duo donated $5 million to crypto-focused super PAC Fairshake and $2 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign. Most recently, Politico reported that the twins pressed Trump to reject Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman nominee Brian Quintenz despite Tyler praising his nomination earlier this year. “Congratulations Brian,” Tyler said in a February X post. “Well deserved. Great choice for crypto and for America.” The Winklevoss brothers’ $21 million Bitcoin donation marks their latest effort to influence U.S. crypto policy, reinforcing their support for Trump’s agenda and signaling continued engagement in shaping the political landscape around digital assets.

Plenty of projects appear promising, but only a select few combine technology, user activity, and strong positioning to stand out. As the next market rally takes shape, those spotting opportunities early could capture some of the biggest gains. This year, four projects are commanding serious attention. BlockDAG is preparing for one of the most anticipated launches of 2025 after a record-breaking presale. Binance Coin is hovering near its all-time high with momentum building from institutional backing. Uniswap is rolling out trading upgrades to sharpen its lead in the DeFi space. Hyperliquid is setting new benchmarks in on-chain trading with record-breaking volumes. Together, they show how different strategies, early adoption or established dominance, can play out in today’s crypto market. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Beast Nears $600M Target! BlockDAG is introducing a Layer-1 framework built on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) merged with Proof-of-Work (PoW), plus full EVM compatibility. This design delivers high-speed transactions while maintaining the security of PoW and allows developers to run Ethereum-style smart contracts. Its presale has already generated over $378 million, selling 25 billion BDAG coins across 29 batches, aiming for a $600 million cap. Early Batch 1 buyers have seen 2,660% returns compared to the Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Even current participants could see an 81% uplift if the launch price hits $0.05. With some analysts suggesting a possible move toward $1, the buzz continues to grow. The project’s community and ecosystem are already well-established. Over 2.5 million users are actively mining daily through the X1 Mobile Miner App. A demo trading tool is live to help users prepare before the official rollout. More than 4,500 developers are contributing across 300+ decentralized apps, and 19,000+ mining rigs have been sold. The project already counts 200,000 holders and is targeting listings on 20 exchanges, with Coinbase and Gemini seen as key goals. For anyone eyeing early-stage momentum with tangible progress, BlockDAG stands out as one of the best cryptos for the future in 2025. 2. Binance Coin: Nearing ATH With Strong Liquidity Binance Coin (BNB) currently trades around $850.77, moving between $827.09 and $868.18. In mid-August, it set fresh highs of $864–$870, underpinned by strong trading activity. The coin also received a boost from Abu Dhabi’s MGX, which injected $2 billion, while ETF speculation is adding fuel to the rally. Over the past month, BNB is up 18% and has climbed 54% over the year, ranking among the strongest large-cap performers in 2025. Its strength comes from being central to the Binance ecosystem, powering fee payments and acting as the platform’s base currency. Even though some trading volumes have shown slight dips, its liquidity depth and extensive user activity keep BNB in high demand. Analysts now point to a potential $1,000 milestone if altcoin enthusiasm holds steady. With utility, scale, and consistent demand on its side, Binance Coin continues to be viewed as one of the best cryptos for the future, especially for those who value stability combined with upside potential. 3. Uniswap: UNI Aims for $20 Breakout Uniswap (UNI) is priced at about $11.03 after slipping 8–9% over two trading days. Despite the short-term dip, the coin’s broader 2025 trend remains positive, with $8–$9 acting as reliable support. Analysts suggest that if UNI breaks $14.50, the next rally could take it toward $19–$20 in the short term, and even as high as $27–$30 with sustained momentum. That leaves its current range attractive for those looking for a rebound play. The platform’s biggest upgrade this year, Flashblocks pre-confirmation on Unichain, has slashed swap times to around 200 milliseconds. This makes trading nearly as fast as centralized exchanges, an important edge for DeFi adoption. Combined with Uniswap’s reputation as a primary hub for token launches and ICO entries, this puts UNI in a strong position. For traders focused on liquidity, speed, and influence in the decentralized market, Uniswap still earns its place as one of the best crypto for the future. 4. Hyperliquid: Whale Activity Fuels Growth Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is trading near $48.57, just under its July peak of $49.75. Recently, the platform smashed records with $29 billion in daily trading volume and $7.7 million in fees earned in a single session. This wave of activity was supported by inflows such as Galaxy Digital’s $125 million USDC allocation for hedging strategies and another wallet’s purchase of 466,000 HYPE plus 2.16 million Fartcoin within hours. The result has pushed total value locked to roughly $610 million. The network is built on its own Layer-1 with HyperBFT consensus and HyperEVM, enabling sub-second finality and high-performance on-chain order books. This setup brings the efficiency of centralized trading while staying decentralized. With technical signals suggesting a potential move toward $55 and steady whale accumulation, Hyperliquid is showing both staying power and growth prospects. For those drawn to high-speed DeFi platforms, HYPE remains one of the best cryptos for the future. The Bottom Line These four projects highlight different paths to growth. BlockDAG is still in presale, yet already shows huge traction across users, developers, and planned exchange listings. Binance Coin is nearing highs backed by institutional demand. Uniswap is strengthening its role in DeFi with faster swaps. Hyperliquid is scaling decentralized trading to record-breaking levels. Spotting the best crypto for the future often means diversifying between early-stage projects with explosive upside and established players offering steady growth. In 2025, blending picks like BlockDAG, BNB, Uniswap, and Hyperliquid could capture both short-term opportunities and longer-term resilience in the crypto space.

50419091,561500,1755745243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50419091.jpeg,Will Bitcoin Beat Every Asset Class? Bitwise Says Institutions Are Taking Notice,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-beat-every-asset-class-bitwise-institutions/,"Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios is continuing to evolve, with new research from Bitwise Asset Management suggesting the asset could become the strongest-performing major investment class in the years ahead. According to a preview of the firm’s forthcoming Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), Bitwise expects Bitcoin to deliver an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% over the next 10 years while experiencing gradually declining volatility . The report, authored by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, frames Bitcoin not as an opportunistic play but as a maturing asset that is increasingly being considered a core portfolio component. Hougan noted that the launch and adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked a turning point, prompting large investment platforms and allocators to begin requesting long-term models for Bitcoin alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Hougan explained that long-term capital market assumptions serve as the foundation for how major financial institutions design portfolios. Each year, firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock release detailed outlooks that guide asset allocation strategies . For the first time in 2025, professional investors have begun requesting that Bitcoin be included in these frameworks, with Bitwise reporting 12 such inquiries this year compared to none in previous years. “The fact that they’re now asking for long-term capital market assumptions means that they’ve shifted their view: It’s no longer a one-off for the fringes of the portfolio; it’s starting to be considered for the core,” Hougan said in the memo. He attributed this change to greater accessibility through regulated ETFs and approval by large account platforms managing trillions in client assets. Bitwise also emphasized that Bitcoin’s path toward institutional recognition has been gradual, requiring both regulatory clarity and infrastructure improvements . The launch of spot ETFs in January 2024 created a new on-ramp for traditional allocators, and subsequent approvals across national platforms have since accelerated the process. Hougan described the transition as occurring “brick by brick,” as Bitcoin gains a foothold in professional investment strategies. Outlook for the Next Decade Looking ahead, Bitwise forecasts that BTC will not only outperform but stand apart from traditional assets in terms of expected returns. The firm projects a 28.3% CAGR over the next decade, significantly higher than the long-term expectations placed on equities, bonds, and private credit by leading Wall Street institutions. At the same time, while volatility is expected to remain elevated relative to other asset classes, Bitwise anticipates a steady decline as market depth expands and liquidity continues to improve. The implications of such a forecast extend beyond performance projections. A consistent inclusion of BTC in LTCMAs could formalize its role in balanced portfolios, shaping how pensions, endowments, and wealth managers approach diversification. Hougan cautioned that while risks remain, the framework is designed to give professional allocators a basis for strategic decision-making rather than a speculative outlook.

Multiple projects are seeing strong attention. Some are rising because of active communities, others because of new use cases or exciting presale results. Right now, four names are leading the discussion: Cold Wallet (CWT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Cold Wallet is pushing forward with a clear presale plan and real-world features, while DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE keep pulling in huge numbers through trading activity and loyal followings. From meme-driven appeal to secure wallet tech, each project brings a unique angle. For anyone deciding which crypto to buy now, this mix offers different paths to possible growth and strong engagement worth tracking. 1. Cold Wallet: Presale Power with Real Features Cold Wallet is charging ahead in its presale, already at Stage 17 out of 150. The project has raised $6.32 million and sold more than 749.33 million CWT, showing rising demand. Unlike many presales that stay stuck in planning, Cold Wallet already has a live app on Android and iOS. It is fully functional, security-checked by Hacken, and currently under CertiK review. This allows people to try the product before the coin even lists. At the presale price of $0.00998, the gap to the confirmed launch price of $0.3517 leaves a huge upside. That means a possible 37× return, or about 3,600%, for those who get in now. Stage 1 buyers at $0.007 could be looking at gains as high as 4,900% if the numbers hold. Utility is built into the design. Holders get CWT cashback on gas fees, swaps, and ramps, without any need for staking or lockups. On top of that, Cold Wallet bought Plus Wallet for $270 million, instantly gaining access to two million active users. Referral rewards make it even sweeter, with USDT payouts and future CWT rewards offered. The mix of a working app, a fast-growing user base, and strong presale results makes Cold Wallet one of the standout picks for August. With both entry potential and real-world usage, it is high on the list of answers to which crypto to buy now. 2. Dogecoin: Meme Legend Still in Play Dogecoin remains one of the most well-known meme coins in circulation. Right now, DOGE trades at about $0.199, with a market cap of $28.6 billion and daily trading over $1.2 billion. It has ticked up around 3% in the past 24 hours. Its charm is not only in memes. DOGE is widely used for tipping, online shopping, and payments, which keeps it moving across markets daily. Recent tweaks to the network have cut fees and improved speed. DOGE may not have the hype of a new presale, but it offers deep liquidity and a huge community. Those two factors have powered massive runs in the past. With meme coins still active this season, DOGE holds its spot as a top choice for those who like volatility and fast trades. For those debating which crypto to buy now, DOGE’s liquidity and staying power give it ongoing relevance. 3. Shiba Inu: Expanding the Ecosystem Shiba Inu trades close to $0.00002185, holding a market cap of about $12.9 billion and daily volumes near $6.34 million. SHIB is up about 4% in the past day, pushed by strong trading and progress in its ecosystem. The project is moving beyond meme status thanks to Shibarium, a Layer-2 network that reduces costs and speeds up activity. This upgrade also makes space for more decentralized apps to build on it. Another feature boosting SHIB is its burn program, which steadily cuts supply. Fewer coins in circulation over time can help support price stability. Combined with DeFi activity and community-driven projects, SHIB is showing it can do more than ride on hype. While its chart still reacts strongly to sentiment, Shiba Inu’s growth plans and supply control give it appeal. For those asking which crypto to buy now, SHIB is worth watching because it blends meme strength with actual ecosystem use. 4. Pepe: Volume Keeps It Hot Pepe is currently trading near $0.000012, with a market cap of $5.1 billion and daily trade volume at around $1.5 billion. In just one day, it jumped 5–8%, powered by steady demand and meme coin excitement. Its large liquidity and steady trading base keep it competing in a crowded market. Analysts are split on what’s next. Some think PEPE could dip toward $0.0000096, while others expect a possible push higher if social buzz picks up again. For short-term traders, this makes it a prime pick because of constant price swings. Its mix of strong branding, quick moves, and high liquidity keeps it visible. For those wondering which crypto to buy now, PEPE still pulls heavy attention and remains on the shortlist. Final Takeaway Cold Wallet, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe each bring different strengths this August. Cold Wallet combines strong presale results, real cashback utility, and millions of new users from its Plus Wallet purchase. DOGE still benefits from unmatched brand awareness and daily use. SHIB is working to expand with Shibarium and its burn model, giving it both meme power and growth steps. PEPE keeps the action lively with heavy trade volumes and constant price shifts. Each option has its own level of risk, but all are pulling strong attention in August 2025. Watching them closely could help time the next move. For anyone asking which crypto to buy now , these four names deserve a spot on the radar.

The asset continues to hold above $0.35, reflecting steadiness when compared to other major altcoins. On a longer time frame, TRON remains in an upward trend, posting a 4.7% gain in the last two weeks. This performance stands out against a backdrop of volatility across the broader cryptocurrency market. Analysts suggest that part of this resilience may be tied to TRX’s relative strength against Bitcoin (BTC). Market data indicates that while most leading altcoins have shown weakness in their BTC pairs, TRON has demonstrated consistent momentum. This divergence has drawn closer attention from traders and investors seeking assets that maintain performance during corrective phases in the crypto sector. Related Reading: TRON’s Futures Map Says “Not Overheated” — Could Another Rally Be Coming? TRX Outperforms Altcoins in BTC Pairs According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk, TRON has outpaced other major altcoins in weekly BTC pair performance. The TRX/BTC ratio recorded a 2.66% increase, while ETH/BTC remained nearly flat at 0.02%, XRP/BTC dropped by 2.28%, and SOL/BTC rose by just 0.85%. This distinction suggests stronger market demand for TRX compared to its peers. The analyst explained that TRON’s sustained performance in its BTC pair highlights growing investor interest and resilience at a time when other altcoins continue to struggle. “While most altcoins continue to face uncertainty in their BTC pairs, TRON stands out with consistent positive momentum, suggesting stronger demand and resilience,” Crazzyblockk noted. He further added that monitoring TRX’s strength against Bitcoin could provide signals of broader capital rotation toward TRON, especially if the trend continues over the coming weeks. TRON Network Expands as USDT Adoption Surges Beyond price performance, the TRON network has seen notable growth in its role as a leading blockchain for stablecoin activity. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Arab Chain, highlighted that TRON has consolidated its position as the primary network for USDT transactions. From January to August 2025, the number of cumulative addresses receiving USDT on TRON surged from about 5 million to over 35 million. This expansion shows TRON’s increasing use case for remittances and digital payments, supported by its low-cost and high-speed infrastructure. While the number of addresses may not precisely reflect individual user counts, the steady increase points toward broad adoption across exchanges, wallets, and decentralized applications. Arab Chain observed that the consistent rise indicates genuine demand and organic network growth, with new participants entering the ecosystem rather than merely reusing existing accounts. The trend also points to a maturing ecosystem for TRX as a central hub for stablecoin flows. The analyst notes that the platform’s ability to capture a large share of the stablecoin market reinforces its strategic role in the wider cryptocurrency sector.

DBS said Thursday in a release that it will distribute the instruments through local Singapore exchanges ADDX, DigiFT and HydraX, marking its first time offering tokenized products to accredited and institutional investors outside its own client base. The debut product is a crypto-linked participation note that pays out in cash when digital asset prices rise, while limiting downside exposure. Structured notes traditionally carry minimum investments of $100,000 and are often customized, making them non-fungible. By tokenizing each instrument into $1,000 units, DBS said the securities become fungible and easier to trade, offering greater flexibility for portfolio management. Demand for such instruments has been strong as investors seek to incorporate advanced investment strategies in their digital asset portfolios, the bank said in a release. In the first half of 2025, DBS clients executed over $1 billion of trades involving these instruments, with trade volumes growing almost 60% from Q1 2025 to Q2 2025. The bank sees this as particularly useful for family offices and professional investors, which have grown rapidly in Singapore. The number of single-family offices in the city-state topped 2,000 in 2024, up 43% year on year, it said in a release. The move comes as Singapore deepens its role as a hub for tokenized finance. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been advancing industry pilots through Project Guardian , which explores tokenization of assets across fixed income, FX and funds, while developing cross-border infrastructure like Global Layer One to pool global liquidity. DBS has been one of the most active banks participating in these initiatives, often using permissioned blockchains for pilots before expanding into public chains. While the initial focus is on crypto-linked notes, DBS said it will also tokenize more traditional equity- and credit-linked notes. “Asset tokenization is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure,” said Li Zhen, head of foreign exchange and digital assets at DBS. “Our first tokenized product addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets. With this initiative, a broader segment of investors can now tap our digital asset ecosystem to build exposure to the asset class,” Zhen continued.",Markets|DBS|Singapore|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|ASIA|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-21 03:04:19

ETH is now back above $4,220 but it faces many hurdles near $4,400. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,150 and $4,220 levels. The price is trading below $4,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $4,220 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price extended losses after there was a close below the $4,250 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained bearish momentum and traded below the $4,150 support zone. The bears were able to push the price below the $4,120 support zone . Finally, the price tested the $4,065 zone. A low was formed at $4,065 and the price recently started a recovery wave above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,580 swing high to the $4,065 low. However, the bears are active near the $4,350 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,580 swing high to the $4,065 low. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,355 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,350 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,380 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,460 level. A clear move above the $4,460 resistance might send the price toward the $4,500 resistance. An upside break above the $4,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,550 resistance zone or even $4,565 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,380 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,240 level. The first major support sits near the $4,200 zone. A clear move below the $4,200 support might push the price toward the $4,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Falling Prices Ark Invest, the investment management firm with more than $6 billion in assets under management (AUM), reduced the size of its ARKB (ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF) by 559.85 BTC, or approximately $64.4 million, as reported by the market watcher page Whale Insider yesterday. The crypto community responded with mixed feelings about the sale, with some indicating that it was a regular rebalancing of the fund. In contrast, others outright questioned it or even mocked it. Data collected at print time from CoinGlass also indicates a wave of sell-offs across exchange-traded funds, coinciding with the recent price slump for the leading cryptocurrency, which was preceded by a new all-time high of over $124,000. Source: Coinglass The ARKB stock seems to have reacted negatively to the sale, with the most recent data indicating a 2.79% daily decline, as reported by Google Finance. Source: Google Finance Buying Opportunity The company has not only been selling, though, because today, the ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) scooped up 356,346 shares of Bullish, with an estimated cost of $21.2 million, and 150,908 shares of Robinhood Markets shares, worth about $16.2M. This is a continuation of last week’s purchase of 2.53 million Bullish shares, worth roughly $172 million, following the exchange’s debut on the NYSE, and several buying sessions of Robinhood stock, with the last two being $14 million and $9 million, respectively. This fund’s stock is also plummeting, not reacting to the stocking up, posting a slightly more significant 3.99% daily drop, which is in line with the currently shaky markets, with investors and institutions preparing for the upcoming Fed speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, which will likely set the tone for the markets for the coming weeks and months.

But behind every story of overnight success, there are thousands of traders who burn out, lose money, or simply can’t keep up with the nonstop volatility. The truth is that making money in crypto doesn’t always equate to gazing at charts 24/7 or trying to catch every dip and every rally. Much of the biggest wealth in this space has been accumulated by people who simply got in position early , weathered the noise, and let the market happen for them. That is why passive strategies are increasingly being talked about. Investors are beginning to understand that money is usually accumulated by being patient, not busy all the time. The goal is no longer about catching every micro-move – it’s about identifying high-upside opportunities before the rest of the market notices them . And right now, presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are emerging as prime examples of how to play this strategy without the stress of daily trading. Why trading less can make you more The idea of profiting without trading every day may seem counterintuitive at first. After all, crypto is one of the most volatile markets on earth. But that very volatility is why trying to out-trade algorithms, whales, and professionals is often a losing game. Rather, early investors in ventures such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Solana demonstrated that holding on patiently can be much more lucrative than fiddling around continuously. Take Dogecoin’s early investors. Those who purchased and just held through the volatility made astronomical profits, while the overwhelming majority who attempted to trade each swing generally ended up with less than they began with. Likewise, Solana’s early traders who held from 2020 up to the 2021 high made thousands of percent in profit without having to make dozens of trades. The lesson is clear: sometimes doing less actually delivers more. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the presale advantage This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the spotlight. The project is currently in presale and has already gained a reputation for being one of the most discussed opportunities in the market. Analysts point to its potential 55x upside , fueled by strong branding, political relevance, and fast-moving community momentum. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE especially compelling is how it offers investors the chance to position themselves early – before broader awareness, exchange listings, and mainstream adoption drive prices higher. Presale participants are even securing 50% bonus allocations , rewarding those who recognize the value of getting in before the crowd. This dynamic mirrors the early days of other breakout tokens that rewarded patience over constant trading. Why presales work for passive strategies Crypto cycles tend to follow a well-known rhythm: Bitcoin rallies, Ethereum consolidates, and eventually liquidity flows into newer projects with higher upside potential. The investors who win big are usually those who place their bets during the quiet stages, long before social media hype takes over. Presales are one of the few places where this advantage is still possible. By buying into a presale, investors are essentially locking in early exposure without needing to constantly monitor charts. The focus shifts from trading every fluctuation to simply holding and waiting for the broader market to catch up. For projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which combine strong community energy with cultural branding, the stage is set for that next big surge. Building wealth the smarter way It’s great to see that you don’t have to ignore the market entirely with this strategy. The key is to invest wisely, be cautious of the risk, and understand that crypto wealth is rarely built overnight. Successful investors are those who think long-term and enter at the right moments and are more importantly not burned out with day-to-day trading. MAGACOIN FINANCE is an ideal candidate for this strategy to a T. Its presale is already creating hype for how quickly it’s selling out each round, demonstrating that demand is naturally building up. The branding gives it longevity beyond being just another speculative meme coin, and its trajectory is taking the same paths we’ve witnessed from early-cycle plays which continued to drive talk in later cycles. Conclusion: wealth without the stress of daily trades For those who are wondering how to make money from crypto without having to trade on a daily basis, the response grows clearer day by day: position early, hold wisely, and let the natural cycles of the market do the work for you. The desperate search for short-term gain usually amounts to nothing, but long-term wagers still reward. With returns on investment projected to be 55x and pre-sale buyers rewarded with enormous bonuses, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the way to making money in this market the smart way – without the headache of trying to out-trade the masses.

This optimism comes on the heels of significant regulatory developments, most notably the recent introduction of the GENIUS Act, which aligns state and federal frameworks for stablecoin regulation. ‘Stablecoin Gold Rush’ US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence in the role of stablecoins, suggesting they could significantly boost the market for US Treasuries. According to a report from the Financial Times, Bessent has indicated that the government may increase the sale of short-term debt to meet the anticipated demand for these cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Expert Touts Chainlink Advantage Over XRP In Institutional Adoption Race Goldman Sachs views this moment as the dawn of a “stablecoin gold rush.” In a recent research paper authored by Will Nance and his team, the bank noted that the global market for stablecoins currently stands at approximately $271 billion. They anticipate significant growth, particularly for Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, which they believe will gain market share both on and off the Binance platform. The report estimates that USDC could see an impressive $77 billion increase, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% from 2024 to 2027. The Potential Impact Of Dollar-Pegged Cryptocurrencies The potential market for stablecoins is vast, with Goldman Sachs highlighting that Visa estimates the addressable market for payments at around $240 trillion in annual payment volume. Consumer payments alone account for about $40 trillion, while business-to-business (B2B) payments and person-to-person (P2P) transactions make up the remainder. The unique structure of stablecoins—requiring them to be backed one-to-one with US dollars or government bonds—means that each stablecoin issued directly increases demand for the bonds that back them. Some market analysts believe this approach will have a profound impact on the bond market, particularly for short-dated bonds, which often yield low interest rates. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Takes Major Step With Community Governance Model — Details A research paper from the Bank for International Settlements also supports Goldman Sach’s view, suggesting that significant inflows into the stablecoin market could lower three-month Treasury yields by 2 to 2.5 basis points within a short time frame. However, the bank’s paper also notes that the effects of stablecoin outflows are disproportionately greater, causing yields to rise by two to three times as much. Amid significant regulatory progress from the Trump administration, including the passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC bill, there have been increased inflows in the broader crypto market. Significant capital has entered Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and there is a new trend of adopting cryptocurrencies as treasury reserves. These factors have led to a new all-time high in total crypto market capitalization of $4.17 trillion. As of this writing, the figure has dropped to $3.81 trillion, as the market’s largest cryptocurrencies have led the correction witnessed since last week.

The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $3.00 zone. XRP Price Recovery Faces Hurdles XRP price remained in a bearish zone after a close below the $3.050 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price extended losses and traded below the $3.00 support zone. The price even declined below $2.90. Finally, it tested the $2.820 support zone. A low was formed at $2.820 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a move above the $2.90 level. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.095 swing high to the $2.820 low. However, the bears are active below the $3.00 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.095 swing high to the $2.820 low. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.9650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.950 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.9650 level. A clear move above the $2.9650 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.9650 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.90 level. The next major support is near the $2.850 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.850 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.820 support. The next major support sits near the $2.780 zone, below which there could be a sustained drop. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.90 and $2.850. Major Resistance Levels – $2.9650 and $3.00.",XRP|Ripple|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-08-21 04:08:18

The forecast drew attention because Armstrong rarely issues public price targets, despite leading one of the industry’s most influential exchanges. From Dorsey To Wood, Big Names Push Bold Bitcoin Forecasts His call aligns with several other well-known advocates . Former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey has also said Bitcoin could climb to $1m by 2030 and continue rising from there. I think we'll see $1M per bitcoin by 2030. Regulatory clarity is finally emerging, the US government is keeping a BTC reserve, there's a growing interest for crypto ETFs, among many other factors. (Not financial advice of course, it's impossible to guarantee) pic.twitter.com/w5EfcYFvVp — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) August 20, 2025 ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood has gone further, projecting a possible $1.5m price in her firm’s “bull case” scenario. Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy has argued the milestone could be reached when Wall Street allocates 10% of its reserves to Bitcoin. Author Robert Kiyosaki, known for Rich Dad Poor Dad , has likewise cited inflation and debt concerns as drivers of a seven-figure valuation. Regulatory Clarity In US Seen As Major Milestone For Crypto Coinbase CEO explained that several developments are strengthening Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. He pointed to regulatory clarity emerging in the US, including legislation on stablecoins and a pending market structure bill in the Senate. “Fingers crossed, something could happen by the end of this year. That would be a huge milestone,” he said. He also noted that the US government now holds a strategic Bitcoin reserve , a move he once considered unthinkable. According to him, the major risks that once clouded Bitcoin’s future are receding. Concerns about governments banning the asset have eased, while the Bitcoin protocol has withstood more than a decade of scrutiny. Armstrong acknowledged the need for upgrades to protect against advances in quantum computing but said the developer community is already exploring proposals. Large Funds Hold 1% Bitcoin Allocations, With Room To Grow At the same time, institutional demand is building. Armstrong said many large funds currently hold about 1% of their portfolios in Bitcoin. He argued that once clear rules are in place, capital inflows will accelerate. Exchange-traded funds have already driven a wave of adoption, attracting significant institutional money into the asset class. Armstrong expects that trend to continue as regulatory milestones are achieved and sovereign interest grows. Bitcoin’s potential to reach $1m has long been a lightning rod in financial debates. The cryptocurrency has repeatedly defied skeptics, setting fresh all-time highs before sharp corrections. For believers such as Armstrong, the case for seven-figure valuations rests on the interplay of limited supply, institutional adoption and macroeconomic uncertainty. Supporters argue that Bitcoin could emerge as a global reserve asset, similar to digital gold, if mainstream financial institutions and governments continue to build exposure. For now, Bitcoin remains well below that target. But with institutional money waiting on the sidelines and regulatory clarity edging closer, the idea of a million-dollar Bitcoin no longer sits on the fringes of speculation.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/this-unearthed-ripple-document-causes-buzz-among-xrp-army-heres-why/,"A post by crypto proponent Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) recently circulated with the claim that the United States had patented XRP in 2013, declaring it a payment method for financial services. Her tweet captions an official-looking certificate from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. At first glance, the document’s seal and bold heading might give the impression of a government patent. However, the claim does not withstand scrutiny. The certificate in question is authentic, but it does not represent a patent, nor does it indicate government ownership of XRP. Instead, it records a trademark registration made by Ripple in the early days , when it operated under the name OpenCoin. This filing is historically significant, but its meaning is different from what has been suggested online. WOW! A DOCUMENT HAS SURFACED: THE U.S. HAS PATENTED #XRP & DECLARED IT AS A PAYMENT METHOD FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES! THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED IN 2013! XRP IS A DONE DEAL! https://t.co/SEFWCHOFj8 pic.twitter.com/OFpBl4P1Kc — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) August 20, 2025 What the Filing Shows The certificate is a service mark registration issued on December 31, 2013. It was filed in May of that year by OpenCoin, Inc., based in San Francisco. The description reads, “providing secure payment options to members of an online community via a global computer network through the use of traditional currency and virtual currency.” This wording demonstrates that from the very beginning, Ripple positioned XRP as a digital asset designed to facilitate secure transactions. By filing for trademark protection, Ripple established exclusive rights to the XRP name in connection with financial services, ensuring brand recognition and legal safeguards as it developed its technology. Why the 2013 Filing Still Matters The registration does not grant government ownership, technical protection, or policy endorsement. It does, however, show how Ripple articulated XRP’s purpose at the outset. That scope remains consistent with XRP’s current positioning for cross-border value transfer and institutional settlement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The language in the filing emphasizes security, internet delivery, and compatibility with both “traditional currency and virtual currency.” By setting these aims in a formal filing more than a decade ago, Ripple documented an early focus on utility in the payment sector . The Distinction Between Patent and Trademark A patent protects a specific invention or process, while a trademark protects words, names, or symbols that identify goods or services. The XRP filing is the latter. It is a legal acknowledgment of Ripple’s right to use the XRP name within its field, not a government endorsement. Ripple has many patents. Some of these prove XRP’s efficiency in cross-border finance , among other advantages. However, this particular document has a different purpose. It does not imply that the U.S. government created or owns XRP, nor does it confirm XRP as an official national payment method.

This cheap crypto asset is generating significant presale momentum. Solana delivered astonishing returns after a quiet 2020. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now positioned for a similar trajectory. Its presale has advanced rapidly through six phases. Investor participation is exceptionally strong. Consequently, analysts are increasingly optimistic about its potential. This sentiment mirrors early confidence in Solana before its surge. Solana’s meteoric ascent Solana traded below $1 in late 2020. Few investors recognized its capabilities then. Its innovative proof-of-history mechanism gained traction later. Consequently, SOL experienced a phenomenal price explosion throughout 2021. Prices soared dramatically from under $2 to an all-time peak exceeding $259. This represented a staggering return exceeding 12,000%. Solana became a top ten cryptocurrency by market cap. Its journey demonstrates how unknown assets can achieve massive growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now occupies a similar early-stage position. Furthermore, its presale structure offers accessible entry. Mutuum Finance presale progress Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has achieved remarkable success. Phase 6 is actively underway presently. Tokens sell quickly at $0.035 each. This price reflects a substantial 250% increase since Phase 1 began at $0.01. Investors have contributed over $14,700,000 so far. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,450 participants. Phase 6 represents a closing window for this pricing tier. Availability is diminishing rapidly. Subsequently, Phase 7 will introduce a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. The official launch price is firmly set at $0.06. Therefore, current buyers anticipate significant returns exceeding 340% post-launch. Mutuum Finance utility foundation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructing a robust decentralized lending platform. It features a dual-lending model combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer protocols. This structure aims for high capital efficiency. Users gain control over lending and borrowing activities.

While established coins like ADA, DOGE, and MATIC are consolidating, analysts are eyeing innovative projects with strong fundamentals that can outperform during these quieter periods. Among the projects gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol that is uniquely positioned to capture investor interest and deliver strong returns. Capitalizing on dual lending and borrowing features Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a dual-lending approach, allowing users to participate in P2C pools with mainstream assets while also offering P2P loans for higher-risk tokens. In the P2C environment, lenders deposit bluechip cryptocurrencies or stablecoins into pooled liquidity, earning interest that automatically adjusts based on pool utilization. For example, a lender contributing $25,000 worth of BNB into a pool operating at 65% utilization will earn 19% APY, translating to $4,750 annually. This provides a compelling, low-maintenance option for crypto investing, especially during market pullbacks when capital can be allocated strategically. Borrowers in the P2C system also benefit by obtaining liquidity without selling their underlying assets. Consider an investor locking $12,000 in ETH and borrowing $9,000 in DAI at a 75% loan-to-value ratio. This arrangement allows them to meet immediate financial needs or pursue additional crypto investments while maintaining exposure to ETH’s potential upside. With no fixed loan term, borrowers have the flexibility to repay at any time as long as their collateral remains sufficient. For high-risk or less liquid tokens like DOGE or FLOKI, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) facilitates P2P lending. In this model, lenders and borrowers negotiate terms directly, setting interest rates and loan durations tailored to individual risk profiles. A lender providing FLOKI for a short-term loan can set an APR of 30%, securing higher returns while keeping the risk contained within the P2P framework. This ensures that the protocol’s main liquidity pools remain stable while providing diversified earning opportunities. Presale momentum and early investor gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035 per token. The project has successfully raised $14.68 million to date, with 22% of this phase’s supply sold and more than 15,500 holders already onboard. The next phase will increase the price by 15%, bringing the token to $0.04 and creating a limited window for investors to acquire tokens at the current discounted price. Early participants in Phase 1 have already seen substantial unrealized gains. For instance, an investor who swapped $4,000 worth of BTC into MUTM during the initial phase now holds tokens valued at $14,000 at $0.035. With the anticipated listing price of $0.06, this investment will grow to nearly $24,000, demonstrating the significant upside available for those acting early. Trust and security are critical in crypto investing, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has addressed this with a comprehensive CertiK audit. The project achieved a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, reflecting the platform’s strong code security and operational integrity. Additionally, the $50,000 USDT bug bounty program incentivizes white-hat researchers with rewards based on severity, including $2,000 for critical findings, $1,000 for major, $500 for medium, and $200 for low-level vulnerabilities. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway , which awards ten participants $10,000 in MUTM tokens each, further strengthens community engagement and excitement around the project. Looking ahead, the upcoming beta launch will coincide with the token listing, giving users the opportunity to interact with the platform’s full features before it goes live. Layer-2 integration is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs and increase speed, enhancing usability. The introduction of a stablecoin will provide additional utility for both lending and borrowing, while anticipated listings on top exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will broaden visibility, attract more participants, and drive demand.

News Background DOGE has faced pressure this month after reports tied to Qubic’s potential 51% attack spooked retail traders and drove selling. Despite those risks, on-chain data shows whale cohorts accumulated more than 680 million DOGE in August, offsetting retail outflows. Broader market sentiment has been mixed, with Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidating near highs, leaving memecoins trading with outsized volatility. Price Action Summary DOGE advanced 5% in the 24 hours ending Aug. 21, 04:00, recovering from an intraday bottom of $0.21 to close at $0.22. The token hit its session low around 13:00 UTC on Aug. 20 before reversing course in a V-shaped recovery. Trading volume spiked to 9.29 million in the final hour, adding 0.45% in the last stretch and confirming institutional-sized flows. Whales accumulated 680 million DOGE through August, positioning despite ongoing concerns around Qubic’s potential 51% attack. Technical Analysis Key support held at $0.21, tested at mid-session before high-volume reversal. Resistance emerged at $0.22, setting a $0.01 trading range for the session. A breakout was triggered at 04:31 UTC with the 9.29 million volume spike marking the session pivot. Sustained turnover at 6.8 million per minute during the final hour points to larger buyers driving momentum.

50426608,https://invezz.com/?p=2845348,1755755210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,TRX’s MetaMask integration stirs market but this token steals hype after 250% gains,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/21/trxs-metamask-integration-stirs-market-but-this-token-steals-hype-after-250-gains/,"Tron (TRX)’s recent MetaMask integration has grabbed headlines, creating a stir in the crypto community as investors scrutinize its potential impact on network adoption and usage. While flashy announcements like these often dominate media cycles, long-term value in crypto markets lies with projects offering real utility and sustainable growth mechanisms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a prime example, quietly building a platform that combines innovation, security, and early adoption advantages, allowing investors to capture substantial paper gains and position for future growth. Tron (TRX)’s MetaMask integration Tron (TRX) surged 4.2% to ~$0.3495, driven by its native integration with MetaMask, announced August 19, 2025. The integration, making TRON the third non-Ethereum chain supported after Solana and Sei, unlocks access to TRON’s $26 billion TVL and $22 billion daily settlement for MetaMask’s 100 million users. Trading volume jumped 10% to $1.25 billion, with whale accumulation of 500 million TRX ($174M) signaling strong confidence. Technical indicators show TRX breaking $0.34 resistance, with RSI at 60 and support at $0.32. TRON’s dominance in DeFi and USDT transactions further fuels bullish sentiment. Analysts project a $0.40 target if $0.37 holds, but macro pressures like US tariffs pose risks. A drop below $0.32 could test $0.31. Presale momentum and utility driving long-term growth Unlike Tron (TRX)’s announcement-driven hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating measurable results through its presale performance. Early Phase 1 investors who entered at $0.01 are already enjoying 250% paper gains as the token advances into Phase 6 at $0.035. The presale itself has raised over $14.68 million, with 22% of tokens sold and a growing community of more than 15,500 holders. With the next phase set to introduce a 15% price increase, this marks a critical window for investors looking to secure an entry point before costs rise. This creates a unique opportunity to join the project ahead of broader market awareness, contrasting with more speculative or news-driven rallies seen with other crypto coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to offer real utility beyond speculative trading. The platform combines P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) lending, allowing users to earn interest on bluechip and stablecoin deposits while also lending or borrowing across various crypto assets. Deposited assets are converted into mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio, which grow in value with accrued interest and can be staked to earn additional MUTM rewards. This buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures that as platform activity increases, token demand is reinforced, creating sustained growth for users. Layer-2 integration will drastically improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, making the platform more attractive for retail and institutional users. Additionally, the beta launch coinciding with the token listing will give early adopters hands-on experience with the platform, allowing them to see the lending, borrowing, and staking utilities in action. Alongside this, a $1 stablecoin under development will facilitate overcollateralized lending, providing predictable borrowing and hedging opportunities while maintaining exposure to crypto asset growth. Trust and credibility are central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s approach. CertiK’s audit, with a Token Scan score of 95 and Skynet at 78, validates the platform’s security, while a $50,000 bug bounty incentivizes thorough vulnerability reporting. A $100,000 giveaway for ten winners also engages the community and encourages early participation. The four-phase roadmap—spanning presale and marketing, building core technology, beta testnet, and live platform launch—positions MUTM for successful exchange listings on Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, and MEXC, further enhancing liquidity and visibility in the market. Conclusion The contrast between Tron (TRX)’s headline-driven moment and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s structured growth highlights a crucial lesson for investors: long-term returns often come from platforms with clear utility, technical robustness, and strategic rollout plans. Phase 1 participants in MUTM already demonstrate the advantages of early entry, while those joining in Phase 6 will still secure substantial upside ahead of the $0.06 listing. The combination of staking rewards, Layer-2 efficiency, buyback-distribute mechanics, and stablecoin integration creates a sustainable ecosystem where token growth is directly tied to platform adoption. As crypto prices today fluctuate and broader market sentiment questions why crypto is down, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer a clear path for investors seeking more than short-term hype. The presale momentum, Layer-2 advantages, and robust roadmap will help solidify MUTM as a top candidate for long-term growth, attracting both retail and institutional interest. While Tron (TRX)’s MetaMask integration makes waves in news cycles, MUTM is quietly setting the foundation for mass adoption and sustainable value creation, ensuring that early investors reap the rewards of participating in a project with tangible utility and structured growth.

Bitcoin Has Continued Its Recent Drawdown Since setting a new all-time high (ATH) above $124,000 one week ago, Bitcoin has been facing a downtrend. The bearish momentum has only furthered during the past day, with BTC hitting a low under $113,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Coils Up: Triangle Break Could Spark 40% Move, Analyst Says Below is a chart that shows how the coin’s recent performance has looked. From the graph, it’s visible that BTC has seen a bit of recovery after forming a low around $112,400, but at the current price of $113,800, the asset is still notably below the levels from the last few days. As is usually the case, the bearish price action has worsened the sentiment among investors. Fear & Greed Index Is Now Suggesting A Fearful Market The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index determines the investor mentality using the data of five factors: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. It then represents it as a score lying between zero and hundred. When the metric has a value greater than 53, it means the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. On the other hand, it being under 47 implies the presence of fear in the market. A level lying between the two thresholds naturally corresponds to a net neutral mentality. Now, here is how the sentiment in the sector currently looks according to the Fear & Greed Index: As displayed above, the index is sitting at a value of 44, indicating that Bitcoin investors are fearful. This is a shift from how the mood has been like in the market for the past couple of months. The Fear & Greed Index was previously in the greed zone since June, but the latest decline in BTC’s price has meant the investors have finally let go of bullish sentiment. If history is anything to go by, this flip in trader mentality could actually turn out to be a positive sign for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The market often tends to move in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority, with an excess of FUD facilitating bottoms and overhype resulting in tops. This effect was seen in action during the aforementioned June sentiment low, which coincided with BTC’s bottom under $99,000. The turnaround in the asset only required an index value of 42, but generally, a more powerful fear sentiment is needed before a bottom can occur.

50426231,561652,1755756055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50426231.jpeg,Crypto Ponzi Scheme Ruling: EminiFX Founder Ordered To Repay $228 Million,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-eminifx-founder-228-million-ponzi/,"Yesterday, a federal judge in New York ordered Eddy Alexandre, founder of the now-defunct cryptocurrency platform EminiFX, to pay $228 million in restitution for orchestrating a Ponzi scheme that defrauded tens of thousands of investors. EminiFX CEO To Pay $228 Million In Restitution According to a court filing published on August 19, US District Judge Valerie Caproni ruled that Alexandre and EminiFX must repay $228 million in restitution along with $15 million in disgorgement. The ruling stated: Defendants Alexandre and EminiFX are jointly and severally liable to pay restitution in the total amount of $228,576,962. Defendant Alexandre is liable to pay disgorgement in the amount of $15,049,500. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) secured the summary judgment more than three years after Alexandre was first charged. In a separate 2023 criminal case, the former entrepreneur pleaded guilty to commodities fraud. For background, EminiFX was founded in 2021, raising over $262 million in just about eight months. In the same duration, the platform attracted more than 25,000 investors looking for quick returns. The platform claimed it could deliver 5% to 9.99% in weekly returns through a so-called “Robo-Advisor Assisted Account.” This account allegedly relied on automated strategies for trading in crypto and forex markets. Court filings revealed that EminiFX suffered net losses of at least $49 million. The platform also never deployed the trading technology it advertised to investors. Investigators found that Alexandre diverted at least $15 million for personal use, covering credit card bills, luxury cars, and cash withdrawals. At the same time, investor payouts were funded with money from new participants, a classic trait of Ponzi schemes. Judge Caproni’s order finally brings the EminiFX case to a close, requiring Alexandre to pay $228 million in restitution. The order also states that any payments toward restitution will offset his disgorgement obligation. Crypto Scams On A Steady Rise Despite tighter regulations and enhanced security measures, scams and fraud continue to plague the crypto industry. In May 2025, law authorities arrested an individual from Wellington, New Zealand, for association with a $265 million crypto scam. A month earlier, a Brazilian court punished a leader of a crypto Ponzi scheme syndicate by sentencing him to 128 years in prison. The Ponzi scheme promised its investors guaranteed returns of 8% per month. A report earlier this month noted that the crypto industry lost a whopping $3.1 billion to hacks during the first half of 2025. This is an increase of almost 100% compared to losses incurred during the first half of 2024. Meanwhile, US prosecutors in Nevada indicted a Las Vegas business owner in connection with a multimillion-dollar crypto fraud earlier this year. At press time, BTC trades at $114,242, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto scam|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto investment|crypto ponzi scheme|Crypto Scam|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|EminiFX|fraud,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 06:00:55

Here Are the Predictions and Possible Effects on the Market,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-say-on-friday-here-are-the-predictions-and-possible-effects-on-the-market/,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to hold his own against making a clear commitment to cut interest rates in September during his speech at the Jackson Hole meeting on Friday. While markets are strongly pricing in a rate cut, Powell may avoid giving definitive signals, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the process. Research firm LHMeyer suggested Powell could temper expectations to prevent markets from fully locking in on the cut. Powell's speech will come under even greater pressure than usual this year. US President Donald Trump has been criticizing the Fed chair for months, calling him a “stubborn mule” and “unintelligent,” and harshly criticizing his resistance to interest rate cuts. Trump is poised to challenge the Fed's internal balance of power by nominating economist Stephen Miran, a figure aligned with his political affiliation, to fill the vacant seat at the Fed. Miran, who supports Trump's calls for interest rate cuts, also advocates for reforms within the Fed that would empower chairmen to dismiss figures like Powell. Related News: Binance Makes New Airdrop Announcement: Quota Filled Within Minutes - May Reopen TS Lombard Chief Economist Steven Blitz commented, “Miran is not one to be swayed by tradition. He will be Trump's provocateur at the FOMC, and he will not hide it.” Powell's job isn't just made more difficult by Trump's pressure and Miran's potential influence. At the Fed's last meeting, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, considered among his successor candidates, voted against the majority to cut interest rates. On the data front, the picture is mixed. A weak July employment report signaled a slowdown in the labor market, while a rise in the producer price index fueled concerns that Trump's tariffs would push up consumer prices. “The tariffs have created a stagflationary effect and seriously complicated the Fed's job,” said Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. Barclays Chief Economist Marc Giannoni, however, noted that Powell's approach to assessing the unemployment rate will be decisive. Recalling Powell's warnings after the July meeting, Giannoni said, “If Powell reiterates that the unemployment rate could remain low due to supply-side factors like immigration, despite the weakening employment, the probability of a rate cut could be lowered to 50%.” Market expectations for a September interest rate cut have recently declined. Following producer price index data and cautious statements from Fed members, expectations have fallen to 85%. *This is not investment advice.

Developers embraced its high throughput, retail investors chased its rallies, and institutions gradually added exposure. From NFT booms to DeFi integrations, Solana became a household name in crypto markets, validating the idea that early entry is where exponential gains are made. Riding the waves: Solana’s market volatility The path to today’s valuation wasn’t smooth. Solana endured sharp crashes, including a brutal 2022 collapse when it dipped under $10. Yet, every major recovery has been more powerful, with cycles driving it back into the top ranks. In 2024 and 2025, Solana consolidated as one of the leading altcoins, trading in a volatile yet strong range between $150 and $200. Analysts now forecast potential upside toward $250–$300 by early 2026, though much of the parabolic growth may already be priced in. For investors just discovering Solana today, the challenge is timing. While the blockchain remains a strong player, its biggest multiple gains are likely behind it. This is where many begin to look at earlier-stage opportunities with higher upside potential, rather than chasing a name that has already delivered its moonshot. Where early-stage momentum is building This brings us to the growing conversation about MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike Solana, which has matured into a top-tier blockchain, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase. Investors who feel they missed Solana’s 46x run are eyeing MAGACOIN as a second-chance play. The project has already drawn attention for its audited smart contracts, transparency standards, and rapidly sold-out presale rounds , echoing early-stage conditions seen in Solana’s rise. But what sets MAGACOIN apart is its cultural branding and community momentum. In a market where narrative often drives value as much as technology, that combination has sparked comparisons to DOGE’s meme-driven breakout and Solana’s underdog ascent. Why the rotation favors new contenders Crypto market cycles tend to follow a predictable pattern: top assets like Solana and Ethereum rally, consolidate, and then capital rotates into fresh stories. Right now, that rotation is underway. While Solana may continue climbing steadily, the speculative wave is increasingly shifting toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer both strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. Analysts argue that MAGACOIN’s presale positioning, political narrative, and expanding community give it the right mix to become the next breakout name. Forecasts even suggest a possible 58x ROI from presale entry , rivaling Solana’s early trajectory. Conclusion: Solana’s legacy, MAGACOIN’s moment If Solana proved anything, it’s that early conviction pays off. A $1,000 bet in 2020 has turned into a huge reward by 2025 . The lesson is clear: the next major altcoin success may not be today’s established leaders but rather a new name rising in the shadows. With presale demand accelerating and audits building investor trust, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as that next candidate for huge ROI. For those who missed Solana’s early rocket ride, this may be the moment they’ve been waiting for. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

50426517,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=788818,1755756590,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50426517.jpeg,Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer unveiled plans to expand its U.S. crypto mining rig manufacturing operations,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitdeer-seeks-to-ride-trump-tariff/,"Singapore-based crypto mining platform Bitdeer announced plans to expand the manufacturing of its mining rigs in the U.S. amid dropping profits. Jeff LaBerge, Bitdeer’s CFA, said his company hoped to ride on Trump’s tariff headwinds, even if his trade policies hurt the miner’s supply chain. LaBerge praised Trump’s approach, saying it had created more things to consider. He also mentioned that the policies were supportive of energy. LaBerge believes a Bitcoin-friendly tariff resolution will be made to allow companies like Bitdeer to thrive. The Cryptopolitan recently reported that Tether had invested over $400M to acquire a 21.4% (31.8M shares) stake in Bitdeer. The miner hopes to start manufacturing mining rigs in the U.S. this year, eventually helping its self-mining business to grow. Bitdeer pointed out that many of its competitors were similarly considering shifting their production to the U.S. However, it clarified that there were no plans to reposition itself as a treasury firm, even as its BTC holdings continued to increase. LaBerge says Bitdeer is more practical The CFA said his company was not trying to be seen as a BTC treasury, adding that the miner was more practical than idealistic about including BTC on its balance sheet. He added that having Bitcoin on the company’s balance sheet was not part of their identity. The company also acknowledged that BTC mining faced challenges ranging from rising costs to dwindling rewards and growing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. One financial analyst claimed that the miner’s Q2 results demonstrated that the company’s bet on vertical integration was paying off. The analyst believes the company has transformed from solely a BTC miner to a key industry technology provider. The manufacturing and commercialization of their SEALMINER A2 miners provided a cost advantage and a growth engine for the company’s operations. However, the analyst observed that bears were likely to point to the company’s high cash burn from R&D and SG&A, growing debt balance, and risks associated with its expansion plans. The analyst believes the high operating expenses of $42.3 million reported in Q2 represented a significant quarterly cash burn. Bitdeer’s spending needs to be supported by sustained revenue growth, but its profitability is still sensitive to BTC prices and high innovation costs. The analyst also thinks the company should take care of its growing debt load, which has reached $533 million. Bitdeer focuses on rapid growth Matt Kong, Bitdeer’s Chief Business Officer, said on August 18 that his company was now looking forward to rapid growth, especially in its self-mining hashrate. He pointed out that Q2 marked a key point of inflection, and his company was on track to achieve its targets throughout the remainder of the year. Kong added that his company expected sequentially improved financial results in H2 2025. The CBO also claimed that its company aimed to achieve its end-of-October 40EH/s target. He explained the company was likely to exceed its 2025 targets because its foundry’s wafer supply allocation had improved. Kong continued revealing his company’s R&D plans, disclosing that the miner was targeting a 5 J/TH chip efficiency for its SEALMINER A4 project. He pointed out that his company also made significant progress in July with the expansion of its U.S. engineering team and the development of customized silicon software. Kong said these developments firmly positioned his company as a leading supplier of the industry’s most energy-efficient mining rigs. The CBO believes this will help improve the company’s competitiveness and unlock value for its customers and shareholders. Kong concluded by saying his company was keen on energizing more data centers. He pointed out that the miner had energized a self-mining data center capacity of 361 MW, bringing the miner’s electrical capacity to roughly 1.3 GW. Kong expects this will increase to over 1.6 GW by the end of this year. The Clarington, Ohio, site is almost at its full 570 MW capacity.

A significant development is unfolding in Asia, where a groundbreaking South Korean stablecoin bill has just been proposed. This legislative effort aims to bring much-needed clarity and stability to the rapidly growing stablecoin market, impacting both domestic and international players. What Does the South Korean Stablecoin Bill Propose? South Korean lawmaker Kim Hyun-jung of the ruling Democratic Party has put forward the nation’s first comprehensive bill specifically targeting stablecoins. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a foundational step towards formal oversight for value-stabilized digital assets. The core idea is to foster healthy market growth while robustly protecting consumers. Minimum Capital Requirement: Issuers would need to hold at least 5 billion won (approximately $3.6 million) in capital. This significant barrier aims to ensure only serious, well-capitalized entities can operate. Sound Business Plan: Companies must present a clear, viable business strategy to the authorities. Qualified Staff & Facilities: Issuers need to demonstrate they have the necessary human resources and infrastructure to manage stablecoin operations effectively. FSC Approval: Obtaining approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) would become mandatory, bringing stablecoin issuance under strict regulatory scrutiny. Foreign Stablecoin Registration: Even stablecoins issued abroad would be required to register with the FSC before they can be distributed within South Korea. This provision extends the bill’s reach beyond national borders. Why is This Regulation Crucial for Stablecoins? You might wonder, why now? The push for this South Korean stablecoin bill stems from a clear desire to prevent financial instability and safeguard investors. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a consistent value, are vital bridges between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. However, without proper oversight, they can pose risks, as seen in past market events. This proposed legislation reflects a global trend towards regulating digital assets. By setting clear rules, South Korea aims to: Enhance Consumer Protection: Mandating capital and approval processes helps ensure that stablecoin issuers are legitimate and capable of meeting their obligations. Promote Market Integrity: Formal oversight reduces the risk of fraud and market manipulation, building trust among users and institutions. Foster Innovation Responsibly: A regulated environment can encourage innovation by providing a secure framework for businesses to operate within, rather than stifling it. What Impact Will the South Korean Stablecoin Bill Have? The implications of this South Korean stablecoin bill are far-reaching. For existing stablecoin issuers, particularly smaller ones, meeting the 5 billion won capital requirement could be a significant challenge. However, for larger, well-established entities, it could solidify their position by weeding out less compliant competitors. This move could also set a precedent for other nations in Asia and beyond, influencing how they approach digital asset regulation. South Korea is demonstrating a proactive stance, moving beyond simple warnings to implement concrete legislative measures. This kind of robust framework is essential for the long-term viability and mainstream adoption of stablecoins. In conclusion, the proposed South Korean stablecoin bill represents a monumental step towards creating a safer, more transparent, and more stable digital asset ecosystem. It underscores the growing recognition among global policymakers that digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, require careful integration into existing financial frameworks for the benefit of all. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or to a commodity like gold. Q2: Who proposed the new stablecoin bill in South Korea? The bill was proposed by South Korean lawmaker Kim Hyun-jung of the ruling Democratic Party. Q3: What is the minimum capital requirement for stablecoin issuers under this bill? The proposed bill requires stablecoin issuers to hold at least 5 billion won, which is approximately $3.6 million. Q4: Will foreign-issued stablecoins be affected by this South Korean stablecoin bill? Yes, the proposal includes provisions requiring foreign-issued stablecoins to register with the Financial Services Commission before being distributed domestically in South Korea.

Key Takeaways: Windtree Therapeutics’ stock collapsed 77% after Nasdaq moved to delist the biotech for failing to meet the $1 minimum bid price rule. The company had recently launched a BNB treasury strategy, but shares have since dropped over 90% from their July peak. While Windtree faces uncertainty, BNB surged to a new all-time high of $876. The company’s stock (WINT) plunged 77.2% to $0.11, with another 4.7% drop in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission , Windtree disclosed that Nasdaq cited Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires companies to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Windtree Vows to Keep Reporting as Nasdaq Suspension Looms Trading of WINT will be suspended on Thursday. Chief Executive Jed Latkin said the company would continue to meet its reporting obligations despite the delisting. Windtree’s market struggles come only a month after the company rolled out a BNB treasury strategy, aimed at providing investors exposure to Binance’s native token without directly holding it. On July 16, the firm unveiled a $60 million purchase agreement with Build and Build Corp, with the option to expand by an additional $140 million. The announcement briefly lifted its stock by 32.2% before the downtrend began. A week later, Windtree secured a $500 million equity line of credit from an undisclosed investor and a separate $20 million stock-purchase deal with Build and Build Corp to expand its BNB position. However, shares have since collapsed more than 90% from their July 18 peak, erasing those early gains. The company has not disclosed how much BNB it currently holds or whether it plans to continue the strategy after the delisting notice. How is no one on my timeline talking about the fact that Windtree Therapeutics, the first Nasdaq-listed company to hold $BNB directly in its treasury, was just delisted from Nasdaq! It failed to maintain the minimum bid price requirement of $1/share for 30 consecutive business… — Raghav Agarwal (@0xRaghav) August 20, 2025 Other public firms have faced similar setbacks on Nasdaq. Argo Blockchai n, for example, was previously suspended but managed to regain compliance and relist. Windtree’s path back remains uncertain. Meanwhile, BNB itself is thriving. The token surged 5.6% on Wednesday to $876.26, hitting a new all-time high and standing out as one of the few blue-chip altcoins to break past 2021 levels this cycle. XRP and Solana are the only other major tokens to do so, while Ether, Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Cardano remain below their previous peaks. BNC Becomes Largest Corporate Holder of BNB with $160M Purchase Earlier this month, BNB Network Company (BNC) bought 200,000 BNB tokens for $160 million, making it the largest corporate holder of Binance Coin. The Nasdaq-listed firm is repositioning itself as a crypto-first treasury, focusing exclusively on BNB as its primary reserve asset. The acquisition comes amid a surge in corporate adoption of BNB, with companies increasingly using the token as a treasury tool. To drive this shift, BNC revamped its leadership team. David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital, was named CEO, joined by former CalPERS CIO Russell Read and ex-Kraken director Saad Naja. The board also welcomed Hans Thomas and Alexander Monje of 10X Capital. Their strategy mirrors moves by other firms like Nano Labs and Windtree Therapeutics, which have allocated hundreds of millions into BNB holdings to emulate the Bitcoin playbook pioneered by Strategy.

This move sent shockwaves through the community, culminating in a dramatic 93% price crash on Upbit. Understanding such rapid market shifts is crucial for any crypto enthusiast navigating this dynamic space. What Triggered the STRIKE Token Delisting and Crash? Investors watched in disbelief as the STRIKE token experienced a precipitous decline. On South Korea’s Upbit exchange, STRIKE plummeted an astounding 93.09% within a single day, settling at 438 won ($0.31). This massive selloff occurred just before its official delisting, scheduled for 06:00 UTC on August 21. The immediate catalyst for this freefall was the announcement from Upbit and its competitor, Bithumb. Both prominent South Korean exchanges declared their intention to delist the token. Such decisions are rarely made lightly and often stem from significant concerns about the project itself. Why Did Exchanges Initiate the STRIKE Token Delisting? The decision by Upbit and Bithumb to proceed with the STRIKE token delisting was not arbitrary. They cited serious concerns regarding the project’s foundational elements. Specifically, the exchanges raised issues with: Project Disclosures: A lack of transparency or insufficient information provided by the STRIKE project team. Business Model Viability: Doubts about the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of the token’s underlying business model. Overall Sustainability: Concerns about the project’s ability to maintain operations and deliver on its promises in the future. These factors collectively painted a picture of a project that might not meet the stringent standards required for continued listing on major exchanges. For investors, these warnings are critical signals about potential risks in the digital asset space. What Lessons Can We Learn from the STRIKE Token Delisting? The rapid decline of STRIKE token serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in the volatile crypto space. Interestingly, this dramatic crash followed a peculiar market behavior just weeks prior. After the initial delisting notice, STRIKE actually saw its price nearly triple, suggesting speculative trading or a misunderstanding of the delisting’s implications. This scenario highlights several key takeaways for crypto participants: Due Diligence is Paramount: Always thoroughly research any project before investing. Understand its whitepaper, team, technology, and business model. Exchange Announcements Matter: Pay close attention to official statements from exchanges regarding token listings, warnings, or delistings. These often precede significant price movements. Avoid FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): The temporary price surge post-delisting notice was a classic example of speculative bubbles. Chasing such pumps can lead to substantial losses. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate single-asset risks. The STRIKE token delisting is a powerful case study in market dynamics and the importance of informed decision-making for every investor. The recent STRIKE token delisting and subsequent crash on South Korean exchanges underscore the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be alarming, they also provide invaluable lessons for investors. Prioritizing thorough research, staying informed about exchange policies, and practicing disciplined risk management are essential for navigating this dynamic landscape successfully. Always remember that transparency and sustainability are cornerstones of a healthy crypto project. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the STRIKE token to crash so dramatically? The STRIKE token crashed primarily due to its announced delisting from major South Korean exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. These exchanges cited concerns over the project’s disclosures, business model, and overall sustainability. Which exchanges delisted the STRIKE token? Upbit and Bithumb, two prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, announced the delisting of the STRIKE token. When was the STRIKE token officially delisted from Upbit? The official delisting of the STRIKE token from Upbit was set to take effect at 06:00 UTC on August 21. Did the STRIKE token’s price react before the delisting notice? Yes, interestingly, after the initial delisting notice was issued, the STRIKE token’s price nearly tripled last month before its eventual catastrophic crash. This suggests speculative trading. What does a token delisting mean for investors? A token delisting means the cryptocurrency exchange will no longer support trading of that specific token. This often leads to a sharp decline in price as investors rush to sell their holdings before trading ceases, and it can significantly reduce the token’s liquidity and accessibility.

In his commentary, Rietveld urged the XRP community to listen closely to Mallers’ insights, even though Mallers is widely regarded as a Bitcoin maximalist. Rietveld explained that many of Mallers’ arguments regarding Bitcoin could also be applied to XRP, suggesting that by replacing “Bitcoin” with “XRP” in his reasoning, holders of XRP could gain valuable perspectives on the digital asset’s long-term potential. Rietveld emphasized that while Mallers often speaks in favor of Bitcoin, his broader points on financial markets, investment strategies, and the failures of traditional portfolios have implications that go beyond a single digital asset. According to Rietveld, this crossover of reasoning highlights why XRP may stand at a similar point today as Bitcoin did in earlier years. The MOMENT This Happens, XRP GOES NUCLEAR – Jack Mallers #XRP pic.twitter.com/59XXG4E4rx — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 19, 2025 Jack Mallers on the State of Traditional Portfolios Mallers began his analysis by criticizing the conventional 60/40 investment portfolio of stocks and bonds, declaring it to be “dead.” He stressed that such traditional strategies cannot deliver sustainable returns in the current economic climate, particularly as U.S. pensions, endowments, and retirement accounts face mounting losses from bonds and underperforming equities. Mallers cited examples of commercial real estate being marked down significantly and noted that many institutional savings accounts are now severely underwater. He argued that Bitcoin provides an essential alternative, citing both private sector adoption and shifts in government policy. Mallers referenced Harvard University’s decision to purchase over $100 million worth of Bitcoin. He highlighted President Donald Trump’s executive order allowing Bitcoin and gold to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts. He framed these developments as critical steps toward securing financial portfolios in an environment where fiat currency continues to lose value through inflation and monetary debasement. Levi Rietveld’s Application to XRP Rietveld, while acknowledging Mallers’ Bitcoin advocacy, positioned XRP as being in a similar situation to Bitcoin in 2018, when skepticism about its long-term value was widespread. He argued that while institutional attention is currently centered on Bitcoin, XRP is quietly outperforming other cryptocurrencies in terms of relative strength during both market declines and recoveries. Rietveld suggested that XRP could soon become a primary choice for investors, particularly as wealth advisors begin considering its inclusion in retirement and investment portfolios through potential exchange-traded funds. He reinforced the idea that digital assets as a class are gaining legitimacy, noting that Treasury Secretary Besson recently affirmed the government’s intention to support digital assets under high regulatory standards. According to Rietveld, this confirms that the U.S. government is not only prioritizing Bitcoin but also creating a path for broader digital asset adoption, which directly benefits XRP’s market positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Both Mallers and Rietveld agreed on the fundamental point that traditional financial instruments are no longer sufficient to safeguard wealth. Mallers advocated for Bitcoin as the solution, while Rietveld argued that XRP offers a superior option . He pointed out that while fiat currencies continue to be devalued, digital assets present an alternative system that preserves value and resists inflationary pressures. Rietveld concluded his analysis by reiterating that XRP represents a unique opportunity for investors who want to enter before liquidity cycles shift away from Bitcoin toward other digital assets. He maintained that XRP’s performance metrics already demonstrate its strength compared to competitors, reinforcing his view that XRP is the more compelling long-term option.

A prominent Bitcoin whale , identified by the address starting with 0xCa2D, executed a massive trade. This influential entity sold a substantial 400 BTC, valued at approximately $45.5 million at the time, on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. What’s even more intriguing is their immediate rotation of these funds into Ethereum (ETH), now holding 11,744 ETH worth an impressive $50.57 million. Understanding the Bitcoin Whale’s Strategic Shift This significant move, reported by Onchain Lens on X, highlights the dynamic nature of large-scale crypto investments. When a Bitcoin whale makes such a substantial transaction, it often sparks discussion and analysis across the crypto community. These large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ possess enough capital to potentially influence market sentiment and even price action, making their movements a key data point for traders and analysts. The decision to divest from Bitcoin and accumulate Ethereum is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a strategic re-evaluation of market positions by this specific Bitcoin whale . Such shifts can be driven by various factors, from anticipating future price movements to seeking different investment opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem. Why Do Bitcoin Whales Make Such Bold Moves? The motivations behind a Bitcoin whale ‘s decision to swap a significant portion of their holdings from one major cryptocurrency to another are complex. Several reasons could explain this particular rotation from BTC to ETH: Anticipation of Outperformance: The whale might believe Ethereum is poised for stronger growth or a more favorable market cycle compared to Bitcoin in the near future. Diversification Strategy: While both are major cryptocurrencies, they serve different primary purposes. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, while Ethereum powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. Yield Opportunities: Ethereum’s ecosystem offers numerous opportunities for staking, lending, and participating in DeFi protocols, which can generate yield on holdings. This might be more attractive than simply holding Bitcoin. Market Sentiment: A general shift in sentiment favoring altcoins or specific narratives around Ethereum’s technological advancements could also play a role. It is important to remember that while on-chain data provides transparency, the exact rationale of any individual Bitcoin whale remains speculative. However, observing these large transactions offers valuable insights into the broader market’s undercurrents. The Ripple Effect: What Does This Bitcoin Whale Swap Mean for You? While one large trade does not single-handedly dictate the market’s direction, the actions of a prominent Bitcoin whale can certainly create ripples. When such a significant amount of capital moves, it can: Influence Sentiment: Other market participants might interpret the move as a bullish signal for ETH or a bearish one for BTC, potentially leading to similar trades. Impact Liquidity: Large sell orders can temporarily increase selling pressure on the asset being sold (BTC in this case) and buying pressure on the asset being acquired (ETH). Highlight Trends: Consistent patterns of whales shifting assets can signal emerging trends or shifts in institutional and large-investor interest. For the average investor, this event serves as a reminder of the market’s constant evolution and the importance of staying informed. While following a Bitcoin whale ‘s every move is not a guaranteed strategy, understanding these significant transactions contributes to a more comprehensive market perspective. In conclusion, the recent 400 BTC to ETH swap by a major Bitcoin whale on Hyperliquid is a compelling example of strategic asset reallocation in the crypto space. It underscores the ongoing dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum, two pillars of the digital asset economy. As the market continues to mature, observing these large-scale movements remains a crucial aspect of informed participation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Their actions are closely watched by analysts. Why did this specific whale sell Bitcoin for Ethereum? While the exact reasons are private, common motivations for such a swap include anticipating stronger future performance for Ethereum, diversifying a portfolio, seeking yield opportunities within the Ethereum ecosystem, or reacting to broader market sentiment shifts. How does a Bitcoin whale’s activity affect cryptocurrency prices? Large trades by a Bitcoin whale can impact market sentiment, create temporary buying or selling pressure, and influence liquidity. While one trade doesn’t define the market, a series of similar large trades can signal significant shifts in investor interest. Should I follow the trading strategies of crypto whales? While observing whale activity provides valuable insights into market dynamics and large-investor sentiment, it’s crucial not to blindly copy their trades. Whales have different risk tolerances, goals, and capital amounts. Always conduct your own research and make decisions based on your personal financial situation.

After introducing its voice bot, the CBA first confirmed job cuts in July, commenting, “Our investment in technology, including AI, is making it easier and faster for customers to get help, especially in our call centers.” However, the bank has now conceded that axing 45 customer service roles on the grounds of AI automation was an “error” and confirmed it had apologized to affected workers. It insists the jobs are still needed alongside its AI-powered “voice-bot.” The CBA says it didn’t take everything into account in its decision to cut jobs In a statement released Thursday, the Finance Sector Union said it had earlier lodged a complaint against CBA with the workplace relations tribunal for not being open about call volumes. According to the union, call volumes were climbing rather than falling, with CBA staff asked to work overtime and team leaders told to step in, contradicting the bank’s assertion that the voice bot would reduce weekly calls by 2,000. Holding onto the notion that the voice bot would make work easier, the bank was prepared to shed 45 customer service jobs. However, the recent reversal acknowledged that it had not properly considered all business implications. It added that its assessment of which roles were required should have been more rigorous. Moreover, it stated that affected employees can either stay on, transition to other positions within the bank, or choose to leave. It also pledged to examine its internal processes to refine its approach. So far, the union has hailed the bank’s reversal as a major victory. However, it stressed that damage had already been done. FSU National Secretary Julia Angrisano said that CBA attempts to present job cuts as innovation. She described using AI as a cover for eliminating secure jobs as a cynical cost-cutting move that workers are fully aware of. Nevertheless, the union claimed it would gather more accounts of how offshoring, automation, and AI have influenced workloads and job security, with the matter set to go before Fair Work next week. Matt Comyn said they employed 2,000 more staff in the last few months CBA’s lead Matt Comyn has been advocating for more tech infusion in the country’s banking industry. Earlier this month, the bank even partnered with OpenAI to introduce advanced AI tools for customers and employees. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has urged Australia to accelerate its AI adoption and position itself as a global AI leader. He also expressed excitement about the partnership, highlighting the opportunity to put AI in the hands of more Australians. Altman noted that OpenAI highly rated Commbank as one of Australia’s largest institutions serving millions of people and businesses daily. He noted that they were thrilled to work together to put advanced AI into the hands of more Australians. He noted that the union would make AI more useful and impactful for people and businesses across the nation. Even so, Comyn admitted the long-term implications of AI for employment are uncertain, adding that it would take years to uncover the full potential of the technology. Other global banks are confronting similar challenges, with AI chipping away employment prospects. For instance, Singapore’s DBS Holdings is set to cut close to 4,000 contract and temporary staff over the next three years as AI increasingly takes over human functions. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , global banks will slash as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years due to artificial intelligence. So far, CEO Comyn said they’ve added another 2,000 workers in recent months, noting that a large share of those roles were based in India as part of its technology build-out.

Understanding these substantial Ethereum treasury holdings offers crucial insights into the evolving market dynamics and the growing institutional confidence in ETH. Who is Amassing These Significant Ethereum Treasury Holdings? A new report, citing data from StrategicETHReserve, reveals that 69 distinct entities, each holding more than 100 Ethereum (ETH), collectively own an astonishing 4.1 million ETH. This figure represents approximately 3.39% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. This concentration underscores a clear trend of strategic accumulation by major players in the crypto space. Who are these key players? Let’s break down the leaders: BitMine Immersion Technologies: This entity holds roughly 1.5 million ETH, valued at an impressive $6.6 billion. Notably, BitMine strategically shifted its focus from Bitcoin (BTC) mining to prioritize ETH accumulation, signaling a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential. SharpLink Gaming: Following closely, SharpLink Gaming possesses about 740,800 ETH, worth approximately $3.2 billion. The Ether Machine: This holder controls 345,400 ETH. Ethereum Foundation: The foundational organization itself holds 231,600 ETH. These figures highlight a diverse range of organizations recognizing the value of Ethereum. What Do These Ethereum Treasury Holdings Mean for ETH’s Future? The accumulation of such substantial Ethereum treasury holdings by these entities carries significant implications for the broader market. When large amounts of a cryptocurrency are held off exchanges by long-term investors or foundations, it naturally reduces the available circulating supply. This can, in turn, contribute to price stability and potentially foster future appreciation. It’s not just about holding; it’s about strategic positioning within the rapidly expanding digital economy. It is also insightful to compare these private corporate holdings with other major ETH reserves. For instance, U.S. spot ETH ETFs, which are a newer development, collectively hold an even larger share: around 6.7 million ETH. This accounts for approximately 5.5% of the total supply. This comparison emphasizes the dual nature of institutional involvement in Ethereum – through direct corporate balance sheets and via regulated investment vehicles. Both types of Ethereum treasury holdings indicate robust demand. How Do Significant Ethereum Holdings Influence Market Confidence? The growing trend of significant Ethereum treasury holdings by various entities, from technology firms to gaming companies and the Ethereum Foundation itself, clearly signals strong institutional confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. This long-term perspective from major players is crucial. It contributes directly to the network’s stability and ongoing development. It also suggests that these entities are not merely speculating on short-term price movements, but are instead investing in the fundamental utility and future potential of Ethereum as a platform. Moreover, such concentrated holdings can profoundly influence market sentiment. When large, established entities are known for their substantial ETH positions, it often inspires confidence among smaller, retail investors. This, in turn, can attract even further institutional capital, creating a powerful positive feedback loop. Ultimately, this dynamic could drive greater adoption and continued innovation within the entire Ethereum network, solidifying its role in the decentralized world. In summary, the revelation that 69 entities collectively hold over 4.1 million ETH, coupled with the substantial reserves held by U.S. spot ETH ETFs, paints a compelling picture. Institutional and corporate interest in Ethereum is not just growing; it is becoming a foundational pillar of its market structure. These significant Ethereum treasury holdings stand as a testament to the network’s enduring appeal and its promising future as a cornerstone of the decentralized economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are “Ethereum treasury holdings”?

Bitcoin briefly knifed below $113K intraday before bouncing, as traders hedge into Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s high-stakes Jackson Hole address (Aug 21–23) . With dollar strength creeping back and leveraged longs getting rinsed, the question is simple: is this a healthy bull-market pause, or the start of a deeper Bitcoin correction driven by crypto market volatility? Bitcoin dropped below $113,000, source: Bitcoin Liquid Index The Dip explained: Why Bitcoin fell below $113K Profit-taking after recent highs After a powerful summer run toward new highs, fast money trimmed risk ahead of a pivotal macro catalyst (Powell). Futures data show today’s low near $112.8K before stabilizing, classic “sell the rumor” behavior into event risk. $500M+ liquidations across derivatives In the last 24 hours, >$500 million in crypto longs were liquidated as the drawdown accelerated-evidence that over-leveraged positioning amplified the move. (Source: CoinGlass, reported by Unchained.) Traders hedging ahead of Fed news The Jackson Hole symposium is a macro bellwether; Powell’s tone on growth and policy can reset risk appetite across assets, so crypto desks lightened up and added hedges into the event. Powell at Jackson Hole: Why it matters for crypto Market expectations of rate cuts or a dovish pivot Recent Fed coverage highlights growing market hopes for cuts, especially around the theme of Fed rate cuts Bitcoin correlation-but the speech is expected to be the defining macro event of the summer. A more hawkish-than-hoped message could pressure risk assets; a dovish lean could re-ignite momentum. Potential impact on risk assets like Bitcoin A firmer U.S. dollar into the event is a headwind for BTC in the short run; crypto rallies tend to breathe easier when the dollar softens. Today, a major dollar index ticked higher ahead of Powell. Historical Jackson Hole precedents and crypto moves While 1:1 causality is messy, prior Jackson Hole speeches that tilted hawkish have coincided with cross-asset risk-off days; the reverse is also true. Traders respect the event because forward-guidance shifts can ripple through yields, liquidity, and sentiment, making it a key focus for Jackson Hole Powell speech crypto analysis. Is this a pause or the start of a correction? Bull case Rate-cut hopes resurface if Powell acknowledges softer growth risks. Spot Bitcoin ETF complex remains an institutional on-ramp; flows have been choppy in August, but the wrapper is sticky demand over a multi-month horizon, even as traders debate whether this dip marks a temporary pause or signals a broader Bitcoin correction in August 2025. Bear case Macro uncertainty & stronger dollar into Jackson Hole. Over-leveraged longs just got tagged; another wave is possible if $110K fails. Technical levels to watch (spot/futures confluence) $110K: psychological round number + recent intraday wash area. $115K: near today’s bounce zone; reclaiming it flips short-term momentum neutral. $120K: first meaningful resistance; a daily close above suggests the dip was a shakeout. (Levels are for trading context, not advice.) What traders are watching next Powell’s tone, UST yields, and the dollar index (DXY) over the next 24–48 hours for knee-jerk direction. Altcoin performance (ETH, XRP, SOL): high-beta coins typically magnify BTC’s move post-event. October ETF catalysts: The SEC just pushed back decisions on several crypto ETFs-including Solana (Oct 16) and XRP (Oct 19) , clustering catalysts in October that could re-focus flows and volatility. Quick, actionable playbook (not financial advice) Into the speech: Expect wider spreads + wicks. If trading, reduce leverage, size with caution, and pre-define invalidation levels. If dollar spikes on hawkish vibes: BTC can probe $110K; watch for liquidation cascades and funding resets as a potential fade setup, only if momentum stalls. If dollar fades on dovish hints: A swift reclaim of $115K–$120K opens room for a squeeze; monitor ETF flow prints in the following sessions for confirmation. Get seen where it counts.

50428030,561622,1755759603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50428030.jpeg,Crypto Lobbyists Resist Banking Industry’s GENIUS Stablecoin Law Proposal,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-lobbyists-banking-genius-stablecoin-proposal/,"In the wake of the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a new law regulating stablecoins, tensions have emerged between traditional banking associations and cryptocurrency advocacy groups. While the US banking associations representing all fifty states have raised alarms about potential vulnerabilities in the law, two crypto organizations, the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council, have pushed back against proposed changes. Crypto Advocates Warn Against Uncompetitive Environment In a joint statement , the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council expressed their strong opposition to the letters issued on August 12, 2025, by the Bank Policy Institute and various state bankers associations. These letters aim to revisit issues that they argue were thoroughly addressed during the legislative process of the GENIUS Act. The groups contend that the proposals threaten to create an uncompetitive environment for stablecoins, prioritizing the interests of banks over broader industry growth, competition, and consumer choice. They argue that payment stablecoins are fundamentally different from bank deposits or investment products, and therefore should not be regulated in the same way. According to the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers are required to maintain one-to-one reserves in cash or high-quality liquid assets and operate under federal or qualified state licensing and supervision. The crypto groups highlight that this regulatory framework is designed to ensure that stablecoins do not function like traditional bank deposits or money market funds, emphasizing their unique role in the financial ecosystem. The advocacy groups also addressed claims that certain practices, such as exchanges sharing rewards, undermine the GENIUS Act’s prohibition on issuer-paid interest. They argue that a level playing field is essential, allowing both banks and crypto firms to innovate and compete, particularly for underbanked consumers who increasingly rely on digital wallets. Stablecoins Under Scrutiny The letter further warns that eliminating features available to stablecoin users, while permitting them for banks, would unfairly favor larger legacy institutions that often fail to provide competitive returns. One contentious point is Section 16(d) of the GENIUS Act, which allows subsidiaries of state-chartered institutions to conduct money transmission to support lawful stablecoin issuer activities across state lines. The advocacy groups argue that repealing this provision would hinder stablecoin redemption rights for out-of-state holders, potentially creating a fragmented regulatory environment that stifles interstate commerce. Additionally, the call to ban non-financial companies from issuing payment stablecoins is seen as an extreme measure that could stifle innovation. In their statement, the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council emphasize that stablecoins operate under strict reserve and supervisory requirements, with their reserves largely remaining within the traditional financial system. They argue that allowing responsibly regulated platforms to share benefits with customers is not a loophole but rather a feature that enhances financial inclusion and fosters innovation.

A recent study highlights Binance’s extraordinary lead in Binance new token trading , showcasing its powerful position in the market. This dominance is not just significant; it is truly unrivaled, reshaping how new projects gain visibility and liquidity. Unpacking Binance’s Remarkable Lead in New Token Trading According to an analysis by CryptoQuant, shared by The Data Nerd on X, Binance has cemented its status as the go-to platform for new token listings. The figures speak volumes about Binance’s commanding presence. Binance processed a staggering $133 billion in new token trading volume this year alone. This figure dwarfs its closest competitors: HTX, which handled $38 billion, and Bybit, with $35 billion. Binance’s daily market share for new token trading has also been consistently high, reaching 34% on August 13th and peaking at an impressive 54% on July 10th. This data clearly illustrates Binance’s extensive reach and the immense trust users place in the platform for accessing the latest crypto innovations. What Drives Binance’s New Token Trading Dominance? Why does Binance consistently outperform its rivals in the new token market? Several factors contribute to its formidable lead: Unmatched Liquidity: Binance offers deep liquidity pools, making it easier for traders to buy and sell new tokens without significant price slippage. This attracts both large institutional players and individual investors. Vast User Base: With millions of active users globally, Binance provides an immediate and massive audience for newly listed projects. This built-in demand is crucial for price discovery and initial adoption. Robust Listing Process: While rigorous, Binance’s listing process is perceived as a stamp of approval, lending credibility to new tokens. Projects often aspire to list on Binance due to the prestige and exposure it offers. Innovative Launchpad Initiatives: Binance Launchpad and Launchpool programs have successfully incubated and introduced numerous popular tokens, creating a strong pipeline of new assets that naturally gravitate towards the exchange for trading. These elements collectively create a powerful ecosystem that fosters robust Binance new token trading activity. Implications for the Crypto Market and Investors Binance’s overwhelming lead in new token trading has significant implications for the broader crypto market. For new projects, securing a listing on Binance can be a game-changer, providing unparalleled exposure and liquidity. This often leads to strong initial performance, though it does not guarantee long-term success. For investors, Binance’s dominance means that many of the most anticipated and high-volume new token launches will likely occur on its platform. However, investors must always exercise caution. While opportunities abound, the volatility inherent in new tokens requires thorough research and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Diversifying investments and not solely relying on initial listing pumps are wise strategies. Navigating the New Token Landscape on Binance Given Binance’s strong position in Binance new token trading , how can participants navigate this landscape effectively? It is essential to approach new token investments with a strategic mindset. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and use case before investing. Understand Volatility: New tokens are highly volatile. Be prepared for significant price swings. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Binance and the projects themselves to stay updated on developments. By adopting a disciplined approach, you can better position yourself within this exciting yet challenging segment of the crypto market. In conclusion, Binance’s impressive $133 billion in new token trading volume solidifies its position as the undisputed leader in this critical segment of the crypto market. Its vast user base, deep liquidity, and strategic listing initiatives create an environment where new tokens thrive. While this dominance offers significant opportunities, responsible investing remains paramount.

This initiative follows the recent enactment of several significant laws, including the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC bills, all aimed at shaping the future of digital assets in the United States. Keys Behind The Responsible Financial Innovation Act Since the House of Representatives passed these key crypto bills last month, the Senate Banking Committee has been crafting its version of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Under the leadership of Chairman Tim Scott and alongside Senators Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Bernie Moreno, the committee introduced the draft of the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025.” This piece of crypto legislation seeks to provide much-needed regulatory clarity, promote innovation, and address the significant risks often associated with the evolving digital asset landscape. Related Reading: Expert Touts Chainlink Advantage Over XRP In Institutional Adoption Race The Senate’s proposed framework builds on the foundation laid by the Clarity Act, which primarily aimed to empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and classify digital assets as commodities. In contrast, the Senate bill grants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) primary regulatory oversight over what it terms “ancillary assets.” Notably, the bill specifies that these ancillary assets should not be classified as securities, and transactions involving them would not fall under federal securities laws, including the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. This comes on the heels of statements from SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who suggested that only a small number of tokens could be classified as securities, depending on how they are packaged and marketed. Crypto Legislation’s Thanksgiving Deadline The bill also takes a stance on combating illicit financial activities associated with digital assets. It mandates new regulations for anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and countering the financing of terrorism. The draft unveils that one of the most pressing challenges in developing a robust digital asset market is determining how traditional banks and financial institutions fit into this evolving ecosystem.

This Upper Boundary Retest Could Set The Stage For $268 An increasing number of banks such as Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America, are now considering the integration of crypto assets, particularly stablecoins, as a means to overcome traditional payment barriers. The proposed legislation aims to address this issue by explicitly allowing banks and financial holding companies to engage in a variety of digital asset activities, including custody and trading. During a recent conversation at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Senator Lummis expressed her confidence in the crypto bill’s momentum, stating, “We will have it on the President’s desk before Thanksgiving.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto bill|crypto market|Crypto Market Structure Bill|crypto news|crypto regulation|cryptocurrency|Senator Lummis,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-08-21 07:00:41

Ye’s X account posted about the token in early Asian hours on Thursday, raising immediate concerns about it being a compromised account. It later posted a video showing Ye talking about and confirming the issuance (it is unclear if it is the real Ye or an AI generation). The token briefly touched $3.16 in early trading — a surge of nearly 6,800% from its issue price — with some trackers claiming it briefly commanded a $3 billion market cap. Behind the frenzy supposedly sits the broader YZY ecosystem, which Ye’s team has pitched as including a YZY token, a Ye Pay processor for transactions, and a YZY Card for global spending of YZY and USDC. YZY’s structure was first revealed by CoinDesk in February , which reported that 70% of supply would go directly to Ye personally, with 10% for liquidity and 20% for public sale. At the time, insiders said Ye had initially demanded an 80% stake — the same allocation structure tied to Donald Trump’s TRUMP token — before being negotiated down. The project has also carried heavy baggage from the start. Ye had previously declared that “coins prey on the fans with hype” before backtracking and approving YZY. Sources told CoinDesk the token was meant to mimic TRUMP’s success, even as Argentina was roiled by a similar scandal when President Javier Milei’s endorsed LIBRA coin collapsed as a pump-and-dump. Critics flagged then — and now — that such insider-heavy distributions tilt risk squarely toward retail buyers, especially when paired with a single-sided liquidity pool. The token distribution shows 20% allocated to the public, 10% to liquidity, and 70% to Yeezy Investments LLC, locked for 24 months under a structured vesting arrangement via Jupiter Lock. To prevent bot-driven manipulation, 25 contract addresses were initially deployed, with only one randomly selected as the official token. That 1-in-25 anti-sniping setup was billed as a fairer launch — but on-chain data suggests insiders still had advance access. Analytics account Lookonchain identified wallet 6MNWV8 as knowing the contract address in advance. The wallet even attempted to buy YZY before launch. Once live, it spent 450,611 USDC to acquire 1.29 million tokens at roughly $0.35 each. It later sold 1.04 million YZY for 1.39 million USDC, leaving 249,907 tokens worth about $600,000 — booking a profit of more than $1.5 million. “Insider wallet 6MNWV8 knew the contract address in advance and even tried buying yesterday,” Lookonchain wrote on X. OnChain Lens flagged an even larger whale who invested 12,170 SOL (about $2.28 million) for 2.67 million YZY. Current holdings are valued at $8.29 million — an unrealized gain of about $6 million. Only YZY tokens were seeded into the liquidity pool, without pairing against USDC. That single-sided setup allows developers or large holders to add and remove liquidity in ways that effectively let them cash out, a structure similar to the controversial LIBRA token. “Only $YZY was added to the liquidity pool with no $USDC. Dev may sell $YZY by adding/removing liquidity, similar to $LIBRA,” Lookonchain noted. The hype and quick gains show how much speculation still drives Solana’s memecoins. Meanwhile, YZY has already slipped to nearly $1, with some early buyers taking heavy hits. On-chain data shows wallet 6ZFnRH spent 1.55 million USDC to buy 996,453 YZY at $1.56, only to sell at $1.06 for 1.05 million USDC — booking a loss of nearly $500,000 in under two hours.

Tutorial ($TUT) – AI-Powered Crypto Educator Turned Market Star Launched in February this year, Tutorial ($TUT) has quickly become one of the steadiest performers in the altcoin market.

Comedian ($BAN) – Chaos, Controversy, and a Fresh Breakout If you’re looking for a proven performer that has just kicked off a new rally, Comedian is a fantastic choice. The token recently broke out of a long-standing consolidation zone that had been in place since early May. Even better, it did so with a fat green candle, surging 22% in a single day . Now, Comedian looks set to retest its recent all-time highs of around $0.20, which would mean another 130% upside from current levels. So, what exactly is Comedian? At its core, it’s a hype-driven meme coin built on irony and social commentary. Its inspiration comes from the infamous modern art piece featuring a banana taped to a wall. If you’ve been on the internet long enough, you might remember how this work sparked heated debates about whether modern art is genius or just plain ridiculous. As a good community-driven meme coin, Comedian doesn’t take sides. Instead, it thrives on the chaos of internet culture, using controversy and conversation as fuel for massive investor gains. And while that might sound nonsensical to a traditional Wall Street analyst, it’s exactly this raw, unpredictable momentum that meme coins use to rocket portfolios in today’s market. Conclusion When asked to ditch the obvious choices and pick a high-risk, high-reward portfolio, ChatGPT cut through the noise and spotlighted high-upside plays with return potential no self-respecting crypto guru list will ever give you. The AI’s top suggestions include Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , Tutorial ($TUT), and Comedian ($BAN). That said, kindly keep in mind that none of the above is financial advice.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-get-ready-for-biggest-pump-of-your-lifetime-heres-why/,"A recent post by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) suggested that XRP is on the verge of a massive upward move. The analyst shared a two-week chart from Bitstamp showing the price pressing against an ascending resistance drawn from the 2021 peak through the early 2025 high and the asset’s recent all-time high, which it reached in July . At the time of the analysis, XRP was traded at $3.13, and Steph believes the current technical setup can bring significant gains. According to the analyst, “Once XRP breaks this multi-year resistance, you’ll witness the biggest pump of your lifetime.” Once #XRP breaks this multi-year resistance, you'll witness the biggest pump of your lifetime! pic.twitter.com/zvGV9p5uzP — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 20, 2025 What the Technical Setup Implies The chart highlights a classic test of the higher-time-frame resistance. On the multi-year timeline, closing above a line that has capped advances since 2021 can shift market structure. Closing above the 2021 peak of $1.96 in late 2024 helped XRP surge above $3 in early 2025, and that level has served as a crucial support throughout the year. The multi-year price compression suggests a massive move could follow the breakout, and the two-week candle reduces noise, outlining a clear direction for the asset. A breakout would trigger a transition from range behavior to a price discovery phase , and potentially, rapid expansion. The slope of the resistance line also shows progressively higher highs, which reinforces the idea that sellers have defended a moving target. If the price settles above that boundary, it would indicate a structural change with the potential to drive further movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How a Breakout Could Be Validated Analysts typically look for a decisive two-week close over the line, followed by continued strength or a successful retest that holds as support. Confirmation would be strengthened by rising participation and a clean price structure, such as higher highs and higher lows on the same timeframe. Because the presented chart focuses on structure, the key evidence is purely price-based. It asks whether XRP can print sustained closes above the 2021-2025 trendline. Well-respected analysts have set bullish targets for XRP, suggesting it could hit double digits in a few months . While the post does not predict a date or target, it isolates a clean break of a multi-year resistance line on the two-week chart as the only condition for growth. If XRP achieves that, the analyst expects outsized upside, which could contribute significantly to this double-digit target, potentially helping the asset hit even higher targets.

Regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act and SEC's Project Crypto boost legitimacy and institutional adoption of Ethereum. Retail and institutional interest in ether is rising, with Google Trends and ARK Invest's positions signaling growing momentum. ETH's technical setup is attractive, with $4100 as key support; a breakout above $4866 could trigger significant upside into 2025. Earlier this month, I outlined a cautious near-term stance on bitcoin . I own the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and recently took a position in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ). Today, I’m analyzing ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. To preface, I am not a crypto expert, but I like to think I’m savvy with charts and broader macro trends. So, let’s take a look at the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF ( ETH ). I have a buy rating on the product. I see a slew of bullish fundamental developments in recent months, while the chart sets up well for a year-end rally. You might recall that Fundstrat’s Tom Lee sent shockwaves across the investment world in August, calling for a $10,000 to $12,000 price target by the end of 2025. I’m not sure if I see that much upside, but with ether tagging key support, I think a bounce is quite likely over the ensuing months. ETH-USD, Bitcoin Outpacing the S&P 500 YTD StockCharts.com According to the issuer , ETH is solely and passively invested in ether. Its investment objective is to reflect the value of ether held by the Fund, less expenses and other liabilities. Ether is a digital asset that is created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Ethereum Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. The Ethereum Network allows people to exchange tokens of value, called ether, which are recorded on a public transaction ledger known as a blockchain. ETH is a moderate-sized ETF with $2.9 billion in assets under management as of August 19, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is low at just 15 basis points, and there is, of course, no yield. The fund’s share price momentum is very strong, earning it a stellar A+ ETF Grade in that category by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. Historical standard deviation metrics are very high, however, so it is a highly risky product . Finally, from a liquidity perspective , tradability is solid—average daily volume is above 3 million shares, while the 30-day median bid/ask spread is just three basis points per Grayscale. Now, turning to the bullish catalysts. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, effectively standardizing digital currencies, paving the way for wider adoption. Its passage helped bring about a fresh wave of crypto buying, with particular gains in ether. The Act brings clarity and legitimacy for stablecoins, specifically, and that should open the floodgates for wider crypto volumes, along with more institutional usage of blockchain technology and networks. The GENIUS Act's Passage Was A Watershed Moment For Crypto The White House At about the same time, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) embarked on its Project Crypto. Its aim is to establish a regulatory framework for crypto trading by giving guidance to big banks and other firms to merge onto the blockchain. The SEC will coordinate with the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to offer further directives and rulemaking across the cryptosphere. The SEC Launches ""Project Crypto"" SEC With this regulatory lattice taking shape, one of ether’s biggest champions, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, has outlined her bull case. She sees Ethereum becoming the primary institutional protocol. ARK ETFs have reportedly taken sizable stakes in ether, too. Cathie Wood Takes a ""Solid Position"" in ETH-USD X Tom Lee and Cathie Wood are obviously on board, but how is retail interest? It’s perking up, at least according to Google Search trends. Around the world, there has been a major jump in searches for “Ethereum” and “eth.” Thus, I assert that dips will be buying opportunities, particularly if we see a new all-time high in ether (more on that to come). The FOMO effect could take root. Google Trends: Ethereum and ETH Shoot Higher This Summer Google As far as large global portfolio managers’ holdings, crypto is just a small piece of the pie. According to the August 2025 BofA Global Research Global Fund Manager Survey, just 9% of investors own crypto assets of any kind. The average crypto allocation among that small group is just 3.2%. While the entire cryptocurrency market cap is only near $4 trillion, investors remain lightly allocated to the niche. BofA FMS: Light Allocation to Crypto BofA Global Research Seasonally, ether has tended to trade poorly in September, so this is a notable risk heading into the end of the third quarter. ETH-USD: Weak September Seasonality Barchart The Technical Take As regulatory frameworks get enacted and institutions begin to embrace ether, the technical situation offers a solid opportunity today, in my opinion. Notice in the chart below that ETH-USD pulled back to key support at the previous resistance level of $4100. I, in fact, added ether exposure on Tuesday, so I’m putting my money where my mouth is. Still, I’d like to see the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency climb above its November 2021 all-time high of $4866. If that were to occur, then Tom Lee’s forecast of a five-figure price could come into play. Another potential price target is near $6800. Here’s how I calculate that: If we take the $2700 depth of the December 2024 to April 2025 plunge and add that on top of the $4100 breakout that took place recently, then we get $6800. I like that the long-term 200-day moving average is back on the rise, while a high amount of volume by price is now below the current level. Moreover, take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph—it is ranging in a bullish zone between 40 and 90, just as price retreats to the polarity point. For now, $4100 is support, and $4800-$4900 is resistance. ETH-USD: $4100 Critical Support, All-Time High Remains Resistance StockCharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on ETH, the low-cost ether ETF. I view it as just as solid as ETHA, which I bought this week. Given wider Ethereum adoption and bullish technical signals, this highly volatile cryptocurrency appears poised for gains into the end of 2025.",ETH-USD|ETHA|ETHE|ETH,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-21 07:14:22

They have officially designated RAI Finance (SOFI) as a SOFI closely monitored asset . This move signals a serious review of the project’s health and operational transparency, impacting investors and the broader market alike. What Does SOFI Closely Monitored Asset Status Mean? When a major exchange like Bithumb labels an asset as ‘closely monitored,’ it’s a clear signal to the market. This status indicates that the exchange has identified specific concerns regarding the project behind the asset. It’s not an immediate delisting, but rather a warning sign, placing the asset under intensified scrutiny. For users, this means increased risk and uncertainty. Bithumb’s decision follows a thorough review process, highlighting the exchange’s commitment to protecting its users and maintaining market integrity. Therefore, understanding the implications of this status is vital for anyone holding or considering trading SOFI. Why Was SOFI Designated a Closely Monitored Asset ? Bithumb’s official announcement detailed several key reasons for placing SOFI under close monitoring. These concerns primarily revolve around the project’s fundamental health and operational transparency. The exchange specifically cited: Deficiencies in Business Reality: Questions arose regarding the actual progress and viability of RAI Finance’s stated business model. Sustainability Issues: Concerns were raised about the long-term sustainability of the project, including its economic model and ability to maintain operations. Operational Progress Lags: Bithumb observed insufficient progress in the project’s development and operational milestones. Insufficient Transparency: A lack of clarity in project communications and financial dealings was noted. Irrational Business Plan Changes: Changes to the project’s business plan were deemed lacking in rationality and proper justification. These points collectively paint a picture of a project struggling to meet the standards expected by a leading cryptocurrency exchange. The designation as a SOFI closely monitored asset is a direct consequence of these identified shortcomings. Implications for SOFI Holders and the Market The designation of SOFI as a closely monitored asset carries significant weight. For current holders of SOFI, this status introduces considerable uncertainty and potential volatility. Historically, such announcements can lead to price declines as investors react to the increased risk. Moreover, this status often precedes more severe actions, such as a warning designation or even delisting, if the project fails to address the identified issues. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to stay informed and consider their positions carefully. The broader market also observes these actions, as they reflect on the due diligence practices of major exchanges like Bithumb. Navigating the Future of SOFI: What Should You Do? If you are holding SOFI, it’s natural to feel concerned. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcements and RAI Finance’s updates. Transparency from the project will be key to resolving this status. Assess Your Risk: Evaluate your personal risk tolerance. Given the increased uncertainty, you might consider reducing your exposure to the SOFI closely monitored asset . Diversify: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with single assets. Understand the Process: Familiarize yourself with Bithumb’s monitoring and delisting policies. Knowing the potential next steps can help you prepare. Ultimately, the onus is on RAI Finance to demonstrate significant improvements in their business reality, sustainability, and transparency to have the SOFI closely monitored asset status lifted. Until then, caution is advised. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to designate SOFI as a closely monitored asset underscores the importance of rigorous due diligence in the crypto space. This move highlights the exchange’s role in safeguarding investor interests by flagging projects that fall short of operational and transparency standards. For SOFI, this is a critical juncture, demanding immediate and substantial corrective action to regain trust and stability. The future of SOFI on Bithumb, and potentially other exchanges, now hinges on its ability to address these profound deficiencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘closely monitored asset’ mean on a crypto exchange? A ‘closely monitored asset’ status means an exchange has identified significant issues with a cryptocurrency project, such as deficiencies in business operations, sustainability, or transparency. It’s a warning signal that the asset is under intense review and could face further action, including delisting, if the problems are not resolved. Q2: Why did Bithumb specifically designate SOFI as a closely monitored asset? Bithumb designated SOFI due to identified deficiencies in RAI Finance’s business reality, sustainability, and operational progress. Additionally, concerns were raised about insufficient transparency and rationality in changes to its business plan. Q3: What are the potential consequences for SOFI after this designation? The primary consequence is increased risk and uncertainty for SOFI holders. The asset’s price may become more volatile. If RAI Finance fails to address Bithumb’s concerns, the asset could face a ‘warning designation’ or, ultimately, delisting from the exchange. Q4: Should I sell my SOFI holdings immediately? The decision to sell or hold SOFI depends on your individual risk tolerance and investment strategy. It is crucial to stay informed about official announcements from Bithumb and RAI Finance. Consider consulting a financial advisor to make an informed decision based on your personal circumstances. Q5: How can I stay updated on SOFI’s status?

What Next?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/21/shiba-inu-bulls-defend-dual-support-with-1t-volume,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained over 2% in the past 24 hours, with bulls defending key support levels on the back of strong volumes. The meme cryptocurrency fell early Wednesday as BTC and the broader market witnessed de-risking ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's impending speech. Buyers, however, stepped in closer to the $0.00001200 level, ensuring that the psychological support was maintained. The subsequent recovery also lifted prices back above the ascending trendline connecting June 22 and Aug. 2 lows, and the key level of $0.00001231, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the June-July rally. Bulls fuel SHIB comeback SHIB shakes off volatility, powers from $0.000012295 to $0.000012574 close on heavy bullish flow. Token holds critical support, smashes through resistance barriers. Next target: $0.000012700 psychological level. According to CoinDesk's AI technical insights model, $0.000012700 is the next level to beat for the bulls. Technical data points to a bullish breakout SHIB traded within a $0.000012089-$0.000012705 range, which represents a 5% spread between session extremes. Institutional interest peaked between 13:00 and 14:00, andvolume surged past 1 trillion tokens. The price held above $0.000012250, confirming a strong demand floor. Mid-session selling pressure at 13:00 failed to crack $0.000012089 support. Resistance at $0.000012600 was penetrated, triggering a volume surge to 12.8 billion tokens. CD20 Index Holds Steady Amid Token Volatility CD20 maintained range-bound trading as SHIB volatility spiked.

The launch, billed by Ye himself as the start of “a new economy, built on chain,” comes just months after he publicly dismissed rumors of creating a token. A New Economy or a Familiar Scheme? The token’s rollout has already stirred some controversy, with journalist Colin Wu sharing data from the GMGN trading platform, which allegedly shows that 90% of its supply is in the hands of just six wallets, raising concerns about heavy concentration and insider activity. Blockchain trackers also flagged suspicious liquidity pool setups reminiscent of the Libra coin rug pull from earlier in the year, where developers retained disproportionate control of liquidity. Additionally, Lookonchain reported that one insider flipped $450,000 worth of USDC into $3.37 million in just hours, highlighting how early entrants capitalized on privileged access. However, even with the skepticism, Kanye’s star power shone, with YZY quickly listed on CoinMarketCap while also securing exchange listings, including Bitget. Furthermore, the official site introduced not only the token but also Ye Pay, a crypto payment processor, and YZY Card, a debit solution aimed at everyday spending in YZY and USDC. It also indicated that the supply breakdown allocated 70% to Yeezy Investments LLC, 20% to public buyers, and 10% to liquidity, with vesting handled by Jupiter Lock contracts. Nonetheless, community sentiment on the meme coin is split. Pseudonymous crypto trader Defi Mochi warned that YZY’s fully diluted valuation between $2 and $3 billion was “bad risk-reward” given the fate of other meme tokens, while also pointing to suspicious timing tied to unfrozen Libra funds. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju drew comparisons to the Official Trump token, which spiked after launch but later collapsed by 88%, suggesting YZY may face a similar trajectory. Price Action and Market Outlook Data from CoinMarketCap shows YZY hit an all-time high of $3.16 within hours of its introduction before tumbling more than 66% to just under $1.00, briefly marking its all-time low at $0.91 the same day. In the last 24 hours, the meme asset has dropped over 54%, with hourly swings as sharp as 31%. At the time of this writing, its market cap had nosedived from its previous multi-billion-dollar peak to sit at around $349 million according to CMC. Traders have been both long and shorting the token aggressively. Spot On Chain reported one trader on Hyperliquid managed a $202,000 gain by shorting the token with leverage, while another repeatedly attempted long positions, racking up more than $159,000 in losses.

Unilabs Leads Google Searches With Mining Yield,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-primed-to-recapture-2024-rally-unilabs-leads-google-searches-with-mining-yield/,"The Cardano price has entered a make-or-break zone, with ADA coin traders closely watching if the crypto giant can replicate its 2024 rally. As uncertainty looms over whether ADA coin will break resistance or slip further, another name is quietly stealing the spotlight: Unilabs Finance . Surging in Google searches due to its impressive mining yield and AI-powered strategies, Unilabs is emerging as the project investors are calling the next big opportunity. Continue reading this article to find out more about Cardano price and Unilabs. Cardano Price Forecast: Breakout or Breakdown? The Cardano price is at a critical point, with ADA coin trading around $0.94 and stuck in a tightening triangle pattern. The coming sessions will determine if the Cardano price will break out or continue in retreat. The crucial resistance level to monitor is $0.98, which, if overcome, may signal the commencement of a big bullish rise for the ADA coin. A new Cardano price forecast identifies this level as the crucial threshold, where ADA coin has previously failed to break out, leaving traders cautious. As the ADA coin range narrows, the pressure to move in either direction increases. If the Cardano price can maintain its price over $0.90, momentum traders will flock to the ADA coin, driving the Cardano price higher. However, a dip below $0.85 would indicate the reverse. This would fuel bearish sentiment and perhaps send ADA coin towards new lows. Why Investors Call Unilabs the “All-Green Portfolio Builder” With the Cardano price showing a dip in its momentum, which pushed it to new heights, smart investors are looking towards new opportunities that can yield them better gains. Unilabs Finance has emerged as one such project that is currently leading search engines owing to its mining yields and its USP, which is AI-powered investment tools and strategies. Unilabs Finance is the world’s first AI-driven asset management platform that stands out with its integrated AI algorithm-driven portfolio management with a decentralized system. Despite being a new entry in the market, the platform has over $32 million in AUM, spread across 4 funds. These include BTC Fund, AI Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. This model lets investors get exposure to high-potential sectors without taking a lot of risks. This AI-powered platform eliminates the need for investors to manually screen the market for emerging opportunities. The protocol handles it for them using AI algorithms at a speed that humans can never match. Furthermore, Unilabs Finance has its Early Access Scoring System (EASS) that helps traders find upcoming crypto projects with the most growth potential. Using this, investors will have a chance to invest in emerging investments before they hit the mainstream market. The same system exists for meme coins, named the Meme Coin Identification Tool. It uses liquidity metrics, virality parameters, and listing data to detect trending meme coins before they deliver massive gains. These features combined offer investors everything that an investor needs for an all-green portfolio, minimizing risk exposure and chances of losses in deals. Unilabs Presale Crosses $14.6M: Investors Rush In Unilabs Finance is currently trending on different platforms due to its impressive mining yield, which has never been offered before. Furthermore, its presale is also behind its being trending. The presale has managed to surpass $14.6 million in presale selling over 2 billion UNIL tokens. Currently, each UNIL token is priced only at $0.0108, all set to surge to $0.012 in the subsequent round, and massively on its tier-1 exchange listing. Furthermore, by holding UNIL tokens, investors can get governance rights and also take part in their staking program. Additionally, token holders can rake in up to 30% of the platform fees as passive income, which makes Unilabs a perfect PassiveFi platform.

But Analysts Warn!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/famous-american-rapper-who-was-allegedly-involved-in-partnership-with-binance-founder-cz-launches-his-own-altcoin-but-analysts-warn/,"Famous American rapper Kanye West, who previously made news that he would launch his own token and even partner with Binance founder CZ for this token, announced the launch of his Solana (SOL)-based token called “YZY”. The price of YZY experienced a meteoric rise in just a few hours, reaching an all-time high of $3.16. However, it quickly fell back to the $1 level. According to GMGN data, the token's market capitalization has surpassed $3 billion. The six largest holders collectively control 90.38% of the token's supply. “Yeezy Money is here… A new economy built on chains,” West X said in a post on his account. West also included an image showing YZY's address and a link to a website where people can buy, sell and send YZY. “YZY Money is a concept that aims to give you control without relying on a central authority,” the website states. In addition to the YZY token, the project's official website also features a crypto payment processor called YE Pay and a debit card tool called YZY Card. It was stated that 70% of YZY’s total supply will remain under Kanye West’s control, while the remaining 30% will be shared between liquidity (10%) and investors (20%). This mirrors the trends of other famous coins, such as the TRUMP memecoin, which has encouraged West to join the crypto world. Analysts Warn About AGI! While YZY has garnered significant interest, analysts have warned that its liquidity pool is built solely using its own token, rather than being backed by a stablecoin like USDC. This, they said, opens the door to potential price manipulation by developers in the future. Coinbase's Conor Grogan also warned that 94% of Kanye West's YZY token is held by insiders. Coinbase Director of Product Strategy Conor Grogan said in a post on X that he estimates that at least 94% of YZY, Kanye West's new Solana-based memecoin, is held by company insiders. According to Grogan, 87% of YZY was initially held in a single multi-signature wallet before being split across multiple addresses, more than 3% was purchased in a single transaction by prepared wallets at market open, and approximately 7% was added to liquidity pools (LPs). *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin and other major altcoins are in the green, with altcoins particularly outperforming BTC over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin temporarily climbed above $114k while Ether hit the $4,300 mark after bouncing off the $4,100 region earlier on Wednesday. Ether could now be heading to a new all-time high as whales maintain buying pressure. Whales keep prices higher despite profit-taking Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 3% in the last 24 hours, similar to other leading altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA. The positive performance came after two days of steady declines, with the rally sparking an increase in short liquidations, with positions worth over $100 million liquidated over the past few hours. Ether’s bounce can be attributed to the resilience of whales during the market correction. Whales holding between 10K and 100K ETH grew their collective stash by 550K ETH over the past week, despite Ether losing 10% of its value during that period. However, small-scale holders embarked on massive profit-taking, with about 380k ETH sold over the last few days. Institutions continue to add ETH and BTC to their treasuries despite the market correction. Data obtained from StrategicETHReserve.xyz. showed that Ethereum digital asset treasuries (DATs) led by BitMine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming, collectively bought about 520K ETH last week In addition to that, Singapore’s largest bank, DBS, is extending its blockchain strategy by offering tokenized structured notes on the Ethereum public blockchain. DBS revealed that this latest development will mark its first time offering tokenized products to accredited and institutional investors outside its client base. Ether targets the $4,793 high if the bullish trend strengthens The ETH/USD 4-hour chart is bearish despite Ether halting its bearish run on Wednesday as it added over 4% to its value. The bulls defended the support near $4,100 and could now push the price to a new yearly high. The technical indicators are showing signs of recovery following days of weakening momentum. The RSI of 50 shows that Ether is no longer in the bearish region, while the MACD lines have also crossed over into the positive territory. At press time, ETH is trading at $4,306 per coin. If ETH continues to rise, it could recover above the $4,500 key level and retest its all-time high resistance at $4,868. An extended bullish run would ensure a new all-time high for ETH, validating another bullish pennant pattern for the top altcoin. Analysts still believe ETH could hit $6k in the medium term, but the price action remains choppy at the moment. However, if the bulls fail to build on yesterday’s momentum, ETH could bounce back from its current 4-hour TLQ level and retest the $4,070 support zone. The bulls would defend this region as failure to do so could see ETH drop to the $,3862 low.

The 20–50 EMAs at $2.96–$3.03 act as resistance, while $2.85 remains the key support. RSI near 39 signals bearish pressure, explaining why XRP price going down recently. XRP is currently trading at $2.90, down 1.5% for the day as sellers keep pushing the price down to $3.00. The token is stuck in a triangle shape that is getting smaller. The bottom support is at $2.85 and the top resistance is near $3.20.

XRP Price Update and Chart View XRP price analysis (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, XRP is forming a descending triangle, with repeated lower highs pressing against horizontal support. If $2.85 fails to hold, the next demand zone rests around $2.65, where prior accumulation was seen earlier in the summer.

Whales Say Remittix Has More Upside,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepe-coin-price-prediction-can-pepe-outperform-doge-whales-say-remittix-has-more-upside/,"Over the past few days, interest in meme coins seems to have resurged, with investors betting on Pepe Coin and Dogecoin ahead of the next leg up. Retail investors have raised questions, such as whether PEPE can outperform DOGE. While retail investors continue to deliberate on meme coins, the whales look elsewhere. They are investing in a PayFi project, Remittix (RTX), which is believed to deliver more gains than PEPE and DOGE combined. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Is Meme Rally incoming? Although Pepe Coin (PEPE) has broken below the current floor, it is a high-volatility meme-coin that can be triggered by anything. Pepe coin price predictions foresee that the current pattern suggests an incoming breakout. Analysts point out that PEPE is under bullish tension and PEPE may be looking to $0.000017 in the near future. A Pepe coin price prediction by Pepethwhale stated that $PEPE is sitting right on a key support zone. If the support holds, we could see an uptrend to $0.000015. But if it breaks down, there’s a chance of a deeper pullback into lower levels. Source: Pepethwhale via X. There’s no need to rush; just wait for confirmation before making any moves. Why DOGE Still Holds Edge in Meme Rally It is probably unsurprising that Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the leading meme coin. It has maintained its unparalleled brand power, liquidity and institutional focus. PEPE has the hype, but DOGE has the market depth and the exchange capacity, which provides stability. Remember, DOGE is an established token with over $32 billion market cap. A 2x means a high amount of capital flow, which is impossible. Pepe coin price prediction, on the other hand, also points to modest gains. Hence, Remittix (RTX) seems to be the best option. Remittix (RTX), The Payfi Project Set To Outshine DOGE And PEPE with Real Utility Amid meme chatter, a surprising altcoin is gaining traction among whale investors. Remittix (RTX) is positioned as a PayFi token. It allows crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, supports multiple currencies and offers real-time FX conversion. Users send cryptocurrencies automatically converted with live FX rate on the app and recipients receive fiat instantly in their bank accounts. It bridges a $19 trillion gap between traditional payment (Web2) and cryptocurrency (Web3). Remittix highlights: Remittix is built for global remittances and freelancer payments and is used by merchant platforms. Built on trust and transparency, security is tight with a CertiK audit and locked liquidity/team tokens. An upcoming wallet (currently in beta) will launch in Q3. Remittix is built for adoption and real use, not speculations like meme coins.

Announced on Thursday, DBS will initially rollout tokenized notes to eligible investors of digital platforms, including ADDX, DigiFT and HydraX. However, it plans to expand to investors on other third-party digital investment platforms. Singapore has been deepening its role as a hub for tokenized finance. The city-state’s central bank, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has been advancing industry trials under Project Guardian . It explores how asset tokenization can be integrated with existing market infrastructure. The bank’s recent move has broadened access to complex financial products, which were once reserved for its private clients. DBS’s First Tokenized Product: Crypto-Linked Notes The bank has launched new crypto-linked notes that provide access to the asset class through DBS’s digital asset ecosystem. The notes pay out in cash when there is a rise in the prices of crypto. “[This] enables them to build exposure to the asset class without having to manage any cryptocurrency,” the announcement read. “The note is also structured to mitigate potential losses should cryptocurrency prices decline.” DBS initially launched crypto-linked structured notes in September 2024, alongside crypto options trading. DBS Responds to Rising Demand There has been a strong demand for such instruments among investors, the bank said. “In the first half of 2025, DBS clients executed over US$1 billion of trades involving these instruments.” Further, trade volumes increased almost 60% from Q1 2025 to Q2 2025. Additionally, DBS will also tokenize common structured notes, including equity-linked and credit-linked notes. “Asset tokenization is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure,” said Li Zhen, Head of Digital Assets at DBS. “Our first tokenized product, a crypto-linked note, also addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets.” The post Singapore’s DBS Bank to Issue Tokenized Crypto Notes on Ethereum Blockchain appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Asset tokenization|DBS|Singapore,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-08-21 07:32:00

Analyst Javon Marks sees repeating patterns that could send the asset to $8, a 740% gain. ADA futures funding rate flipped positive, signaling increased bullish positioning despite recent trading volume decline. Whale Accumulation Signals Renewed Interest Cardano (ADA) is showing renewed activity after large investors accumulated a substantial amount of tokens. Data from Santiment shared by analyst Ali Martinez shows that whale wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million ADA added 100 million coins in the past 24 hours. This move increased total holdings in that range to about 18.65 billion ADA. 100 million Cardano $ADA scooped up by whales in the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/nA8qNyGBkB — Ali (@ali_charts) August 20, 2025 Meanwhile, ADA’s price has been trading between $0.86 and $0.88, after pulling back from recent highs near $1. The increase in whale accumulation during this dip suggests that larger investors are positioning at lower levels. Historically, this type of buying has sometimes provided support during market corrections. Price Action and Technical Outlook At the time of press, ADA was trading at $0.88, up 3% in the last 24 hours, but remained 10% down during the last week. The recovery at crucial support zones has anchored the token after sustained drops in the recent past. Analyst Javon Marks noted that Cardano’s current price structure is showing similarities to its previous market cycle. Charts comparing past and present cycles indicate that ADA may be forming the same corrective and impulsive phases that preceded its earlier rally. Marks suggested that if the pattern continues, ADA could move toward $8, representing more than a 740% increase from current levels. Source: X Derivatives Market Activity Futures and derivatives data also point to rising trader interest. Coinglass reported that ADA open interest dropped 4% to $1.61 billion, while trading volume fell 18% to $5.27 billion. Despite this, the funding rate flipped positive to 0.0072%, meaning long traders are paying shorts. Remarkably, such shifts have often been followed by price rallies, as seen in early July. Source: Coinglass Additionally, CryptoPotato recently reported that ADA futures volume surged on August 14 to $7 billion, the highest level since March 2025. This sharp rise suggests a growing focus on ADA within the derivatives market. Beyond whale buying and derivatives activity, Cardano has also attracted institutional attention. Grayscale recently created a Delaware-based trust for ADA, sparking discussion about a possible spot ETF in the future. This has fueled speculation that ADA may continue to see increased interest from larger investors.

50429217,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79465,1755761606,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"SUI and ADA Have Been on Fire in 2025, but This New Crypto Might be Better",https://timestabloid.com/sui-and-ada-have-been-on-fire-in-2025-but-this-new-crypto/,"The 2025 market cycle has already delivered fireworks for altcoin investors, with projects like SUI and Cardano (ADA) ranking among the standout performers. SUI’s rapid ascent has been fueled by its reputation as a scalable, developer-friendly Layer 1, attracting attention from DeFi and gaming ecosystems. Cardano, meanwhile, has continued its slow but steady climb, leveraging upgrades to its smart contract functionality and growing institutional interest in its staking model. For traders who positioned themselves early, the rewards have been substantial. Yet as both projects gain traction, some analysts argue the biggest profits of this cycle may not come from established names like ADA or SUI. Instead, attention is shifting toward emerging small-cap contenders , where modest inflows can ignite exponential upside. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. SUI’s Rise Reflects Growing Appetite for Scalable Layer 1s SUI has quickly gained recognition as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems of 2025. Its architecture emphasizes scalability and transaction speed, offering an attractive environment for both developers and users frustrated by congestion on other networks. NFT platforms, gaming projects, and DeFi protocols have increasingly chosen SUI as their base, helping the token achieve double-digit percentage gains month after month. Analysts highlight that SUI’s trajectory underscores how much demand exists for performance-driven blockchains. However, the coin’s expanding market capitalization also makes it harder to deliver the kind of parabolic moves early investors crave. For traders chasing 20x or 50x gains , the focus inevitably turns to assets with smaller valuations and greater room to grow. Cardano Shows the Power of Patience Cardano has also been a key player in 2025. The launch of long-awaited governance upgrades, combined with the expansion of decentralized applications on its network, has renewed confidence in ADA’s potential. Its community-first approach and emphasis on academic rigor have paid dividends, allowing Cardano to maintain its reputation as one of the most credible Layer 1s in the market. Still, while ADA’s price appreciation has been meaningful, many in the market acknowledge its upside is constrained compared to its early years. With billions already invested and a long track record of adoption, ADA now competes as a “blue-chip” altcoin – offering stability but not necessarily the meteoric returns many investors seek in a bull market. Momentum shifts when established giants consolidate, and this is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is beginning to separate itself. Unlike ADA and SUI, which already require massive inflows to move the needle, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits at the earliest stage of its lifecycle. Its presale has generated intense interest, with rounds selling out in record time as investors recognize the potential to catch a coin before it lists on major exchanges. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE unique is how it blends crypto’s profit potential with cultural momentum, tapping into the political conversation shaping headlines globally. Analysts argue this creates a perfect storm: scarcity-driven tokenomics, explosive demand , and cultural resonance that mirrors the early days of DOGE and SHIB. The result is a setup where small amounts of capital can generate the kind of exponential upside no longer possible for larger-cap assets. Why Smaller Caps Can Deliver Bigger Returns The difference between projects like ADA or SUI and early-stage coins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE comes down to market dynamics. Established projects must attract billions in liquidity to sustain major rallies, while smaller caps can move dramatically on much less. This is why seasoned traders often allocate a portion of their portfolios to emerging names – the risk-to-reward ratio can far outpace what’s available with larger players. As MAGACOIN FINANCE approaches the close of its presale, with scarcity tightening and demand accelerating, many investors view it as the kind of rare opportunity that only appears once every few cycles. Its ability to combine branding strength, presale enthusiasm, and a supportive macro environment has positioned it as a standout contender heading into 2025’s bull market expansion. Conclusion SUI and ADA’s performances in 2025 highlight the enduring strength of established ecosystems. Both coins continue to play critical roles in the broader market, with strong communities and robust technology to back them. Yet for those searching for the next big wealth generator , the spotlight is turning toward smaller projects with the ability to multiply quickly. MAGACOIN FINANCE represents that kind of opportunity – an altcoin still in its infancy but already generating traction that resembles the early trajectories of crypto’s greatest success stories . For investors who missed the initial waves of ADA or SUI, this may be the second chance they’ve been waiting for.

Key Takeaways: A dormant Bitcoin whale shifted over $90M in BTC, selling on Hyperliquid and rotating into Ethereum. The whale opened massive leveraged long positions worth $295M across four wallets. This comes as Ethereum faces $678M in ETF outflows and sharp price volatility near $4,000. According to data from Onchain Lens , a wallet that withdrew 14,837 BTC ($94.9 million) seven years ago recently deposited 660 BTC into decentralized exchange Hyperliquid over the past 20 hours. The whale sold a large portion and later opened leveraged long positions in Ethereum. Whale Shifts $45.5M in BTC to ETH on Hyperliquid Fresh activity shows an additional 400 BTC ($45.5 million) was deposited into Hyperliquid, with the funds swapped for ETH on the spot market. The whale then bridged the ETH back to the Ethereum mainnet, consolidating a holding of 11,744 ETH worth $50.6 million. Onchain data reveals even larger bets in play. The whale opened long positions totaling 68,130 ETH ($295 million) across four different wallets, using 3x and 10x leverage. Screenshots shared by Onchain Lens show open positions valued between $90 million and $99 million each. This #Bitcoin OG further deposited 400 $BTC , worth $45.5M into #HyperLiquid , and is selling it to buy $ETH on the spot.

Ethereum recently surged alongside Bitcoin, attracting attention from whales seeking higher upside potential in leveraged derivatives markets. As reported, Ethereum tumbled to $4,063 on Wednesday after a wave of forced liquidations and heavy selling by ETF giants BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, who collectively dumped over $422 million worth of ETH in just 24 hours. The move has shaken investor confidence and sparked debate over whether Ethereum’s 200% rally in recent months has finally run out of steam. Data from SoSoValue shows the withdrawals marked the third consecutive day of ETF outflows, totaling $678 million over three sessions. Fidelity led with $156 million in redemptions, followed by Grayscale with $122 million, while Bitwise, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton posted smaller but notable sell-offs. Although ETH briefly recovered to around $4,223 after testing the $4,063 level, pressure remains high. Ethereum Investors to Shift Back to Bitcoin as ETH Soars As reported, Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow has suggested that Ethereum’s latest rally could be setting up a reversal , with capital eventually flowing back into Bitcoin. Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm Jan3, claimed that many long-term ETH holders, particularly early insiders from the ICO era, already own significant amounts of Bitcoin. According to him, these investors are rotating BTC into ETH to “pump it on new narratives” such as the emergence of Ethereum treasury companies. Once prices rise sufficiently, he predicts they will sell their ETH, leaving “new generational bagholders,” and move the profits back into Bitcoin. “No one wants ETH in the long run,” he said.

Amidst the bullish sentiments, STG extended its rally as the race to purchase Stargate Finance takes an unexpected turn. The Wormhole Foundation has confirmed its intent to acquire the cross-chain liquidity network, challenging LayerZero’s $110 million offer . The move renewed interest in the deal, with STG holders anticipating increased benefits with a competitive acquisition. Wormhole Foundation @WormholeFdn · Follow At the WF, we have respect for the @StargateFinance protocol, its team, and especially its holders. Stargate is a leader in multichain asset transfers. That’s why we’re stepping up with our intent to acquire Stargate – to ensure holders get the fair deal they deserve. 7:03 PM · Aug 20, 2025 1.3K Reply Copy link Read 358 replies Wormhole highlighted that it trusts LayerZero’s valuation undermines Stargate’s ecosystem potential and growth trajectory. Thus, the foundation has requested a hiatus in the ongoing LayerZero proposal snapshot vote (for five business days) to create time for a massive acquisition bid for Stargate. Besides making the bidding competitive, Wormhole’s claims suggest that Stargate’s worth in the cross-chain sector exceeds the initial $110 million offer. LayerZero’s proposal under scrutiny LayerZero’s bid to acquire Stargate attracted attention as it signals a bold move toward cementing its position as a dominant cross-chain interoperability and messaging platform. Stargate operates as a liquidity transport layer, and its functionalities match LayerZero’s strategy of facilitating seamless asset movements and communications across blockchains. LayerZero’s proposal added: This offer is designed to accelerate both Stargate and LayerZero, giving Stargate the resources to ship on an aggressive roadmap that expands its prerogative outside of bridging, while tying as an incredible, revenue-generating protocol that touches the end-consumer deeper into the LayerZero ecosystem. Nevertheless, Wormhole Foundation’s new move challenges the initial deal. Wormhole stated that LayerZero’s valuation underestimates the cross-chain’s long-term potential, especially as multi-chain platforms gain traction in the evolving blockchain sector. The request to pause ZRO’s community vote hints at a more formal, attractive offer that could ensure more value for STG investors and the Stargate partners. Why does Wormhole want Stargate? Wormhole is an interoperability network that facilitates billions in cross-chain transactions, while connecting over 30 blockchains. In April, it collaborated with Mercado Bitcoin to fuel the tokenization sector. With Stargate’s acquisition, Wormhole will integrate a lucrative liquidity layer to supercharge its messaging ecosystem. That could enrich Wormhole’s ecosystem beyond security and messaging to incorporate liquidity provision, which remains paramount in the DeFi world. STG price outlook Stargate’s native token soared over 10% from $0.1642 to a $0.1813 intraday peak. STG hovers at $0.1730 after a slight correction from 24-hour highs. Its daily trading volume jumped 435%, signaling intensified trader activity in the past few sessions. Chart by Coinmarketcap The remarkable performance signals enthusiasm among the Stargate community. STG holders likely believe that competitive bidding might unlock more benefits for investors and recognition of Stargate as a key player in the interoperability movement. Meanwhile, broad market performance will shape STG’s trajectory. Continued recoveries would trigger extended gains for the alt, while another downside would erase the recent gains and possibly catalyze substantial price dips.

Amazon is developing a higher-end Fire tablet that will, for the first time, run on the Android operating system, according to six people familiar with the matter. The effort, internally code-named “Kittyhawk,” could debut as early as next year. Amazon will use the Android OS to revamp fire tablets Fire tablets have long lacked access to the full range of apps available on Google’s Play Store , which discouraged developers as they’d have to build separate versions of their apps for Fire devices. “Consumers have always expressed a concern about not having access to the latest Android versions, not having access to some of their apps because Amazon used their own store,” said Jitesh Ubrani, a researcher at IDC. “It’s meant more work for developers in this day and age of largely free apps or services.” Despite these drawbacks, Amazon has sold millions of Fire tablets by pursuing a low-cost strategy. The devices have typically been priced near manufacturing cost. According to IDC, Amazon holds 8% of the global tablet market, just behind Lenovo at 8.2%. Apple and Samsung remain the leaders with 33.1% and 18.7% respectively. The new Android-based Fire tablet would be a notable shift for Amazon, as it has historically avoided relying on third-party software. One version under discussion carries a price tag of about $400 which is nearly double the current top-end Fire Max 11 at $230. By comparison, Apple’s iPads range from $350 to $1,200. Specific technical details about the device remain undisclosed. Amazon’s Fire Phone was first launched in 2014. It failed to gain traction and was discontinued at a loss of $170M. But in recent years, the company has shown more openness to external technology. For example, it has integrated Anthropic’s Claude AI system into Alexa+ and other services. The Kittyhawk project is expected to start with a premium model, while lower-cost Fire tablets will continue to use Amazon’s Linux-based Vega operating system in the near term. Over time, however, Amazon plans to shift the full lineup to Android. Amazon declined to comment on the project, saying it does not respond to rumors or speculation. Insiders caution that Kittyhawk could still face delays or even cancellation due to financial or strategic concerns. Google introduces Pixel 10 with expanded AI features In related news, Alphabet’s Google unveiled its latest Pixel 10 smartphones and a suite of connected devices at its annual “Made by Google” event in New York. The Pixel 10 lineup features new AI tools, including a “coach” in the camera app that guides users to take better photos and an assistant that surfaces contextually relevant information, such as displaying a flight confirmation email when a user calls an airline without requiring explicit input. Pricing begins at $799 for the standard model and $1,799 for the foldable version, holding steady despite concerns about U.S. tariffs. Google also introduced the Pixel Watch 4 and updated Pixel Buds 2a earbuds, while the higher-end Pixel Buds Pro 2 received only minor updates. Although Android powers more than 80% of smartphones worldwide, Google’s Pixel brand remains a small player in the market. In the second quarter, it accounted for just 1.1% of global shipments, up slightly from 0.9% a year earlier, according to IDC. In its largest market, the United States, Pixel’s share slipped from 4.5% to 4.3%. Industry observers have noted that Google’s hardware efforts are as much about showcasing Android’s potential as they are about direct competition with Apple. The company moved its event to the summer last year in an attempt to preempt Apple in promoting AI-enabled features on phones. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Pullback linked to U.S. inflation and producer price index data, not structural weakness. Ethereum maintains key support above $4,100, keeping its bullish outlook intact. After a sharp pullback, the crypto market is showing early signs of recovery. The global market cap stands at $3.87 trillion, up 1.2% in the past day, with Bitcoin trading near $113,700 and Ethereum above $4,290. According to Coinbase’s Head of Research, David Duong, the recent market pullback began with U.S. economic data. Inflation numbers from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) looked fine earlier last week at 2.7%. But then came the Producer Price Index (PPI), which surprised the market. At the same time, traders are watching the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, where the Federal Reserve could deliver “hawkish” signals about interest rates. This created the perfect excuse for a cool-off after months of gains in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins. In short, the pullback was less about disaster and more about timing.

Treasury Secretary Bets On The Crypto Industry On Wednesday, the Financial Times (FT) reported that the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is “betting” on the crypto industry to become a key buyer of US Treasuries in the coming years. Following the enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in July, digital assets pegged to the US dollar are required to be backed on a one-to-one basis by US dollars or Treasury bills. Sources familiar with the discussions told the news media outlet that Secretary Bessent has signaled to Wall Street that he expects the industry to “become an important source of demand for US government bonds” as Washington seeks to bolster demand for a surge of new US government debt. According to FT, Bessent has contacted leading stablecoin issuers , including Circle and Tether, for information, revealing the Treasury Department’s alleged plans to increase sales of short-term bills for the coming quarters. The report noted that the focus on the sector follows investors’ concerns about the US’s deteriorating public finances, adding that the Treasury Department’s hopes are also a sign of the White House’s “drive to bring crypto to the heart of US finance.” “The recent passage of the Genius Act is a significant development which we are monitoring as it will promote innovation in stablecoins and grow demand for short-term Treasury securities” the Treasury Department told FT, explaining that “issuance plans will continue to be informed by a variety of inputs including that from investors, primary dealers and the Treasury borrowing advisory committee”. Jay Barry, head of global rates strategy at JPMorgan Chase, told FT that “[Secretary Bessent and the Treasury department] absolutely think that stablecoins will be a real source of new demand for Treasuries. And that is absolutely why [Bessent] is comfortable weighting issuance towards [short-term debt].” A Multi-Trillion ‘Gold Rush’ Era? Notably, the Treasury Secretary previously affirmed that “this groundbreaking technology will buttress the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, expand access to the dollar economy for billions across the globe, and lead to a surge in demand for U.S. Treasuries, which back stablecoins.” Adding that “The GENIUS Act provides the fast-growing market with the regulatory clarity it needs to grow into a multitrillion-dollar industry.” Similarly, Goldman Sachs asserted that the industry is “at the beginning of a stablecoin gold rush,” which could potentially bring the $271 billion global market to trillions of dollars, Fortune reported . “Stablecoins are a $271bn global market, and we believe USDC (…) benefits from market share gains on and off of partner Binance’s platform, as ongoing stablecoin legislation legitimizes the ecosystem, and the crypto ecosystem expands, also potentially catalyzed by legislation,” the report highlighted, citing the bank’s research paper from August 20. Payments are the most obvious source of (total accessible market) expansion for stablecoins over the longer term. This opportunity is largely untapped so far, with the majority of stablecoin activity being driven by crypto trading activity and demand for dollar exposure outside of the U.S. Nonetheless, not everyone in the financial sector believes that the sector will boost the demand for US government bonds. Global Chief Economist at financial services firm UBS, Paul Donovan, shared a more skeptical approach with clients on Wednesday morning. According to Fortune, Donovan noted that the Treasury Secretary is “reportedly getting excited that stablecoins might increase demand for short-dated U.S. Treasuries, helping finance the unsustainable U.S. fiscal position. However, stablecoins are more about redistributing money supply.” “Someone selling Treasury bills to buy stablecoins, which invest the money in Treasury bills, does not change demand for U.S. debt instruments,” he concluded.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Circle|Crypto legislation|GENIUS Act|Scott Bessent|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoins|Tether|us bonds|US Treasury Department|US Treasury Secretary,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 08:00:00

Some analysts suggested that the altcoin is ready to break out to new highs, but warned that a rejection from the current levels could lead to volatile retests. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop Below $110,000 Despite Bounce – Is A 15% Pullback Coming? Chainlink Reclaims Key Levels On Wednesday, Chainlink led the crypto market as it started to recover from the recent pullback, which saw most cryptocurrencies retest their range lows for the first time in two weeks. LINK recorded the second-best performance among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, with an 11% increase in the past day. Notably, the altcoin hit a six-month high of $26.76 on Monday, after recovering 14% from the weekend lows. As it hit its multi-month high, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Chainlink added nearly 3,000 new addresses. According to the post, 2,995 new LINK addresses were created on August 18, the highest growth in 5 months. However, the start-of-week correction halted the bullish momentum, sending the cryptocurrency’s price to retest its breakout zone, around the $23.50 mark on Tuesday. After testing this area as support, Chainlink rebounded and reclaimed the $24.50-$25 range, briefly hitting the $26.50 barrier on Wednesday morning before retracing. Analyst Rekt Capital asserted that LINK is attempting to reclaim the $23.86-$34 price area after the recent performance. He highlighted that the lows of this range have historically been a “key support and successful retests here have enabled rallies to the Range High around $34.” Chainlink’s continued stability at the $23.86 level will be crucial for the rally to the range high. The market watcher noted that volatility below this range is possible as part of a volatile retesting process. LINK’s Levels To Watch The cryptocurrency’s monthly close is one of the most important levels to watch, as closing above the range low would position Chainlink for a bullish rally continuation. On the contrary, failing to reclaim this area in the monthly timeframe could lead to a deeper pullback toward the $19.41 level, not seen since the early August breakout. Rekt Capital explained that this level “has often acted as a volatile retest zone in bullish cycles, serving as a base for successful reversals, most prominently in mid-2021,” concluding that the cryptocurrency’s next move will be determined by a reclaim of the $23.86 resistance or a volatile retest of the $19.41 support. Altcoin Sherpa suggested that Chainlink will continue its path to the $30 barrier if the flagship cryptocurrency continues its uptrend. He affirmed that if Bitcoin loses the $110,000 support, LINK will likely see another dip.

Meanwhile, market watcher CW asserted that Chainlink faces one more key area before rallying to $30. According to the post, if LINK breaks through the current sell wall, around the $26.25-$26.75 levels, it will continue its run toward the $30 resistance, where another selling wall is situated. As of this writing, Chainlink trades at $26.15, a 35% increase in the monthly timeframe.

50430718,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/what-happened-to-mags-500m-tokenization-deal-with-mantra,1755764277,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/50430718.jpeg,What Happened to MAG’s $500M Tokenization Deal with Mantra?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/what-happened-to-mags-500m-tokenization-deal-with-mantra,"In July 2024, MAG Group announced a $500 million tokenization pilot with blockchain platform Mantra , aiming to bring Dubai’s luxury real estate on-chain. The plan turned heads across both crypto and property markets, promising high-yield vaults targeting 8% APY, boosted by $OM token incentives, and a showpiece property — a $75 million Ritz-Carlton mansion — designed to symbolize the dawn of a new era. For months, Mantra rode a wave of publicity. Panels, interviews, and headlines framed the partnership as the start of “democratized” real estate investing. But as 2025 began, reality looked less dramatic. The vaults never materialized, the Ritz-Carlton remained off-chain, and updates grew fewer. By spring, the once-hyped project seemed stalled. Industry chatter pointed to hurdles: complex regulatory requirements, an overly retail-focused approach, and possible strategic friction with MAG itself. The pioneering announcement had given Mantra visibility, but visibility alone wasn’t enough to sustain momentum. This May, MAG surprised the market with a new declaration: the $500 million pilot had been replaced by a $10 billion mandate, this time powered by Mavryk Network and backed by Multibank . The same Ritz-Carlton mansion that once headlined Mantra’s deal was back — only now part of a vastly larger portfolio including landmark developments like The Ritz-Carlton Residences and Keturah Reserve. What began as a $500 million experiment is now a $10 billion transformation. In the words of MAG’s leadership, Mavryk is “the clear leader in real estate tokenization” and has been appointed as MAG’s exclusive blockchain partner in the GCC. While Mantra positioned itself with retail-style products and token rewards, Mavryk’s approach has been institutional from the start. Its purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain provides the compliance, scalability, and security needed for multi-billion-dollar transactions. Paired with Multibank’s upcoming RWA Exchange, Mavryk offers not just tokenization, but a functioning ecosystem for trading, lending, and borrowing against real estate assets. That kind of infrastructure appealed to MAG, which needed more than a marketing narrative — it needed a partner who could deliver. With $10 billion in assets moving on-chain , Mavryk and MAG now account for roughly half of the global RWA tokenization market. The leap from a $500 million pilot to a $10 billion commitment represents not just growth but confidence — a 20x increase in deal flow that signals institutional trust in Mavryk’s capabilities. This isn’t simply about flashy properties. It’s about liquidity, compliance, and investor access. Through MultiBank.io, assets will trade on a regulated platform, enabling capital markets to interact with tokenized real estate in ways that were promised but never realized under Mantra. Industry observers note that Mantra’s original deal was important in opening the conversation. It proved that developers like MAG were serious about blockchain adoption. But without execution, the vision remained theory. Mavryk’s arrival changes the equation. By taking over the same properties Mantra once promised to tokenize — and scaling that promise twentyfold — Mavryk is positioned to deliver where its predecessor could not. The baton has been passed, but the race is far from over. For investors, this moment marks the shift from “what if” to “what’s next.” With MAG and Multibank backing Mavryk, the $10 billion initiative could set a global benchmark for how real-world assets are brought to blockchain. The story of Mantra is not one of total failure, but of groundwork laid and lessons learned. The story of Mavryk is about execution — and about transforming those lessons into the largest real estate tokenization deal in history.

At a time when the sector is crowded with platforms promising yield and scalability, Mutuum Finance is delivering concrete solutions, streamlining lending, optimizing liquidity, and strengthening governance with tools built for the next wave of adoption. With momentum building across the ecosystem, these five standout features explain why MUTM is being recognized as one of the defining DeFi plays of 2025. Mutuum Finance token price at presale level 6 is $0.035. It will be 14.29% higher, at $0.04, when it hits presale level 7. The people joining at this point will earn a minimum of 400% returns when the token launches. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $14.7 million and more than 15450 investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale phase 6. Early adopters of the project are set to reap fast 500% returns as soon as the project launches. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Two-Tier DeFi Lending Structure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an innovative non-custodial decentralized DeFi protocol. The protocol supports Peer-to-Contract lending and Peer-to-Peer lending with efficiency and flexibility being the objective. Peer-to-Contract leverages the smart contract functionality to extend loans with minimal or no human involvement. Peer-to-Peer eliminates the intermediaries and has lenders and borrowers trade directly with each other. The model is very easy to manage risky assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up steam as its presale makes the news. It is currently in phase 6 at $0.035. It will also rise 14.29% to $0.04 in the next phase. Investor interest is increasing with the project having already raised over $14.7 million and already having over 15450 token holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching its new overcollateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. With a solid foundation that can survive the collapse of algorithmic designs, the stablecoin can continue to be stable and constant for a very long period of time. The project is also backed by a 95.0 trust score from Certik. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has newly launched its Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool value of $50,000 USDT.

A Strategic Vision for Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) developed its tokenomics model to facilitate sustainable value through efficient liquidity and security with anti-inflationary protection. Long-term token price appreciation is based on a controlled distribution process during the presale period combined with efficient management mechanisms. Deflation mechanisms activate in the long term to reduce network supply which generates scarcity resulting in greater price growth potential over the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $14.7 million with over 15,450 investors already on board. Stage 6 presale is live at $0.035, with Stage 7 set to increase by 14.29% to $0.04.

Whispers of impending Fed Rate Cuts have begun to echo across global markets, stirring excitement among investors. This isn’t just about the US economy; it’s a pivotal moment that could reshape capital flows worldwide. While many focus on traditional assets, a prominent financial institution, UBS, is turning its gaze towards a less conventional, yet potentially highly rewarding, arena: Emerging Market Currencies . They see not just a shift, but a significant window of Investment Opportunities . If you’re looking to understand where the smart money might be headed and how to position your portfolio, this deep dive into the potential of emerging market currencies amidst a changing monetary landscape is for you. Understanding the Allure of Emerging Market Currencies What exactly are Emerging Market Currencies , and why are they suddenly garnering so much attention? Simply put, these are the national currencies of developing economies, often characterized by rapid growth, evolving financial markets, and sometimes, higher volatility. Historically, investing in these currencies has been seen as a high-risk, high-reward proposition. However, the current global economic climate, particularly the anticipation of Fed Rate Cuts , is creating a uniquely favorable environment for them. Unlike the established, mature markets of developed nations, emerging economies frequently offer higher interest rates to attract foreign capital, a concept known as the ‘carry trade’. While this has always been a draw, the differential in yields between developed and emerging markets tends to widen significantly when developed market central banks, like the Federal Reserve, begin to ease monetary policy. This makes the yield offered by emerging market assets, including their currencies, even more attractive to global investors seeking higher returns than those available in their home markets. How Fed Rate Cuts Fuel Emerging Market Growth The relationship between Fed Rate Cuts and the performance of Emerging Market Currencies is a fundamental dynamic in global finance. When the U.S. Federal Reserve lowers its benchmark interest rates, it triggers a series of reactions that directly benefit emerging economies and their currencies. Let’s break down this powerful mechanism: Reduced Yield Differential: Lower U.S. interest rates diminish the attractiveness of holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets. Investors, always on the hunt for better returns, then look for higher-yielding alternatives. Emerging markets, with their typically higher interest rates, become prime candidates. Capital Inflows: As global capital seeks higher returns, money flows out of the U.S. and into emerging markets. This influx of foreign investment strengthens the demand for local currencies, leading to their appreciation. This is a direct boost to Emerging Market Currencies . Lower Borrowing Costs: Many emerging market governments and corporations borrow in U.S. dollars. When the Fed cuts rates, the cost of servicing this debt can decrease, easing financial burdens and freeing up resources for domestic investment and growth. Improved Risk Appetite: A dovish Fed often signals a more accommodative global monetary environment, which generally encourages investors to take on more risk. This increased risk appetite translates into greater willingness to invest in potentially higher-return, but also higher-risk, emerging market assets. Stimulus for Global Trade: Lower U.S. interest rates can weaken the dollar, making U.S. exports more competitive and imports more expensive. This can stimulate global trade, benefiting export-oriented emerging economies. These combined effects create a virtuous cycle where lower U.S. rates lead to stronger emerging market economies, which in turn support the appreciation of their currencies. This is precisely the scenario that UBS believes presents compelling Investment Opportunities . UBS Outlook: Identifying Key Investment Opportunities The UBS Outlook on emerging market currencies is notably optimistic, positioning them as a top pick for investors seeking growth in a post-Fed rate cut environment. Their analysis goes beyond general trends, pinpointing specific regions and characteristics that make certain currencies particularly appealing. UBS emphasizes a selective approach, focusing on economies with strong fundamentals, improving external balances, and credible policy frameworks. According to the UBS Outlook , the shift in global monetary policy is not just a temporary blip but a significant structural change that will favor carry strategies in emerging markets. They highlight that the interest rate differentials, which previously narrowed, are set to widen again, making the ‘carry’ (the profit from borrowing in a low-interest currency and investing in a high-interest one) more lucrative. This makes the current period ripe for identifying prime Investment Opportunities . While specific currency recommendations can shift, the general principles of the UBS Outlook include: Focus on High-Yielders with Sound Macro Policies: Currencies of countries that offer attractive interest rates but also demonstrate fiscal discipline and stable economic management. Commodity Exporters: Nations benefiting from stable or rising commodity prices, as these often underpin their economic health and currency strength. Diversification within EM: Spreading investments across different emerging regions (e.g., Latin America, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe) to mitigate idiosyncratic risks. The conviction from UBS stems from the belief that the current setup provides a unique entry point for long-term gains, moving beyond the short-term tactical trades that have dominated emerging market currency strategies in recent years. This strategic shift opens up a broader array of Investment Opportunities for discerning investors. The Benefits: Why Consider Emerging Market Currencies Now? For investors, the current landscape offers several compelling reasons to consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to Emerging Market Currencies , especially with the impending Fed Rate Cuts . These benefits extend beyond simple yield hunting and touch upon diversification and long-term growth potential. Here are the primary advantages: Benefit Category Description Higher Yield Potential Emerging market central banks often maintain higher interest rates to combat inflation or attract capital. As developed market rates fall, the yield differential (carry) becomes more pronounced, offering potentially higher returns on currency holdings. This is a core part of the Investment Opportunities narrative. Diversification Benefits Emerging Market Currencies often have a low correlation with developed market assets. Including them in a portfolio can help reduce overall portfolio volatility and enhance risk-adjusted returns, especially during periods of developed market uncertainty. Economic Growth Prospects Many emerging economies are experiencing robust economic growth, driven by favorable demographics, increasing consumption, and structural reforms. Strong economic fundamentals often translate into stronger currencies over the long term, offering capital appreciation. Undervaluation Potential Following periods of global risk aversion or dollar strength, many Emerging Market Currencies can become undervalued relative to their fundamental economic strength. A shift in sentiment, often triggered by Fed Rate Cuts , can lead to a significant revaluation. These benefits, combined with a supportive global monetary policy backdrop, create a compelling case for exploring these unique Investment Opportunities . Navigating the Risks: What Challenges Lie Ahead for Emerging Market Currencies? While the prospect of Fed Rate Cuts presents exciting Investment Opportunities in Emerging Market Currencies , it is crucial to approach this landscape with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. These markets, by their very nature, can be more volatile and susceptible to various shocks than their developed counterparts. A robust Forex Trading Strategy must account for these challenges. Key risks include: Political Instability: Emerging nations can be prone to political upheaval, sudden policy changes, or geopolitical tensions. Such events can trigger rapid and significant depreciation in their currencies. Economic Vulnerability: Many emerging economies are highly dependent on commodity exports, global trade, or external financing. Fluctuations in commodity prices, global economic slowdowns, or sudden capital outflows can severely impact their economic stability and currency value. Inflationary Pressures: While high interest rates are a draw, persistent high inflation can erode purchasing power and undermine currency stability. Central banks in these regions often face a delicate balancing act. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller or less developed emerging currency markets may have lower trading volumes, leading to wider bid-ask spreads and difficulty executing large trades without impacting prices. This can be a significant challenge for a comprehensive Forex Trading Strategy . External Debt: Countries with high levels of foreign currency-denominated debt can face increased vulnerability if their local currency depreciates sharply, making debt servicing more expensive. Policy Missteps: Unsound fiscal or monetary policies by local governments or central banks can quickly erode investor confidence and trigger capital flight. Mitigating these risks requires thorough research, continuous monitoring of macroeconomic and political developments, and a disciplined approach to risk management. It’s not about avoiding risk entirely, but about understanding and managing it effectively as part of your Forex Trading Strategy . Crafting a Robust Forex Trading Strategy for EM Currencies Successfully capitalizing on the Investment Opportunities presented by Emerging Market Currencies requires more than just identifying the right macro trends. It demands a well-thought-out and disciplined Forex Trading Strategy . Here’s how investors can approach this dynamic market: Thorough Research and Due Diligence: Before investing in any emerging market currency, delve deep into the country’s economic fundamentals. Look at GDP growth, inflation rates, current account balances, foreign exchange reserves, and government debt levels. Understand the political landscape and any upcoming elections or policy changes. The UBS Outlook emphasizes this fundamental analysis. Focus on Macro Trends and Central Bank Policy: Monitor global interest rate differentials, commodity prices (especially for commodity-exporting nations), and the overall sentiment towards risk. Keep a close eye on the rhetoric and actions of both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the central banks of the emerging economies you are considering. Risk Management is Paramount: Given the inherent volatility of Emerging Market Currencies , strict risk management is non-negotiable. Position Sizing: Allocate only a small percentage of your overall portfolio to these higher-risk assets. Stop-Loss Orders: Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if a trade moves against you unexpectedly. Diversification: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across several emerging market currencies and regions to spread risk. Consider Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While carry trades can be short-term, the broader theme of capital flows due to Fed Rate Cuts suggests a longer-term trend. Align your strategy with your investment horizon. Utilize Specialized Funds or ETFs: For retail investors, direct currency trading can be complex. Consider Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) or mutual funds that specialize in emerging market currencies or bonds. These vehicles offer diversification and professional management. Stay Informed: The geopolitical and economic landscape of emerging markets can change rapidly. Subscribe to reliable financial news, research from institutions like UBS, and economic calendars to stay updated. By integrating these elements into your Forex Trading Strategy , you can navigate the complexities of Emerging Market Currencies more effectively and potentially unlock significant returns. Promising Investment Opportunities: Which Currencies Are on UBS’s Radar? While the specific currencies highlighted in the UBS Outlook can fluctuate based on real-time market conditions, their general focus tends to be on economies exhibiting strong fundamentals, manageable inflation, and positive real interest rates. These are the countries poised to benefit most from capital inflows as Fed Rate Cuts become a reality. Generally, the Investment Opportunities often lie in regions such as: Latin America: Countries like Brazil and Mexico are frequently cited. Brazil, with its high interest rates and significant commodity exports, can offer attractive carry. Mexico benefits from its strong trade ties with the U.S. and often has relatively stable macroeconomic policies. Asia: Nations like India and Indonesia are often on the radar. India’s robust domestic demand and reform agenda, coupled with Indonesia’s commodity wealth and improving fiscal health, make their currencies appealing. Central and Eastern Europe (CEE): Countries such as Poland and Hungary, while sometimes facing geopolitical headwinds, can offer compelling yields, especially as they integrate further with the Eurozone economy. The key for UBS, and for any astute investor, is to look beyond just high nominal yields. The real Investment Opportunities are in currencies where the high yield is sustainable, supported by sound economic policies, and where there’s potential for currency appreciation as capital flows return. This involves a careful assessment of a country’s external balance sheet, its ability to manage inflation, and the credibility of its central bank. The anticipation of Fed Rate Cuts creates a fertile ground for these specific emerging market currencies to shine, potentially offering substantial returns for those who conduct their due diligence and employ a disciplined Forex Trading Strategy . Conclusion: Seizing the Moment in Emerging Market Currencies The landscape of global finance is continually evolving, and the impending Fed Rate Cuts are poised to be a significant catalyst for change. As UBS has astutely observed, this shift creates extraordinary Investment Opportunities , particularly within the realm of Emerging Market Currencies . The allure of higher yields, coupled with the potential for currency appreciation driven by capital inflows, presents a compelling narrative for investors seeking diversification and robust returns. However, while the potential rewards are substantial, the inherent risks of emerging markets demand a cautious and informed approach. A well-defined Forex Trading Strategy , grounded in thorough research, disciplined risk management, and continuous market monitoring, is essential for navigating this dynamic environment. By understanding the intricate relationship between global monetary policy and emerging market dynamics, investors can position themselves to potentially unlock the astounding profit potential that lies within these vibrant economies. The time to evaluate these opportunities is now. As the global economic tides turn, Emerging Market Currencies could very well become a cornerstone of successful investment portfolios in the coming years, offering a pathway to growth that extends beyond traditional assets.

Cardano wavers below $0.90 and XRP battles support near $3.00 amid market rotation. As they meander, analysts suggest that a different $0.09 token is quietly gaining the edge and could outpace both by 50x before 2026. In this evolving environment, long-term investors are increasingly considering projects with strong utility, active execution, and roadmap clarity. Whales and early-stage traders alike are watching one project that combines these traits and it’s rapidly rising in attention. Cardano: volatile resistance holds back ADA momentum Cardano remains pressured, trading around $0.88 after a 3% monthly drop. Despite price being close to the pivotal $0.90 resistance, analysts see a narrow window for gains toward $0.92 or $1.00 if momentum returns. This is bolstered by the fact that Cardano futures volume hit $6.96 billion , which is the highest level in 5 months. Analyst sentiment is divided, some still believe that ETF-related developments could lift Cardano if institutional capital flows in. But for now, the token lacks a clear breakout narrative. XRP: price bounces blunted by distribution and rotation XRP recently held support around $2.91, but failed to break back above the strong resistance near $3.30. Analysts warn that a failure could push XRP lower toward $2.60 or even $2.00. Experts have revealed that XRP looks ready to bounce. After perfectly timing the top, the XRP price now shows a buy signal . On-chain data also points to distribution occurring at key resistance ranges, signalling waning bullish conviction. Remittix: $0.0969 token poised to surge As Cardano and XRP struggle, this $0.0969 crypto, Remittix (RTX) , stands out. It’s not a meme token; it’s built to solve real payment friction. With a Q3 wallet reveal, audited infrastructure and whale-backed interest, RTX is gaining attention not for hype; but for delivery. In contrast to ADA’s stagnation and XRP’s distribution cycle, Remittix offers measurable milestones and a functioning utility platform. It attracts those scouting for a low gas fee crypto project, top crypto to buy now or a crypto with real utility. Remittix stands out with: Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Built for borderless payments with global reach Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch Boosting this appeal is an ongoing $250,000 giveaway and a recent first centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement which was triggered when Remittix reached the $20 million fundraising milestone.

Even for those deeply immersed in the fast-paced cryptocurrency space, understanding broader macroeconomic movements, particularly in the major currency pairs like the USD/JPY forecast , is crucial. Recently, Swiss banking giant UBS made headlines by revising its USD/JPY forecasts higher, a move that signals potential shifts in the global financial landscape. This development is not just a technical adjustment; it carries significant implications for traders, investors, and anyone monitoring the health of the global economy. What does this mean for the stability of traditional markets, and how might it indirectly influence the broader sentiment towards digital assets? Understanding the Latest USD/JPY Forecast from UBS UBS, a prominent player in global financial services, has issued a notable update on its projections for the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. This revision indicates a stronger outlook for the US Dollar relative to the Yen, a shift that warrants close attention from market participants. While specific figures are proprietary to UBS’s research, the essence of their adjustment points towards an expectation of the pair trading at higher levels than previously anticipated over the coming months and quarters. This upward revision reflects a deep dive into fundamental economic indicators and policy trajectories of both the United States and Japan. Such a forecast adjustment by a major institution like UBS is significant because it often signals a consensus forming among large financial entities regarding future currency movements. It’s not merely a prediction; it’s an informed perspective based on extensive research and analysis of: Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between interest rates in the US and Japan. Economic Growth Projections: Expected performance of both economies. Monetary Policy Stances: The future direction of central bank policies (Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan). Global Risk Sentiment: How global events influence safe-haven demand for currencies. For traders, understanding the rationale behind these revised forecasts is as important as the numbers themselves. It provides a framework for evaluating potential opportunities and risks in the forex market. What Drives the Shift in Japanese Yen Outlook ? The Japanese Yen has long been a subject of intense market scrutiny, often acting as a barometer for global risk appetite and the effectiveness of the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) monetary policy. UBS’s revised outlook for the Yen likely stems from several interconnected factors that are currently shaping Japan’s economic trajectory and its currency’s valuation: Monetary Policy Divergence Perhaps the most dominant factor influencing the Yen’s strength or weakness is the stark divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan and other major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve. While the Fed has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation, the BoJ has largely maintained its ultra-loose monetary policy, including negative interest rates and yield curve control. This creates a significant interest rate differential, making the US Dollar more attractive for carry trades, where investors borrow in a low-interest currency (JPY) and invest in a high-interest currency (USD). Inflation Dynamics Japan has historically struggled with deflation. While inflation has recently picked up, it remains relatively modest compared to Western economies. The BoJ has been cautious about tightening policy prematurely, fearing a return to deflationary pressures. If Japanese inflation remains subdued while global inflation persists, the pressure on the Yen to weaken will continue. Economic Growth and Trade Balance Japan’s economic growth, while stable, has not been robust enough to consistently support a stronger Yen. Furthermore, changes in Japan’s trade balance, influenced by global commodity prices and demand for Japanese exports, can also impact the currency. A deteriorating trade balance, for instance, can put downward pressure on the Yen. Global Risk Sentiment The Yen traditionally functions as a “safe-haven” currency during times of global economic uncertainty. However, this status has been challenged by the persistent monetary policy divergence. If global risk sentiment improves, and investors seek higher yields elsewhere, the Yen’s safe-haven appeal might diminish, leading to further weakness. These factors, in combination, paint a complex picture for the Japanese Yen outlook . UBS’s analysis likely weighs these elements heavily, concluding that the prevailing conditions favor a weaker Yen against the Dollar for the foreseeable future. Navigating the Forex Market Analysis : Implications for Traders The implications of UBS’s higher USD/JPY forecasts are multifaceted for participants in the forex market. For those engaged in currency trading, this outlook can inform their strategic decisions, prompting adjustments to existing positions or the initiation of new ones. Here’s how traders might interpret and react to this significant piece of forex market analysis : Potential for Long USD/JPY Positions If UBS’s forecast proves accurate, traders might consider taking long positions on USD/JPY, meaning buying the US Dollar and selling the Japanese Yen. This strategy aims to profit from the expected appreciation of the Dollar against the Yen. The carry trade component, benefiting from the interest rate differential, could also become more attractive, assuming the spread remains favorable. Risk Management is Paramount Even with a strong forecast, the forex market is inherently volatile. Traders must employ robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and taking profit targets to secure gains. Unexpected shifts in central bank rhetoric, geopolitical events, or sudden changes in global economic data can quickly reverse trends. Monitoring Key Economic Data Traders will need to closely monitor economic releases from both the US and Japan. Key data points include inflation reports, GDP figures, employment data, and central bank meeting minutes. These releases can provide further confirmation or challenge to the prevailing forecast, necessitating agile adjustments to trading strategies. Technical vs. Fundamental Analysis While UBS’s forecast is a fundamental piece of information, successful traders often combine it with technical analysis. Identifying key support and resistance levels, trend lines, and chart patterns can help in timing entries and exits, optimizing the potential returns from the forecasted movement. Key USD/JPY Forecast Revisions (Hypothetical Example) To illustrate the kind of revisions institutions like UBS might make, consider the following hypothetical table: Period Previous Forecast (USD/JPY) Revised Forecast (USD/JPY) Implied Change Q3 2023 142.00 145.50 +3.50 Yen Q4 2023 140.50 147.00 +6.50 Yen Mid 2024 138.00 148.50 +10.50 Yen (Note: These figures are illustrative and do not represent actual UBS forecasts.) Such revisions indicate a significant shift in the expected trading range, providing a clearer target for strategic positioning. Developing Effective Currency Trading Strategies Amidst Volatility In a market influenced by evolving forecasts and dynamic economic conditions, developing robust currency trading strategies is paramount. The UBS forecast for USD/JPY serves as a strong directional signal, but how can traders translate this into actionable plans? Here are several strategic considerations: The Carry Trade Opportunity Given the persistent interest rate differential, the carry trade remains a compelling strategy for USD/JPY. This involves borrowing in the low-yielding Japanese Yen and investing in the higher-yielding US Dollar. As long as the interest rate gap remains wide or widens further, and the Yen continues to weaken, this strategy can yield significant returns from both interest accrual and currency appreciation. However, be mindful of potential reversals if the interest rate differential narrows unexpectedly. Trend Following If the UBS forecast is accurate, USD/JPY is likely to exhibit an upward trend. Trend-following strategies, which involve identifying and riding existing market trends, could be highly effective. This might include using moving averages, MACD, or other trend indicators to confirm the upward momentum and identify entry and exit points. Patience and discipline are key to this approach. Hedging Against Yen Weakness For businesses or investors with significant exposure to the Japanese Yen (e.g., Japanese exporters, foreign companies with JPY-denominated assets), a weakening Yen could impact their profitability or asset value. In such cases, taking a long USD/JPY position could serve as a hedge, offsetting potential losses from Yen depreciation. This is a crucial risk management tool. Scalping and Day Trading Even within a broader trend, intraday volatility in USD/JPY can present opportunities for scalpers and day traders. These short-term strategies focus on capturing small price movements throughout the trading day. While not directly reliant on long-term forecasts, understanding the underlying directional bias (like UBS’s forecast) can provide a contextual edge for short-term decision-making. Diversification and Portfolio Approach Relying solely on one currency pair or one strategy can be risky. Diversifying across different currency pairs and employing a mix of strategies can help mitigate risk. Consider how the USD/JPY forecast might influence other correlated pairs or asset classes, and adjust your overall portfolio accordingly. For crypto traders, this means understanding how traditional forex volatility might impact stablecoin pegs or the broader sentiment in digital asset markets. Ultimately, successful currency trading strategies blend fundamental insights (like UBS’s forecast) with technical analysis, rigorous risk management, and adaptability to changing market conditions. Connecting to Broader Global Economic Trends The UBS USD/JPY forecast is not an isolated event; it is deeply intertwined with broader global economic trends . Understanding these connections is vital for a holistic view of the financial landscape and how traditional markets influence, and are influenced by, the burgeoning digital asset space. US Federal Reserve Policy The direction of the US Dollar, and consequently USD/JPY, is heavily dependent on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. If the Fed continues to maintain a hawkish stance or even signals further rate hikes to combat inflation, the Dollar will likely remain strong. Conversely, any indication of a dovish pivot by the Fed could weaken the Dollar and temper the USD/JPY’s upward trajectory. Global Inflation and Growth Persistent global inflation, particularly in major economies, puts pressure on central banks to tighten monetary policy. This can lead to capital flows towards countries offering higher yields, strengthening their currencies. Conversely, concerns about a global economic slowdown or recession might lead to a flight to safety, though the Yen’s safe-haven status has been somewhat diminished by its low-yield environment. Geopolitical Developments Geopolitical tensions, such as conflicts, trade disputes, or political instability, can significantly impact currency markets. These events can trigger risk-off sentiment, affecting safe-haven demand, or disrupt supply chains, influencing inflation and economic growth. The USD/JPY pair, given its role in global finance, is highly susceptible to such external shocks. Commodity Prices Japan is a major importer of energy and raw materials. Fluctuations in global commodity prices, especially oil, can have a substantial impact on Japan’s trade balance and, by extension, the Yen’s value. Higher commodity prices typically weigh on the Yen, as Japan needs to pay more for imports. Impact on Crypto Markets While seemingly distant, strong trends in major forex pairs like USD/JPY can indirectly affect cryptocurrency markets. A strong US Dollar, for instance, can sometimes put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as investors might prefer traditional, less volatile investments. Conversely, a stable or weakening Dollar could create a more favorable environment for crypto. Moreover, the stability of fiat currencies underpins stablecoins, making forex stability a foundational element for a significant part of the crypto ecosystem. The UBS forecast, therefore, is a lens through which to view these interconnected global forces. It highlights the ongoing tug-of-war between inflationary pressures, central bank responses, and underlying economic performance, all of which shape the value of currencies and the broader financial landscape. Conclusion: What This Means for Your Financial Future UBS’s decision to raise its USD/JPY forecasts is a significant signal in the global financial markets. It underscores the persistent divergence in monetary policies between the US and Japan, driven by differing inflation dynamics and economic outlooks. For traders and investors, this forecast provides a powerful directional bias, suggesting that the US Dollar is likely to strengthen further against the Japanese Yen. While opportunities for profitable currency trading strategies abound, it is crucial to approach the market with a well-defined risk management plan, staying informed about evolving global economic trends , and continually refining your forex market analysis . The interconnectedness of financial markets means that shifts in major currency pairs like USD/JPY can have ripple effects, even reaching the cryptocurrency space. Understanding these fundamental movements equips you with a broader perspective, allowing for more informed decisions across your entire investment portfolio. As the financial world continues to evolve, staying abreast of expert forecasts and the underlying economic narratives is key to navigating its complexities successfully.

He named the token Yeezy Money ($YZY) while calling it “A new economy, built on chain.” However, YZY price saw a sharp uptick to breach $3 before collapsing down to the $1 zone. The move comes just months after the rapper dismissed memecoins as fan exploitation. It pushes him directly into the same cultural-crypto space now being defined by Donald Trump and a wave of celebrity-backed coins. Insider wallet flips $450K into $1.5M The hype was immediate as YZY briefly surged to a $3 billion market cap within minutes of going live, before sliding back to around $1.5 billion. The token’s trading address was listed on Solana’s Meteora platform, and Kanye West’s team said it deployed 25 contract addresses to fight bot sniping. Yeezy Money’s official website describes it as a broader “ecosystem.” It comes with YZY token, a payment processor called Ye Pay designed to cut merchant fees, and a YZY Card that allows spending in both crypto and fiat. The site mentioned that “YZY Money is a concept to put you in control, free from centralized authority.” The website tried to highlight YZY’s on-chain transparency. It added that 20% of tokens are allocated to public sale, another 20% to liquidity, while 30% sits with Yeezy Investments LLC under a vesting schedule. Additional tranches will unlock over 24 months, as this needs to be done to avoid a sudden flood of supply. Insider wallets trading YZY, Source: LookOnChain . It looks like YZY would end in a quick rug pull like other celebrity coins have. Blockchain tracker Lookonchain flagged several insider wallets that appeared to buy YZY ahead of the public. One wallet, labeled 6MNWV8, spent more than $450,000 USDC for early tokens and flipped them for more than $1.5 million in profit within hours. It bought 1.29 million YZY at $0.35 and sold 1.04 million YZY for $1.39 million. Arthur Hayes regrets trading Kanye’s YZY Taking a trade on YZY, Arthur Hayes in a post stated, “Pls don’t rug me Kanye West !!! $YZY for the win … cause bull market.” A few hours later, he wrote, “Oopsie … fam next time pls don’t let me trade shitters like $YZY. Should have just kept two-steppin.” YZY price is down by 54% from the launch, trading at an average price of $1.18 at the press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by a massive 35,000% to stand around $935 million. Oopsie … fam next time pls don’t let me trade shitters like $YZY . Should have just kept two-steppin. pic.twitter.com/6oiKLNv9Mo — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) August 21, 2025 In February, Ye was dismissing memecoins as scams that “prey on the fans with hype.” He also claimed he was approached with a $2 million offer to promote a fake Ye-branded token. Meanwhile, he now joined the ranks of celebrities like Iggy Azalea and Caitlyn Jenner in the crypto world. With this, Solana has built a reputation as the home of viral tokens like BONK and dog-themed WIF. Now, Ye’s entry could mark another cultural moment. SOL price jumped by more than 2% over the last 24 hours. Solana is trading at an average price of $186.11 at the press time.

With analysts forecasting a possible 1,200% rally for BlockSack (BSACK) after launch, both tokens are riding a wave of renewed investor optimism. BlockSack (BSACK) Presale Momentum Signals Post-Launch Upside BlockSack (BSACK) is carving a niche by combining meme coin branding with scalable tokenomics designed for long-term growth. Presale data indicates strong buying activity, with early tranches selling out quickly and attracting speculative capital looking for outsized gains. The 1,200% rally forecast is based on historical patterns of high-demand presale projects and the growing appetite for low-cap meme entries post major exchange listings. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Breakout on Community Strength Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most recognized names in the meme coin sector, with its ShibArmy community playing a pivotal role in maintaining momentum. Current technical analysis shows SHIB consolidating near key resistance, with a breakout potentially unlocking the path to its $0.00002 target. This bullish outlook is supported by ongoing token burns and governance upgrades, though the climb will require sustained buying pressure and community engagement. Why the Market Is Watching Both SHIB and BSACK While SHIB’s price action is tied to established market cycles, BSACK’s presale status gives it a different growth trajectory. Investors are splitting strategies — SHIB for the potential of a large-cap breakout backed by deep liquidity, and BlockSack (BSACK) for an early-stage surge that could multiply initial positions. Both benefit from the broader meme coin narrative that continues to pull speculative capital from the sidelines. Conclusion – Two Different Paths, One Bullish Meme Narrative Shiba Inu (SHIB) and BlockSack (BSACK) represent two ends of the meme coin spectrum: SHIB as a veteran token aiming for a significant price milestone, and BSACK as a high-upside presale contender with triple-digit growth potential. With analysts projecting a strong quarter ahead for meme coins, these projects offer compelling opportunities for traders positioning ahead of the next market wave.

Shiba Inu, a long-time favorite in the meme coin community, is now ambitiously aiming for a price target of $0.00002, inspired by its strong community and market presence. Concurrently, the new contender, BlockSack, is gearing up for a striking debut, with forecasts suggesting a massive rally of up to 1,200%. Let's delve into the factors driving these cryptocurrencies and why they stand out in the bustling market. The Rise of BlockSack: A New Star in the Crypto Sky BlockSack is rapidly establishing itself as a major player even before its official launch. The presale phase has shown impressive traction, with investors eagerly acquiring BSACK tokens . This keen interest is largely due to its innovative approach that merges meme-friendly appeal with robust tokenomics, promising long-term viability beyond mere speculative trading. Investors and enthusiasts eagerly anticipate its market introduction, eyeing substantial returns. Shiba Inu: More Than Just a Meme Coin Shiba Inu has transcended its initial status as a fun, meme-driven asset to establish itself as a cryptocurrency with potential strategic value. The ShibArmy, its dedicated community, has been pivotal in driving its value through various initiatives, including token burns and participation in governance protocols. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to achieve the ambitious price target that could redefine its market standing. Market Dynamics: Shiba Inu and BlockSack While Shiba Inu benefits from an established presence and deep market penetration, BlockSack represents the vibrant potential of new entries in the cryptocurrency sphere. The contrast between SHIB’s established market cycle and BSACK's entry-phase dynamism presents a unique spectrum of opportunities for investors. The dual appeal lies in SHIB's potential breakout and BSACK's high-growth prospects post-launch. Conclusion: A Promising Horizon for Meme Coins The ongoing narrative around Shiba Inu and BlockSack highlights the broader trend in the meme coin sector, which continues to captivate investors seeking both fun and profit in the crypto markets. Whether it's the veteran SHIB aiming for a new price milestone or the emerging BSACK set for explosive growth, the sector offers diverse strategies for different investment appetites.

As the cryptocurrency market continues its fascinating dance, traditional financial indicators like currency movements often provide crucial context. Recently, the US Dollar has shown a noticeable drift higher, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. This movement isn’t isolated; it’s intricately linked to anticipation surrounding major economic events, particularly the upcoming Jackson Hole Symposium. For those navigating the volatile crypto landscape, understanding these macro shifts is paramount, as they frequently influence broader market liquidity and investor sentiment. Understanding the US Dollar ‘s Ascent Why is the US Dollar strengthening? Several factors contribute to its current trajectory. Primarily, the market is bracing for signals from the Federal Reserve, especially concerning interest rate policy. In times of global economic uncertainty, the dollar often acts as a safe-haven asset, attracting capital from various corners of the world. This demand naturally pushes its value higher. Safe-Haven Appeal: Global economic slowdown fears or geopolitical tensions often lead investors to seek the relative safety of the US Dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: Expectations of higher interest rates in the U.S. compared to other major economies make dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Economic Data: Stronger-than-expected economic data out of the U.S., even if mixed, can bolster confidence in the American economy, supporting the dollar. The dollar’s performance is a key barometer for global trade and investment flows, directly impacting everything from commodity prices to corporate earnings. For crypto enthusiasts, a stronger dollar can sometimes imply tighter liquidity in broader markets, which may have indirect effects on digital asset valuations. The Anticipation Around Jackson Hole The annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is not just another conference; it’s a pivotal event on the global economic calendar. Hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, it brings together central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world. Why is it so important? Historically, significant policy shifts or forward guidance from the Federal Reserve Chair have been unveiled at Jackson Hole. Markets hang on every word, searching for clues about the future path of monetary policy, particularly interest rates and quantitative easing or tightening. This year, the focus is squarely on: Inflation Outlook: How central banks view the persistence of inflation and their commitment to bringing it down. Economic Growth Projections: Insights into global and domestic economic health, and potential recession risks. Future Monetary Policy: Any hints about rate hikes, pauses, or even cuts, and the broader strategy for managing economic stability. The dollar’s recent movements are a direct reflection of this heightened anticipation. Traders are positioning themselves based on what they expect to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, knowing that even subtle shifts in rhetoric can trigger significant market reactions. Euro’s Resilience: The Boost from Euro PMI s While the dollar has been on an upward drift, the Euro has shown surprising resilience, particularly against the backdrop of recent economic data. This strength can largely be attributed to the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) readings from the Eurozone. PMI data provides a snapshot of economic health across manufacturing and services sectors. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 suggests contraction. Recent Euro PMI figures, especially those for the services sector, have often come in stronger than anticipated, offering a glimmer of hope for the Eurozone economy. This positive data has: Boosted Confidence: Improved PMI numbers suggest that the Eurozone economy might be more robust than previously feared, alleviating some recession concerns. Supported ECB Policy: Stronger data gives the European Central Bank (ECB) more room to maintain its hawkish stance on interest rates, further supporting the Euro. Attracted Investment: Positive economic indicators can draw foreign investment into Eurozone assets, increasing demand for the currency. However, it’s crucial to note that the Eurozone faces its own set of challenges, including energy price volatility and geopolitical tensions. The PMIs offer a current snapshot, but the longer-term outlook remains complex. Navigating the Global Forex Market The interplay between the US Dollar , the Euro, and other major currencies defines the global Forex Market . This market, the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, is a constant reflection of macroeconomic trends, geopolitical events, and Central Bank Policy decisions. For investors, understanding its dynamics is key to anticipating broader financial movements. Key dynamics in the Forex market include: Factor Impact on Currencies Current Trend Interest Rate Differentials Higher rates attract capital, strengthening currency. USD benefiting from perceived higher future rates. Economic Data Releases Strong data boosts confidence, weak data weakens. Mixed global data, Euro PMIs offering support. Geopolitical Events Uncertainty drives safe-haven flows. USD often gains during global unrest. Central Bank Commentary Forward guidance shapes market expectations. Jackson Hole critical for Fed’s outlook. Volatility in the Forex market can spill over into other asset classes, including equities and cryptocurrencies. For instance, a significantly stronger dollar can make dollar-denominated assets more expensive for international investors, potentially impacting demand across various markets. The Influence of Central Bank Policy At the heart of currency movements lies Central Bank Policy . Institutions like the Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of England (BoE) wield immense power through their decisions on interest rates, quantitative easing/tightening, and forward guidance. Their primary mandates often revolve around price stability (controlling inflation) and maximizing employment. How do their policies impact currencies? Interest Rates: Raising interest rates generally makes a currency more attractive by offering higher returns on deposits and bonds, thus increasing demand. Conversely, rate cuts can weaken a currency. Quantitative Easing/Tightening: QE involves injecting liquidity into the financial system, which can dilute a currency’s value. QT, or balance sheet reduction, removes liquidity, potentially strengthening the currency. Forward Guidance: Central banks communicate their future policy intentions. Clear, consistent guidance can reduce market uncertainty, while ambiguous signals can increase volatility. The upcoming Jackson Hole symposium is a prime example of how central bank communication directly influences market expectations and currency valuations. The subtle nuances in a central banker’s speech can trigger millions of dollars in trades, highlighting the profound impact of their policy decisions on the global financial landscape. Actionable Insights for Investors In this dynamic environment, what can investors do to navigate the shifts in the Forex Market and beyond? Stay Informed on Central Bank Commentary: Pay close attention to speeches, minutes, and press conferences from the Fed, ECB, and other major central banks. These are primary drivers of currency movements. Monitor Key Economic Indicators: GDP growth, inflation rates, employment data, and PMI readings offer crucial insights into economic health and potential policy responses. Diversify Portfolios: Given the interconnectedness of global markets, diversification across different asset classes and geographies can help mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations. Understand Correlations: Recognize how currency movements might correlate with other investments, such as commodities (e.g., oil often inversely correlated with the dollar) or even specific crypto assets. Risk Management: Utilize stop-loss orders and position sizing to manage exposure to volatile currency pairs. For crypto investors, understanding the broader macro environment, particularly the strength of the US Dollar , can provide valuable context for digital asset performance. A period of dollar strength might sometimes coincide with reduced risk appetite in broader markets, influencing flows into more speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A Tense Balance in Global Finance The global financial markets are currently walking a tightrope, balancing inflation concerns with recession fears. The US Dollar ‘s uptick ahead of Jackson Hole underscores the market’s reliance on clear signals from the Federal Reserve regarding future monetary policy. Simultaneously, the Euro’s resilience, bolstered by positive Euro PMI s, highlights the nuanced economic picture emerging from different regions. The decisions made by central banks, particularly those outlined at key events like Jackson Hole, will continue to be the primary drivers of currency valuations and, by extension, influence the broader investment climate. For participants in the Forex Market and beyond, staying attuned to these shifts in Central Bank Policy is not just recommended, but essential for informed decision-making in an increasingly interconnected world.

Its presale has successfully raised over $14,700,000, attracting 15,450 token holders. Currently operating in Phase 6, MUTM tokens are priced at $0.035. This represents a substantial 250% increase from the opening phase price of $0.01. Phase 6 is progressing rapidly towards completion. Consequently, the opportunity to purchase tokens at this level is diminishing quickly. Following this phase, Phase 7 will commence. It will feature a 14.3% price rise, setting the token cost at $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is scheduled for launch at $0.06. Therefore, investors buying now potentially secure significant returns exceeding 300% upon the token’s market debut. This trajectory prompts analysis: can MUTM emulate historical crypto surges and reach $9.50 by 2029? Examining patterns provides insight. MUTM price prediction and historical parallels Analysts are projecting a Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price of $9.50 by 2029. The prediction depends on a number of basic factors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a dual-lending platform with a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocol. This framework creates a stable demand for tokens by lending and staking rewards. Moreover, it is combined with the effective Layer-2 technology that significantly lowers the cost of transactions. This enhancement significantly boosts accessibility and potential user adoption. Crucially, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens. Scarcity often influences long-term crypto prices positively, especially with growing utility. Moreover, historical precedent supports ambitious projections. Chainlink (LINK) exemplifies this potential vividly. LINK traded near $0.40 during early 2020 market conditions. Subsequently, it experienced a monumental surge. By May 2021, LINK achieved an all-time high exceeding $53. This represented a staggering return exceeding 12,000% within approximately 18 months. LINK’s ascent was fueled by tangible adoption within decentralized oracle networks, not mere speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) possesses similar foundational utility within decentralized lending. Its planned revenue generation and token buybacks could replicate LINK’s demand-driven growth pattern, albeit over a longer timeframe, aiming for 2029. The $9.50 target reflects this measured, utility-backed expansion potential. Robust security underpins Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Security remains paramount for any crypto investment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers exceptional assurance here. The project has successfully concluded a comprehensive audit by CertiK, a premier blockchain security firm. This rigorous assessment yielded an impressive 95.00 security score. Completing this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is allocated for this initiative. Rewards are categorized into four distinct tiers: Critical, Major, Minor, and Low. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced a new dashboard feature. It prominently displays a leaderboard ranking the project’s top 50 token holders. Participants maintaining their positions within this elite group will receive bonus token rewards, fostering long-term holding. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) community incentives Engagement within the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem is actively encouraged. The project is currently running its largest giveaway event. A total prize pool of $100,000 in MUTM tokens is available, distributed equally among ten fortunate winners. Each victor will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Participation involves straightforward steps. This initiative significantly boosts community excitement and participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale opportunity nears end Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a tangible opportunity within the current crypto market. Its presale progress, highlighted by raising $14,700,000 and attracting 15,450 holders, demonstrates strong early interest. The project combines innovative DeFi utility with proven Layer-2 efficiency and exceptional security credentials. Historical patterns, exemplified by Chainlink’s remarkable ascent, illustrate the potential for tokens to solve real problems.

These 3 altcoins could outpace BTC,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/21/bitcoin-price-to-120k-these-3-altcoins-could-outpace-btc/,"As Bitcoin prices surge toward a potential $120K, attention is shifting to altcoins that may outpace BTC in the next market cycle. Remittix , with its innovative PayFi technology, is leading the charge. Designed to simplify the operation of cross-border payments and to bridge the gap between crypto and fiats, Remittix is gaining traction. This altcoin could be poised for explosive growth in 2025. BTC price surge expected to reach $120K in 2025 Bitcoin price has had a solid run in recent times. As such, analysts expect it will reach $120K in the next one year and between $150K and $200K in the next seven years. The key market drivers of this growth include institutional adoption, Bitcoin ETFs and growing global interest. As Bitcoin price bullishly develops, investors are awaiting huge rewards as digital assets take center stage. BTC’s continued dominance in 2025, coupled with expanding use cases, suggests a long-term, stable uptrend for the coin. Chainlink price prediction shows strong rebound potential Chainlink (LINK) is positioning itself as a strong contender in the crypto market, with its recent performance showing promising signs of a continued rebound. LINK price is currently selling at $24.58 after rebounding off of recent lows and getting the attention from momentum traders. The key resistance zone between $29 and $34 remains critical for a breakout. If LINK can sustain a move above this range, analysts predict a significant upward surge. Chainlink’s utility as the leading decentralized oracle for smart contracts gives it solid fundamentals, boosting investor confidence in its potential for further growth. Analysts see $10 target for Cardano despite short-term pullback Cardano (ADA) has shown impressive growth, surging over 20% this week despite facing resistance at the $1.00 mark. After a recent correction, concerns have emerged over a potential deeper pullback. However, analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential. With a $10 price target still in play, Cardano’s recovery potential is drawing significant attention. Investors are closely watching key support levels as the next breakout above $1.00 could signal further upside. Remittix revolutionises cross-border payments for the unbanked Remittix is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects of 2025, positioning itself to revolutionise the cross-border payments space. Unlike the speculative meme coins dominating the headlines, Remittix is focused on real-world utility.

In its presale, Remittix has raised over $20.6 million with over 612 million tokens sold at $0.0969 each. Analysts see huge growth potential, predicting that Remittix could deliver up to 10x returns as adoption increases. While Bitcoin attracts institutional investors, Remittix is carving its niche in the payments industry, addressing critical financial bottlenecks for millions of underserved people. Over $20,6M raised in presale with 612 million tokens sold. The PayFi model connects crypto to fiat in under 24 hours. Global accessibility, reducing fees and eliminating delays.

50434493,https://invezz.com/?p=2845773,1755769298,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,SOL and AVAX face resistance while RTX keeps hitting new presale milestones,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/21/sol-and-avax-face-resistance-while-rtx-keeps-hitting-new-presale-milestones/,"Solana and Avalanche (AVAX) are drawing attention as traders eye potential breakouts in the L1 sector. Solana price hovers around $183 amid institutional inflows surpassing $1 billion in 2025, while AVAX continues testing key resistance zones near $27. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is quietly outperforming expectations, hitting over $20 million raised and 612 million tokens sold, driven by its functional utility and upcoming Q3 wallet launch. Investors are increasingly recognizing the difference between speculative tokens and crypto with real-world adoption. Solana price performance and institutional flows Solana price has maintained resilience despite market pullbacks, moving from $175 to $180 over the past week. Institutional capital has been flowing in strongly, with Solana-based products recording $176.5 million in weekly inflows, bringing the year-to-date total over $1 billion. The ecosystem also continues to see operational expansion: Solana achieved 100,000 transactions per second in stress tests, proving its scalability. DeFi activity is strong, with DEX volumes up 31% week-on-week and $1.25 billion in USDC minted recently. Regulatory uncertainties remain, however, with the SEC postponing decisions on Solana ETF proposals, keeping investors cautious. Avalanche price shows breakout potential AVAX is trading around $23.51, pressing the $25–$26 resistance zone for the eighth time. On-chain activity has surged, with daily transactions climbing from 500,000 to over 1.3 million. This increase in usage aligns with renewed community cohesion, signaling potential for strong momentum. Technically, AVAX is forming higher lows, creating an explosive setup. Analysts suggest a successful breakout above $27 could unlock rapid gains toward $35–$44. While the $25–$27 zone remains a critical pivot, the longer-term compression pattern points to strengthening buyer conviction and potential trend reversal. Why Remittix remains a market standout While SOL and AVAX battle resistance, Remittix is delivering tangible milestones. RTX is currently priced at $0.0969, with over 612 million tokens sold and $20 million+ raised. Its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart enhances liquidity and visibility for global traders. The Q3 2025 beta wallet allows sending crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Key highlights include: Global Payouts: Cross-border transfers in seconds Real-World Utility: Practical use for freelancers, remitters, and businesses Security and Transparency: Audited by CertiK. Remittix’s roadmap, strong fundraising and adoption-focused design make it one of the most promising DeFi projects of 2025. The wallet’s real-time FX conversion and business API further solidify its position as a utility-first altcoin. Comparative outlook and market implications Solana price is likely to remain sensitive to Bitcoin movements and ETF-related news, while AVAX approaches a make-or-break resistance zone. Remittix , however, offers growth backed by infrastructure, adoption and functional utility rather than speculative hype. Investors seeking a blend of potential upside and real-world applicability may find RTX an attractive addition to their portfolio, complementing exposure to established L1s like SOL and AVAX.

Among them, meme-driven coins continue to capture attention for their creative ecosystems. Shiba Inu, SPX6900, and Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) stand out as three names with strong communities and unique features built on Ethereum. While their designs differ, each offers insights into how meme culture and blockchain can merge. For those exploring crypto coins , these projects highlight the intersection of culture, decentralization, and financial systems. Pepe Dollar Presale Gains Traction in Meme Economy Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) is positioning itself as one of the top crypto presales in today’s market. The project raised over $1.5 million during Stage 2 of its presale, with the token priced at $0.006495 against a launch price of $0.03695. This structured approach provides transparency for investors looking to buy presale crypto within the Ethereum ecosystem. What sets Pepe Dollar apart is its combination of meme culture with decentralized finance tools. The project integrates DeFi, GameFi, and PayFi into a single framework, aiming to create an ecosystem where meme-powered transactions hold real value. PayFi plays a central role by bridging decentralized finance with real-world payments, offering practical usage alongside cultural relevance. A major feature is its Federal Burn allocation. Twenty-nine percent of the supply will be permanently burnt to promote scarcity, decentralization, and reduced manipulation. Any unsold tokens from the pre-sale cryptocurrency will also join the burn wallet. The Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) smart contract has already been audited and verified by blockchain security firms, establishing its credibility in the crypto presale projects space. As a new crypto token presale, it blends internet culture with long-term structural design. Pepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/ Pepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity PEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Pressure Amid Declines Shiba Inu has experienced notable market weakness in recent days. The token declined by 6% over two days, sliding to $0.000012 as Ethereum ETFs faced sell-offs worth $255 million. Burn activity within the SHIB ecosystem has also slowed dramatically. With only 223,914 tokens destroyed, the burn rate collapsed by 98.89%, signaling reduced engagement across the network. From a technical perspective, SHIB trades below its 20-day moving average. This places it near critical support levels and highlights ongoing bearish momentum. For holders, SHIB’s trajectory reflects both external market pressures and decreased network participation. SPX6900 Emerges With Strong Community Support SPX6900 is rapidly becoming a recognized name in the meme coin sector. Known for its distinct branding and playful theme, it has generated considerable traction across social channels and Web3 forums. What makes SPX6900 noteworthy is its vibrant community participation. It is not only fueled by clever marketing but also by genuine engagement from holders who see it as more than just a meme. This foundation has helped SPX6900 sustain attention in a crowded market of crypto presales and new projects. With rising mentions in the crypto presale list, SPX6900 demonstrates how a strong narrative and active base can support momentum even without complex financial tools. Final Thoughts: Pepe Dollar, Presales, and Meme Utility The Ethereum network continues to be home to both experimental and culturally significant projects. Shiba Inu shows how meme coins can rise and face challenges, while SPX6900 highlights the strength of community-driven tokens. Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) adds another layer by blending internet culture with decentralized financial infrastructure. Its presale stage and audited smart contract position it as part of the top crypto presales available today. For those exploring presale crypto coins, these projects illustrate the ongoing role of meme culture in shaping blockchain adoption. PepeDollar, SHIB, and SPX6900 reflect how culture, scarcity, and engagement come together in modern cryptocurrency presales.

Key Takeaways: Asian family offices are pouring capital into crypto, with NextGen raising over $100M in months. UBS says Chinese family offices plan to lift crypto exposure to 5% of portfolios. Wealth managers report a shift from small allocations to advanced strategies like arbitrage. Jason Huang, founder of Singapore-based NextGen Digital Venture, said his firm raised more than $100 million in just a few months for its new long-short crypto equity vehicle, the Next Generation Fund II. “Our investors — mainly family offices and internet or fintech entrepreneurs — recognize the growing role of digital assets in diversified portfolios,” Huang said. His first fund, wound down last year, had returned 375% in under two years. UBS: Chinese Family Offices Plan to Lift Crypto Exposure to 5% The growing allocation is also being noted by major banks. UBS said some overseas Chinese family offices plan to increase crypto exposure to around 5% of their holdings. “Many second- and third-generation individuals of family offices are starting to learn about and participate in virtual currencies,” said Lu Zijie, head of wealth management at UBS China. The rally in Bitcoin, which surged past $124,000 this month, has amplified the enthusiasm. President Donald Trump’s administration recently advanced the pro-crypto GENIUS Act, while Hong Kong’s stablecoin legislation has strengthened regional confidence. “The momentum has definitely built, and I think it’s a function of just general maturity of the asset class,” said Saad Ahmed, head of Asia Pacific at Gemini. Wealth managers noted a shift in mindset. A few years ago, family offices considered digital assets as an optional allocation; today, they increasingly view crypto as essential. WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin could become the #3 stable by maturity. Unlike DeFi-focused stables, it’s targeting treasuries, sovereign deals, and Middle Eastern family offices. Going from $2B to $100B supply is realistic when the Treasury market is trillions. That’s the opportunity. pic.twitter.com/uLxzu02kku — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) August 20, 2025 “Last year, they started to dip their feet into Bitcoin ETFs… now they have begun to learn the difference of holding a token directly,” said Zann Kwan, CIO of Singapore-based Revo Digital Family Office. Some family offices are also embracing more complex strategies, moving beyond buy-and-hold. Lighthouse Canton, a Singapore wealth manager, said clients are exploring basis trades and arbitrage. Fidelity International’s Giselle Lai added that Bitcoin is now being treated as a hedge against macro uncertainty, noting its low correlation with stocks and bonds. HashKey Exchange Sees 85% Surge in Users Amid Crypto Boom Exchanges are benefiting from the trend. Hong Kong’s HashKey Exchange reported an 85% jump in registered users year-on-year as of August 2025. In South Korea, trading volumes at the three largest platforms are up 17% so far this year, with average daily turnover climbing more than 20%. As reported, South Korean authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country’s first spot crypto ETFs . President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs. Last week, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions.

The project has already raised over $2 million in funding, with more than 170 million tokens sold to eager investors. At a presale price of just $0.005, Ozak AI is offering early buyers the chance to secure tokens before what many analysts believe could be a monumental breakout. With forecasts pointing to a potential $1 launch price, a modest $250 stake today could grow into $25,000, making Ozak AI one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space. Why Ozak AI Is Generating Buzz Unlike many speculative projects, Ozak AI is riding the momentum of two of the most powerful trends in technology: artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain innovation. The project’s mission is to bring advanced AI-powered tools to the Web3 ecosystem, offering solutions that improve decision-making, automate processes, and help both developers and users extract more value from decentralized platforms. This dual-market approach gives Ozak AI a unique position. While meme coins thrive on hype and top players like Bitcoin and Ethereum benefit from their brand dominance, Ozak AI offers something new—utility rooted in the real-world demand for AI. Investors are recognizing this, which is why its presale is selling out so quickly. $250 Into $25,000—The ROI Potential At a presale price of $0.005, Ozak AI offers a clear roadmap to high returns. If the token reaches its $1 target at launch, this would represent a 200x return for early investors. That means a $250 investment today could realistically grow into $25,000, while a $1,000 stake could balloon into $100,000. Even in a more conservative scenario in which Ozak AI's most effective hit is $0.005, investors might nonetheless enjoy a 100x return, turning $250 into $25,000. These types of numbers are nearly unprecedented in mounted belongings like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana, wherein profits are anticipated to be some distance extra modest because of their better market caps. Ozak AI Presale Momentum and Market Confidence The pace at which Ozak AI has raised over $2 million is a testament to growing investor confidence. Crypto presales are frequently a barometer for how much faith the market has in an undertaking’s imaginativeness and prescience, and Ozak AI’s overall performance shows strong guidance. With strategic partnerships, a clean roadmap, and a growing worldwide community, the project seems nicely prepared to deliver on its promises. Momentum is everything in crypto, and Ozak AI is gaining it at the right time. As the broader market enters another bullish cycle, tokens that combine hype with utility are likely to outperform, and Ozak AI checks both boxes. Why Investors Are Choosing Ozak AI Several factors are driving investors to Ozak AI over other opportunities: Low Entry Point: With a token price of just $0.005, the barrier to entry is extremely low, allowing investors to secure a large number of tokens at minimal cost. Massive Upside: Projections of $0.50 to $1 create the possibility of 100x–200x returns, far surpassing what traditional assets or even established cryptos can offer. Real Utility: Unlike many meme coins, Ozak AI is building a platform that leverages AI for Web3 applications, increasing the chances of long-term adoption. Community Buzz: Strong presale performance and growing hype across crypto circles signal that Ozak AI could become one of 2025’s standout performers. Ozak AI has already proven itself as a serious contender in the crypto presale space, raising over $2 million and selling out 170 million tokens with impressive speed. At just $0.005 per token, the project offers extraordinary upside, with the potential to turn even a small $250 investment into $25,000 if it reaches its $1 target. Compared to hooked-up giants like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which give first-rate but limited returns, Ozak AI affords a rare threat for lifestyle-changing profits. With robust presale momentum, real AI-driven utility, and developing market hype, Ozak AI is positioning itself as one of the most promising projects of 2025. For investors seeking to balance threat with the opportunity of exponential rewards, Ozak AI would possibly just be the opportunity they’ve been looking forward to.

Among these, Solana, Cardano and Remittix (RTX) are standing out as prime buys. Analysts are betting big on these coins for the long haul, with Solana and Cardano showing potential for a solid rebound, while Remittix continues its meteoric rise in presale. Solana price corrects amid ETF delay decision The Solana price has faced challenges over the past few days as the altcoin struggles to regain bullish momentum. SOL dipped below the $188 support zone, entering a short-term bearish phase. This pullback is largely attributed to the delay in the Solana ETF decision, which has been pushed back to October. ETF delays often dampen market sentiment, and for Solana investors, this means reduced leverage and potentially switching to projects with clearer catalysts, like Remittix. Source: TradingView Solana price has recently struggled below the 50% FIB retracement level. The key resistance for the Solana price sits near $182. A breakout above $182 could create bullish momentum. However, failing to reclaim this level risks further declines toward $175 support The ETF delay has given bears the upper hand in the short term, and traders are now waiting for a confirmed breakout. However, Solana price is still a top contender in the long run, especially if the Solana ETF decision finally lands. Cardano price action: testing critical resistance levels Cardano’s price action has entered a critical phase as ADA approaches key resistance levels while showing signs of a potential pullback. Currently trading at $0.927, ADA is caught within a narrowing triangle pattern, indicating an imminent price move. Source: X (Twitter) Traders are closely monitoring the $0.98 resistance level, which has previously blocked breakout attempts. Recent price movements show ADA entering a downside correction after reaching $1.020. The price has dipped below important support levels, including $0.950 and $0.920, signaling bearish sentiment Why Remittix is outpacing the competition While Solana and Cardano face short-term pressure, Remittix (RTX) is making waves with real-world use cases and an impressive presale surge. Already past $20,6 million raised, Remittix is drawing attention from investors looking for a low gas fee crypto with solid utility. Here’s why Remittix is trending: Real-time crypto-to-FIAT transfers available across 30+ countries and 40+ cryptocurrencies $250,000 Remittix Giveaway generating buzz and growing its user base Fast, frictionless crypto payments, designed for businesses, freelancers and global remitters With utility-driven momentum, Remittix (RTX) is positioned to outperform speculative tokens.

Experts are predicting 50x gains as the presale moves toward its CEX listing, offering one of the most exciting opportunities in 2025. Time to make your move The market is in flux, but Remittix is positioning itself as the go-to project for those tired of speculative risk and looking for high growth crypto.

Ozak AI's commitment to enhancing blockchain functionalities through AI has set it apart from typical speculative crypto projects. With a starting presale price of just $0.005, Ozak AI provided an accessible entry point for potential investors.

XRP price is at $2.90 with a market value of $172.6 billion and volumes at $7.73 billion. In such a scenario, newer coins like Remittix (RTX) are being measured against Ripple’s initial progress, especially considering that they are aiming at the problem of cross-border payments. The XRP price benchmark and growing interest in alternatives XRP has been a payment space pioneer for years, yet investor enthusiasm is turning towards future crypto plays that can replicate or build upon its model. With XRP price volatility still in focus, the majority look to early-stage plays such as Remittix. This is less speculation and more finding a crypto with real utility, especially in cross-border usage, where speed and low gas fees matter most. Remittix presale frenzy and wallet release Remittix has become one of the leading crypto presale 2025 contenders at a rapid pace, with over $20.5 million in proceeds and more than 611 million RTX tokens sold at the current price of $0.0969 per token . The presale also began its first Centralized Exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart, an enormous step towards ease of access and liquidity. One of the key drivers of momentum is the Remittix beta wallet, which will be launched in Q3. The mobile-focused wallet aims to bridge crypto and fiat and allow deposits into bank accounts in several nations directly. The news describes why RTX is being referred to as a DeFi project that focuses on crypto tackling true-world problems, not speculation. Why Remittix is gaining traction Over $20.5Million presale raised with strong global demand Wallet beta launch in Q3 brings direct fiat conversion functionality Backed by an officially listed CEX listing on BitMart One of the top-performing cryptos under $1 with real-world use case This mix of adoption and infrastructure approach is rare among live crypto presales today, making RTX an emerging altcoin to monitor. Having a $250,000 Remittix giveaway as part of the package is a bonus insofar as visibility and community engagement. The bigger picture As Ripple continues to keep its ground in cross-border payments, investors are speculating if Remittix could be the Next XRP in terms of actual real-world adoption. By offering a solution for remittances, fiat on-ramp integration and crypto staking opportunities, RTX is aiming to be something greater than yet another presale hype cycle. For those searching for the next altcoin big thing 2025, Remittix combines presale traction, upcoming product launches and exchange listings that signal long-term viability. Already, whales are taking positions and its focus on solving a $19 trillion payment market creates RTX the case to be one of the top DeFi projects 2025 under the radar.

The bank, which reportedly targets more than $300 billion in assets under management by the end of 2025, said in its press statement that it reached agreements with ADDX, DigiFT and HydraX to distribute the new products. “ Through tokenized notes, DBS will provide accredited and institutional investors flexibility in managing sophisticated portfolios. The notes will be available to eligible traders through third-party investment platforms and exchanges,” the release read. The launch comes against the backdrop of growing demand for advanced digital financial products in Singapore, where the number of single family offices based in Singapore exceeded 2,000 in 2024, up 43% from the previous year. First offering tied to cryptocurrency The first tokenized products to be issued will be cash-settled, cryptocurrency-linked participation notes. These instruments allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly holding crypto. Structured notes are products with a minimum investment requirement of $100,000, often customized for individual investors, making them non-fungible. The notes created by DBS provide cash payouts when cryptocurrency prices rise, but they have mechanisms to reduce losses if prices fall. The initiative follows the bank’s September 2024 rollout of cryptocurrency-linked notes for eligible DBS clients, alongside crypto options trading. According to DBS, investor demand for these instruments has been strong. In the first half of 2025, its clients executed more than $1 billion in trades involving structured notes. Trade volumes grew nearly 60% between the first and second quarters of the year. Beyond cryptocurrency-linked notes, DBS plans to tokenize more conventional products such as equity-linked and credit-linked notes. Bank leaders happy with blockchain moves Li Zhen, Head of Foreign Exchange and Digital Assets for Global Financial Markets at DBS, mentioned that the tokenization project is a part of the bank’s long-term vision for financial innovation. “Asset tokenization is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure,” he remarked. “Since 2021, DBS has been active in scaling this ecosystem by fostering responsible innovation, enabling tokenization to meet real market demand and make financial markets more efficient and accessible.” He added that the first tokenized product, a crypto-linked note, responds directly to the institutional appetite for digital assets in the city-state. “With this initiative, a broader segment of investors can now tap our digital asset ecosystem to build exposure to the asset class,” Li concluded. Strong financial performance supports innovation DBS enters the tokenization market from a position of strength. In 2024, the bank became the first Singaporean company to cross S$100 billion in market capitalization, ending the year at S$124 billion. It also delivered total shareholder returns of 51%, one of the strongest performances in its history. Growth in wealth management and wholesale banking were part of the bank’s accrued success. According to Euromoney, citing analysts at Morgan Stanley, DBS could count returns on equity at 18% in 2025. The economists propounded that this performance justifies a two-times price-to-book valuation for the lender. While China’s economic slowdown has weighed on regional growth, the bank’s income from large corporate banking and small scale businesses in India rose by 25% in 2024. DBS sees additional opportunities in India’s small and medium-sized enterprises, coupled with its digital and artificial intelligence capabilities and its nationwide branch network . The network was acquired through the bank’s 2020 takeover of Lakshmi Vilas Bank. Tan Su Shan, deputy CEO and CEO-designate, has been working closely with former chief executive Piyush Gupta to oversee DBS into a blockchain-based phase.

The firm shared on X that the cryptocurrency’s heaviest weekly volume clusters over the past six months lined up with a market bottom and a new all-time high, suggesting that watching volume extremes has once again been a profitable contrarian strategy. Trading Volumes Flagged the Bottom and the Top Santiment’s chart highlighted two defining moments. One was an $84.08 billion trading volume burst during the tariff-driven dip in April that marked the “bottom signal,” with the second being a much larger $90.90 billion spike in recent weeks that coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $124,000. According to the analytics firm, the first flagged a sharp selloff that provided bargain entry points for investors, while the second was a top signal, coming in sync with intense profit-taking as BTC set its record high. “The two largest volume spikes from Bitcoin signaled the optimal time to buy (as prices were falling) and sell (as prices peaked to a new ATH),” noted Santiment. Its assessment comes a couple of days after Glassnode shared an update showing that “First Buyers” had added 50,000 BTC to their holdings in five days, while so-called “Conviction Buyers” also accumulated, albeit more cautiously. Meanwhile, “Loss Sellers” had increased by nearly 38%, reflecting capitulation from weaker hands, with profit-takers expanding their take to the highest level seen this year. Indeed, on August 20, the platform reported that long-term holders had booked $2.8 billion in profits across Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) as the market cooled. BTC led the rush, realizing its largest profit-taking event since December 2024, when investors pocketed $1.5 billion on July 18. That wave of exits helped push the OG crypto under $113,000 earlier this week, dragging other majors lower and erasing more than $70 billion in total market value overnight. Adding to the bearish mood, Santiment’s metrics also showed that crowd sentiment on social platforms had swung negative, registering the most pessimism since June. Price Action Meanwhile, at the market, Bitcoin was trading at $113,705 at the time of this writing. The price reflects an almost 7% dip over the past week, a relatively poor performance compared to the broader crypto market, which shed 3.5% in the same period. Furthermore, the asset slipped 3.1% in the last 30 days, although it remains up nearly 91% year-over-year.

The network enables instant alerts when flagged criminal funds arrive at participating platforms, allowing exchanges to freeze deposits before withdrawal and off-ramping occurs. Industry Collaboration Targets $47 Billion Annual Crime Problem TRM Labs announced the initiative on August 20, with massive collaboration between over 20 founding members, federal law enforcement agencies, and security researchers, including ZachXBT and Security Alliance. The system addresses the urgent need for faster detection as criminals move stolen funds through over 10,000 transactions within months, as seen in the $1.5 billion Bybit hack earlier this year. According to TRM Labs data, at least $47 billion in cryptocurrency has been sent to fraud-related addresses since 2023, while 2025 has become a record year for hacks, with over $2.3 billion stolen. The network operates through verified investigators flagging criminal addresses, automatic propagation across related wallets, and real-time alerts when tagged funds hit participating exchanges. The launch comes as crypto criminals have dramatically accelerated their operations, with Global Ledger reporting that hackers now move funds in as little as four seconds after attacks, approximately 75 times faster than average exchange alert systems can respond. Introducing Beacon Network: The first real-time crypto crime response network. Exchanges, issuers, and law enforcement can now trace funds instantly — and act before criminals cash out. Learn more: https://t.co/ZtslbTyOfM #BeaconNetwork #TRMLabs pic.twitter.com/IX7MPRntF0 — TRM Labs (@trmlabs) August 20, 2025 Real-Time Detection Tackles Millisecond Criminal Operations The urgency behind Beacon Network stems from the devastating speed of modern crypto crime, where one in four hacks sees funds thoroughly laundered before any public statement is issued. Global Ledger’s analysis revealed that the fastest complete laundering process took just 2 minutes 57 seconds from initial breach to final deposit, faster than typical laptop screen timeouts. In over 68% of crypto attacks, hackers move funds before incidents become publicly known, with only 4.2% of stolen assets ultimately recovered during the first half of 2025. Source: Global Ledger The average 37-hour delay between fund movement and public reporting creates an insurmountable disadvantage for traditional response methods. Centralized exchanges have emerged as the primary targets, contributing to more than 54% of total losses during 2025’s first half , as attackers exploit them as high-value single points of failure. Token contracts accounted for $517.8 million in losses, while personal wallets suffered 11.7% of total damages across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has refined timing strategies, planning fund movements to coincide with normal transaction activity around noon when organizations experience staff transitions and reduced vigilance. These sophisticated actors execute attacks “planned down to every single swap and transfer,” exploiting operational gaps during lunch breaks and shift changes. Meanwhile, crypto hack losses surged 27.2% to $142 million in July 2025 alone , with seventeen major security breaches, including the $44.2 million CoinDCX attack through compromised employee credentials and the $42 million GMX re-entrancy exploit. International Law Enforcement Scores Early Victories Through Blockchain Analysis Earlier this year, Greece’s Hellenic Anti-Money Laundering Authority achieved the country’s first crypto asset freezing by tracing funds from the $1.5 billion Bybit hack, utilizing Chainalysis Reactor tools acquired in 2023. Greece makes historic first crypto seizure after $1.5B Bybit hack using advanced @chainalysis tools to trace North Korea's Lazarus Group complex laundering schemes. #BybitHack #Greece https://t.co/vXuJLlJl8I — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 9, 2025 The landmark operation established irrefutable on-chain evidence linking seized assets to wallets used in the North Korean-attributed cyber heist. The international response has yielded mixed results, with 32.78% of stolen Bybit funds remaining traceable nearly five months after the attack. However, 87.47% have now gone dark , and only 5.24% successfully frozen. Despite coordinated efforts involving 12 organizations and $2.2 million in bounty payments, the majority of stolen assets remain beyond recovery. Beacon Network addresses these coordination challenges by enabling verified law enforcement agencies from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Australia, and South Korea to flag addresses in real-time. The system automatically traces flagged funds across blockchains and propagates intelligence to connected services without human intervention. The network’s focus areas include North Korean IT workers and hack fund disruption, ransomware payment interdiction, terrorism financing prevention, and recovering funds from romance scams and child exploitation. Founding member exchanges have praised this innovation, particularly noting that it gives them access to real-time intelligence.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-banks-cant-stop-whats-coming-for-xrp-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld recently shared a post on social media stating, “Banks Can’t Stop What’s Coming… XRP.” Along with this statement, he attached a video in which he elaborated on his outlook for global finance, technology, and the role of cryptocurrencies in the years ahead. His message focused on how current economic conditions and technological progress are creating an environment where digital assets may take a more central role. Economic Context Outlined in the Video In the video, Rietveld discussed the economic backdrop he believes is shaping this transition. He pointed to what he described as a “growing liquidity, growing M2, lowering of interest rates, and a productivity boom all essentially happening at the same time.” According to him, these overlapping developments are creating a foundation for significant change in how financial systems will operate. He suggested that the convergence of these conditions is accelerating the push toward alternatives to the existing monetary framework. Banks Can’t Stop What’s Coming… #XRP pic.twitter.com/A8FMJiddQJ — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 18, 2025 XRP Price Outlook Beyond 2030 Rietveld acknowledged uncertainty about the long-term outlook, stating that “2030 and beyond that we don’t know what things are gonna look like anymore.” Despite this uncertainty, he expressed confidence in the importance of digital assets as a safeguard against the limitations of traditional systems. He emphasized that his conviction is rooted in the belief that the current structure of fiat currency will not hold the same relevance in the future. He anticipates a fundamental shift where cryptocurrencies take a leading role in the global economy. Position on XRP, HBAR, and the Future of Technology In his remarks, Rietveld outlined his investment stance, saying that “accumulating XRP consistently, accumulating HBAR consistently right now is the perfect remedy.” He argued that these digital assets represent strong opportunities for those who want exposure to what he sees as the financial and technological transition already underway. He linked this perspective not only to changes in financial markets but also to broader advancements in artificial intelligence and technology. According to him, cryptocurrency will play a leading role in shaping the trajectory of both finance and innovation. Implications of His Statement Rietveld’s comments underscore his belief that traditional banking systems will be limited in their ability to control the transition he envisions. By stating that banks cannot stop what is coming, he framed the rise of digital assets such as XRP as part of a larger inevitability tied to global financial and technological shifts. His video suggested that consistent investment into select cryptocurrencies could be an important strategy for adapting to the changes expected over the next decade.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $114,826, it will fuel a bullish rally to $117,132. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $111,769, beginning a bearish trend to $105,782. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as sellers pushed the price toward $113.5K. The recent highs triggered selling demand. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Strategy bought an additional 430 Bitcoin between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. The purchase cost was $51.4 million, or an average $119,666 per Bitcoin. Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-21 10:00:00
50434605,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-vs-avalon-x-avlxs-real-estate-backed-rwa-draws-major-investors/,1755770400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50434605.jpeg,XRP vs Avalon X: AVLX’s Real Estate–Backed RWA Draws Major Investors,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-vs-avalon-x-avlxs-real-estate-backed-rwa-draws-major-investors/,"XRP’s core value proposition remains consistent: fast, low-cost cross-border transfers on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a proposition given renewed attention whenever risk appetite turns and tokenization narratives flare. On the flip side is Avalon X (AVLX) tying token utility to perks around real property projects. With the markets restless and real-world assets back top of mind, XRP holders are observing how Avalon X’s efforts may align in a fast-settlement ecosystem. XRP News: Why Is XRP Still the Best Crypto for Cross-Border Payments? Market conditions this week have been volatile. Macro jitters around the pace of U.S. rate cuts pressured majors, but on Tuesday, XRP briefly outperformed the large caps and underscored how quickly flows rotate across liquid names. As it stands, XRP price is hovering near $2.90 after testing both sides of the $3.00 area intraday. That $3.00 handle has become a psychological pivot to the price, which ramped toward $3.10 as XRP price stalled into round-number liquidity, something traders closely observed on Tuesday. Additionally, there is earlier coverage pointing to an unusual pause near $3.00 (on heavy volume) earlier in the session, which creates speculation around structural thinness within that zone. Price notwithstanding, that cadence of the XRPL matters to long-only holders. In the last two days, validators pushed three protocol ‘fix’ amendments into a 14-day countdown . If the supermajority support remains, the network could activate these amendments around August 29th and tighten reliability and governance hygiene around the ledger. Incremental upgrades don’t usually make headlines, but they check trust in the throughput when on a spike. Context still includes a liability chapter, finally closing. Last week, the SEC concluded its multi-year case against Ripple with a $125 million penalty and an injunction on a series of certain institutional sales, while preserving secondary-market trading of XRP outside of treatment as a securities instrument per Judge Torres’ prior ruling. For so many participants, that clarity obviated a tired tail risk and reset the conversation back to utility, liquidity, and execution. Avalon X Provides Real Estate Utility Through Token Holdings Avalon X is promoting its AVLX as a utility token that provides tiered benefits. Across Grupo Avalon developments, backed by the developer’s proven track record of $103M+ in completed sales and near $1B total project pipeline value. The project is designed with usage in mind, with staking options available at presale, tiered benefits, and then, after a listing, the ability to use AVLX for discounted property purchases in the ecosystem. It makes the token an access point for known benefits instead of a substitute for equity. Tokenomics are clear and aim for consistency. The total supply is capped at 2,000,000,000 (Token allocation: 60% presale/ICO, 15% staking & rewards pool, 10% marketing, 7% burn, 5% liquidity, 3% team) with no inflationary minting; 7% of the supply will be allocated to deflationary events (burns). The whitepaper frames this as a sustainability approach to jointly aligning short-term incentives from presale with commitments to long-run community participation through staking and a moderate burn plan. Avalon X articulates that AVLX smart contracts are independently audited, citing an audit by CertiK for the token contract, and that it plans to continue to use independent reviews before opening to broader market access. This audit focus is intended to build institutional-grade trust around a consumer-facing utility token. The perks scale through three clear tiers. Gold offers a 10% bonus on presale purchases, plus five automatic raffle entries. Diamond offers a 15% bonus, a stay discount of 20% across future Avalon developments, and whitelist access to future offerings. Platinum offers a 25% bonus, 25 raffle entries, a week-long stay, priority services (clubhouse services and concierge access), and a 50% stay discount. There are two giveaways to increase engagement at launch: The first is a $1,000,000 AVLX pool for ten winners ($100,000 each), with minimum purchase and referral elements described through the site blocks. The second is a giveaway of a luxury townhouse in the Eco Valley development from Grupo Avalon that includes minimum purchase and referral entries as well. Both campaigns aim to encourage early participation while showcasing the broader ecosystem. Conclusion Both stories lean into practical use cases but from different angles. Avalon X focuses on converting token holding into tangible perks tied to real projects. By merging blockchain technology with property-backed presale, it offers a credible RWA path beyond hype-driven coins. Avalon X’s utility framing is a natural adjacent narrative, one to evaluate on audits, tokenomics clarity, and how quickly roadmap milestones become lived experiences.

BTC and XRP Are Rangebound But One Project Tops the List,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-before-the-market-recovers-btc-and-xrp/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are locked in narrow ranges, leaving traders wondering why crypto is down despite strong long-term narratives. When top coins stall, experienced investors start scanning for emerging projects with sharper upside. While BTC and XRP remain in holding patterns, analysts are pointing to one presale altcoin that is drawing serious attention: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . A DeFi Protocol Redefining Lending and Borrowing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized liquidity protocol designed to unlock lending and borrowing opportunities across the crypto market. Its standout model combines two complementary approaches: peer-to-contract (P2C) pools for bluechip assets and stablecoins, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for higher-risk tokens. This design is creating attention because it offers flexibility and competitive returns for both lenders and borrowers. In a P2C scenario, lenders supply assets into shared liquidity pools and earn returns that adjust automatically with pool utilization. For example, a lender who supplies $20,000 worth of AVAX into a pool operating at 70% utilization earns 20% APY. That’s $4,000 in annual passive income with no direct negotiation needed. On the borrowing side, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) allows users to unlock liquidity without losing exposure to their favorite tokens. Someone who locks $8,000 worth of ADA can borrow $5,600 USDT at a 70% loan-to-value ratio. They maintain exposure to ADA’s potential price growth while freeing up funds for new trades or expenses. Loans carry no fixed terms, meaning repayment is possible at any time as long as collateral remains sufficient. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2P lending model adds another layer for more speculative assets like SHIB or TRUMP coin. Instead of relying on algorithmic rates, lenders and borrowers negotiate directly. That means a lender willing to take on higher risk can secure interest rates north of 20%, while borrowers get access to liquidity without depending on pooled structures. This dual-track model gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an advantage over single-approach lending platforms. Presale Momentum and Path to Listings The numbers around Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale speak for themselves. Currently in Phase 6, tokens are priced at $0.035, with over $14.68 million already raised and more than 15,500 holders onboarded. With 22% of tokens sold and the next phase increasing the price to $0.04, investors are facing a 15% jump just around the corner. For those who acted earlier, returns are already stacking up. Take an investor who swapped $3,000 worth of SOL during Phase 1 at $0.01. At today’s presale rate of $0.035, their MUTM holdings are already worth 3.5x more on paper. With the confirmed listing price at $0.06, that same investment is on track for a 6x value increase, showing the kind of returns not available in rangebound majors like BTC or XRP. This presale is being reinforced by strong credibility markers. The project has completed a CertiK audit, receiving a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. To ensure continued robustness, a $50,000 bug bounty program rewards ethical hackers based on severity, ranging from $2,000 for critical issues to $1,000 for major discoveries. Alongside this, a $100,000 giveaway spread across 10 winners adds an extra layer of excitement for early supporters. Looking forward, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for its beta launch, which will coincide with the token’s live debut. This will give users a chance to test the platform’s core mechanics right away, adding real utility from day one. Exchange listings are also on the roadmap, with expectations for major platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase to bring significant visibility and liquidity. That is why crypto predictions from analysts are starting to highlight MUTM as a project uniquely positioned for recovery upside. While Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP may continue to consolidate, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a combination of real DeFi use cases, rising presale momentum, and upcoming exchange exposure. For anyone exploring crypto investing during a period of sideways price action, the opportunity to secure tokens before the presale price increases offers an attractive entry point. In fact, the combination of audited security, passive income potential, and presale returns positions MUTM as one of the most compelling crypto investment opportunities of the year. As the market prepares for its next move, one thing is becoming clear: while BTC and XRP remain steady, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the breakout story investors have been waiting for.

In a thread on X, Florian frames the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility (RRP) as the “surplus pot” that quietly powered asset prices for two years—and now, with that pot empty, he believes markets are about to feel the unfiltered weight of tighter liquidity. Why This Means Pain For Bitcoin Florian starts by locating the inflection point: “The reverse repo facility (RRP) is at its lowest level in four years.” He then walks through the basic plumbing. During the pandemic response, “so much money was printed… there were fewer assets than excess cash,” so banks and money funds “parked [it] with the Fed in the RRP. Safe and earning interest.” As that pool drained, it didn’t disappear—it “was continuously pumped into the market over the last few years. Mainly into government bonds.” In his accounting, “around $2 trillion in excess liquidity from 2020/21 flowed into the market over the last 24 months,” keeping valuations buoyant despite higher policy rates and formal quantitative tightening. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Treasury Bubble Popping? Expert Answers The metaphor he uses is deliberate and evocative: “It’s like a tanker traveling at full speed. Even if you turn off the engine, it will continue to drift for many kilometers, solely due to the speed it has built up.” For Florian, that drift—the lagged effect of past liquidity—is ending. “Now the propulsion is gone. The surplus pot is empty, and the tanker comes to a standstill.” He connects that mechanical turn to the looming supply calendar: “There are still trillions in government bonds that need to be purchased in the coming months and years.” With the RRP no longer acting as a buyer of first resort, “we will feel the full brunt of the reduced liquidity since 2022.” The near-term cross-asset message is unambiguous. “This is bad for stocks, bonds, and Bitcoin in the short term,” he writes, adding that “stocks and Bitcoin can afford short respites… bonds cannot.” The constraint, in his view, is structural: “The US bond market is the most important market in the world.” If the RRP isn’t there to absorb cash and recycle it into Treasuries, “bond yields will continue to rise to attract investors.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Hinges On Trump’s Pick For Fed Chair: Analyst That dynamic, he warns, collides with political and macro limits: “interest rates are already far too high for the current administration.” His base case is that the central bank ultimately has to step in: “The Fed will likely intervene and rescue the bond market by providing new liquidity.” The path from here is “unclear… in the short term,” but the contours of the pressure are, in his telling, set by the plumbing. Florian repeatedly stresses that any turbulence should not be misread as a Bitcoin-native failure. “The turmoil is once again coming from the fiat system, not from Bitcoin. Bitcoin merely reflects this development with its volatility.” That framing places Bitcoin downstream of dollar liquidity rather than in opposition to it. The market, he cautions, will “do everything it can to drive you out of your position.” His counsel for positioning is psychological as much as financial: “If you know what you own, you can stay relaxed.” The long-term thesis remains intact in his mind—“Remember where Bitcoin is headed as an ideal store of value”—but navigating the next phase requires horizon discipline: “Because if you keep your eyes on the horizon, you won’t get seasick.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,736.

Just Two Mining Pools Control Majority Of Hashrate,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-51-hack-two-pools-control-majority-hashrate/,"Two Bitcoin mining pools now make up for 51% of the network Hashrate, raising potential concerns about the centralization of the blockchain. Foundary & AntPool Make Up For The Majority Of The Bitcoin Hashrate As pointed out by X user Leo Lanza in a post , two mining pools have gained control of more than 51% of the Bitcoin Hashrate. The “ Hashrate ” here refers to a measure of the total amount of computing power that miners have connected to the network. BTC runs on a consensus mechanism known as the Proof-of-Work (PoW) , in which validators compete against each other using computing resources to get the chance to add the next block to the chain. The Hashrate tracks this power being employed by miners as a whole. Below is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows the trend in the 7-day average of the global Bitcoin Hashrate. As is visible in the graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate has witnessed a rise recently and is now nearly at the all-time high (ATH). Thus, it seems validators are in expansion mode. While the Hashrate makes a collective measure of the computing power that the miners have attached, these resources never actually work in tandem due to the nature of PoW. This competition is actually what secures the BTC network. PoW only works, however, as long as participants involved are sufficiently decentralized. If a particular miner was to gain control of the majority of the Hashrate, they can, in theory, alter the blockchain to their will. Such an attack is popularly known as a 51% attack. Other consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS) can also fall prey to this method. For example, if a staker (miner-equivalent on PoS networks) assumes control of over 51% of the staked ETH, they can take over the Ethereum blockchain. Today, Bitcoin has grown so much that a 51% hack is extremely hard to pull off. Even so, it isn’t outright impossible. One threat to BTC’s decentralization comes in the form of mining pools, groups where individual miners coalesce to get a better shot at earning revenue. And this is where the current concern lies: two pools are sitting on more than 51% of the Bitcoin Hashrate. As data from Hashrate Index shows, Foundary USA and AntPool currently have 33.6% and 17.9% of the BTC mining power, respectively. Combined, they make up for 51.5% of the global Hashrate. Though, while this may be true, an attack should still be unfeasible. As mentioned before, these pools are still made up of individual miners, each of which need to be coordinated to pull off a takeover. Beyond the logistical problem, any successful attack would crash the Bitcoin price and directly hurt the miners involved.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis There isn’t much a Bitcoin loyalist can do right now except be patient and wait for the token to establish strong support. On the positive side, Bitcoin does appear to be holding at a major zone near the $111K level, the same area where the last major breakout originated. If you want proof of how strong this support is, just look at what happened in the early days of August, when Bitcoin touched the support and absolutely flew off, surging about 11% in just a few days. Even better, on the 1-hour chart, the 10 EMA briefly crossed above the 20 EMA intraday today. While Bitcoin couldn’t sustain that momentum shift on the lower time frame, it’s still an encouraging sign, especially since it aligns with price action off the key support zone. It’s also worth noting that the last time the 10 EMA held above the 20 EMA was about a week ago, adding weight to the shift we saw today. That said, we do need a slightly stronger move to fully confirm a rebound.

Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis Even though Dogecoin appears to be in troubled waters at first glance, it is reacting strongly from multiple support zones, hinting at a possible rebound. The most prominent is an upward-sloping trendline on the daily chart, which the token leaned on yesterday before bouncing nearly 6%. That move also pushed Dogecoin above a downward-sloping resistance on the 1-hour chart, confirming at least a short-term bullish shift. Alt text: $DOGE’s 1-hour chart hinting at a potential rebound In addition to breaking above its recent lower high, key EMAs, like the 10, 20, and 50, on the hourly chart are stacked in bullish order (10 above 20, 20 above 50).

Recent financial results were exceptional, with revenue up 64% and a swing to strong profitability, driven by Bitcoin price appreciation and large BTC holdings. Ongoing dilution and debt-funded growth have pressured the stock, but operational efficiency and strategic partnerships support a bullish outlook. I rate MARA a strong buy with a $25 target, as AI/HPC diversification is underappreciated and offers significant upside beyond core mining operations. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is a bitcoin miner power play — one of the largest by operational capacity and BTC holdings. I think it is a company that can't be sidelined if you favor the bitcoin mining landscape as an investment. Its performance often sets the tone for the entire industry. Despite this, MARA is positioning itself not only to sustain dominance in mining but also to become a global digital infrastructure business, with its significant investments in the sphere of AI and HPC. Moving beyond its dependency on Bitcoin allows MARA to diversify. If HPC and AI computing succeed, the company could see significant financial upside — along with an improvement in its stock price. The stock is highly volatile, experiencing sharp swings whenever Bitcoin becomes more turbulent or when sentiment shifts around the industry or broader market. MARA Holdings also falls into the interest-rate-sensitive category; thus, it is not surprising that its performance often correlates with the Russell 2000 small-cap index. MARA is a rapid-growth stock that frequently dilutes investors to raise cash. This adds pressure on the stock price — and that's why many people prefer trading it rather than holding it. However, I think that at current valuations, and considering the extremely positive outlook for Bitcoin and MARA itself, I rate it as a strong buy with a $25 price target over the next 12 months, implying more than 50% upside. FQ2 2025: Massive Double Beat Backed By Bitcoin Surge On July 29, MARA disclosed its FQ2 2025 results. It was a phenomenal quarter, as the bitcoin miner strongly beat analyst expectations with revenue increasing to $238.5 million, up 64% year over year, and net income of $808.2 million — or $1.84 per diluted share — a sharp reversal from a net loss of $199.7 million, indicating ($0.72) per share a year prior. To be fair, it was also a strong quarter for all BTC miners using the HODL strategy. Under FASB rules, to record a profit or loss on bitcoin holdings, companies must use the prior quarter's closing price from reliable sources. On June 30, BTC closed at about $107,000 , compared to $82,000 on March 31 — a $25,000 increase that significantly boosted results, as MARA held 49,951 bitcoin in its treasury at quarter-end. MARA now holds a total of 50,639 BTC, according to its latest report. If bitcoin continues to appreciate over the next year, MARA could benefit both from mining revenue and from realized gains on its treasury. It's a major upside potential for HODLers. MARA Leads Bitcoin Miners By BTC Holdings (Bitbo.io) Nevertheless, the company reported a massive 170% increase in bitcoin holdings at quarter-end, up from about 18,500 BTC a year ago. It is important to note that MARA can mine approximately 670 BTC per month at the midpoint; therefore, more than 23,000 BTC were acquired through market purchases over the past 12 months to boost its treasury. In July, MARA closed an upsized 0% convertible note of $950 million and raised $319 million through ATM equity programs. Despite its strong liquidity, the company continues to rely on debt-fueled instruments and equity offerings to finance rapid growth or expand BTC holdings through market purchases. I think this ongoing dilution has been the most frustrating issue for investors and is the key reason the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 this year. MARA Holdings also reported a remarkable increase in adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion, up 1,093% year over year from a loss of about $125 million. These are not typical numbers in the market; they indicate massive growth. The company is heavily focused on operational efficiency. Management reported that its energized hashrate rose 82% year over year to 57.4 EH/s — the highest in company history. Fleet efficiency also improved to 18.3 J/Th, a 26% YoY upside. Lastly, the company outlined its key strategic outlook. MARA is gradually evolving into a digitally oriented energy business while leveraging AI infrastructure beyond pure crypto mining. The company has become asset-heavy, with 70% ownership of its capacity. It has also announced strategic partnerships with Google-backed TAE Power Solutions and Pado AI, mainly targeting the AI and HPC landscape. MARA's goal is to reach 75 EH/s by year-end, which would make it more dominant than ever. Diversification Into AI And HPC Is Not Priced In And Should Drive Upside I think diversifying its business model and shifting into AI and HPC will work out extremely well for MARA. We have already seen examples in the bitcoin mining space where companies have moved from being pure BTC plays to a mix of crypto, AI, and HPC. Those that adopted a diversified model — such as Iris Energy and Cipher Mining — have significantly outperformed traditional miner CleanSpark, which remains heavily focused on bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I don't think all miners should suddenly pivot into AI instead of strengthening their core mining operations. However, diversification and reduced dependency on a single asset are usually rewarded by the market, which is why I think MARA's shifting outlook is not yet priced in. MARA Stock Performance Compared To Peers (Google Finance) Over the past month, MARA Holdings has outperformed only CleanSpark, a pure bitcoin miner. Both CIFR and IREN have done far better, mainly driven by optimism around AI and HPC. I think it's only a matter of time before the market starts pricing in MARA's potential from a non-crypto mining perspective. Looking Purely At Valuation and Growth, It's Hard To Find A Reason Not To Buy I think MARA Holdings is an undervalued company and presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity. The company is currently trading at a trailing-twelve-month P/E of 9.27 — more than 60% below the sector median. At a PEG of 0.11, MARA is 88% cheaper than the average peer in the space, indicating significant undervaluation. Of course, to justify its valuation, MARA must maintain its future growth projections — but it is so undervalued that even with a slower growth, it would still be significantly attractive on a PEG basis. MARA: Yearly Revenue (Seeking Alpha) Since 2022, MARA Holdings has been doubling its top line year over year. With Q2 reported, the company has already exceeded FY2024 revenue by more than $100 million. It's truly an exceptional growth story. Other growth-related metrics, compared to the sector median, also look phenomenal: Metric MARA Sector Median Revenue Growth ((FWD)) 50.79% 7.56% EBITDA Growth (YoY) 97.94% 9.91% EPS Diluted Growth (YoY) 85.33% 11.03% ROE Growth (YoY) 2.64% (4.33%) CapEx Growth (YoY) 42.11% 6.14% MARA Holdings is an intriguing growth story, heavily invested in capital expenditures and further expansion into BTC mining as well as the AI and HPC landscape. Nevertheless, MARA is expected to grow its top line by more than 50% next year, while EBITDA rose about 98% year-over-year. The bottom line increased by 85.33%, nearly 8x higher than the sector median. Putting all these phenomenal numbers aside, MARA also reported a 2.64% growth in return on equity, while the average peer is still struggling to generate a positive return. EV/EBITDA stands at 7.66, compared to the sector median of 17.40. The price-to-book ratio is 1.15, about 75% more attractive than peers. From a fundamental standpoint, MARA Holdings appears significantly undervalued. For someone considering a bitcoin miner, I don't see how other pure BTC miners could rally without MARA. It is a truly compelling long-term investment, especially for investors seeking greater BTC exposure. Supporting The $25 Price Target As of mid-trading on August 19, MARA was range-bound between $15.50 and $16.00. That is around 56% below my expected $25 price target for the next 12 months. Sentiment toward pure BTC miners is weak, while BTC HODL companies, diversified miners, and AI-focused plays or pure Bitcoin treasury companies — such as Strategy — are gaining more attention and trading at a premium. At current valuations, MARA's Bitcoin holdings alone make up nearly 97% of its total market capitalization (50,639 coins at $115k equal $5.82 billion versus a market cap of around $5.96 billion). Adding its $100 million cash reserve brings it almost to 100%. This points to massive undervaluation: by purchasing the stock, you essentially get the mining business for free — and it's profitable. This also shows why I think none of the AI and HPC potential is priced in. The downside appears limited, and such low valuations rarely occur. We should also consider that in a typical month, MARA mines around 690 BTC. At the price of 115k per coin, that equals about $80 million. The company plans to keep expanding its BTC treasury, which should raise its floor price, even if BTC trades in a range and does not see a sharp decline. Despite this, MARA is running its business effectively and has been steadily reducing mining costs. As reported in Q2 2025, costs have fallen 47% over the past 10 quarters. As a result, the company disclosed that its energy cost to mine a single coin is $33.7k — among the lowest in the sector: Purchased Energy Cost / BTC of $33.7K, which we believe to be among the lowest in the sector MARA: Cost To Mine Decreased ( MARA Holdings, Investor Relations) MARA Holdings is a growth company, and investors should be satisfied with its aggressive top-line expansion without worrying too much about bottom-line figures. As a bitcoin miner, it remains highly dependent on the underlying crypto asset — as long as BTC remains volatile, so will MARA. The shift from pure mining activity to AI and HPC will help diversify the business. At a high single-digit P/E, the company looks incredibly undervalued. Trading at approximately 16x P/E — still nearly half the sector median — would be enough for the stock to reach my target. MARA Holdings experiences significant swings both ways, but with strong BTC demand and the cryptocurrency trading just 7% below its all-time high, I see more tailwinds than risks. I am being conservative with my $25 price target, even though it suggests more than 50% upside over the next year. At current valuations, you essentially get the mining business for free, without pricing in any positive future outlook for AI and HPC — areas the market typically rewards with a premium. MARA can perform well even if BTC trades in a range, steadily improving both its top and bottom lines. From a fundamental perspective, I see MARA as a great long-term opportunity for investors. Key Risks And Concerns Ahead Despite trading at such undervalued levels, there are some key risks and concerns that could potentially weigh on the stock price in the near term. As it is highly correlated with BTC movements, a sharp decline in the crypto price could drag MARA Holdings down with it. To those who are not experienced with this landscape, miners are usually considered a leveraged play; therefore, if Bitcoin drops by 3% to 5%, MARA would likely fall twice as much. I think MARA investors should recognize that continued dilution to support fast-paced growth is likely. Unless the FED reduces high-interest rates, I think that equity dilution may remain management's primary option for securing additional liquidity. Any announced ATM offering could trigger a double-digit decline. Operational disruptions also present risk. Adverse weather, unforeseen disruptions, or equipment malfunctions could impact BTC production and slow AI expansion. Lastly, with an already saturated range of BTC-related investments, investors may opt for alternatives such as Bitcoin ETFs and divert capital away from mining stocks. While markets can remain irrational, asymmetrical opportunities are often rewarded — and this seems to be the case for MARA. Conclusion: MARA Holdings Is A Strong Buy — Hyper-Growth You Can't Sideline MARA Holdings is a dominant name in the bitcoin mining industry. As the second-largest BTC holder in the world after Strategy, the company represents a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking a hyper-growth stock with limited downside potential. The bitcoin miner is profitable, and with its ongoing diversification into AI and HPC, it will likely become more stable and less dependent on BTC volatility. This should unlock a new segment of investors who prefer a more reliable and diversified business model. Assigning a conservative 15x multiple to MARA's valuations supports my $25 target, implying over 50% appreciation in stock price over the next 12 months. The stock is undervalued, and the current price point provides an attractive entry for significant long-term gains. I think MARA is a strong buy with a $25 price target — based on growth trajectory and undervalued fundamentals, it's hard to find reasons not to consider this opportunity. 13 analysts suggest a one-year average price of $23.87, which defines about 54% growth. I think if the market favors bitcoin miners over the next year, MARA's massive BTC holdings position it for strong upside. Historically, the company has made major moves in both directions, and with the current pullback, I think MARA could is well-positioned for a rebound.",BTC-USD|MARA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-21 10:06:18

Recently, the Sterling exchange rate experienced a significant uplift, a development that caught the attention of traders and investors alike. This surge was primarily driven by the release of stronger-than-expected economic indicators from the United Kingdom, painting a more optimistic picture for the nation’s economic health. What is the Sterling Exchange Rate Doing? The British Pound (GBP), often referred to as Sterling, demonstrated a robust appreciation against major currencies following the latest data releases. This upward movement reflects a renewed confidence in the UK economy’s resilience. The immediate reaction in the Sterling exchange rate saw it strengthening against the US Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR), among others. This immediate response highlights how sensitive currency markets are to economic news, especially when it deviates significantly from forecasts. Traders observed a swift shift in sentiment, pushing the GBP higher as market participants priced in the improved economic outlook. Decoding the UK Economic Data : The PMI Story At the heart of Sterling’s recent ascent lies the UK economic data , specifically the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) figures. PMI surveys are crucial gauges of economic activity, providing insights into the manufacturing, services, and construction sectors. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 suggests contraction. The recent data revealed an unexpected rebound, particularly in the services sector, which dominates the UK economy. This stronger-than-anticipated performance signaled a potential recovery path, defying earlier pessimistic projections. Here’s a breakdown of what the recent PMI data revealed: Services PMI: This sector, representing a significant portion of the UK’s GDP, showed a notable increase, indicating renewed business activity and consumer spending. This strength is often a key driver for overall economic sentiment. Manufacturing PMI: While perhaps not as strong as services, the manufacturing sector also showed signs of stabilization or slight expansion, contributing to the overall positive picture. Composite PMI: This combined index, reflecting activity across both manufacturing and services, registered a reading well above the 50-mark, signaling broad-based economic expansion. These figures are compiled from surveys of purchasing managers in various companies, making them a timely and often accurate predictor of economic trends. Why is Strong Purchasing Managers’ Index Data Important? The significance of a robust Purchasing Managers’ Index extends beyond mere numbers. It offers a forward-looking perspective on economic health, influencing monetary policy decisions by central banks like the Bank of England (BoE). Strong PMI data can suggest inflationary pressures or economic resilience, potentially leading the BoE to consider tightening monetary policy, such as raising interest rates, sooner than anticipated. Higher interest rates typically make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns on their investments, thereby supporting its value. This positive outlook can also boost consumer and business confidence, fostering a virtuous cycle of economic activity, encouraging investment, and potentially leading to job creation. Analyzing GBP Performance in the Current Climate While the recent PMI figures have provided a significant boost, understanding overall GBP performance requires a look at the broader economic landscape. Factors such as inflation trends, global economic sentiment, geopolitical developments, and the Bank of England’s stance on interest rates all play a role. Currently, the UK faces persistent inflation, which the BoE is actively trying to combat. Stronger economic data, while positive for growth, could also imply that inflation might be stickier, potentially requiring more aggressive rate hikes to bring it back to target. This nuanced interplay of factors keeps the GBP in a dynamic state, subject to continuous re-evaluation by market participants. Other influences on GBP performance include: Inflation Outlook: Higher-than-expected inflation could prompt the BoE to maintain a hawkish stance, supporting the GBP. Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between UK interest rates and those of other major economies impacts capital flows and currency appeal. Global Risk Appetite: In times of global uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven currencies, which can affect GBP. Political Stability: Domestic political developments and stability can also influence investor confidence in the UK economy. What are the Broader Forex Market Trends ? The uplift in Sterling is not isolated; it’s part of larger Forex market trends that are constantly evolving. Globally, central banks are grappling with inflation, recession fears, and varying economic recoveries post-pandemic. The US Dollar’s strength, the Eurozone’s challenges, and Japan’s unique monetary policy all contribute to the complex tapestry of currency movements. Sterling’s recent rise, driven by domestic data, shows that while global forces are strong, localized economic resilience can still carve out distinct paths for individual currencies. Traders will be closely watching for sustained positive data and any shifts in the BoE’s communication to gauge the longevity of this GBP strength. This recent movement underscores the importance of fundamental analysis in currency trading, where economic data releases can swiftly alter market dynamics and influence global investment strategies. Key Aspects and Actionable Insights The recent Sterling surge highlights several key aspects for investors and market watchers: Benefits: Increased Investor Confidence: Strong economic data often signals a healthier investment environment, attracting foreign capital into UK assets. Potential for Stronger Economic Recovery: Positive PMI figures suggest that the UK economy might be more resilient than previously thought, leading to a faster rebound. Improved Purchasing Power: A stronger Sterling means that UK consumers and businesses can purchase foreign goods and services more cheaply, benefiting importers. Challenges: Sustaining Momentum: While promising, one strong data point does not guarantee a sustained recovery, especially amid ongoing global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Persistent Inflationary Pressures: Strong growth could exacerbate inflation, potentially requiring the Bank of England to implement further restrictive monetary policies, which could temper growth later. Risk of Data Volatility: Economic data can be volatile, and future releases might not be as positive, leading to potential reversals in currency strength. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors: Monitor Upcoming Releases: Keep a close watch on future UK economic releases, especially inflation, retail sales, and labor market data, as these will provide further clues about the economy’s direction. Analyze Bank of England Statements: Pay attention to any speeches or minutes from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee. Their forward guidance on interest rates will be crucial for the Sterling’s trajectory. Consider Portfolio Diversification: For those with exposure to various asset classes, understanding how traditional currency strength impacts other markets, including commodities and even cryptocurrencies, can inform diversification strategies. Risk Management: Given the inherent volatility of currency markets, employing robust risk management strategies is essential when trading or investing based on economic data. Conclusion The recent surge in the Sterling exchange rate , propelled by encouraging UK PMI data, marks a significant moment for the British economy. It underscores the profound impact of robust economic indicators on currency valuations and broader market sentiment. While the path ahead remains subject to global and domestic challenges, this positive development provides a fresh wave of optimism for the UK’s economic trajectory. For those navigating the intricate world of finance, understanding these fundamental shifts in UK economic data is paramount to making informed decisions and anticipating future market movements.

On-chain data shows Ethereum now leads Bitcoin in daily active addresses and transferred value, and dominates stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization. Despite strong usage trends, Ethereum's network fees remain weak, pushing its price-to-fee valuation to a five-year high and raising valuation concerns. Given current extended valuations, I rate both ETH and ETH-USD as holds, but view significant dips as attractive long-term buying opportunities. The meteoric price rise of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) since the April lows has been nothing short of monstrous: ETH-USD Monthly Chart (TrendSpider) Since early-April, ETH is working on its third green candle in four months with the price of the coin rallying roughly 250% over that time frame. Driven largely by ETH recently getting the 'Treasury Strategy' treatment that we've seen benefit Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) over the last couple years, ETH is currently flirting with all time highs and a monthly high close for August. In this article, we'll take a long overdue look at the fundamentals of Ethereum as an investment idea as well as the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) to deduce if ETFs are still the best way to play Ethereum long term. The Treasury Strategy Comes For ETH I think it's important to keep in mind what the real drivers of ETH's performance have been over these last few months. Anyone who has followed my work the last year or so is likely aware of this; but ETH and BTC continue to be capital flow stories. For most of 2024 and 2025, investment demand for Digital Assets through more traditional securities has greatly favored BTC over ETH. That is no longer the case. Digital Asset Flows (CoinShares/Bloomberg) We can see in the data above that essentially all of August investment demand has been for Ethereum. Bitcoin is actually negative month to date while ETH has seen just under $3 billion in positive net flows over just two weeks. This discrepancy has been so intense, that ETH is even beginning to close the gap between the two assets on a year to date basis. Competing with ETF investors on the bid, ETH Treasury Companies have also entered the arena: As of August 20th (StrategicETHReserve.xyz) There are currently no less than 14 publicly traded companies that are acting as Ethereum Treasury businesses according to StrategicETHReserve. I've covered a handful of them over the last month or two. There are three that are clearly dominant in their ability to raise capital to buy ETH; Bitmine Immersion ( BMNR ), SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ), and The Ether Machine ( DYNX ). Together, those three entities have acquired roughly 2.6 million of the 4.1 million ETH held by publicly traded companies. Perhaps more impressive than the ETH held by these top three Treasury entities is the speed with which they have been able to amass these ETH holdings. ETH Holdings by Public Companies (StrategicETHReserve) At the end of June, there was just 1.2 million ETH held by all companies in the public markets. Meaning, this figure has more than tripled in just 6 weeks. In the process Bitmine Immersion has passed every single ETH ETF in the US for ETH holdings with the loan exception of the iShares Ethereum ETF ( ETHA ). What is notably different about buying ETH for corporate treasury over something like BTC is the reality that ETH can be staked natively for in-kind yield. Given that, it isn't actually all that unreasonable to pay a premium to mNAV for ETH Treasury companies since the assets are indeed being monetized. This all brings us to a key question then; is this ETH hoarding driven by strong trends in usage/utility or is it more speculative in nature? The answer is probably a little bit of both. On-Chain Data and Valuation In a recent piece covering the Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ) for Seeking Alpha, I detailed why I felt there was actually some merit to the hype we were seeing in ETH. Namely, Ethereum's very real dominance in both Stablecoin supply and RWA: Stablecoin Supply Share by Chain (Artemis) At 53.5% market share, Ethereum is by far the largest player in the Stablecoin game with $146.8 billion of the total $274 billion supply. And that share has been growing since the end of 2024. Ethereum claims a similar share of the RWA market where tokenized Gold , treasuries, and private credit now exceed $25 billion combined. My view continues to be that a significant portion of this renewed interest in Ethereum is from the post-GENIUS Act stablecoin narrative and the idea that Ethereum will be a major winner in that category. I do happen to share that view longer term but think that the current form of stablecoins - ones that completely lack any user privacy whatsoever - are unlikely to be adopted without both UI improvement and better privacy protection at the application layer. Regardless, there are very positive usage signs for ETH that I think are worth pointing out. DAAs, 30 Day Average (CoinMetrics) On a rolling 30 day average, Daily Active Addresses (or DAAs) for Ethereum are quickly approaching an all time high. Perhaps more importantly, ETH just passed BTC in the metric on August 17th. ETH also just passed BTC in 30 day average transacted value on August 15th: Transferred value, 30 Day Average (CoinMetrics) So by both users and transferred value, ETH is now beating BTC over 30 day rolling averages. It's not the first time ETH has passed BTC in both of these metrics, but as far as I can tell, it is the first time ETH has passed BTC in both of these metrics at the same time . Still, despite all of these positive trends for ETH, a large increase in fees still eludes the network: ETH Fees for Circulating P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) The long term trend for monthly fees paid to transaction validators in ETH has been quite poor over the last 18 months or so. At just $49.7 million in fees for the month of July, the year over year change for July fees was down 47% from $94.6 million last July. Halfway through August, this month isn't looking all that much better with just $24.7 million in fees through the 19th. Meaning if we want to view Ethereum through anything resembling a traditional valuation metric, ETH-USD's 1,008x circulating price to fee multiple is more extended than it has been at any time in the last 5 years. In fact, you'd have to go back to February 2020 to find a time where ETH's P/F valuation was this lofty. Back then, ETH was trading near $300. The coin certainly 'grew into' that valuation given all of the developments in DeFi and stablecoins. But it wasn't a journey without large draw-downs. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust After initially launching with just 292k ETH in AUM, ETH has doubled supply to become a top 4 Ethereum ETF by total holdings. The fund is now within striking distance of overtaking FETH for the third spot by AUM: Fund Name Issuer Expense Ratio AUM iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) iShares 0.25% $14.70B Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHE ) Grayscale 2.50% $4.57B Fidelity Ethereum Fund ETF Fidelity (FMR) 0.25% $3.18B Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF Grayscale 0.15% $2.92B Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ) Bitwise Investments 0.00% $558.42M Source: Seeking Alpha, As of 8/20/25 While it is essentially iShares first and everyone else competing for second place, Grayscale's Ethereum Mini Trust has been a success for both Grayscale and shareholders, from where I sit. In addition to limiting the fee flight supply bleed out of ETHE, the fund has the second best total return of the four major ETH ETFs over the last 6 months. Data by YCharts At a 51.8% total return since late February, Grayscale's mini trust is performing as designed and offers investors a much cheaper option for Ethereum exposure than its legacy Ethereum offering. All this said, spot ETFs that don't offer staking could realistically lose some luster to Ethereum Treasury companies in the public markets. Stocks like SBET and BMNR have been on explosive roller coaster rides since transitioning to ETH-related businesses. And depending on when one wants to start their performance comparison, the stocks have dramatically out-performed and under-performed the spot ETH ETFs like ETH or ETHA. My personal view is Ethereum exposure through the spot ETFs is the better play when mNAV multiples in the Treasury companies get extended. When those multiples are closer to mNAV, the Treasury companies might be more viable opportunities in certain scenarios. Closing Takeaways I remain of the view that Ethereum's fundamental setup is encouraging. Ethereum's daily active numbers are now highly competitive with that of Bitcoin; as is transferred value. The chain has a major lead over smart contract peers in both stablecoins and RWA. The real question is valuation. Despite these seemingly positive trends in usage, fees remain stagnant. Coupled with a 250% surge in coin price since early-April, Ethereum's price to fees ratio is the highest it has been in the last 5 years. That said, we've seen these valuation levels before. The chain had seemingly no real problem growing into its $300 coin price in February 2020 when we last saw these P/F valuations. But it's worth noting nothing moves in a straight line: ETH-USD February 2020 (TrendSpider) After hitting nearly $300 in early February 2020, the price of ETH retraced by nearly 70% in just four weeks. Do I think that can happen again? Unlikely. Recall what was happening during March 2020. By the end of that year, ETH was at $1,000. So even though I see some signs of fatigue in ETH, digital assets, and the equity market more broadly, I wouldn't necessarily be selling too much here. I'll reiterate both ETH-USD and ETH as holds today. But I think any serious dips going forward are likely good long term buys.",BMNR|SBET|ETHA|FETH|ETHE|ETH-USD|ETH,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-21 10:13:07

He’s completely committed to this belief, to the point that he now spends over half his time on crypto projects . Eric Trump has even taken on the nickname of a ‘Bitcoin Maxi,’ which is what people call someone who believes Bitcoin is the only crypto that truly matters. Trump didn’t stop there and doubled down on an earlier prediction that Bitcoin would hit $175K by the end of this year. He also shared personal stories about what he believes is wrong with the traditional money system and how Bitcoin and its underlying technology, blockchain, can fix issues like slow transactions. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) that aim to resolve these issues could now start to bask in the light and receive greater public attention. Interestingly, his comments came right after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made a similar, very positive forecast , showing that some big players in the financial world are getting behind crypto in a big way. American Bitcoin Goes Public Eric Trump isn’t all talk and no trousers, however, as it’s tied to his business. His company, American Bitcoin, is about to go public on the Nasdaq through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining . This deal happened after American Bitcoin merged with another company owned by Eric and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., back in March. The brothers now own a solid 20% of the new company, while the other 80% is owned by a prominent Bitcoin miner called Hut 8. This move to go public clearly indicates that the Trumps are serious about entering the crypto industry. It’s a significant change from their usual business ventures, and how the company performs will be a good sign of how well they can handle this new, often unpredictable market. With the increased interest in Bitcoin, attention in the wider market will shift to projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) that are more accessible to retail investors and still give the opportunity to capitalize on $BTC’s success. Hypercharge Your Bitcoin: The Future Is Here Bitcoin has long been the gold standard of crypto, but it’s been held back by its own success.

This isn’t just another project; it’s the solution to Bitcoin’s biggest problems, turning it from a simple store of value into the ultimate platform for innovation. Bitcoin’s Big-Time Backers When high-profile figures like Eric Trump and the Coinbase CEO begin making bold, bullish predictions about Bitcoin, it signals that crypto is genuinely entering the mainstream. And with the Trump family backing up their words by taking American Bitcoin public on the Nasdaq, actions always speak louder than words. Moves like these always draw attention to innovative projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as investors look for ways to maximize ROI. It’s clear the market is evolving beyond mere speculation, and while it’s exciting to watch, remember to do your own research before investing in any new project.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 10:15:14

The supertrend at $3.06 caps rallies, with upside targets at $3.15 and $3.30 if broken. Modest $2.05M net inflow signals caution, offsetting optimism around Ripple’s brand filing. By Jainam Mehta ​XRP ( XRP-USD ) traded around $2.91 on Thursday, stabilizing after a modest bounce from the $2.80–$2.85 demand zone. The recovery followed a week of fading momentum and lower highs that left price capped beneath layered supply at $2.95–$3.10. Traders remain cautious, as sentiment has improved slightly following renewed attention on Ripple’s legacy trademark, but technical conditions continue to favor a level-to-level market. Technical picture remains fragile The four-hour chart shows XRP moving within a narrow corridor, with Break of Structure (BOS) signals confirming a downtrend through mid-August. The 10,3 Supertrend near $3.06 has acted as dynamic resistance, rejecting multiple attempts at recovery. Until the market secures a close above this level, the bias stays sideways to lower. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Demand remains active at the bottom of the range. Price probed the $2.80–$2.85 band and respected the “strong low” at $2.74, where long lower wicks signaled dip-buying interest. Still, rallies into $2.99–$3.06 have consistently attracted supply. For bulls, acceptance above $3.06 is critical, as it would open a path to $3.14–$3.15 and then $3.28–$3.32. A sustained move over the $3.38 “weak high” would shift the tone decisively bullish.On the downside, a close below $2.80 risks a retest of $2.74, with failure there exposing $2.70–$2.68. These levels remain the battleground as traders weigh whether range behavior evolves into a directional breakout. Flows and sentiment add nuance Spot flow data show a modest $2.05 million net inflow into exchanges at $2.91, reversing the negative netflows that previously supported XRP by reducing circulating supply. Positive inflows suggest some holders may be preparing to sell into rallies, a cautionary signal near resistance. Sustained negative netflows would be the healthier backdrop for bulls seeking a push through $3.06. News around Ripple’s 2013 filing for the XRP service mark has improved community confidence, highlighting brand protection in financial services. While the filing provides institutional clarity, it does not alter XRP’s regulatory status or immediate technical trajectory. For now, price action continues to reflect liquidity dynamics rather than legal milestones. XRP short-term outlook The short-term base case is continued range trading between $2.80 and $3.06, with whipsaws likely near the midrange at $2.94–$2.98. Conservative traders are waiting for a confirmed close above the Supertrend to press longs toward $3.15 and $3.30. Aggressive bears may fade rallies into $2.99–$3.06, though stops above $3.06 are prudent. In earlier XRP coverage, we emphasized the importance of the $2.74–$2.80 demand zone as the line that defines whether the token maintains constructive footing. That framework remains valid. Unless XRP breaks below this shelf, buyers can continue to defend the structure. A decisive close above $3.06, however, is the real signal needed for bulls to regain broader control.

The issuance, announced on X, raised USD1’s total supply to a record $2.4 billion, the token’s largest increase since late April. The April-launched stablecoin is currently the world’s sixth-largest by market capitalization with $2.39 billion. Fed endorsement precedes USD1 mint USD1’s 205 million token minting spree coincided with a speech by Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. As covered by Cryptopolitan earlier this week, Wyoming became the first state to launch a stablecoin . “I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally,” Bowman said Wednesday. She added that stablecoins could also improve retail and cross-border payments. Bowman further highlighted the GENIUS Act, legislation signed into law last month, saying it was “an important step for the payment stablecoin market and could help stablecoins reach their full potential.” USD1 gains ground in global stablecoin market Since its debut, USD1 has steadily ascended, although it is still far behind the sector’s leaders, USDT and USDC. Tether’s USDT commands around 60% of the market with a $167 billion capitalization, while Circle’s USDC holds a 24% share at $67.4 billion. According to data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, World Liberty Financial controls $465.6 million in assets across multiple tokens as of Thursday. The firm’s largest single holding was USD1, with 212.6 million units worth $212.6 million. WLFI holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence Additional assets include 85.4 million AETHUSDT valued at $85.4 million, 32.8 million USDC worth $32.8 million, and 162,692 AETHWBTC with a market value of $18.5 million. The portfolio also contains significant positions in AETHWETH, AETHWSTETH, and AETHUSDC, each valued in the tens of millions. Arkham’s balance history chart shows World Liberty Financial’s wallet holdings hovering between $160 million and $200 million through July, with little deviation. However, a crypto market upturn at the start of August that pushed Bitcoin over the $124,000 level propelled balances above $300 million before settling at roughly $465 million. On August 11, World Liberty Financial announced that ALT5 Sigma , a publicly traded technology company, sold $1.5 billion worth of stock, with the proceeds earmarked for acquiring $WLFI, the cryptocurrency issued by World Liberty. According to securities filings, the arrangement will also see World Liberty receive shares in ALT5 in exchange for $750 million worth of its tokens. The latter company recently refuted allegations that it was under a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation for insider trading and its supposed ties to Live Ventures chief executive Jon Isaac. Treasury eyes stablecoins as buyers of US debt The expansion of USD1 comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pursues efforts to integrate stablecoins into US fiscal strategy. According to people familiar with the matter, Bessent has approached issuers such as Tether and Circle to somehow use their reserves, often backed by US Treasuries, to finance the government’s $36 trillion debt obligation. Bessent reportedly told Wall Street contacts that he expects stablecoins to become a source of demand for Treasuries. These discussions have already influenced the department’s plans to expand sales of short-term bills in the coming quarters. US public finance independent analysts project the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio will reach historic highs over the next decade, exacerbated by increased borrowing under President Donald Trump’s tax reforms.

Kevin O’Leary Explains Paradigm Shift in Bitcoin Mining: Interview,https://cryptonews.com/news/why-go-green-kevin-o-leary-explains-paradigm-shift-in-bitcoin-mining/,"As Bitcoin continues to breach all-time highs, the debate over Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact grows louder. A Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance study found that 52.4% of Bitcoin mining now relies on sustainable energy. Among the firms pushing this transition is Bitzero, backed by Shark Tank investor and entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary aka “Mr Wonderful”. In an interview with Cryptonews, O’Leary and Bitzero CEO Mohammed Bakhashwain outlined why the company is betting on power infrastructure, not price, to shape the future of both Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. “Bitzero started as an idea at the end of 2020,” Bakhashwain recalled. “Our core business is power. The more power we can bring online, the more flexibility we have to allocate it – whether for Bitcoin, AI, or HPC.” He pointed to the company’s large-scale sites in Scandinavia, including one in Finland, that could scale to roughly 1 gigawatt over the next five to six years, and another in Norway with capacity for 300 megawatts. Asked whether BitZero leans more toward Bitcoin mining or AI, Bakhashwain described the company as fundamentally “agnostic.” “Our assets are power envelopes. Right now, AI demand is strongest, and with traditional tech hubs facing shortages, we’re seeing rising interest in remote regions like ours.” For Kevin O’Leary, who invested early in Bitzero, that philosophy was key. “My investment strategy in any asset class is to own the infrastructure as well as the asset itself. If you’re going to own Bitcoin, why not own the picks and shovels that make it happen? That’s power, that’s energy, that’s data centers. Bitzero checks all those boxes.” Sustainable Energy and Mining Efficiency As the industry sees more pressure to go greener, according to Kevin O’Leary, institutions will accelerate that shift. “Some institutions prefer, or demand, that the Bitcoin they buy be mined sustainably,” he explained. “That’s difficult because tagging coins is complex, but the real driver is efficiency. Miners want the most efficient equipment possible for economic reasons, and that forces sustainability forward.” He argued that Bitcoin mining has had a net benefit in driving energy efficiency. “When a coin is created from surplus electricity, as in Bitzero’s Norway site, it’s capturing the value of that energy in perpetuity. It’s pushing compute forward and making it more efficient for everybody.” Bakhashwain added that Bitzero carefully selects sites with surplus power to avoid affecting local communities. “We want to be as people-friendly as possible. That’s why we focus on areas where our consumption doesn’t raise household costs.” O’Leary noted that while nuclear power may eventually play a role, natural gas is driving much of the immediate demand, especially in the U.S. “You can’t just add one gigawatt of demand to a grid and raise everyone’s bills by 25%,” he said. “That’s politically impossible. The solution right now is natural gas.” Bitzero facility in Namsskogan, Norway Keeping Bitcoin Mining Profitable and Green The cyclical halving of Bitcoin reduces rewards and raises questions about mining profitability. Bakhashwain noted, “even now, we have equipment predating the last halving still running profitably,” he said. “It’s about constantly upgrading, optimizing, and managing operations smartly. Efficient sites remain profitable.” O’Leary added that the industry has matured since the 2022 bear market, when many miners faced existential threats. “Back then, they loaded up on leverage with floating rate debt. It wasn’t Bitcoin’s fault – it was poor management. Those “idiot managers” got wiped out, and better managers took over. That’s healthy. It’s the same thing I’ve seen in real estate my whole career.” Huge Room From Institutional Crypto Adoption For O’Leary, Bitcoin’s long-term future is tied to institutional adoption. “Right now, 95% of institutions haven’t allocated to crypto at all,” he said. “And those that have, are allocated through ETFs or treasury stocks.” “If crypto becomes just another alternative asset class like gold, why wouldn’t institutions put 5% of their portfolios in it? The demand could be massive.” That demand is what drives his investment in infrastructure of this asset class. “Energy, permits, fiber, real estate, people – putting it all together is incredibly difficult. Bitzero has proven it can,” O’Leary said. Kevin O’Leary is Finding Ways to Get “Royalties” on Bitcoin Holdings When it comes to his own crypto portfolio, O’Leary sticks to discipline. “I cap my crypto exposure at 20% of my portfolio which is full allocation” he revealed. “We actually had to sell down recently because the run-up pushed us over. That’s our mandate.” Within that allocation, Bitcoin is the cornerstone. “Bitcoin is my granddaddy position – it’s a perpetual holding. Three to five percent is the right allocation for most investors. But Bitcoin doesn’t pay distributions, and that’s what I’m solving for now; finding ways to create yield on my Bitcoin holdings.” He added that new regulations, like the recently passed Genius Act and the upcoming Infrastructure Act, will open the door for new financial products. “There’ll be opportunities to generate “royalties” on Bitcoin.” The post Why Go Green?

Starknet, a leading Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, has officially announced a groundbreaking development: the imminent launch of Starknet Bitcoin staking . This highly anticipated move follows the successful passage of proposal SNIP-31, clearing the way for Bitcoin (BTC) holders to participate in securing the Starknet network and potentially earn rewards in the coming weeks. What Does Starknet Bitcoin Staking Mean for Your Portfolio? The recent approval of SNIP-31 is a significant milestone for Starknet and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This proposal officially clears the path for Starknet to integrate Bitcoin directly into its staking mechanism. Essentially, it means that very soon, you will have the opportunity to stake your Bitcoin on Starknet, actively contributing to its security, decentralization, and overall robustness. This innovative step brings several compelling advantages: Expanded Staking Options: Traditionally, staking opportunities were limited to native tokens of specific proof-of-stake blockchains. This initiative broadens the horizon, offering a novel avenue for Bitcoin holders to put their assets to work. Enhanced Network Security: By allowing Bitcoin, the most secure cryptocurrency, to contribute to its consensus, Starknet significantly strengthens its network’s resilience against attacks and enhances its decentralization. This creates a more robust and trustworthy environment for all users. Potential for Passive Income: While specific reward structures will be detailed closer to launch, staking typically offers participants a chance to earn yield or rewards on their locked assets. This could transform Bitcoin from a purely speculative asset into a productive one within the Starknet ecosystem. The plan outlines a careful approach, setting a 0.25 staking weight for Bitcoin. Importantly, this is capped at 25% of the total consensus power, a strategic limit designed to ensure network stability and prevent any single asset from dominating the consensus mechanism. This balanced approach prioritizes the long-term health of the Starknet network. Which Bitcoin Versions Will Support Starknet Bitcoin Staking? A key aspect of the SNIP-31 proposal is the specific approval of several wrapped Bitcoin tokens for Starknet Bitcoin staking . This is a critical detail because native Bitcoin (BTC) isn’t directly compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment, which Starknet leverages as a Layer 2 solution. Wrapped Bitcoin tokens bridge this compatibility gap, allowing BTC’s value to be represented and utilized on other blockchains. The approved tokens include established and emerging wrapped Bitcoin solutions: Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): The most widely recognized ERC-20 token, fully backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in audited reserves. Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC): Another wrapped Bitcoin variant designed for specific use cases. tBTC: A decentralized, open-source representation of Bitcoin on Ethereum, known for its robust collateralization mechanism. SolvBTC: An innovative solution that aims to provide a more capital-efficient way to represent Bitcoin on EVM-compatible chains. Moreover, the proposal includes robust governance rules for the future inclusion of new wrapped BTC tokens. This forward-thinking framework ensures adaptability and allows Starknet to remain at the forefront of cross-chain interoperability, accommodating future innovations in wrapped asset technology. How Will Starknet Bitcoin Staking Reshape the DeFi Landscape? The integration of Starknet Bitcoin staking has profound and exciting implications for the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Bitcoin, despite being the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has largely functioned as a passive store of value. This groundbreaking move by Starknet allows its immense liquidity to be actively utilized in a productive, yield-generating manner within a vibrant Layer 2 ecosystem. This development could trigger several transformative effects: Significant Increase in Total Value Locked (TVL): The ability to stake Bitcoin on Starknet is expected to attract substantial capital, potentially leading to a massive boost in Starknet’s TVL. This increased liquidity can, in turn, attract more developers and users to the platform. Innovation in DeFi Products: With staked Bitcoin as a foundational asset, developers are likely to create a new wave of innovative DeFi applications. Imagine lending protocols collateralized by staked BTC, new derivatives markets, or even insurance products tailored for Bitcoin stakers. Enhanced Cross-Chain Synergy: This initiative further blur the lines between different blockchain ecosystems, fostering greater collaboration and interoperability. It showcases how Bitcoin’s value can extend beyond its native chain, contributing to the growth of other networks. As reported by JinSe Finance, the precise details of implementation will unfold in the coming weeks. The cryptocurrency community eagerly anticipates further announcements on how users can participate in this exciting new chapter for Starknet, which promises to redefine Bitcoin’s role in the decentralized economy. In conclusion, Starknet’s strategic decision to enable Starknet Bitcoin staking marks a truly pivotal moment for both the network and the wider crypto industry. By unlocking Bitcoin’s immense staking potential through carefully approved wrapped tokens and a well-defined governance framework, Starknet is poised to attract significant liquidity and foster innovative DeFi solutions. This move not only enhances Starknet’s security and decentralization but also offers Bitcoin holders unprecedented new avenues for earning rewards, truly integrating the king of crypto into the vibrant Layer 2 ecosystem. This is a powerful step towards a more interconnected and productive blockchain future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Starknet Bitcoin staking? Starknet Bitcoin staking is the process of locking up wrapped Bitcoin tokens (like WBTC, tBTC, SolvBTC) on the Starknet network to help secure it and potentially earn rewards, following the successful passage of proposal SNIP-31. Why can’t I stake native Bitcoin directly on Starknet? Starknet, as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, operates within an EVM-compatible environment. Native Bitcoin (BTC) is not directly compatible with this, so wrapped versions of Bitcoin are used to bridge the asset to the Starknet network. Which wrapped Bitcoin tokens are approved for staking? The SNIP-31 proposal specifically approves Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC), tBTC, and SolvBTC for staking on Starknet. The framework also allows for future inclusion of other wrapped BTC tokens. What are the benefits of staking Bitcoin on Starknet? Benefits include expanded staking opportunities for Bitcoin holders, enhanced security and decentralization for the Starknet network, and the potential to earn passive income or rewards on your Bitcoin holdings. When will Starknet Bitcoin staking go live? Starknet announced that the proposal has passed and the launch of Bitcoin staking is expected in the coming weeks, with specific details on participation to be released soon.

Did A Nation Buy 200,000 Bitcoin Secretly? He added: “Or, you know, our country just bought 200,000 Bitcoin and we did so very quietly. We don’t want anybody to know about it, but that’s how much we believe in the asset.” Trump offered no name, timeline or documentation, and framed the remark as an anecdote from conversations with global leaders. The figure — 200,000 BTC, roughly $22 billion at recent prices — instantly ricocheted across social platforms and crypto trading chats. Trump’s broader narrative fused a personal conversion story with a muscular forecast for the asset. “Guys, I am a hard-asset guy…I always joked [to Michael Saylor ] if I can’t feel it, if I can’t touch it, if I can’t see it, it kind of wasn’t for me,” he said, recounting how a wave of debankings against his family’s businesses and crypto operators pushed him into the industry. “I probably spend over 50% of my time in crypto,” he added, calling the current backdrop “the best [regulatory environment] it’s ever been” and declaring that BTC is “on the one-yard line,” with growth over the next six months “explosive” and the next decade “amazing.” While calling himself a “Bitcoin maxi,” he reiterated his price targets: “There is no doubt about Bitcoin reaching $1 million,” adding that “it is expected to reach $175,000 by the end of this year.” Pressed on geopolitics, he described a “digital land grab” by sovereign wealth funds and corporates moving to add BTC to treasury reserves. “In ways that you can’t even imagine,” he said, before recounting a Greenwich private-banker friend who once derided BTC as “funny money” but later called asking how to buy — at triple the price. Trump argued that the convergence of debanking risk, inflation stress in emerging markets and the frictions of the legacy payments system is accelerating institutional and retail adoption: “We could pop up a wallet and I could transfer $100 million of Bitcoin…in two seconds,” he said, contrasting it with a year-long commercial real-estate sale process. The “200,000 BTC” number is especially charged because it echoes — but is not the same as — estimates of government-controlled wallets already in public view. It is estimated that the US government’s seized holdings have hovered around that magnitude and have been discussed in the context of the administration’s strategic bitcoin reserve framework. American Bitcoin In The Focus The panel also focused on an inside look at American Bitcoin, the Trump-backed mining-plus-treasury vehicle being carved out with Hut 8. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot laid out the operating math: last quarter, he said, energy cost to mine a bitcoin averaged about $37,000, with all-in cost near $57,000, positioning the operation at a steep discount to spot purchases. Hut 8 currently manages around a gigawatt of capacity with additional sites under exclusivity and a multi-gigawatt pipeline, he added, arguing that vertical integration lets American Bitcoin “be this pure-play mining business that gets vertically integrated economics without the overhang of a large fixed management team.” He emphasized discipline over scale for scale’s sake, likening capital allocation to oil and gas: if new rigs (ASICs) don’t beat simply buying BTC over the machine’s life, they don’t buy. American Bitcoin’s go-public plans were another throughline. Hut 8 has already disclosed that its majority-owned subsidiary intends to list on Nasdaq under the ticker ABTC via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining , with shareholder votes slated for late August and closing targeted for early September, subject to approvals. The company’s filings and subsequent coverage frame the vehicle as a “premier bitcoin accumulation platform,” with Hut 8 retaining a controlling stake. Recent investor materials have also highlighted that American Bitcoin purchased 1,726 BTC in Q2 as it ramps its treasury strategy. At press time, BTC traded at $113,845.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Eric Trump,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 12:00:00

This massive stablecoin issuance immediately caught the attention of market observers, signaling potential shifts in liquidity and and demand within the digital asset ecosystem. Understanding the implications of such large transactions is crucial for anyone following crypto trends. What Does This Massive USDC Minting Mean? When we talk about USDC minted , we refer to the creation of new units of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. USDC is issued by Circle and Coinbase through the Centre Consortium, aiming to provide a stable, transparent, and regulated digital dollar for the internet age. The minting process involves Circle receiving fiat currency (USD) and, in turn, creating an equivalent amount of USDC on the blockchain. Increased Supply: A 250 million USDC minting means an immediate injection of a quarter of a billion dollars in digital form into the crypto economy. Meeting Demand: Typically, such large mints occur in response to significant demand from institutional investors, exchanges, or large over-the-counter (OTC) desks looking to acquire stablecoins for various purposes. Market Liquidity: More USDC in circulation often translates to increased liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and centralized exchanges. Why Do We See Such Large USDC Minted Events? The primary driver behind the continuous USDC minted activity is market demand. As the crypto ecosystem expands, so does the need for a reliable, dollar-pegged asset that can facilitate trading, lending, and other financial activities without the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Several factors contribute to this demand: Institutional Inflows: Large institutions often use stablecoins as a gateway to enter and exit crypto positions, providing a stable medium for large-volume transactions. DeFi Growth: The booming decentralized finance sector heavily relies on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols. More activity in DeFi often correlates with more USDC minting. Exchange Activity: Traders and investors on centralized exchanges frequently use stablecoins to park funds, buy other cryptocurrencies, or manage risk during volatile periods. Global Reach: USDC offers a fast and efficient way to transfer dollar value globally, bypassing traditional banking systems, which appeals to businesses and individuals alike. The Ripple Effect: How Does 250 Million USDC Impact the Market? The creation of 250 million USDC minted can have several downstream effects on the broader crypto market. While stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, their issuance patterns can provide insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, plays a vital role in reporting these large transactions, offering transparency to the community. An increase in USDC supply often suggests that market participants are preparing to deploy capital. This capital might be used to: Buy Cryptocurrencies: Investors might convert their newly acquired USDC into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins, potentially leading to upward price pressure. Provide Liquidity: Funds could be channeled into liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges, enhancing trading efficiency and reducing slippage. Engage in Lending: The USDC could be lent out on platforms to earn yield, contributing to the overall health and activity of the DeFi ecosystem. It is important to remember that minting does not automatically mean buying pressure. Sometimes, it signifies that funds are being moved to facilitate large over-the-counter deals or simply to increase the treasury’s reserves to meet future demand. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: What’s Next for USDC? The consistent activity of USDC minted highlights its growing importance as a cornerstone of the digital economy. As the regulatory landscape for stablecoins evolves globally, USDC’s commitment to transparency and attestations of its reserves positions it favorably. This latest minting event underscores the ongoing expansion of the crypto market and the increasing sophistication of institutional participation. Observing these large stablecoin movements provides valuable clues about market liquidity and potential future trends. While no single minting event guarantees a specific market outcome, the cumulative effect of such activities paints a picture of growing demand and a maturing ecosystem. Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of USDC Minting The recent report of 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury is more than just a number; it is a significant indicator of robust demand for dollar-pegged digital assets. This event reflects the ongoing expansion of the crypto market, driven by institutional interest, DeFi growth, and the global need for efficient value transfer. As stablecoins like USDC continue to bridge traditional finance with the decentralized world, monitoring their supply dynamics remains a crucial aspect of understanding the broader crypto landscape. Stay informed, and watch how these powerful shifts unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It is issued by Circle and Coinbase through the Centre Consortium, backed by reserves of fiat currency and short-term US Treasury bonds, ensuring its stability. Q2: Why is USDC minted? A2: USDC is minted in response to market demand. When individuals or institutions deposit fiat currency (USD) with Circle, an equivalent amount of USDC is created on the blockchain. This process ensures that every USDC in circulation is backed by an actual dollar. Q3: How does USDC minting affect the crypto market? A3: Large USDC minting events often indicate increased demand for stablecoins, which can signal potential future buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies, increased liquidity in DeFi protocols, or preparations for large over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Q4: Is USDC a safe stablecoin? A4: USDC is considered one of the most transparent and regulated stablecoins. Its reserves are regularly audited and attested to by independent accounting firms, aiming to ensure that each USDC is fully backed and redeemable. Q5: Who is Whale Alert? A5: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking and analytics service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains, providing real-time insights into significant movements by large holders, often referred to as “whales.” Did this article help you understand the significance of large USDC minting events?

The effort is aimed at steering major Chinese tech groups away from the H20 chip , a cut-down processor that has become common in local AI projects. People familiar with the matter said three agencies responded after Lutnick’s comments last month. “We don’t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best,” Lutnick told CNBC in July. Two people said some senior leaders in China viewed the remarks as “insulting”, prompting policymakers to look for ways to deter purchases. Hence, several tech groups in China either paused or sharply cut planned H20 chip orders, based on comments by sources aware of the situation. Nvidia still has appeal in China Following Huang’s warm welcome in China during his last trip, Chinese customers took a lot of interest in the H20 chips. Their interest was strong enough that Nvidia told TSMC to reopen production lines for the H20 chips. Regulators have asked for increased use of chips produced domestically recently, but groups from ByteDance to Alibaba had argued their AI work would suffer without Nvidia hardware, hurting China’s chances in its technology race with the west. Sources close to those companies told the Financial Times that attitudes are now shifting, specifically, for “inference,” the stage when AI systems answer user requests. That change followed broader testing and chip adoption from domestic makers, including Cambricon and Huawei after Washington initially put a ban on the export of the H20 chips. “Lutnick’s speech gives the coalition [of regulators] one more reason to intensify its efforts to push tech firms to use China’s own chips,” said a person close to the policymakers. CAC asked companies to abandon Nvidia’s H20 chips following Lutnick’s comments About 7 days after Lutnick’s remarks, the CAC issued informal “window guidance” to large platforms, including Alibaba and ByteDance, referring to concerns of security. The agency also asked the companies to pause their orders of chips. The CAC said in a statement that AI pros from the US revealed that Nvidia’s chips come with a location tracking functionality and could be remotely shut down. However, Nvidia has disputed this claim strongly. MIIT also spoke informally with tech executives from China to solidify the stance by CAC, one person said. The NDRC, the state planner leading the drive for independence in technology, then sent out its guidance asking companies to refrain from buying all chips from Nvidia, which included the H20. The NDRC has long been tasked with the promotion of chip independence, along with providing help to domestic companies, including Huawei, to acquire space in the market. CAC’s involvement has increased pressure on tech companies to focus on compliance, even though the directions remain sort of informal. If the watchdog issues penalties, it would choke daily operations. Despite calls from some in Washington for tighter curbs, Trump has made it clear that he could allow a lesser version of the Nvidia Blackwell chips for exports to China along with the H20 chips. Some Chinese firms have delayed H20 orders Some tech companies in China have delayed H20 orders while they wait to see whether a Blackwell chip specific to China with potentially better performance will be offered, people said. Some policymakers from Beijing are also trying to place a ban on chips made in foreign companies altogether for inference, which contributes to most of the demand in AI. However, local supply is limited. Still Beijing is hoping that the upcoming production lines coming next year will ease the shortage. The foreign ministry of China stated, “As a matter of principle, science, technology, and economic and trade issues should not be politicised, instrumentalised, or weaponised. Containment and suppression will not hold back China’s development.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech|CNY|DeepSeek|Huawei|Nvidia|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-21 12:00:28

This new crypto token presale hopes to change the game by allowing ordinary people to have access to industrial Bitcoin mining without the need for large upfront fees or technical expertise. It’s not simply another name on the big crypto presale lists . Bitfrac is developing a realistic infrastructure that will provide passive income for everybody, not just institutions. Industrial Bitcoin Mining Without the Complexity Industrial-scale Bitcoin mining has long been the realm of IT companies, hedge funds, and early adopters. Ordinary investors cannot afford or maintain the necessary specialized technology, secure facilities, and access to ultra-low-cost power. Bitfrac simplifies this process by tokenizing. Each Bitfrac token represents a fractional stake in the company’s mining operations. This implies that investors are not purchasing random assets but rather obtaining exposure to genuine, revenue-generating infrastructure. These enterprises employ cutting-edge ASIC miners like the Bitmain S19 XP and Whatsminer M50S. Efficiency is crucial in mining, and Bitfrac provides 24-hour monitoring to maintain uptime above 99%. With a hash rate capacity of 2.5 EH/s and a daily BTC generation of around 8.2 coins, these data demonstrate scale and sustainability. This is not a gamble. It is the foundation of a cryptocurrency presale based on real performance indicators rather than promises. Dual Revenue Model Maximizes Token Utility While most presale crypto tokens rely on a single source of revenue or hype-based valuation, Bitfrac has adopted a more strategic approach: two complementary income streams. The first stream is simple: high-efficiency Bitcoin mining operations. Bitfrac mines BTC at a lesser cost than other rivals because it uses cutting-edge gear in optimal energy zones. This technique generates predicted net mining earnings of more than $14 million each month. But that’s only part of the tale. The second revenue stream comes from facility hosting services. Bitfrac leases space and power to institutional customers that bring their own mining equipment. This delivers consistent monthly revenue, regardless of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. With an anticipated monthly net profit of $892,000 from hosting alone, Bitfrac ensures durability even during weak markets. Together, these streams provide Bitfrac token holders with exposure to both upside and stability—an uncommon combination in the world of cryptocurrency presales. Your Early Access to Passive Mining Profits The Bitfrac token presale allows early adopters to capitalize on this dual-income possibility. Stage 1 of the new token presale is priced at $0.017 per token, with a limited 20% early bird incentive for quick buyers. Out of the $2 million objective for this round, it has already raised over $1.88M, indicating great early traction. This is your opportunity to own a piece of the infrastructure, not just the result. Profits will be given monthly, and plans are already in place to install mining rigs at energy-efficient worldwide locations. No technological skills are necessary. Simply hold the tokens and let the system operate for you. With only a few days until the next pricing level begins, now is the chance to purchase presale cryptocurrency with real-world support. Why Bitfrac Stands Out Among the New Crypto Presales In a sea of speculative cryptocurrency presales, Bitfrac distinguishes itself by providing something tangible: ownership of real mining gear and passive revenue paid in Bitcoin. While many presale cryptocurrencies offer usefulness, Bitfrac provides functionality from the start. Token holders do not have to wait for an app or a marketplace; they may start earning money as soon as mining begins. This concept converts the token from a bet to an asset that works for you. Whether you’re comparing alternatives from the most recent cryptocurrency presale list , Bitfrac makes a strong argument. It fills the void between cryptocurrency excitement and utility by creating an ecosystem built for durability, size, and fairness. As Bitcoin grows more expensive to acquire outright, fractional mining provides an alternative—one that is wiser, more sustainable, and revenue-generating. And Bitfrac just made that road available to everyone. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

He indirectly admitted he was wrong and outlined reasons why his prediction fell through. Harvard Economist Breaks Silence On Missed Bitcoin Prediction In an X post, Rogoff identified himself as the Harvard economist who said that Bitcoin was more likely to be worth $100 than $100,000. He then went on to comment on what he missed when he made this prediction. First, the economist said that he was far too optimistic about the U.S. coming to its senses about sensible crypto regulation. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Predicts The Collapse Of Bitcoin In This Timeframe Rogoff, who was the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), indicated that the Donald Trump administration has gone about Bitcoin and crypto regulation in the wrong way. He questioned why policymakers would want to facilitate tax evasion and illegal activities, likely in reference to regulations such as the GENIUS Act, which have provided regulatory clarity. It is worth mentioning that one of the reasons the Harvard economist had predicted that Bitcoin was more likely to go to $100 was based on his belief that government regulation would trigger lower prices. He had made this prediction when BTC was trading at around $11,000. Rogoff claimed back then that the flagship crypto needed global regulation to crack down on its use for money laundering. The former IMF chief believed that if this regulation took away the possibility of money laundering and tax evasion, then Bitcoin’s actual use cases for transactions were very small. As such, he was banking on BTC lacking any demand, which would drive its price lower rather than higher. However, that hasn’t been the case as government regulation has only boosted Bitcoin’s demand. The flagship crypto rallied to $100,000, a price level Rogoff said it won’t reach, for the first time last year following Donald Trump’s victory. Meanwhile, BTC has reached new highs on the back of regulatory clarity, including its rally to a previous all-time high (ATH) just before the passage of the GENIUS Act last month. Further Reasons For The Missed Prediction The Harvard economist also stated that he did not appreciate how Bitcoin would compete with fiat currencies to serve as the transaction medium of choice in the $20 trillion global underground economy. He further remarked that this demand puts a floor on its price. Related Reading: Two Scenarios Map Out Bitcoin Price Crash After Recovery In addition to being a transaction medium of choice, BTC has also gained a reputation as a store of value, which has created demand for it among traditional finance (TradFi) investors. These investors have gained exposure to Bitcoin mainly through the ETFs. Interestingly, Harvard recently revealed a $117 million stake in BlackRock’s BTC ETF. Lastly, Rogoff said that he did not anticipate a situation where regulators, especially the regulator in chief, would be able to brazenly hold hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in crypto without consequence, considering the “blatant conflict of interest.” At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $113,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here's Why!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-government-wallet-acquires-ethereum-eth-from-coinbase-heres-why/,"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national Bitcoin (BTC) reserve in March. Trump announced that the reserve would include Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA), in addition to Bitcoin. While the Bitcoin and altcoin reserve in question consists of Bitcoin and altcoins seized by the government, it was stated that no other assets will be purchased. Related News: What Does Trump's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Order Mean for XRP, Solana, and Other Altcoins? At this point, while the US Government had Bitcoin and Ethereum in its possession, there was ETH movement in the US government wallets. According to a post by On Chainlens, the official US government wallet received $332,000 worth of ETH from Coinbase just hours ago. The data suggests these funds are linked to the 2021 Uranium Finance hack. Accordingly, US authorities recovered 76.56 ETH from the 2021 Uranium Finance attack, and Coinbase assisted in this asset transfer. What Happened? The Uranium Finance protocol was hacked in April 2021, and millions of dollars were stolen. However, years later, the incident still has an impact. US authorities managed to seize $31 million linked to this attack in February 2025. A recent Ethereum transfer from Coinbase is part of the recovered assets, proving that recovery efforts are ongoing even years after the hack. While the amount of Ethereum taken by the wallet labeled “Funds Hijacked by Uranium Finance Hacker” appears modest, it has attracted attention due to the government's efforts to recover ETH seized as a result of the hack. Following the latest login, the US government address currently holds 1,358 ETH, worth approximately $5.83 million. The wallet also contains several more digital tokens, bringing its total balance to approximately $34.71 million. The wallet labeled “Funds Compromised by Uranium Finance Hacker” contains other altcoins besides Ethereum, with a total balance reaching approximately $34.61 million. An official wallet belonging to the U.S. Government received 76.56 $ETH from #Coinbase , worth $332K. Back in April 2021, Uranium Finance was targeted in an exploit, leading to a major asset seizure of $31M by the U.S. Government in February 2025. https://t.co/olHTF8ZCiW … pic.twitter.com/ICEDqOUtho — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) August 21, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

Onchain analytics firm Glassnode said current trends echo previous cycles and suggest the market may be further along than many believe. “From a cyclical perspective, BTC price action also echoes prior patterns,” the firm wrote, noting that long-term holders — investors who hold coins for more than 155 days — are taking profits at levels comparable to past euphoric stages. Demand Weakens as Traders Chase Volatility Signs of fatigue are emerging in Bitcoin demand, Glassnode observed. Spot BTC ETFs have seen outflows of around $975 million over the last four trading sessions, according to Farside Investors. At the same time, Bitcoin has retreated 8.3% from its mid-August record of $124,128 to around $113,940, CoinMarketCap data shows. This cooling appetite has pushed traders toward speculative bets. Glassnode highlighted that open interest across major altcoins briefly touched a record $60 billion before correcting with a $2.5 billion pullback. The firm said that if history is a guide, Bitcoin’s highs could still arrive in the coming months. In both the 2018 and 2022 cycles, peak prices were recorded only two to three months beyond where the market currently stands when measured from the previous cycle low. Independent analyst Rekt Capital also noted in July that if BTC mirrors its 2020 trajectory, the market peak could come in October — about 550 days after the April 2024 halving. Growing Debate Over the Bitcoin Cycle’s Relevance Still, not everyone is convinced the halving cycle remains the dominant force. Several executives and investors argue that rising institutional demand, particularly through public company treasuries and ETFs, could alter the timeline. On Aug. 10, investor Jason Williams said the top 100 treasury companies now hold close to one million Bitcoin , citing data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET that values corporate holdings at over $112 billion. This, he argued, makes the current cycle structurally different. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan echoed this sentiment, declaring in July that “the BTC cycle is dead.” He expects Bitcoin to enjoy an “up year” in 2026 , suggesting that macroeconomic factors, especially a favorable interest rate environment, may now outweigh the traditional halving rhythm.

A staggering 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury marks a notable event in the stablecoin landscape. What does this massive injection of stablecoin mean for the broader crypto market and its participants? What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Signify? When USDC is minted , it means new units of the USD Coin stablecoin are created and added to circulation. This process is typically backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars or highly liquid cash equivalents held in reserves. Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain transaction tracker, highlighted this substantial creation of USDC minted tokens. Creation of New Supply: The minting indicates that new USDC tokens are being introduced into the market, increasing the total circulating supply. Demand Indicator: Large mints often suggest a rising demand for stablecoins, perhaps from institutions or large investors looking to enter the crypto market or increase their stablecoin holdings. Treasury Activity: The USDC Treasury acts as a central hub for the issuance and redemption of USDC, reflecting the operational flow of this major stablecoin. How Do Stablecoins Impact Crypto Liquidity? Stablecoins like USDC are vital components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They aim to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. This stability makes them crucial for several reasons, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. Trading Facilitation: Stablecoins allow traders to quickly move in and out of volatile cryptocurrencies without converting back to fiat, thus reducing transaction times and costs. DeFi Backbone: They are the primary collateral and medium of exchange in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, powering lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Global Remittances: Stablecoins offer a fast and low-cost method for international money transfers, bypassing traditional banking systems. Therefore, a large influx of USDC minted can have wide-ranging effects on market liquidity and activity. What Are the Potential Market Implications of This USDC Minting? The creation of 250 million USDC minted tokens suggests a potential increase in liquidity within the crypto market. This new supply of stablecoin could indicate several things, signaling shifts in market sentiment or operational needs. Increased Buying Power: More USDC in circulation means more stable capital available for purchasing cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to upward price movements if this capital is deployed. Institutional Inflow: Large mints sometimes precede significant institutional investments as these entities often prefer to accumulate stablecoins before deploying capital into volatile assets. DeFi Expansion: An increase in USDC supply can fuel growth in DeFi protocols, offering more capital for liquidity pools, lending platforms, and other decentralized applications. Observing such substantial amounts of USDC minted provides valuable insights into the broader financial flows within the digital asset space. Navigating Stablecoin Trust and Transparency: A Key Challenge While the USDC minted event highlights growth, it also brings focus to the importance of stablecoin transparency. Users and institutions rely on stablecoins to be fully backed and regularly audited. This trust is paramount for the stability and integrity of the crypto market. Circle, the issuer of USDC, provides monthly attestation reports from independent accounting firms. These reports aim to verify that every USDC minted token is indeed backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets held in reserves. Maintaining this transparency helps build confidence and ensures the long-term viability of stablecoins as a crucial financial instrument in the digital economy. The recent 250 million USDC minted at the Treasury is more than just a large number; it signifies ongoing demand and evolving dynamics within the stablecoin sector. This event underscores the growing integration of stablecoins into the mainstream financial landscape, providing crucial liquidity and stability. As the crypto market matures, understanding these movements becomes increasingly important for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does “USDC minted” mean? When USDC is minted , it means new units of the USD Coin stablecoin are created and added to circulation. This process is typically backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars or highly liquid cash equivalents held in reserves. 2. Who is responsible for minting USDC? USDC is primarily issued by Circle, a regulated financial technology company, in collaboration with Coinbase, through the Centre Consortium. They ensure that each USDC minted token is backed by reserves. 3. Why is 250 million USDC minted significant? The minting of such a large sum, like 250 million USDC minted , often indicates significant demand for stablecoin liquidity in the market. It can signal impending large-scale trading activities, institutional interest, or a general increase in crypto market participation. 4. How does USDC minting affect the broader crypto market? Increased USDC minted supply can enhance market liquidity, making it easier for traders to enter and exit positions. It can also fuel activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and potentially indicate bullish sentiment if new capital is entering the ecosystem. 5. Is USDC considered a safe stablecoin? USDC is generally considered one of the most transparent and regulated stablecoins. Its issuers provide monthly attestation reports from independent accounting firms to verify that every USDC minted token is fully backed by reserves. Did you find this analysis helpful?

In a widely discussed X post, he warned investors against believing sensationalist claims that a few hundred dollars’ worth of XRP can yield life-changing wealth. “You will not be rich from a $500 XRP investment,” he wrote, adding that a minimum of $10,000 in XRP is more realistic for anyone hoping to see substantial profits. His statement directly counters the narrative pushed by certain influencers who promote unrealistic expectations to draw views. The Math Behind the Warning At today’s price of about $2.90 per token, $500 buys roughly 172 XRP. If XRP were to rally to $10, that stake would be worth approximately $1,724—a decent return, but far from the “life-changing” figures some influencers suggest. I’m sick of tired of the view bait posts misleading the #XRP community. You will not be rich from a $500 $XRP investment. Get to at least $10,000 in $XRP minimum to see real profits. Stop believing these “XRP” influencers and use common sense. — Crypto Jack (@That_CryptoNerd) August 21, 2025 By contrast, a $10,000 allocation secures around 3,448 XRP, which at the same $10 target would amount to more than $34,000. This straightforward comparison highlights why Crypto Jack emphasizes larger, well-considered allocations over small speculative bets. Market Realities: Supply and Valuation Part of the disconnect between expectations and reality comes from overlooking XRP’s large supply. With a circulating supply of roughly 59 billion tokens, every price milestone translates into massive market capitalization figures. At $20 per XRP, the market cap would be over $1.1 trillion; at $100, it would soar to nearly $6 trillion. Such valuations would require levels of adoption and capital inflow far beyond the current crypto market’s scale. While XRP is one of the most liquid digital assets and has strong use cases in cross-border settlement, these numbers illustrate the challenge of achieving extreme price targets. XRP’s Position in the Market Despite the hype, XRP continues to hold a strong position in the digital asset space. The token remains among the top in daily trading volume, with deep liquidity across major exchanges. Market infrastructure is also maturing. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A recent CFTC filing confirmed that a U.S. exchange is preparing to launch cash-settled XRP futures contracts, a development that strengthens institutional access and hedging opportunities. This demonstrates that, while retail speculation often dominates the narrative, serious market participants are increasingly building tools around XRP. A Balanced Approach for Investors Crypto Jack’s message is ultimately one of pragmatism. Smaller positions can still deliver meaningful returns when compounded with patience and disciplined strategies like dollar-cost averaging. However, expecting a $500 allocation to generate generational wealth is unrealistic. Investors are better served by sizing their positions thoughtfully, diversifying across assets, and aligning expectations with actual market dynamics. In doing so, they protect themselves from the emotional swings that come with overhyped price predictions. Final Thoughts Crypto Jack’s remarks struck a chord because they blend realism with practical advice. The truth is that XRP has potential, but wealth generation in crypto is rarely the product of a single small bet. As the ecosystem matures, disciplined allocation and sober expectations will remain more powerful than viral posts promising overnight riches. For those serious about long-term profit, Crypto Jack’s words offer a timely reminder: math and strategy—not hype—should guide investment decisions.

With Q4 in motion, attention is on whether INJ can muster enough strength to reclaim higher ground and potentially retest the $20 level. This analysis looks at Injective’s current technical setup and what factors could drive its next decisive move. Injective (INJ) Displays Mixed Signals Amid Price Struggles Source: tradingview Injective (INJ) is navigating choppy waters with its current price between nearly $14 and $17. The coin faces a tough ceiling at $18, while finding some ground just above $12. Lately, the price has dipped by more than 10% in a week, showing a weakening trend over the month and the past six months as well. Despite the current downturn, if market conditions improve, there is potential for growth. INJ could surge over 25% to the next major resistance at $21. However, with an RSI of 38, the coin is not oversold yet, leaving plenty of room for potential upward momentum if the bulls take charge. Conclusion Despite recent declines, Injective’s support near $12 and resistance around $18–$21 provide a clear roadmap for potential recovery. With its RSI still leaving room for upward momentum, a rebound toward $20 remains on the table if buying pressure picks up. While caution is warranted given recent weakness, INJ could still surprise with a late-year push, making it one to watch closely through Q4.

This isn’t just a number; it signals potentially big shifts in the cryptocurrency landscape. Understanding this substantial USDC minting is crucial for anyone following digital asset trends and market liquidity. What Does This Massive USDC Minting Mean? When new USDC is minted, it essentially means that Circle, the issuer of USDC, has added an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars to its reserves. This process ensures that each USDC token remains pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, maintaining its stability. The recent 250 million USDC minted transaction, as highlighted by Whale Alert, indicates a strong demand for this leading stablecoin in the market. Increased Liquidity: More USDC in circulation typically translates to increased liquidity across various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and centralized exchanges. This can facilitate smoother trading and larger transactions. Market Demand: Large minting events often reflect a rising demand for stablecoins. Traders use stablecoins for various purposes, including trading, lending, or simply as a safe haven during periods of market volatility. Treasury Activity: The USDC Treasury acts as the central hub for issuing and burning USDC. Its activity provides valuable insights into the overall health and growth of the stablecoin ecosystem. Why is USDC Minting Important for the Crypto Market? The act of USDC minting directly impacts market dynamics. Stablecoins like USDC serve as a vital bridge between traditional finance and the volatile cryptocurrency world. They allow traders to lock in gains or prepare for new investments without converting back to fiat currency, thereby reducing friction and costs. Moreover, the influx of 250 million USDC minted can indicate several underlying market sentiments. For instance, institutional investors often utilize stablecoins for large-scale transfers and as a base currency for their crypto strategies. Therefore, a significant mint suggests potential institutional interest or large capital movements entering the digital asset space. Consider how this new liquidity can flow. It might be directed towards purchasing other cryptocurrencies, participating in DeFi yield farming, or simply sitting on exchanges, ready for the next market opportunity. This makes monitoring USDC minting events a key part of comprehensive market analysis. Potential Impacts of 250 Million USDC Minted The immediate impact of such a large USDC minting event is often seen in increased trading volume and potential price movements for other cryptocurrencies. When a substantial amount of stablecoin enters the market, it often signals an intention to deploy capital, rather than just holding it. Buying Pressure: Newly minted USDC can be used to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or various altcoins, potentially creating upward price pressure across the market. DeFi Growth: A boost in USDC supply can fuel growth in DeFi applications, as users seek out lending, borrowing, and staking opportunities to earn yield. Market Confidence: Consistent minting, especially in large sums, can signify growing confidence in the stablecoin’s stability and the broader crypto market’s potential for expansion. However, it is important to note that minting alone does not guarantee a bull run. Sometimes, large stablecoin inflows are used to cover short positions or for arbitrage opportunities. Always analyze these events in conjunction with other market indicators for a complete picture. Navigating the Dynamics of USDC Minting For investors and enthusiasts, understanding the implications of events like USDC minting is crucial. This recent 250 million USDC minted transaction serves as a powerful reminder that stablecoin movements are significant indicators of underlying market activity. Always consider the broader context and other market signals. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Whale Alert: Keep an eye on reports from services like Whale Alert for large transactions across various blockchains. Check Exchange Balances: Observe stablecoin balances on major exchanges; a significant rise might indicate an intent to buy other assets. Analyze Funding Rates: In perpetual futures markets, funding rates can offer clues about market sentiment and potential short-term movements following large stablecoin inflows. Ultimately, these events highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Being informed allows you to make more strategic decisions and better anticipate market shifts. In conclusion, the recent report of 250 million USDC minted at the Treasury is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal. This substantial USDC minting event points to increased demand for stablecoins, greater liquidity in the market, and potential shifts in investment flows. While it doesn’t guarantee specific outcomes, it certainly merits close attention from anyone navigating the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. Stay informed, and always conduct your own research to understand the full picture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “USDC minted” mean?

With its price hovering in a tight range, traders are watching closely to see if S can flip resistance into support and carve out a recovery path. This analysis breaks down Sonic’s key technical levels and evaluates whether it could become one of the top undervalued coins in the current market. Sonic Coin's Bumpy Ride Shows Hopes of a Bounce Source: tradingview Sonic (S) is wobbling between $0.30 and $0.35, hinting at some market struggle. The past week witnessed a small dip, down nearly 4%, while the last month's fall reached close to 23%. The coin sits below a key resistance at $0.37, with another hurdle looming at $0.42. Support is found at $0.27 and $0.23 if things go south. Despite a gloomy half-year drop of about 65%, the coin's movement could shift. If Sonic breaks past $0.37 and climbs towards $0.42, we might see a growth of over 20%. With careful traction in place, there's room for positive momentum if trends align favorably. Conclusion Despite heavy losses over the past months, Sonic’s support at $0.27 and $0.23 provides a foundation for potential stabilization. A breakout above $0.37, followed by $0.42, could trigger a rebound of 20% or more, signaling renewed investor confidence. If momentum shifts in its favor, S could transform from a struggling asset into an overlooked contender within the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

Back then, President Trump’s official coin (TRUMP) and the MELANIA token shot up to record highs before people started selling to take profits. This comeback could happen because Eric Trump, President Donald Trump’s son, believes Bitcoin will eventually hit over $1 million. Speaking at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday, Eric revealed he now dedicates over 50% of his time to cryptocurrency ventures and remains steadfast in his prediction that BTC will hit $175,000 per token by the close of 2025. NEW: @EricTrump builds the case for a $1M #Bitcoin price live in Wyoming. ""There's no question that #Bitcoin hits one million bucks."" pic.twitter.com/1dfxp1DoRX — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) August 20, 2025 This positive outlook is making investors excited about Trump-related meme coins again. Bitcoin Price Impact on Presidential Meme Coins During January’s rally, the TRUMP memecoin peaked at $75.35 with a market capitalization surpassing $15 billion, securing its position as the third most valuable memecoin at that time. However, the token has since endured substantial selling pressure, declining more than 85% from its peak. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently trading at $8.66 as of this writing, it holds the sixth position among meme coins with a market valuation of approximately $1.73 billion. The MELANIA memecoin has experienced an even steeper decline, plummeting 98% from its $13.73 high to trade at $0.2082, with a modest market cap of $175 million. Nevertheless, Eric’s recent market optimism could shift these dynamics, as meme coins typically benefit substantially from extended Bitcoin rallies when market gains rotate into lower-cap tokens, making them easier to drive higher. Technical Bitcoin Price Prediction On the technical front, the TRUMPUSDT daily chart shows that the market established a bottom around the $8 zone and has since been trading sideways within a consolidation channel between roughly $8 and $12. The repeated bounces off the lower boundary suggest strong support, while the upper range at $11.98 acts as a firm resistance cap. Source: TradingView A decisive break above this resistance would likely trigger momentum toward the next major target near $15.13, marking the start of a larger recovery phase. At present, the price is hovering near the lower edge of the channel, which makes this level critical. Holding above the level could set up a rebound back to the mid-range and eventually the upper resistance, while losing it would undermine the bullish outlook and open the risk of new lows. Bitcoin Hyper: New Crypto Projects to Watch Right now, Bitcoin is sitting around $114,000 and getting ready for the big price jump that Eric Trump talked about. When this happens, new crypto projects often see big gains too. One project that looks really promising is the Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) . So far, Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $11 million from investors, which shows people are excited about it. Many crypto experts believe HYPER can make the same crazy gains as TRUMP did Remember, TRUMP went up over 1,000% in just 2 days If HYPER does something similar, investing $1,000 during the presale could potentially turn into $10,000 or even more. Right now, you can buy HYPER tokens for just $0.012775 each during their early sale. You can buy them on the Bitcoin Hyper website using other cryptocurrencies or even your debit card.

50439364,https://cryptonews.com/?p=412101,1755778437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50439364.jpeg,"Corporate Crypto Treasuries: Bitcoin Reserves Could Heighten Credit Risk, Analysts Warn",https://cryptonews.com/news/corporate-crypto-treasuries-bitcoin-reserves-could-heighten-credit-risk-analysts-warn/,"The growing practice of companies holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their treasuries may heighten credit risks, according to analysts at Morningstar DBRS. Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have moved steadily into the mainstream, with both small and large companies adopting them for payments and investments. According to Morningstar DBRS analysts many companies are now using cryptocurrencies for treasury functions, effectively positioning bitcoin and other tokens as corporate reserve assets. These “cryptocurrency treasury companies” represent a growing niche within corporate finance, but one that carries heightened risks for credit profiles. Concentration and Market Exposure Morningstar analysts note that corporate bitcoin holdings remain concentrated among a handful of firms, with Strategy Inc. alone holding over 629,000 bitcoins — roughly 64 percent of all public company bitcoin treasury holdings. Michael Saylor’s Strategy has been adding to its reserves at a rapid pace, snapping up bitcoin almost weekly in recent months as part of an aggressive accumulation strategy. Strategy has acquired 430 BTC for ~$51.4 million at ~$119,666 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.1% YTD 2025. As of 8/17/2025, we hodl 629,376 $BTC acquired for ~$46.15 billion at ~$73,320 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/8zSHvPTFJO — Strategy (@Strategy) August 18, 2025 The top 20 public companies collectively control an estimated 94 percent of corporate bitcoin reserves, underscoring how concentrated this exposure remains. In total, approximately 3.68 million bitcoins, valued at around $428 billion as of August 2025, are held across corporations, ETFs, governments, and custodians. This represents nearly 18 percent of the current circulating supply, says Morningstar. While the growth in adoption shows confidence among corporates and investors, reliance on such a volatile asset for treasury management introduces substantial challenges. Morningstar analysts caution that concentration risk coupled with the high market volatility of cryptocurrencies could complicate liquidity planning and affect corporate balance sheets during periods of stress. Risks Facing Corporate Treasuries Morningstar DBRS analysts identify a range of risks for companies adopting a cryptocurrency treasury strategy. Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the most pressing challenges, with no uniform global framework governing cryptocurrencies. Although countries such as the U.S. and those in the eurozone have introduced clearer rules, these remain in flux, leaving corporates exposed to shifting compliance obligations. Liquidity also presents a concern. While digital asset markets have grown considerably, they can still thin out during times of volatility. In such moments, transactions may be delayed, and spreads can widen, undermining the reliability of cryptocurrency reserves as a financial backstop. Counterparty and security risks further complicate the landscape, as many firms depend on centralized exchanges for both trading and custody. Recent disputes, such as the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase — which was eventually dropped in 2025 — highlight the evolving and unpredictable regulatory environment surrounding major platforms. Another factor is the materiality of digital asset holdings on corporate balance sheets. Treasury functions are designed to safeguard financial stability and ensure liquidity, but when bitcoin becomes a company’s primary reserve asset, its volatility can undermine these objectives. A June 2024 study found that bitcoin was nearly five times more volatile than the S&P 500 in the short run and four times more volatile in the long run, suggesting significant exposure to price swings, acceding to Morningstar. Custodial considerations add further complexity, with firms needing to weigh the risks of self-custody against the vulnerabilities of third-party custodians. Implications for Corporate Credit Profiles The central purpose of corporate treasury management is to maintain stability, support consistent operations, and enable growth. Analysts argue that the incorporation of highly volatile cryptocurrencies into treasury reserves fundamentally alters this role. The volatility of assets such as bitcoin, combined with regulatory and custodial uncertainties, introduces new risks that can directly impact a company’s creditworthiness. Morningstar DBRS analysts conclude that while cryptocurrency adoption by corporates will likely continue to grow, particularly as regulatory clarity improves and integration into payment systems expands, these strategies carry meaningful implications for credit risk. The long-term success of corporate crypto treasuries will depend on whether they can balance the promise of digital assets with the fundamental responsibility of safeguarding financial health.

According to remarks reported by Walter Bloomberg, Schmid expressed that he is not rushing to implement interest rate cuts. This patient stance offers a crucial insight into the current thinking within a key branch of the U.S. central bank, influencing market expectations and the broader economic outlook. What Does “Not in a Hurry” Mean for Fed Interest Rates? When a prominent Fed official like Jeff Schmid states he’s “not in a hurry” to cut Fed interest rates , it signals a deliberate and cautious approach to monetary policy. This implies that the Fed is prioritizing long-term stability over quick adjustments. Such a perspective often arises when policymakers observe lingering inflationary pressures or a robust labor market that does not necessitate immediate easing. Data-Dependent Decisions: The Fed’s approach remains heavily reliant on incoming economic data, including inflation reports, employment figures, and overall economic growth indicators. Avoiding Premature Cuts: Rushing to cut Fed interest rates too soon could reignite inflation, potentially undoing progress made over the past year in bringing prices down. Maintaining Flexibility: A patient stance allows the Fed to react appropriately as economic conditions evolve, rather than committing to a specific timeline that might later prove unsuitable. Why the Patience on Fed Interest Rates? Several factors likely contribute to the Kansas City Fed’s cautious view on adjusting Fed interest rates . The U.S. economy has shown remarkable resilience, and while inflation has cooled from its peak, it may not yet be consistently at the Fed’s 2% target. Schmid’s comments reflect a desire to ensure inflation is truly under control before easing monetary conditions. Consider these key points: Persistent Inflationary Concerns: Despite recent declines, some sectors of the economy still exhibit persistent price pressures, requiring continued vigilance. Strong Labor Market: A tight labor market can contribute to wage growth, which might, in turn, fuel inflation if not managed carefully. Historical Lessons: Central banks often learn from past errors, where premature easing of Fed interest rates led to a resurgence of inflation, necessitating further tightening later. This careful consideration aims to prevent a “stop-go” policy cycle that could create uncertainty for businesses and consumers, undermining economic stability. Impact on the Economy and Markets from Fed Interest Rates The Fed’s stance on Fed interest rates has significant implications across the entire economy. For businesses, higher rates mean more expensive borrowing, potentially slowing investment and expansion plans. Consumers might face higher costs for mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt. However, it also means potentially higher returns on savings accounts and money market funds for savers. Financial markets react keenly to such statements. A patient Fed might lead to: Higher-for-Longer Rates: Expectations for Fed interest rates to remain elevated for an extended period, influencing long-term investment strategies. Bond Market Movements: Yields on government bonds may remain relatively high, reflecting investor expectations of sustained policy rates. Equity Market Volatility: Companies sensitive to interest rates, such as growth stocks or those with high debt, might experience greater fluctuations as market participants adjust their outlooks. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors and economic observers alike to make informed decisions. What Lies Ahead for Fed Interest Rates? While Schmid’s comments indicate a lack of urgency, they do not rule out future adjustments to Fed interest rates . The path forward will depend heavily on upcoming economic data releases. If inflation continues its downward trend and the labor market shows signs of softening, the argument for rate cuts will strengthen. Conversely, any unexpected uptick in inflation or sustained economic strength could reinforce the current patient approach. It’s important to remember that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) operates by consensus, and individual Fed presidents offer diverse perspectives that contribute to the broader discussion. Schmid’s view represents one important voice in this ongoing debate, highlighting a cautious outlook for adjusting Fed interest rates . Summary: Patience is Key for Fed Interest Rates Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid’s recent remarks underscore a prevailing sentiment within parts of the Federal Reserve: a commitment to patience when it comes to adjusting Fed interest rates . This deliberate approach prioritizes sustained economic stability and a definitive return to the Fed’s inflation target. While markets constantly seek clarity, the message is clear: don’t expect rapid moves. The Fed will continue to navigate the economic landscape with caution, guided by data and a long-term vision for price stability, ensuring the foundation for future economic growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid say about interest rates? Jeff Schmid stated that he is “not in a hurry” to cut interest rates, indicating a patient and cautious approach to monetary policy regarding Fed interest rates . Why is the Fed not rushing to cut Fed interest rates? The Fed is likely prioritizing sustained control over inflation and observing a resilient economy and strong labor market, aiming to avoid premature easing that could reignite price pressures. How do Fed interest rates affect the average person? Higher Fed interest rates can lead to increased costs for loans (mortgages, car loans, credit cards) but may also offer higher returns on savings accounts and other interest-bearing investments. What data does the Fed consider when deciding on Fed interest rates? The Fed primarily considers inflation data (like CPI and PCE), employment figures (such as the unemployment rate and job growth), and broader economic growth indicators (like GDP) to guide its decisions on Fed interest rates . Will Fed interest rates be cut this year? While Jeff Schmid’s comments suggest patience, the timing of any future Fed interest rates cuts will depend entirely on incoming economic data and the consensus view of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

According to a Facebook statement released by the NWP Cybercrime agency on Thursday, the fraudster convinced the victim to reveal their crypto wallet’s seed phrase by claiming to be working on a criminal case. “ We believe these individuals may have been identified through a data breach. This is a highly targeted and advanced scam ,” the authorities wrote. The perpetrator exploited the victim’s fear and urgency, police said, pushing them to enter their recovery phrase on a spoof website. The attackers then withdrew the equivalent of 2.1 million British pounds from the wallet within minutes. Bitcoin wallet seed phrase phished to steal funds The seed phrase, a string of 12 to 24 words, is the master key to a crypto wallet that allows anyone with access to control the wallet’s funds however they want. North Wales Police said the criminals preyed on the victim’s trust in authority by insisting that their personal documents were compromised, urging them to “secure” their assets using a provided link. The phishing site tricked the victim into entering their wallet seed phrase. “This was a highly sophisticated scheme,” a police spokesperson said. “Once the seed phrase was shared, the funds were stolen almost instantly.” In a statement, North Wales Police told crypto holders to verify genuine law enforcement contacts. “Police will NEVER call you unexpectedly to discuss your crypto assets or ask you to take action on your cold storage device. This is a big red flag,” officials said. The force recommended that anyone receiving suspicious calls should hang up and contact the police directly to confirm if the communication came from official channels. Importantly, authorities said officers would never request a person’s seed phrase under any circumstances. “Scammers are constantly evolving their tactics,” North Wales Police added. “They are crafting sophisticated social engineering schemes to trick even the most diligent holders. According to Blockchain security firm TRM Labs report cited by Cryptopolitan, thefts involving private keys and seed phrases accounted for around 80% of stolen cryptocurrency funds in the first half of 2025. Analysts said that while technical vulnerabilities in exchanges and protocols continue to exist, hackers are preferably targeting individual investors because of the irreversible nature of crypto transfers. Scattered Spider member sentenced in the US In a separate case of crypto-related crime, a member of the notorious hacking collective known as Scattered Spider was sentenced in the United States on Wednesday. Noah Michael Urban a/k/a King Bob, has been sentenced to 10 years in Federal Prison for his crimes and involvement with the Scattered Spider group. He has also been subject to pay $13,000,000 in restitution. pic.twitter.com/eTB6p6npGE — vxdb (@vxdb) August 20, 2025 US District Judge Harvey Schlesinger handed down a ten-year prison sentence to Noah Urban, 20, in a Jacksonville, Florida courtroom. Urban pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Urban was involved in cyberattacks that targeted 29 cryptocurrency investors and 13 companies. He was first arrested in central Florida in January 2024, when he was still 19 years old. During the sentencing hearing, the court heard statements from several victims that included a retired firefighter who spoke of losing his retirement savings, while another said their IVF fertility funds had been stolen. “This was kind of like a game for them,” Urban’s lawyer, Kathryn Sheldon, told the court. “They were working together, conspiring together to get access to these systems.” According to cybersecurity researchers, Scattered Spider is a loose network of hackers, many of them young males based in the US, UK and Western Europe. The group gained notoriety for ransomware attacks in 2023 against Las Vegas casino operators Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International.

Today, we're announcing MetaMask USD ($mUSD) – MetaMask's native stablecoin. MetaMask is the first self custodial wallet to launch a stablecoin, and we have big plans for it. pic.twitter.com/bbUqYGWXJw — MetaMask.eth (@MetaMask) August 21, 2025 This makes MetaMask the first self-custodial wallet to issue a stablecoin, strengthening its role as a central gateway to decentralized finance (DeFi). Speculation about mUSD’s development surfaced last week after a governance proposal outlining the stablecoin was briefly published online before being deleted. The launch has now been confirmed. Positioned Amid Growing Stablecoin Adoption The introduction of mUSD comes at a time when stablecoins are gaining traction worldwide, with increasing use cases in payments, trading, and remittances. Recent U.S. regulatory clarity, including the passage of the GENIUS Act, has further strengthened confidence in the sector. MetaMask aims to leverage these conditions by offering a stablecoin designed to integrate directly with its wallet infrastructure, allowing users to transact in a familiar environment while maintaining self-custody of their assets. Integration with Ethereum and Linea At launch, mUSD will be available on Ethereum and Linea , Consensys’ Layer 2 network. The token is expected to play a foundational role in the development of Linea’s DeFi ecosystem, supporting liquidity growth and network expansion. mUSD will be integrated across the MetaMask suite of decentralized applications and DeFi protocols, enabling onramps, swaps, transfers, and cross-chain bridging directly from within the wallet. By embedding these functions natively, MetaMask is aiming to streamline how users access stablecoin-based financial services. Expanding Toward Real-World Utility In addition to DeFi functionality, mUSD is expected to support real-world payments by the end of the year. Through the MetaMask Card, users will be able to spend mUSD at millions of merchants worldwide that accept Mastercard. This bridge between digital assets and everyday commerce highlights MetaMask’s strategy to expand beyond the crypto ecosystem into practical financial use cases. By introducing mUSD, MetaMask positions itself at the intersection of self-custody, stablecoin adoption, and real-world utility.

The $24.55 level remains a strong support base, crucial for maintaining the current uptrend. LINK is pausing near $26.50 on the 4-hour chart, with $25.50 acting as the key level for the next move toward $27.00. Chainlink (LINK) on August 21st, 2025, is currently trading at $26.13, marking a 5.17% daily increase. The asset has gained strong bullish traction over the last 24 hours, pushing toward a significant resistance level at $26.86, while establishing firm support at $24.55. LINK’s trading range for the day shows considerable volatility, with a low of $24.55 and a high of $26.86, reflecting bullish sentiment across the broader crypto market. Chainlink 1-day price chart: LINK buyers dominate as LINK approaches key resistance The daily chart presents a clear bullish structure, with LINK making higher highs and higher lows throughout the session. After reclaiming the $25.00 zone, the price climbed steadily to challenge resistance at $26.86, the intraday high. This level now serves as a key upside barrier, and a confirmed breakout above it could open the path toward $28.00–$30.00. On the downside, $24.55 remains the most immediate support, a level that previously served as a consolidation base. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The RSI is currently sitting in the upper range but remains below overbought levels, allowing more room for upside movement. The MACD histogram shows increasing bullish momentum, with the MACD line widening above the signal line, a traditional continuation indicator. The price is also above the 20-day EMA, which supports the bullish short-term trend. A move above $26.86 would likely accelerate the rally, while failure to break that level could result in a short-term retracement toward $25.30 or lower. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK bullish momentum consolidates above support On the 4-hour chart, LINK is consolidating gains after a strong upward push. The price action shows a short-term pause just below $26.50, with buyers effectively defending the $25.50 zone. This area is acting as a launchpad for potential continuation, with momentum indicators still favoring the bulls. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The RSI is holding near neutral territory after cooling off from overbought levels, suggesting a healthy consolidation phase. The MACD remains in bullish territory, but momentum is flattening, which implies the market is waiting for a catalyst to decide direction. If bulls maintain control above $25.50, another push toward $27.00 could follow. If support breaks, the next key downside level to monitor is $24.55. Chainlink technical indicators: levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $20.59 BUY SMA 5 $21.64 BUY SMA 10 $22.25 BUY SMA 21 $19.80 BUY SMA 50 $17.85 BUY SMA 100 $16.18 BUY SMA 200 $14.34 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $19.87 BUY EMA 5 $18.47 BUY EMA 10 $16.74 BUY EMA 21 $15.42 BUY EMA 50 $15.32 BUY EMA 100 $16.33 BUY EMA 200 $16.63 BUY What to expect from Chainlink? Chainlink is currently showing strong bullish momentum, with price action steadily pushing toward the key resistance at $26.86. If this level is broken with convincing volume, the next target could be the $28.00–$30.00 range. Short-term consolidation near $26.50 suggests the market is preparing for a decisive move. However, if LINK fails to break above resistance, a pullback toward $25.30 or the firm support at $24.55 is possible. Holding above $25.50 in the 4-hour timeframe is essential to maintain bullish control. Traders should watch for a breakout above $26.86 or a loss of $25.50 to gauge the next direction. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink remains a key player in the crypto space due to its role as a decentralized oracle network, powering smart contracts with real-world data. Its strong utility and ongoing adoption in DeFi support long-term interest. Technically, LINK is in a short-term uptrend, trading above key support at $24.55 and testing resistance at $26.86. A breakout could lead to the $28–$30 range, but volatility remains high. Why is the LINK price up today? The price of Chainlink (LINK) is up 5.17% today, trading at $26.13 as of August 21, 2025, due to strong bullish momentum and renewed buying pressure in the market. The asset is forming a series of higher highs and higher lows, reflecting growing trader confidence and technical strength.

The price is also holding well above its support at $24.55, which reinforces the ongoing uptrend. Intraday volatility and substantial volume suggest active market participation, contributing to today’s upward movement. Will Chainlink reach $50?

Investors keenly watch for signals regarding the future of monetary policy, particularly the timing of a Fed rate cut . Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic recently offered crucial insights into the economic landscape, shedding light on his expectations for interest rate adjustments this year. Bostic’s outlook suggests a cautious approach to monetary easing, directly impacting market sentiment and investment strategies. This perspective provides a significant update for those tracking the broader economic health and its potential influence on digital assets. What is the Latest on the Fed Rate Cut Outlook? Raphael Bostic, a key voice within the Federal Reserve, reiterated his expectation for one Fed rate cut to occur later this year. This forecast, while consistent with previous indications, comes with a caveat: the economic outlook remains fluid and subject to change based on incoming data. Bostic emphasized that the monthly “replacement rate” for jobs has shifted. This rate, which signifies the number of jobs needed to keep up with population growth and maintain stable employment, is now estimated to be closer to 50,000–75,000. This is a crucial metric that the Fed monitors closely when assessing labor market strength. One Rate Cut Expected: Bostic maintains his forecast for a single interest rate reduction in 2024. Fluid Outlook: The timing and certainty of this cut are still subject to evolving economic data. Job Market Shift: The new job “replacement rate” is lower, indicating less pressure on the labor market to absorb new entrants. How Do Job Numbers Influence a Potential Fed Rate Cut? The labor market’s health is a cornerstone of the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. A robust job market can fuel inflation, prompting the Fed to maintain higher interest rates. Conversely, a weakening market might necessitate a Fed rate cut to stimulate economic activity. Bostic’s observation about the “replacement rate” is significant. Historically, this figure was higher, meaning more jobs were needed to absorb new workers. A lower replacement rate suggests that the labor market might not need to generate as many jobs to avoid an increase in unemployment. This could imply that current job growth, even if appearing modest, is sufficient to keep the labor market balanced. Furthermore, Bostic warned about the potential for more frequent and larger data revisions. This highlights the challenge of accurately assessing real-time economic conditions. Policymakers must make decisions based on data that could later be significantly adjusted, adding a layer of complexity to their forecasts for a Fed rate cut . What Does This Mean for the Economy and Your Investments? The prospect of a single Fed rate cut this year, rather than multiple cuts, indicates that the Federal Reserve remains cautious about easing monetary policy too quickly. This stance aims to ensure inflation continues its path down to the Fed’s 2% target, even if it means keeping borrowing costs higher for longer. For the broader economy, sustained higher interest rates can impact everything from mortgage rates to business investments. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are particularly noteworthy: Reduced Liquidity: Higher rates generally lead to tighter liquidity conditions, which can sometimes dampen enthusiasm for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Dollar Strength: A relatively hawkish Fed stance compared to other central banks can strengthen the U.S. dollar, potentially making dollar-denominated assets less attractive for international investors. Market Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding rate decisions can contribute to increased market volatility, requiring investors to remain vigilant. However, it is also important to remember that the crypto market has its own unique drivers, including technological innovation, adoption rates, and regulatory developments. While macro factors like interest rates play a role, they are not the sole determinant of crypto performance, even with a looming Fed rate cut . Raphael Bostic’s latest comments provide a clear, albeit cautious, signal from the Federal Reserve. His expectation of one Fed rate cut this year, coupled with insights into the evolving labor market and data revisions, paints a picture of careful economic management. Investors and market participants should continue to monitor upcoming economic data releases, particularly inflation reports and employment figures, as these will heavily influence the Fed’s next moves. Staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts is essential for navigating the complex interplay between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. Adaptability and a well-informed strategy will be key in the months ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Raphael Bostic’s current expectation for interest rate cuts in 2024? Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic currently expects one interest rate cut to occur later this year, though he notes the outlook is in flux. 2. What does the “replacement rate” for jobs signify? The “replacement rate” for jobs refers to the number of jobs needed each month to keep up with population growth and maintain a stable level of employment. Bostic now sees this rate closer to 50,000–75,000. 3. How does a potential Fed rate cut impact the labor market? A Fed rate cut typically aims to stimulate economic activity, which can encourage hiring and potentially lower unemployment. Conversely, a strong labor market might reduce the urgency for a rate cut. 4. What are the implications of the Fed’s cautious stance for cryptocurrency investors? A cautious Fed stance, leading to potentially higher rates for longer, can reduce liquidity in the broader market, strengthen the U.S. dollar, and contribute to market volatility, which can influence risk assets like cryptocurrencies. 5. Why is monitoring economic data revisions important for investors? Bostic warned that large data revisions may be more frequent. This means initial economic reports might be significantly changed later, affecting the Fed’s policy decisions and requiring investors to remain adaptable in their market analysis.

Traditional financial markets, particularly major currency pairs like EUR/USD, often serve as leading indicators or significant influencers for overall market sentiment and liquidity. A recent pronouncement from global banking giant UBS regarding the future trajectory of the EUR/USD forecast has sent ripples through the forex community, and its implications extend far beyond just currency traders. For those navigating the volatile crypto waters, paying attention to these traditional market signals can provide crucial insights into potential shifts in investor risk appetite and capital flows. Let’s delve into UBS’s pivotal prediction and what it could mean for your portfolio. Unpacking the Latest EUR/USD Forecast from UBS: What’s the Core Message? UBS, one of the world’s leading financial services firms, has issued a notable EUR/USD forecast , projecting that the popular currency pair is likely to encounter a significant peak around the 1.25 level. This prediction is not merely a number; it is underpinned by a meticulous analysis of various macroeconomic factors and policy divergences between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). The core message from UBS suggests that while the Euro might experience some near-term strength, its upside potential against the U.S. Dollar is limited in the medium to long term. This ceiling, according to their analysts, is primarily driven by a few key considerations. Firstly, the pace of interest rate hikes and the subsequent unwinding of quantitative easing measures by both central banks play a crucial role. The Fed has generally adopted a more aggressive stance on monetary tightening compared to the ECB, which could continue to support the dollar. Secondly, differences in economic growth prospects between the Eurozone and the United States are factored in. While the Eurozone faces challenges like energy crises and geopolitical uncertainties, the U.S. economy, despite its own hurdles, might demonstrate greater resilience, attracting capital flows towards dollar-denominated assets. Finally, inflation trajectories in both regions are carefully monitored. If U.S. inflation proves more persistent or the Fed remains committed to higher rates for longer, it would further bolster the dollar’s position. This comprehensive outlook from UBS provides a roadmap for what to expect from one of the most traded currency pairs globally, offering a critical perspective for anyone involved in financial markets. Deep Dive into Forex Market Analysis: What Drives EUR/USD’s Movement? To truly grasp the implications of UBS’s EUR/USD forecast , it is essential to understand the complex forces that govern the forex market analysis of this pair. The Euro and the U.S. Dollar are influenced by a myriad of factors, often intertwined, creating a dynamic environment for traders. Here are some of the primary drivers: Interest Rate Differentials: Perhaps the most significant driver. Higher interest rates in one region attract capital, strengthening its currency. The gap between the Federal Reserve’s rates and the European Central Bank’s rates directly impacts the attractiveness of holding Euros versus Dollars. Economic Growth and Data: Strong economic indicators (GDP, employment figures, retail sales) signal a healthy economy, which typically supports the domestic currency. Diverging growth paths between the U.S. and the Eurozone can lead to significant currency movements. Inflation Trends: Central banks often raise interest rates to combat high inflation. The inflation outlook in both regions dictates the likely monetary policy actions, thereby influencing currency valuations. Persistent inflation in one area might prompt more aggressive tightening, making its currency more appealing. Geopolitical Events: Global events, such as conflicts, political instability, or major policy shifts, can create uncertainty and drive investors towards safe-haven currencies, with the U.S. Dollar often serving as a primary refuge during times of global stress. Trade Balances and Capital Flows: A country with a trade surplus (exporting more than it imports) generally sees its currency appreciate as demand for its goods and services (and thus its currency) increases. Similarly, large capital inflows (foreign investment) strengthen a currency. Understanding these interconnected elements is crucial for anyone attempting to predict or react to movements in the EUR/USD pair. UBS’s analysis synthesizes these factors to arrive at their 1.25 peak prediction, suggesting that the cumulative weight of these drivers points towards a limited upside for the Euro. Understanding the Euro Dollar Prediction: What Does a 1.25 Peak Signify for Traders? The Euro Dollar prediction of a 1.25 peak from UBS carries significant weight for participants across the financial spectrum. For forex traders, a ‘peak’ or ‘ceiling’ at a specific level like 1.25 implies a strong resistance point. This means that once the EUR/USD pair approaches or reaches this level, it is highly likely to encounter selling pressure, potentially leading to a reversal or a period of consolidation. This outlook has different implications depending on a trader’s strategy and time horizon: For Long-Term Investors: A projected peak suggests that the current uptrend in EUR/USD, if any, may be nearing its exhaustion. This could prompt long-term investors to consider taking profits on Euro-long positions or even initiate Dollar-long positions, anticipating a subsequent decline in the pair. It signals a potential shift in the overarching trend. For Short-Term Traders: Day traders and swing traders might look for opportunities to ‘fade’ the rally as it approaches 1.25, placing sell orders in anticipation of a pullback. Conversely, they might look for buying opportunities on dips if the pair consolidates below this level, but with a keen eye on the overarching resistance. Risk Management: Knowing a potential peak can help traders set more realistic profit targets and stop-loss levels. If their analysis aligns with UBS’s, they might tighten their stops as the pair nears 1.25 to protect capital. Should EUR/USD reach 1.25, market participants will be closely watching for signs of exhaustion, such as weakening momentum indicators or bearish candlestick patterns. Conversely, a decisive break above 1.25, sustained by strong fundamental catalysts, would invalidate UBS’s prediction and signal a significant shift in market dynamics, potentially opening the door for further Euro appreciation. However, as it stands, the 1.25 level serves as a critical psychological and technical barrier, shaping the trading strategies of many. Navigating Currency Trading: Practical Strategies for the Current Climate Given UBS’s specific Euro Dollar prediction , how can individual traders and investors effectively navigate the complex landscape of currency trading ? Adopting a well-thought-out strategy is paramount, especially when major financial institutions issue such definitive forecasts. Here are some practical strategies to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: While EUR/USD is a significant pair, do not put all your eggs in one basket. Consider other currency pairs or asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, whose movements might not be directly correlated, to mitigate risk. Implement Robust Risk Management: This is non-negotiable in forex. Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on trades. Given a potential peak, be extra cautious about over-leveraging or holding positions that defy the predicted trend without strong counter-evidence. Define your risk-reward ratio before entering any trade. Stay Informed and Adaptable: Market conditions can change rapidly. While UBS’s forecast is valuable, it is one perspective among many. Continuously monitor economic data releases, central bank communications, and geopolitical developments. Be prepared to adjust your strategy if new information emerges that contradicts the current outlook. Consider Hedging Strategies: For those with exposure to either the Euro or the Dollar in their broader investment portfolios (e.g., holding European stocks or U.S. bonds), hedging strategies using currency derivatives could be explored to protect against adverse currency movements. Focus on Technical and Fundamental Analysis: Combine the fundamental insights provided by UBS’s outlook with your own technical analysis. Look for confluence points where technical indicators (e.g., resistance levels, overbought signals) align with the fundamental forecast, strengthening your trading conviction. Ultimately, successful currency trading in this environment hinges on discipline, continuous learning, and a willingness to adapt. The 1.25 peak prediction offers a framework, but its execution requires careful planning and adherence to sound trading principles. The Broader Impact: How Does the UBS Outlook Shape Market Sentiment and Beyond? The pronouncements from institutions like UBS carry considerable weight in the financial world. Their detailed UBS outlook for the EUR/USD pair, projecting a 1.25 peak, does more than just inform individual traders; it significantly shapes broader market sentiment and influences institutional capital flows. When a major bank like UBS takes a definitive stance, it can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, as other large players and retail traders adjust their positions in alignment with such a prominent forecast. This collective action can amplify the predicted market movements. Beyond the immediate forex market, this outlook has wider ramifications: Global Investment Strategies: Fund managers and institutional investors factor currency movements into their overall investment strategies. A strong Dollar or a weakening Euro could influence decisions on where to allocate capital globally, impacting equity markets, bond markets, and even commodity prices. Corporate Earnings: Multinational corporations with significant exposure to Eurozone or U.S. markets will see their earnings affected by currency fluctuations. A stronger Dollar, for instance, can make U.S. exports more expensive and reduce the value of overseas earnings when repatriated. Impact on Crypto Markets: While seemingly disparate, traditional finance and crypto markets are increasingly intertwined. A strengthening U.S. Dollar, often seen as a safe haven, can sometimes lead to capital flowing out of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a weaker Dollar might encourage risk-on behavior. The sentiment generated by a major forex market analysis from UBS can therefore indirectly influence the liquidity and price action within the crypto ecosystem, as institutional capital moves between asset classes. If the Dollar is expected to strengthen after 1.25, some investors might prefer to hold stablecoins or even cash out crypto into USD, impacting overall crypto market capitalization. In essence, the UBS outlook serves as a significant data point for a vast array of financial participants, guiding decisions that extend far beyond the immediate currency pair and underscoring the interconnectedness of global financial markets. UBS’s insightful EUR/USD forecast , pinpointing a potential peak near 1.25, offers a crucial perspective for anyone involved in the global financial markets. This prediction, rooted in a comprehensive forex market analysis of central bank policies, economic divergences, and inflation trends, signals a critical juncture for the world’s most traded currency pair. Understanding this Euro Dollar prediction is not just for currency traders; it provides a broader lens through which to view global capital flows and risk appetite, impacting everything from equities to digital assets. As you navigate the intricate world of currency trading , remember the importance of robust risk management, continuous learning, and adaptability. The UBS outlook serves as a valuable guide, but market dynamics are ever-evolving, requiring constant vigilance and informed decision-making. Whether you are a seasoned forex trader or a crypto enthusiast, these macroeconomic signals are vital for making strategic choices in an interconnected financial world.

Ethereum, Solana and Remittix are three tokens being closely compared by investors. While Ethereum and Solana already dominate the charts, Remittix is quickly gaining traction, raising over $20.6 million through the sale of more than 611 million tokens at $0.0969 each. With a confirmed BitMart listing and another CEX listing expected once the project hits $22 million, Remittix is positioning itself as one of the best crypto project 2025 contenders. Ethereum ROI Potential Still Relies on Institutional Growth Source: TradingView Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the digital asset market. Trading near $4,200, Ethereum has rebounded from its $4,000 support but still struggles to reclaim the $4,800 resistance level. Whales also bought over 400,000 ETH in the recent dip. Analysts highlight steady exchange outflows of $18.59 million, showing that investors prefer to stake or hold long term, reducing sell pressure. Institutional money continues to pour in, with BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF attracting massive inflows, and Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs boosting their exposure. Still, many believe Ethereum’s ROI potential is capped compared to low cap crypto gems, as its $528 billion market cap leaves less room for exponential growth. Solana’s Fast Network Could Drive Mid-Level Gains Source: Shafyn Khan Solana, priced near $183 , is another strong player. It has built a reputation for fast transactions and low fees, making it popular in DeFi project ecosystems. The Solana price prediction suggests a possible rebound toward $200–$210 if support levels around $172 hold. Solana continues to expand through partnerships like 1inch integration for cross-chain swaps and the launch of Heaven Launchpad to strengthen token issuance. However, with a $96.92 billion market cap, Solana’s growth outlook is more modest compared to smaller tokens. Investors see it as a top crypto under $1 alternative only in terms of utility, not ROI multiples. Why Remittix Could Deliver the Biggest ROI in 2025 Remittix is different from Ethereum and Solana because it is directly targeting the $190 trillion payments market. Designed for real-world cross-border transfers, it offers investors exposure to a token with clear utility and massive demand. Having already raised over $20.6 million, Remittix is also fueling community interest through its $250K giveaway campaign and upcoming CEX expansion plans at $22 million dollars. If Remittix grows even a fraction of what Ethereum and Solana have achieved, its ROI could outpace them by a wide margin. That’s why analysts are calling it one of the next big altcoin 2025 opportunities. Here’s why it stands out: Expanding into the $190T payments sector, giving it real-world adoption Over $20.6M raised, with momentum toward the next CEX listing at $22M $250K community giveaway driving viral engagement Audited by CertiK, ensuring strong security and trust Payments made simple with global bank transfers powered by blockchain Which Token Will Win the ROI Race? Ethereum offers stability, Solana provides speed but Remittix has the highest ceiling as a low cap crypto gem with unmatched growth potential. With listings, giveaways, and strong utility, it is being hailed as one of the best DeFi projects 2025 and possibly the next 100x crypto. For investors asking what is the best crypto project to buy now, Remittix stands out as the rising contender with real momentum.

On-chain data reveals that one crypto trader, identified as wallet 6ZFnRH , lost half a million dollars in less than two hours after misjudging the token’s violent price swings. The trader initially deployed 1.55 million USDC to purchase 996,453 YZY at an average entry price of $1.56. However, as liquidity thinned and sentiment shifted, YZY dropped below the $1 threshold. The whale capitulated at $1.06, recouping only 1.05 million USDC and locking in a staggering $500,000 loss in record time. YZY has dropped below $1. Whale 6ZFnRH spent 1.55M $USDC to buy 996,453 $YZY at $1.56, then sold for 1.05M $USDC at $1.06—losing $500K in less than 2 hours. https://t.co/VrSJBcpmQB pic.twitter.com/YsOjjj0FqL — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 21, 2025 Cryptocurrency traders not concerned by Yeezy Money volatility The brutal liquidation has not deterred speculators from piling into the coin. Well-known trader Machi Big Brother ( @machibigbrother ) has revealed a 3x leveraged long position worth 570,000 YZY ($613,800), a bet that the token’s volatility can be exploited for outsized returns. Machi Big Brother( @machibigbrother ) just opened a 3x leveraged long on $YZY , with a position of 570,000 $YZY ($613.8K). https://t.co/T0DJNDGd53 pic.twitter.com/60tXRi3ZgN — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 21, 2025 Kanye West himself has also raised the stakes. Blockchain records show that he injected 30 million YZY (valued at $34 million) into the liquidity pool on Meteora, setting an automated range between $3.1716 and $4.4929. Once the price crosses the lower bound, West will begin earning fees while gradually selling into USDC. Should YZY break above the upper band, the entire allocation will be sold, effectively realizing $134 million at peak levels. The combination of whale losses, speculative leverage, and celebrity-backed liquidity has created a perfect storm around YZY. For now, the token has slipped under $1, raising doubts about its sustainability.

This AI token seems to be resilient to the latest bad news from the tech industry and could deliver sizable gains in the future according to one popular trader. Just a few hours ago, Meta Platforms announced that it will temporarily stop adding new members for its AI team, citing some “basic organizational planning”. The company has been on a hiring spree lately to supercharge its efforts to develop powerful artificial intelligence models. Reports indicated that Meta had been offering signing bonuses of more than $100 million to the best candidates while it spent $14.3 billion to acquire Scale AI. Accumulation is almost complete for @NEARProtocol $NEAR And could be gearing up for its next major leg once the market recovers. If the pattern plays out, the next phase is a potential mark up. Historically, these setups have led to explosive rallies as liquidity rotates… pic.twitter.com/yossmlLxff — CryptoBusy (@CryptoBusy) August 19, 2025 Despite this bearish news, trader CryptoBusy, whose X account is followed by more than 200,000 users has shared a bullish Near price prediction as he believes that the token is ready to step out of a long-standing phase of accumulation. This trader sees a potential move to around $10 to $12, meaning an upside potential of 5X to 6X based on the current price. A confirmed breakout above $3.5 would trigger such a move according to CryptoBusy’s prediction. Near Price Prediction: NEAR Could Rise to $4 If This Key Support Holds The 4-hour chart shows that selling pressure accelerated as NEAR hit $2.85. The token has been dropping since it last touched this area and could be eyeing the $2.35 level as its next target. This has been a highly contested area for both bulls and bears, which increases its relevance for traders if future moves push the price to this level. Technical indicators have started to show early signs of a trend reversal. For example, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) just bounced off oversold levels in this lower time frame. It has also moved above the 14-period moving average, which is typically considered a buy signal. A drop to $2.3 is possible during this pullback. However, if the price bounces off this level with strong volumes, the odds favor a strong push toward $2.85 first and then an explosive move that could propel NEAR to $4 as the latest rally resumes. Although this means an attractive upside potential of 73%, a popular meme coin called Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) could be poised to deliver even higher gains as it has started its migration to the Solana blockchain. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Could 10X Amid Its Ongoing Token Burn Wall Street (WEPE) is migrating to Solana and this is a big deal as it could drive higher volumes toward a token that closed one of the best crypto presales of the year just a few months ago. The WEPE army is a community of like-minded traders who share insights and get trading ideas from each other. They all have one thing in common – they want to see WEPE take over the crypto world. After its huge success in Ethereum, the road has been paved for a massive launch in Solana – the best blockchain for meme coins. The developing team has pledged to burn the corresponding dollar value of all WEPE (ETH) tokens migrated to Solana to shrink the circulating supply and boost the price of this Pepe-inspired meme coin. You can buy Wall Street Pepe and benefit from this migration boost by visiting the official Wall Street Pepe website.

For those deeply invested in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding these shifts in the broader tech landscape is crucial, as AI’s advancements often intertwine with decentralized technologies, influencing market sentiment and innovation trajectories. Recently, a significant development emerged from Meta’s AI division: a strategic pause in AI hiring , following an aggressive period of talent acquisition. What does this mean for the future of AI development, and how might it impact the competitive landscape? Understanding the Strategic Meta AI Hiring Freeze The news that Meta has frozen hiring within its artificial intelligence organization comes after a flurry of activity aimed at bolstering its AI capabilities. This pause, reported by The Wall Street Journal, follows a period where Meta actively poached more than 50 AI researchers and engineers from rival companies, demonstrating a clear intent to dominate the AI frontier. The freeze went into effect recently, and its duration remains unclear. Meta confirmed the hiring freeze, describing it as a standard procedure for “basic organizational planning” after a significant influx of new personnel and during yearly budgeting cycles. This explanation suggests a period of consolidation, allowing the company to integrate its newly acquired talent and refine its strategic direction before further expansion. The Fierce AI Talent War : A Battlefield for Innovation Meta’s aggressive recruitment drive highlights the intense AI talent war currently raging across the tech industry. Companies are fiercely competing for top AI professionals, recognizing that human capital is the cornerstone of groundbreaking innovation. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been at the forefront of this push, reportedly making personal calls to highly sought-after researchers and engineers, offering lucrative compensation packages that sometimes reached nine figures. This level of investment underscores the perceived value of elite AI talent. This aggressive talent acquisition strategy, while effective in bringing top minds to Meta, has not been without its challenges. Analysts have raised concerns about the rising costs associated with stock-based compensation, warning that such expenses could potentially impact shareholder returns. The escalating demand for AI experts creates a unique economic dynamic, where talent becomes a premium commodity, influencing corporate balance sheets and long-term financial health. Meta Restructuring : Realigning for Superintelligence The hiring freeze also coincides with a significant Meta restructuring of its AI unit. Earlier this week, Meta Superintelligence Labs, the company’s core AI division, was reorganized into four distinct new groups. This strategic realignment aims to streamline operations and sharpen focus on specific areas of AI development. The new structure includes: TBD Labs: Led by Alexandr Wang, the former founder of Scale AI, this group’s specific mandate is yet to be fully disclosed but is expected to focus on cutting-edge or exploratory AI initiatives. Research Group: Dedicated to fundamental AI research, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in artificial intelligence. Product Integration Group: Focused on embedding AI models and capabilities into Meta’s vast array of existing products, such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, enhancing user experience and functionality. Infrastructure Group: Responsible for building and maintaining the robust computing power, data pipelines, and foundational systems necessary to support Meta’s ambitious AI endeavors. This reorganization indicates a deliberate effort by Meta to optimize its AI development pipeline, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently across research, development, and deployment. The inclusion of a figure like Alexandr Wang suggests a strong emphasis on practical, impactful applications of AI. New Meta AI Unit Focus Area Leadership (if known) TBD Labs Undisclosed, likely cutting-edge research or new ventures Alexandr Wang (former Scale AI founder) Research Group Fundamental AI research, pushing boundaries of knowledge Not specified Product Integration Group Applying AI models into Meta’s existing products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) Not specified Infrastructure Group Building and maintaining the underlying computing power and data systems for AI Not specified Mark Zuckerberg AI Ambitions: A Long-Term Play Mark Zuckerberg AI vision is not a new development; it has been a consistent theme in Meta’s strategic direction for years. His personal involvement in recruiting top talent and his public statements consistently highlight AI as a foundational technology for the company’s future, particularly in realizing the ambitious vision of the metaverse. Zuckerberg sees AI as the key to creating more immersive, intelligent, and interactive digital experiences. This hiring pause, therefore, should not be interpreted as a retreat from Meta’s AI ambitions. Instead, it appears to be a calculated move to digest the recent talent surge and ensure that the newly formed organizational structure can effectively leverage the acquired expertise. It is a period of internal optimization, designed to lay a stronger foundation for sustained growth and innovation in AI, positioning Meta to compete effectively with other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. What This Means for Future AI Hiring Trends Meta’s decision to pause AI hiring , even temporarily, sends a signal across the tech industry. While it might lead to a momentary slowdown in the most aggressive recruitment tactics, it also suggests a maturation of the AI talent market. Companies might shift from a pure volume-based hiring approach to a more targeted strategy, focusing on specific niche skills or leadership roles. For AI professionals, this could mean that while the overall demand for AI talent remains high, the nature of job opportunities might evolve. There could be an increased emphasis on specialized expertise, experience in deploying AI at scale, and a deeper understanding of specific industry applications. Companies might also look more towards internal development and upskilling programs to meet their AI needs. Key Takeaways for the AI Ecosystem: Consolidation Phase: The pause suggests a period of consolidation and integration for Meta, allowing them to make the most of their recent hires. Strategic Reorganization: The restructuring into specialized units aims to enhance efficiency and focus in AI development. Talent Market Dynamics: While intense, the AI talent war might see shifts towards more strategic, rather than purely aggressive, recruitment. Long-Term Vision: Meta’s commitment to AI, driven by Mark Zuckerberg, remains unwavering, with the pause serving as a recalibration for future growth. In conclusion, Meta’s strategic pause in AI hiring, coupled with its significant organizational restructuring, marks a pivotal moment in its journey to AI dominance. Far from a step back, this move appears to be a calculated recalibration, designed to integrate new talent, optimize internal structures, and ensure that Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitious AI vision is built on a solid, efficient foundation. The AI talent war continues, but its battlefields may now include more nuanced strategies than sheer poaching sprees, influencing the broader tech landscape and even indirectly impacting the evolving world of decentralized finance and blockchain technologies.

Gas fees fuel every transaction and keep the network running smoothly. Anytime you send ETH, swap tokens, or mint an NFT, you pay gas fees. This guide explains what gas fees are, why they matter, and how to keep them low. What Are Gas Fees in Crypto? The Definition of Gas Fees Gas fees are the costs you pay to get transactions validated and processed on a blockchain like Ethereum. They reward validators who do the heavy lifting and keep the network secure. Gas fees depend on your transaction’s complexity and network traffic. They’re like service charges for using the blockchain. Why Gas Fees Exist in Blockchain Networks Gas fees exist in blockchain networks to keep transactions running smoothly and securely. They make sure miners or validators get paid for using their computing power to process and confirm transactions. Without these fees, there’d be no real incentive for anyone to maintain the network. Gas fees also help prevent spam. If sending transactions were free, people could flood the network with junk and slow everything down. Gas Fees vs. Transaction Fees: Are They the Same? Gas fees and transaction fees sound similar, but they aren’t exactly the same. Gas fees are specific to blockchains like Ethereum. It’s like paying for the electricity and effort behind the scenes. Transaction fees is a broader term. It can mean any fee you pay to move assets—whether it’s on Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even a traditional bank transfer. So, all gas fees are transaction fees, but not all transaction fees are gas fees. How Gas Fees Work Who Collects Gas Fees? Gas fees are collected by the people who keep the blockchain running—miners on proof-of-work (POW) networks and validators on proof-of-stake (POS) networks. When you send a transaction, your gas fee goes to whoever successfully processes and confirms it. This payment rewards them for their computing power, time, and resources, and keeps them motivated to maintain the network’s security and reliability. The gas fee you pay ends up in the wallet of the person who handled your transaction. Gas Units, Gas Price, and Total Cost Gas Units measure how much “work” your transaction needs. A simple ETH transfer might use 21,000 gas units, but running a smart contract could take way more. Think of it like the amount of fuel needed. Gas Price is how much you’re going to pay per gas unit, usually measured in gwei—tiny fractions of ETH. Total Cost is gas units multiplied by gas price. It’s the final amount you pay for your transaction to go through. How Miners and Validators Set Prices Miners and validators don’t just pull gas prices out of thin air—the blockchain rules decide them. Ethereum uses a dynamic system, where every block has a base fee that’s set automatically. This base fee goes up when the network’s busy and drops when things are quiet. You can also add a priority fee—basically a tip—to make your transaction more tempting so it gets processed faster. Validators pocket this tip as a reward for picking your transaction over others. So, the protocol decides the base price, and you decide how generous you want to be with the tip. The final gas fee is a mix of both. Examples from Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Other Chains As mentioned before, on Ethereum, the base fee isn’t chosen by validators—it’s set by the protocol. Etherscan provides real-time gas fee rates, updating about every 15 seconds with each new Ethereum block. Here’s an example of a simple Ether transfer: Ethereum Gas Fee Calculation (Example) Given: Transaction type: Ether transfer Gas units required: 21,000 (standard ether transfer) Base fee: 0.75 gwei Priority fee: 0.015 gwei Equations: Gas price = Base fee + Priority fee = 0.75 + 0.015 = 0.765 gwei Gas fees (gwei) = Gas price × Gas units = 0.765 × 21,000 = 16,065 gwei Gas fees (ETH) = 16,065 gwei × (1 ETH / 1,000,000,000 gwei) = 0.000016065 ETH Gas fees (USD) = 0.000016065 ETH × $4,000 / ETH = $0.06426 ≈ 6¢ Note: 1 gwei = 10 −9 ETH. Bitcoin works differently. Fees are based on transaction size in bytes and how many satoshis-per-byte you’re willing to pay. Solana charges a fixed base fee, plus an optional priority fee if you want your transaction to go faster. Factors That Affect Gas Fees Network Congestion Gas fees shoot up when the blockchain is busy—kind of like surge pricing for ride-sharing. When too many people try to send transactions at the same time, the demand for block space goes up. Validators can only fit so many transactions into each block, so they naturally pick the ones with higher fees first. If you want your transaction to go through quickly, you’ll need to pay a higher gas price. But if you’re not in a hurry, waiting for a quieter time can save you a lot. Complexity of the Transaction Not all transactions are created equal. Sending a bit of ETH from one wallet to another is simple and only needs the basic amount of gas. But if you’re interacting with a smart contract—like swapping ERC-20 tokens on Uniswap, staking ETH on Lido, or minting an NFT—the network has to do more work. Any transaction on Ethereum is basically you asking the network to run some code. When the EVM runs that code, it changes the state of the blockchain. Gas is what you pay so validators run the code, update the state, and share it with everyone else. The bigger the change, the more gas it burns. Blockchain Protocol Rules (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon) Every blockchain has its own rules. Consensus rules, block size and speed, and other features determine how much you pay in fees. Here’s a quick comparison: Blockchain Consensus Mechanism Block Time Avg. Tx Fee (USD) Peak Fee Estimate (USD) Fee Impact Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) ~12 sec ~$0.45 $2–$50 More predictable and gradually reducing. Bitcoin Proof-of-Work (PoW) ~10 min ~$0.83 $3–$15 Higher fees due to energy and congestion. Solana PoS + Proof-of-History ~0.4 sec ~$0.00025–$0.0028 ~$0.0005–$0.01 Very low fees, given high capacity. Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) ~2 sec ~$0.0005–$0.01 ~$0.01–$0.10 Consistently low fees across activity levels Base Fee and Priority Tip (Ethereum EIP-1559) In 2021, gas fees got a major upgrade with a new ethereum improvement proposal (EIP-1559). Instead of users guessing the right price to pay, the network now automatically sets a base fee for each block. The base fee is the minimum you need to pay for your transaction to be included in a block. It’s burned and permanently removed from circulation. This helps reduce ETH supply over time, making it more valuable. The base fee adjusts up or down depending on network demand. If a block is more than 50% full, the base fee goes up slightly; if it’s less, the fee drops. EIP-1559 also introduced a priority tip. This tip is optional. When the network is busy, it helps reduce wait time. The validator who picks your transaction gets this tip as a reward. Ethereum Gas Fees Explained in Detail What Is Gwei? Gwei is just a smaller unit of Ether, used to make gas fees easier to read. Since gas prices are usually tiny fractions of ETH, writing them in ETH would be messy. Imagine saying “0.000000003 ETH” every time you talk about fees. Instead, we use gwei, where 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 gwei—that’s a billion gwei. So if the gas price is 30 gwei, it really means you’re paying 0.00000003 ETH for each unit of gas. The term “gwei” comes from “giga-wei”—which means one billion wei. One gwei equals exactly one billion wei and it’s the smallest possible unit of ETH. A gwei is also known as nanoether. Think of it like cents to a dollar—but with way more zeros. Gwei keeps the numbers clean and the conversations simple when talking about gas fees. Did you know? A wei is named after Wei Dai, a cryptographer who created b-money in 1998. It’s an early digital currency idea that helped inspire modern cryptocurrencies. Gas Limit vs. Gas Price Gas limit and gas price are two terms that sound similar but do very different jobs. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas units you’re willing to let your transaction use. It’s like setting a budget for your transaction. Simple ETH transfers have a fixed limit of 21,000 gas units. But for smart contract interactions, the exact gas needed isn’t always obvious. It depends on the contract code. For example, if you set the gas limit to 300,000 for minting an NFT, the EVM would consume 250,000, and you would get back the remaining 50,000. Transaction Type Gas Units Notes Simple ETH Transfer 21,000 Sending ETH from one wallet to another. ERC-20 Token Transfer ~50,000–65,000 Slightly higher since it calls a smart contract. ERC-20 Approval (approve) ~45,000–65,000 Needed before spending tokens via contracts (e.g., Uniswap). DEX Swap (Uniswap, Sushi, etc.) ~100,000–150,000 More complex, involves liquidity pools + token transfers. NFT Mint (ERC-721) ~100,000–250,000 Depends on contract complexity and metadata storage. NFT Transfer (ERC-721) ~50,000–80,000 Higher than ETH transfer because it interacts with token contracts. NFT Approval (setApprovalForAll) ~70,000–100,000 Grants marketplaces or dApps permission to manage your NFTs. DeFi Lending/Borrowing (Aave, Compound) ~200,000–500,000 Complex logic: collateral, interest rates, token interactions. Deploying a Smart Contract 500,000+ Can easily go into millions of gas depending on contract size. Setting a higher limit makes sure the transaction doesn’t fail if it ends up needing more gas than expected. The gas price is how much you’re going to pay for each unit of gas, usually quoted in gwei. Paying high gas prices makes your transaction more attractive to validators, so it gets processed faster. Lower prices might save money but could mean waiting longer. EIP-1559 and the London Hard Fork In August 2021, Ethereum launched the London Hard Fork, which bundled several proposals to improve fees, and user experience. The most important upgrade was EIP-1559. Before the upgrade, Ethereum used fixed block sizes. When demand spiked, blocks filled up fast and users had to wait for space. This made fees unpredictable and the user experience frustrating. EIP-1559 introduced variable-sized blocks. Now, each Ethereum block has a target size of 15 million gas, but blocks can grow or shrink with demand, up to a maximum of 30 million gas. The network balances itself back to 15 million through a process called tâtonnement . If a block goes over the target, the protocol raises the base fee for the next block. If it falls under, the base fee goes down. The London Hard Fork included several other proposals: EIP-3198: Gave smart contracts access to the block’s base fee. EIP-3529: Reduced gas refunds to stop spam and push writing of efficient code. EIP-3541: Blocked deployment of contracts with certain byte sequences to improve validation. EIP-3554: Delayed the “difficulty bomb” so developers had more time to work on the Merge. How Wallets Estimate Gas When you send a transaction, your wallet uses live network data to make an educated guess. Most wallets, like MetaMask, fetch the current base fee from the Ethereum network and then look at how full recent blocks have been. They’ll also analyze how much gas similar transactions are using right now. Based on that, the wallet suggests a gas limit (so your transaction has enough room to run) and a priority tip. Many wallets even give you options—like “slow,” “average,” and “fast”—each with different priority tips. The faster you want it confirmed, the more you’ll pay. Gas Fees on Other Blockchains Bitcoin Transaction Fees Bitcoin doesn’t use gas like Ethereum—it charges fees based on a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model. Any BTC transaction fees is based on two things: Transaction size in bytes. Fee per byte in SATs (satoshis). Every block on Bitcoin has a limited space of 1 megabyte, so miners naturally pick transactions with the highest fee-per-byte first. If the network is busy, you’ll need to offer more satoshis per byte to get confirmed quickly; if it’s quiet, you can get away with less. Bitcoin Transaction Fee Calculation (Example) Given: Transaction size: 250 bytes Current rate: 50 satoshis/byte Equations: Fees (satoshis) = Transaction size × Rate = 250 × 50 = 12,500 satoshis Fees (BTC) = 12,500 satoshis × (1 BTC / 100,000,000 satoshis) = 0.000125 BTC Fees (USD) = 0.000125 BTC × $100,000 / BTC = $12.50 Note: 1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis . Solana Gas Fees Solana charges a tiny base fee of 5,000 lamports (the smallest unit of SOL) for each signature. A signature is cryptographic proof that shows an account has approved a transaction. Since one SOL equals a billion lamports, even at $100 per SOL the fee is about half a cent. Half of that fee is burned, and the other half goes to validators. On Solana, the priority fee is based on the compute unit limit and compute unit price. The compute unit limit is the maximum amount of computational work your transaction can use. The compute unit price is how much you’re willing to pay per unit in micro-lamports. Adding a priority fee is optional for faster transactions and is pocketed by validators. Solana Transaction Fee Calculation (Example) Given: Signature: 1 Base fee: 5,000 lamports Compute unit limit: 150,000 CU × 1.1 ≈ 165,000 CU Compute unit price: 100 μ-lamports / CU = 0.0001 lamport / CU Equations: Priority fee = Compute unit limit × Compute unit price = 165,000 × 100 μ-lamports = 16,500,000 μ-lamports = 16.5 lamports Total fee (lamports) = Base fee + Priority fee = 5,000 + 16.5 = 5,016.5 lamports Total fee (SOL) = 5,016.5 lamports × (1 SOL / 1,000,000,000 lamports) = 0.0000050165 SOL Total fee (USD) = 0.0000050165 SOL × $100 / SOL = $0.00050165 Note: 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports ; 1 μ-lamport = 0.000001 lamport . Polygon Gas Fees Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain works a lot like Ethereum, but with way lower costs. It uses the same gas units × gas price formula, and gas prices are measured in gwei—except here, 1 gwei is a fraction of a POL token instead of ETH. Polygon Transaction Fee Calculation (Example) Given: Transaction type: POL transfer Gas units required: 21,000 (same standard as Ethereum) Base fee: 30 gwei Priority fee: 2 gwei Equations: Gas price = Base fee + Priority fee = 30 + 2 = 32 gwei Gas fees (gwei) = Gas price × Gas units = 32 × 21,000 = 672,000 gwei Gas fees (POL) = 672,000 gwei × (1 POL / 1,000,000,000 gwei) = 0.000672 POL Gas fees (USD) = 0.000672 POL × $0.60 / POL = $0.00040 (less than a tenth of a cent) Note: 1 gwei = 10 −9 POL . Layer 2 Gas Fee Reductions (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) Layer 2 networks are built on top of Ethereum to make transactions faster and cheaper, without sacrificing security. They process most of the work off-chain and then settle the results back on Ethereum in batches—spreading the cost across many users. Arbitrum and Optimism use optimistic rollups, which assume transactions are valid by default and only run fraud checks if challenged. This approach can cut fees by up to 90% compared to mainnet Ethereum. zkSync uses zero-knowledge rollups, which bundle transactions together and submit a cryptographic proof to Ethereum. This proof confirms the batch is valid, reducing data storage costs and lowering fees significantly—often to just a few cents. Optimism Transaction Fee Calculation (Example) Transaction type: ETH transfer Gas units required: 21,000 (same as Ethereum) Gas price: 0.000007 gwei Equations: Gas fees (gwei) = Gas price × Gas units = 21,000 × 0.000007 = 0.147 gwei Gas fees (ETH) = 0.147 gwei × (1 ETH / 1,000,000,000 gwei) = 0.000000000147 ETH Gas fees (USD) = 0.000000000147 ETH × $4,000 / ETH = $0.000000588 (nearly free) Arbitrum Transaction Fee Calculation (Example) Transaction type: ETH transfer Gas units required: 21,000 (same as Ethereum) Gas price: 0.01 gwei Equations: Gas fees (gwei) = Gas price × Gas units = 21,000 × 0.01 = 210 gwei Gas fees (ETH) = 210 gwei × (1 ETH / 1,000,000,000 gwei) = 0.000000210 ETH Gas fees (USD) = 0.000000210 ETH × $4,000 / ETH = $0.00084 (less than one-tenth of a cent) zkSync Transaction Fee Calculation (Example) Transaction type: ETH transfer Gas units required: 21,000 (same as Ethereum) Gas price: 0.15 gwei Equations: Gas fees (gwei) = Gas price × Gas units = 21,000 × 0.15 = 3,150 gwei Gas fees (ETH) = 3,150 gwei × (1 ETH / 1,000,000,000 gwei) = 0.00000315 ETH Gas fees (USD) = 0.00000315 ETH × $4,000 / ETH = $0.0126 (~1.3 cents) Note: 1 gwei = 10 −9 ETH . Why Gas Fees Fluctuate Peak Usage Times Gas fees usually climb when trading activity is at its highest. Ethereum trading volume isn’t evenly spread across the world—it follows market hours. Europe handles about a third of global crypto volume and the US pushes trillions in yearly trades. That’s why gas fees often spike during US–EU overlap hours. Asia-Pacific is close behind, making up more than a third of global volume. Countries like India, Vietnam, and South Korea see strong activity, which means fees can also rise during Asian market hours. Fees usually drop on weekends and public holidays since fewer traders are active. They also follow market cycles. Bull runs push fees higher, while bear markets calm things down and make gas fees cheaper. Large On-Chain Events (NFT Drops, Token Launches) Massive on-chain events can send gas fees through the roof. When a hyped NFT collection drops or a new token launches, thousands of users often try to interact with the same smart contract at the exact same time. This creates intense competition for block space, and validators naturally pick the transactions with the highest fees first. As people keep raising their gas prices to outbid others, costs can skyrocket in minutes. Network Upgrades and Fee Model Changes Gas fees can change dramatically when a blockchain updates its rules or introduces a new fee system. For example, Ethereum’s London Hard Fork made fees more predictable but still sensitive to demand. Other upgrades might tweak block size, validator incentives, or how transactions are prioritized, all of which can impact what you pay. Even small changes in protocol logic can shift fees up or down, especially if they affect how much data a transaction uses or how quickly blocks fill up. How to Reduce Gas Fees Use Off-Peak Transaction Times One of the easiest ways to save on gas fees is to send your transactions when the network isn’t highly active. On Ethereum, fees often drop during weekends or late at night, when fewer people are trading, minting NFTs, or interacting with DeFi. When you avoid peak hours, you’ll face less competition for block space, which means lower gas price. Choose Cheaper Networks or Layer 2 Solutions Layer 2s like Arbitrum , Optimism, and zkSync run on top of Ethereum but process most of the work off-chain, so you still get Ethereum’s security at a fraction of the price. A swap that might cost $5–$10 on mainnet can be well under $1 on a Layer 2. Alternatively, you can choose entirely different blockchains—like Polygon, Solana, or BNB Chain—where fees are often just pennies or even fractions of a cent. For frequent transactions, those savings add up fast. Bundle Transactions Where Possible Instead of paying separate fees for each action, a bundled transaction processes them together. So you only pay for the combined gas cost once. For example, some DeFi protocols let you approve and swap tokens in a single transaction. Some NFT marketplaces may allow batch transfers. While the gas limit for a bundled transaction is higher than a single simple one, it’s still much cheaper than sending each transaction separately. Set Custom Gas in Your Wallet Most wallets let you manually set your gas price and gas limit, giving you more control over how much you pay. Instead of accepting the default “fast” or “instant” options, you can lower the priority fee if you’re not in a rush. For example, if the suggested priority tip is 2 gwei, you might try 1 gwei or even less during quieter periods. Just remember, setting it too low could fail your transaction if the network gets busy. Common Misconceptions About Gas Fees Paying Higher Gas Always Makes Transactions Faster This one’s easily believed, but it’s not always true. Yes, if you pay more, your transaction tends to get picked sooner, but that doesn’t guarantee lightning-fast confirmations, especially when blocks are packed tight or when the network behaves unexpectedly. There’s also a point of diminishing returns. After a certain level, adding more gas doesn’t make your transaction noticeably faster, it just makes it more expensive. Gas Fees Are the Same Across All Blockchains It’s easy to assume that all blockchains charge similar fees, but that’s not true. The fees you pay depend on how a blockchain reaches consensus, how big and fast its blocks are, and the features or upgrades it has in place. Consensus mechanism: Blockchains use different systems like proof-of-work (POW) or proof-of-stake (POS), and these change how much computing power is needed, which affects fees. Block size and speed: Networks with bigger or faster blocks can handle more transactions, which often keeps fees lower. Network features: Upgrades or unique rules in a network can also impact how fees are set. Gas fees aren’t universal—they depend entirely on the blockchain you’re using and how that network is built. Gas Fees Go to the Blockchain Company A lot of people think gas fees are like a service charge paid to the company “running” the blockchain. This is not applicable because blockchains are decentralized. On Ethereum, the base fee is burned while the priority tip goes to the validator who processes your transaction. Bitcoin fees go to miners as part of their block rewards, and on Solana or Polygon, validators earn the fees for validating transactions. Gas fees are either destroyed or paid out to the network participants who keep things running. Future of Gas Fees Ethereum Scaling Plans (Sharding, Rollups) Ethereum’s long-term plan to tame gas fees is through sharding and rollups. Sharding will split the Ethereum network into smaller chains called “shards.” Each shard works like a mini-database, handling queries and transactions on its own. Shards will make Ethereum faster and more efficient. Rollups—like Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge Rollups are already live on Layer 2. They batch transactions off-chain and submit them to Ethereum in bulk, slashing the cost per transaction while keeping Ethereum-level security. Rollups and sharding will make high fees the exception, not the rule. Gasless Transactions and Meta Transactions Gasless transactions let you use a blockchain without paying gas fees. Instead, a third party—often called a relayer—covers the cost and might get reimbursed later in tokens, stablecoins, or even through advertising or promotions. Meta transactions work in a similar way. You sign a transaction off-chain, and the relayer submits it on-chain while paying the gas. This approach is popular in dApps and games where developers want to give users a smooth, “no-wallet-hassle” experience. The big win here is usability—people can interact with the blockchain without worrying about gas, which makes onboarding new users much easier. Competing Low-Fee Blockchains A growing number of blockchains are competing by offering fast transactions with fees so low they’re almost invisible. Solana charges fractions of a cent for most actions, even during high activity. Polygon mirrors Ethereum’s functionality but keeps costs down to pennies or less. BNB Chain combines low fees with high throughput, making it popular for DeFi and gaming. These networks attract users and developers who want to avoid Ethereum’s sometimes steep gas costs, especially for high-volume or low-value transactions. Wrapping Up Gas fees are a huge part of how blockchains work. They keep networks secure, reward the people who validate transactions, and stop the system from being spammed. With smart timing, the right tools, and newer scaling solutions, you can often bring those fees way down. In the end, understanding gas fees isn’t just about saving money—it’s about making better, faster, and more informed moves in the crypto world.",Blockchain 101: Information & Guides|ARB|BTC|ETH|Ethereum|OP|POL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-21 13:45:05

It has been a wild ride for OKB investors as this exchange token went up from $46 to $105 in just a day after X Layer announced the burn. 90%+ of $OKB has successfully transitioned to its new home on X Layer from the Ethereum L1.

The price retreated a bit to around $90 and then exploded just a few days after to its current high of $205. OKB was primarily bought by users of the OKX crypto exchange to get discounts on trading fees. Those who held on to the token during this rally have already booked a 350% gain. OKB Price Prediction: OKB Volumes Explode But RSI Flashes Warning Signal Trading volumes for OKB have exploded by 394% in the past 24 hours alone with $1.3 billion worth of the token exchanging hands during that brief period. This figure accounts for 30% of the asset’s circulating supply. It seems highly likely that OKB will hit $220 today once the American session opens. The daily chart shows the strong vertical ascent that OKB has experienced since the burn. There are a couple of support areas to watch in case of a retreat at this point. These levels could provide attractive entries for late buyers. The $123 is perhaps the most relevant from a technical standpoint as the project’s market cap would sit at its pre-burn level if it hits that mark. However, that would require a highly unlikely 40% drop from OKB’s current price level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) favors an imminent pullback as it has entered extreme overbought levels. Even though OKB may not hit $123, any meaningful retreat could be considered a buying opportunity as the baseline OKB price prediction is still bullish.

One of the tokens shining in this turnaround is OKB, the native token of exchange OKX, which surged more than 51% in the last 24 hours. The price is currently trading at around $201.33 at press time. The surge has been fuelled by an aggressive token burn that cut circulating supply by 93%, intensifying demand and drawing strong inflows of capital. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators show a dominant bullish trend, though some data signals point to short-term caution. OKB climbs 85% in seven days after supply cut OKB has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the past week, with its value up nearly 85%. The dramatic rise coincides with the exchange’s latest token burn that wiped out the majority of OKB’s circulating supply. By cutting availability to just 7% of earlier levels, the move created scarcity, which typically boosts buying pressure. Trading volume has also spiked significantly in the past 24 hours, reflecting strong participation from both retail and institutional investors. Liquidity inflows have lifted OKB’s market activity to its highest level in months, reinforcing the current bullish momentum. Capital inflows support bullish momentum Alongside price momentum, capital inflows have also strengthened OKB’s position. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures liquidity moving into and out of an asset, is currently trending higher above the zero line. At 0.24, its strongest reading in three months, the indicator signals robust buying pressure and sustained accumulation by holders. Together, the token burn, reduced supply, and inflows are combining to drive demand for OKB. Analysts monitoring the charts say such readings reflect an asset under strong market interest, with price action supported by consistent capital injection. Overbought signals point to a possible correction Despite the strong rally, data shows that OKB is now heavily overbought. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a widely tracked indicator of overbought and oversold conditions, is currently at 93.24. An RSI above 70 typically signals that an asset is overbought and vulnerable to a pullback. If selling pressure emerges, technical support could bring the token down towards $142.88, a level that may be tested if investor momentum cools. Still, as long as demand remains strong and capital inflows continue, the possibility of OKB retesting and pushing beyond its all-time high remains open. Market outlook for OKB after record highs OKB’s rapid climb highlights how aggressive token supply reductions can dramatically reshape market dynamics. With the burn cutting 93% of supply, the resulting scarcity has added a layer of momentum that few other tokens have seen this week. As the wider crypto market attempts recovery, OKB’s performance stands out as one of the strongest, though its overheated indicators suggest that volatility is likely in the short term.

This immediate downturn across major indices prompts crucial questions for investors, especially those keenly watching the dynamic cryptocurrency space. Understanding these market movements is vital for making informed decisions in an increasingly interconnected global economy. What Triggered This US Stock Market Decline Today? The opening bell revealed a noticeable dip across America’s leading indices. The S&P 500 saw a modest decrease of 0.23%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite also registered a 0.25% fall. The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced the most pronounced drop, declining by 0.36%. This collective US stock market decline reflects immediate market reactions to various underlying factors. Investors are currently processing fresh economic data, corporate earnings reports, and ongoing geopolitical developments. These elements often converge to influence investor sentiment, leading to shifts in trading patterns and overall market performance. How Does the US Stock Market Decline Impact Crypto? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the performance of traditional markets, particularly the US stock market decline , is always a point of interest. Historically, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have shown an increasing correlation with equities, especially tech stocks. When the stock market faces headwinds, it often creates a ripple effect in the crypto arena. Investors might reduce their exposure to riskier assets, which can include digital currencies. This phenomenon is often observed during periods of economic uncertainty or when liquidity tightens across global financial systems. However, some argue that a significant US stock market decline could also present a unique opportunity for crypto. Some view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional financial system instability, while others consider such dips as prime moments for accumulation, believing in crypto’s long-term potential. Navigating Volatility: Investor Strategies Amidst a US Stock Market Decline Navigating market volatility requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. When the US stock market decline occurs, it is essential for investors to adopt prudent measures to protect their portfolios and identify potential opportunities. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic news, central bank policies, and market analysis to understand underlying trends. Diversify Portfolios: Spread investments across different asset classes, including both traditional and digital assets, to mitigate concentrated risk. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making rash decisions based on short-term fluctuations; focus on your long-term investment goals. Risk Management: Implement clear risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders or defining profit targets, to manage exposure effectively. These strategies apply equally to both traditional stocks and the dynamic cryptocurrency market. Understanding your personal risk tolerance is paramount during such periods of market uncertainty. What Lies Ahead for Markets After This US Stock Market Decline? The immediate US stock market decline does not necessarily dictate the long-term trajectory. Markets are dynamic, influenced by a constant flow of information and sentiment shifts. Analysts will be closely watching upcoming economic indicators, central bank statements, and global geopolitical events for clues about future movements. For the crypto market, its resilience and ability to decouple, or further correlate, with traditional finance will be a key theme to observe. While short-term dips can be unsettling, they are a normal part of market cycles. The broader focus remains on continued innovation within the blockchain space and the accelerating adoption of digital assets globally. Today’s US stock market decline serves as a timely reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While traditional indices saw an initial dip, the implications for cryptocurrency investors are multifaceted. Staying informed, maintaining a strategic outlook, and understanding market dynamics are key to navigating these shifts successfully. The financial landscape is ever-evolving, and adapting to its rhythms is an essential part of the investment journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the US stock market open lower today? A1: The US stock market opened lower due to immediate market reactions to various factors, including fresh economic data, corporate earnings reports, and ongoing geopolitical developments that influenced investor sentiment. Q2: Is a US stock market decline always bad for cryptocurrency? A2: Not necessarily. While cryptocurrencies often show correlation with traditional equities, especially tech stocks, some investors view significant dips as opportunities for accumulation or even as a potential hedge against traditional financial instability. Q3: What are the key indices affected by this decline? A3: The main indices affected were the S&P 500 (-0.23%), NASDAQ (-0.25%), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.36%). Q4: How can crypto investors prepare for market volatility? A4: Crypto investors can prepare by staying informed, diversifying their portfolios, maintaining a long-term perspective, and implementing robust risk management strategies. Q5: What is the correlation between the US stock market and crypto? A5: Historically, there has been an increasing correlation between the US stock market (particularly tech stocks) and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When one moves, the other often follows, though this relationship can vary. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Wealth advisers say they are fielding more calls, trading platforms report heavier activity, and specialist funds are drawing steady inflows as wealthy investors look to add exposure. “We raised over $100 million in just a few months, and the response from LPs has been encouraging,” said Jason Huang, founder of NextGen Digital Venture. He said that his investors are primarily family offices and tech entrepreneurs who see digital assets becoming important in diversified portfolios. At the same time, Swiss bank UBS says a number of Chinese family offices abroad intend to lift crypto holdings to about 5% of total assets. “Many second and third-generation individuals of family offices are starting to learn about and participate in virtual currencies,” said Lu Zijie, who runs UBS China’s wealth management division. The renewed appetite follows fat market gains and supportive steps in the US during President Donald Trump’s term, including the newly approved GENIUS Act . Bitcoin has set fresh records this month, climbing past $124,000. Similarly, in Hong Kong, a new stablecoin law has also fired up interest. Regulation drives growing crypto confidence Advisers say the tone for Asian clients has shifted from a token slice several years ago to a sense that crypto now belongs in a standard portfolio, with more effort going into tools to improve returns and manage risk. “The momentum has gathered, and I believe it’s a function of just general maturity of the asset class,” Saad Ahmed from Gemini said. Lighthouse Canton, a Singapore wealth manager, says more advanced family offices are testing market-neutral tactics, including arbitrage and basis trade strategies to seek steadier results regardless of price swings. Institutional platforms echo the shift . According to Giselle Lai from Fidelity International, investors increasingly treat Bitcoin as a “portfolio diversifier” used to hedge macro shocks because of its weak links to stocks and bonds. Trading platforms report sharp increases in growth and activity Exchanges across the region are seeing the payoff in user growth and activity. Hong Kong’s HashKey Exchange reported that registered accounts were up 85% year-on-year in August 2025. This followed the launch of Asia’s first XRP tracker fund by HashKey, as reported earlier by Cryptopolitan . In South Korea, total trading across the three biggest platforms has risen 17% so far in 2025 versus the same stretch of 2024, while average daily volumes are up over 20%, according to data from firm CryptoQuant. With inquiries piling up and rules settling in, wealth managers say the scramble for crypto know-how among Asia’s affluent is unlikely to fade soon, even as they remain alert to the market’s sharp moves. For many, disciplined risk controls now sit alongside bolder allocation plans ahead.

PI Price Primed for Recovery, Pumps 4% Overnight",https://cryptonews.com/news/is-pi-coin-resurfacing-pi-price-primed-for-recovery-pumps-4-overnight/,"Pi Coin went up by as much as 4% in the past 24 hours and currently stands above $0.36. Trading volumes have exploded by 64% during this period and the price action seems to be favoring a bullish Pi Coin price prediction despite the token’s latest retreat. Pi’s daily trading volumes have been under $100 million in the past 9 days and hit a low point at $26 million on August 26 as investors have completely lost interest in this token amid its persistent downtrend. The native asset of the Pi Network has failed to capture the wave of positive momentum that has hit cryptos lately and has booked a 79% year-to-date loss as users have lost confidence in the project. Top crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have refused to list Pi in their trading platforms as the project has been flagged as a scam by authorities in multiple countries while the smart contract that powers Pi Coin is not fully open source. Centralization complaints have also plagued Pi’s reputation and favor a bearish Pi Coin price prediction unless they are addressed at some point. Pi Coin Price Prediction: PI Could Recover to $0.60 If This Pattern is Confirmed The 4-hour chart shows that Pi has been making higher lows lately. An early indication that the downtrend may be over. After hitting an all-time low at around $0.32, the token has not dropped to those levels once again in 20 days. That said, Pi Coin has made a series of lower highs that indicate significant price compression. If the price stays above $0.335 support area highlighted in the chart, that would favor a bullish Pi Coin price prediction as it should lead to a breakout of the descending triangle. The first target for Pi Coin could be set at $0.45 in that case and then to $0.60 if positive momentum gains enough traction. This means a 66% upside potential from where Pi Coin is now as long as this breakout is confirmed. Pi Coin has disappointed investors ever since the project launched its public mainnet. Meanwhile, the best meme coins like Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) are taking full advantage of altcoin season and could 10X as a result of its latest move. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Could Explode After Solana Migration Wall Stree Pepe (WEPE) is migrating to the Solana blockchain after its successful launch on Ethereum and this move could mark the beginning of a new bull market for this top meme coin. After its millionaire presale earlier this year, the launch team has kept moving forward with the project’s roadmap and is now embarking on this ambitious migration to attract higher trading volumes. Solana is well known as the go-to blockchain for meme coins and will be the best home for WEPE. As an added incentive to the community, Wall Street Pepe will burn a significant portion of the circulating supply as the migration advances. For every dollar worth of WEPE on Ethereum that is migrated, the corresponding amount will be burned in Solana. Once the migration is completed, the price will likely explode as a result of these initiatives. You can buy $WEPE and join the WEPE army via the official Wall Street Pepe by either connecting your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ) or using a bank card.

Nasdaq-listed Reborn Coffee (ticker: REBN) is embarking on an exciting journey, planning to pilot crypto payments at select stores. This move, reported by Investors Collective on X, signals a growing interest in integrating digital currencies into everyday retail experiences. What are Crypto Payments and Why Now? Crypto payments involve using digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum to pay for goods and services. Unlike traditional banking, these transactions often occur on a decentralized network, offering a new way to handle money. Reborn Coffee’s decision to explore this frontier comes at a time when cryptocurrency adoption is steadily expanding. Businesses are increasingly recognizing the potential benefits of accepting digital assets, from lower transaction fees to attracting a tech-savvy customer base. This pilot program is a significant indicator of mainstream retail embracing the digital finance revolution. The Benefits of Embracing Crypto Payments for Businesses Why would a coffee chain like Reborn Coffee venture into the world of digital currencies? There are several compelling reasons that make crypto payments an attractive option for businesses looking to innovate and stay competitive. Reduced Transaction Fees: Traditional credit card processing fees can be substantial. Crypto transactions, especially direct peer-to-peer ones, can offer lower costs. Faster Settlements: Depending on the cryptocurrency and network, transactions can settle much quicker than traditional banking methods, improving cash flow. Attracting New Customers: The cryptocurrency community is large and growing. Accepting digital assets can appeal to a niche market eager to spend their crypto holdings. Enhanced Security: Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies, offers a high level of security and transparency for transactions. Global Reach: For businesses with an international presence or online sales, crypto payments can simplify cross-border transactions. Navigating the Challenges of Digital Currency Adoption While the potential of crypto payments is vast, implementing them isn’t without its challenges. Reborn Coffee, like any pioneer, will likely encounter various hurdles during its pilot phase. Consider these common obstacles: Price Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly and rapidly. This poses a risk for businesses holding crypto if the value drops before conversion to fiat currency. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Businesses must stay informed about changing laws and compliance requirements. User Education and Adoption: Not all customers are familiar with using cryptocurrencies. Businesses may need to educate their staff and customers on how to make these payments. Technical Integration: Setting up the necessary infrastructure to accept and process crypto payments requires technical expertise and reliable payment processors. Reborn Coffee’s pilot will provide valuable insights into how these challenges can be effectively managed in a real-world retail environment. What Does This Mean for Mainstream Crypto Adoption? Reborn Coffee’s initiative is more than just a business experiment; it is a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of crypto payments . When a Nasdaq-listed company, operating in a high-traffic consumer sector like coffee, embraces digital currency, it sends a strong signal to other businesses. This pilot could inspire other retail chains to explore similar payment options, gradually normalizing the use of cryptocurrencies for everyday purchases. As more businesses adopt this technology, it could lead to increased user confidence, improved payment infrastructure, and ultimately, broader acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate form of payment. The Future is Brewing: A Compelling Outlook Reborn Coffee’s pilot program for crypto payments in Southern California is an exciting development. It highlights the growing convergence of traditional retail and innovative financial technology. This move not only positions Reborn Coffee as a forward-thinking brand but also contributes to the ongoing evolution of how we transact. The success of such pilots could pave the way for a future where paying with digital currency is as common as swiping a credit card or tapping a phone. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of both the coffee industry and the cryptocurrency world, constantly adapting and innovating to meet consumer demands. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Which cryptocurrencies will Reborn Coffee accept during the pilot? A1: The initial report does not specify which cryptocurrencies Reborn Coffee plans to accept. Details typically emerge closer to the pilot launch. Q2: Why is Reborn Coffee piloting crypto payments? A2: Reborn Coffee is likely exploring crypto payments to innovate, reduce transaction costs, attract new customers, and stay ahead in the evolving digital economy. Q3: Will all Reborn Coffee locations accept crypto payments? A3: No, the report indicates that the pilot will be at select stores in Southern California, not all locations initially. Q4: How does accepting crypto payments benefit customers? A4: For customers, it offers an alternative payment method, potentially faster transactions, and the ability to utilize their digital assets for everyday purchases. Q5: What are the risks for Reborn Coffee in accepting crypto payments? A5: Key risks include cryptocurrency price volatility, navigating evolving regulations, and ensuring seamless technical integration and user adoption. Did you find this article insightful?

Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ The price of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency has already slipped by over 7% since touching $124,450 last week, raising doubts about the strength of its next move. Wave Structure Signals Critical Stage According to technical analyst CasiTrades, Bitcoin touched a low of $112,500 earlier today, a level that aligned with multiple timeframe targets. The move also came with bullish divergences on momentum indicators, which pointed to a short-term rebound. The analyst framed this drop as part of a corrective pattern, calling it Wave 1 of an A-wave. The next stage, labeled Wave 2, is expected to deliver a relief bounce. CasiTrades suggested that this move could carry Bitcoin back into the $119,900 to $121,900 zone. 🚨 They laughed & Bitcoin Delivered Exactly as Forecasted. Why the Next Move Matters Even More! 🚨 Following up on my last post, where I mapped out the A-wave targeting the major .382 retracement at $77K, we just completed Wave 1 of A with the recent low at $112,500. That was a… pic.twitter.com/cOn8rJ9OZL — CasiTrades 🔥 (@CasiTrades) August 20, 2025 If rejection happens there, the decline could intensify into Wave 3, with possible downside reaching as far as $88,000. Reports explained that the bearish scenario would be invalidated if Bitcoin could print a new all-time high beyond $124,500. That would necessitate a reset in the corrective setup, which would have bulls with more leverage in the short term. Altcoins Show Signs Of Rotation As Bitcoin struggles with resistance, bigger-cap altcoins have been exhibiting mixed action. CasiTrades thinks that traders may move into these assets in Bitcoin’s downtime, anticipating that they will make more considerable movements in the meantime. XRP, which dropped to $2.85 earlier in the day, has rebounded slightly and now trades at $2.90. That still leaves it down 1.30% over the last 24 hours. Ethereum is faring better, gaining 1.8% to trade at $4,269, while Solana added 2.5% to reach $183. Market watchers say this kind of rotation is not unusual. When Bitcoin stalls at major resistance levels, traders often chase higher returns in altcoins that carry more volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Captures Investor Frenzy, Overtakes Bitcoin With Nearly $3-B Surge Uncertainty Ahead For Traders The focus remains squarely on the $120K–$122K area. A clean breakout would indicate that Bitcoin is gaining strength again, while rejection would validate CasiTrades’ expectation of a greater fall. They are now considering those possibilities, with some waiting to build up on dips and others opting to remain in wait-and-see mode until the picture becomes clearer. For the time being, the market is divided between anticipation of a rebound and fear of further correction. Altcoins are showing some relief with isolated areas of green, but the response of Bitcoin at resistance will tend to dictate the tone for the next few days.

50443483,561852,1755784855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50443483.jpeg,Bitcoin Author Saifedean Exposes Milei’s ‘Economic Miracle’ As Fiat Fraud,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-saifedean-milei-economic-miracle-fiat-fraud/,"Saifedean Ammous—best known in the Bitcoin community as the author of The Bitcoin Standard—has attacked Argentine President Javier Milei’s stabilization program as a bond-fueled “fiat fraud,” arguing that the policy mix flatters official statistics while deepening the country’s dependence on multilateral lenders and peso-denominated carry trades. In a lengthy X post on August 20, Ammous framed last week’s bond rollover as a reality check: “Argentina’s Javier Milei regime tried to roll over bonds by offering investors an insane 69% interest rate, and only succeeded in rolling over 61% of them. Even a 69% annual interest rate isn’t enough to tempt investors to risk lending to the Milei ponzi.” He punctuated the thread with a line he says Milei himself used after a memecoin debacle: “No Crying in the Casino!” Bitcoin Vs. Fiat: Milei Picks His Side Ammous’ critique is explicitly Bitcoin-versus-fiat. He claims the administration “reneged on [its] campaign promise to shut down the central bank,” chose to expand money-supply measures instead of “stop[ping] creating money,” and raised taxes while seeking an IMF rescue —moves he calls “the same old fiat banksterism.” The Bitcoin author’s monetary prescription is unambiguous: “After almost two years in office, it would have been absolutely trivial for Milei to bring price inflation down to close to zero with the one simple trick… stop creating money.” In Ammous’ telling, anything short of extinguishing discretionary money creation cannot be sold to Bitcoiners as sound policy. On debt and multilateral financing, Ammous alleges that the latest arrangements amount to record-breaking exposure to official creditors and a mortgaging of future fiscal space. “With this new $20b in IMF loans, Argentina now has the highest outstanding debt to the IMF in IMF history… borrowing is now at 1,352% of its IMF quota,” he writes, adding that the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank “also” committed roughly $12 billion and $10 billion, respectively, bringing “a total of $42 billion borrowed from international institutions.” He characterizes the show of support, celebrated by local officials, as a pyrrhic victory for fiat: “Point 5 is not a win, it is an L.” The Bitcoin-versus-fiat framing extends to prices, exchange rates, and data quality. Ammous argues that government statistics understate the erosion of purchasing power, but says even the official numbers are damning. “After year-on-year price inflation rates rose to almost 300% in the first few months of his presidency, it has declined to the 30–40% range in recent months, and the cumulative price inflation since Milei has taken office is 155%,” he writes. He underscores pressure on the peso by citing both the black-market and official rates: “The black market peso exchange rate has dropped 30% against the dollar in just 21 months… The official rate… has dropped by around 70%, from 400 pesos per dollar to 1,300 pesos per dollar. Just in the last month of July, both rates dropped around 13%.” Bitcoin Doesn’t Default—Fiat Always Does Ammous, speaking from a hard-money and Bitcoin perspective, insists that free markets cannot coexist with monetary discretion: “All talk of a free market is empty rhetoric as long as the government manipulates the money.” He links this to the high-yield peso bond complex—what he dubs a “shitcoin casino”—arguing that “the central bank is imposing an interest rate of 65%, making speculation on the government’s bonds the only possibly profitable industry.” In Bitcoin circles, that argument resonates with a longstanding critique: fiat incentives manufacture yield-chasing behavior that collapses when confidence wobbles, while Bitcoin’s fixed issuance schedule avoids that cycle by design. His post also alleges problematic asset management and bank risk. “Milei shipped off the little that remained of Argentina’s once significant gold reserves to London in search for a quick yield buck,” Ammous claims, before warning that new regulations could again funnel household savings into sovereign risk: “Milei and Caputo are currently trying to force the banks to buy more government bonds, yet again using the savings of Argentinians to prop up the government’s unsustainable debt… bringing back painful memories of the Corralón of 2001.” The Bitcoin author’s broader contention is that fiat systems externalize crisis risk onto depositors and domestic savers, while Bitcoin self-custody avoids those channels. The administration’s supporters—some of them Bitcoiners—push back. Fernando Nikolić, founder of Perception responded point-by-point that “inflation has dramatically declined,” “GDP growth is projected at 5.5%,” “currency controls were successfully eliminated without crisis,” and “the budget achieved [a] historic surplus.” He framed the outcome as proof that markets and institutions “rewarded Milei’s more gradual approach,” even if it falls short of an immediate central-bank shutdown favored by Austrian economists and many Bitcoin advocates. Ammous dismissed the rebuttal: “You either didn’t read what I wrote or you’re incapable of comprehending what you read… Point 5 is not a win, it is an L. Muted for wasting my time with stupidity.” Beyond the clash of tone, the substantive disagreement is philosophical and monetary. Ammous’ benchmark is Bitcoin-standard discipline: close the central bank , anchor money supply, let relative prices reset, and rebuild on hard money—painful initially, in his view, but durable. The government’s approach is classic fiat stabilization: disinflate with tight policy, widen financing buffers with IMF/WB/IDB lines, normalize the FX regime, and nurse domestic markets back to depth—politically survivable if growth returns, but reliant on confidence, rollover capacity, and high local-currency rates that Bitcoiners see as the hallmark of fiat fragility. For now, both narratives point to the same hinge variables: peso rollover capacity at “insane” yields, the pace of disinflation, the behavior of parallel exchange rates, and whether multilateral support remains politically and financially sustainable. If those levers tighten simultaneously, Bitcoin’s critique will look prescient; if they hold, the case for a fiat stabilization hardens. In Ammous’ words, however, Bitcoin is the only durable exit: “It would have been absolutely trivial… stop creating money.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $113,612.",Bitcoin News|Argentina|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Javier Milei|Saifedean Ammous,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 14:00:55

While some investors think that DOGE and SHIB will become investors' favorites again, some have given up hope for this bull. However, Joao Wedson, CEO of analytics firm Alphractal, shared his new analysis of SHIB. The renowned CEO stated that SHIB will return to prominence. Wedson noted that on-chain data indicates that SHIB is in the accumulation phase and the price is likely to rise. Stating that one metric signals that the SHIB price could increase by at least 125%, the CEO stated that SHIB will experience a big bull run, albeit late. Wedson also underlined that the cryptocurrency peak will have arrived when memecoins become the focus of attention in the market again. Shiba Inu (SHIB) was a famous memecoin in 2021, but will it be able to gain traction again in 2025? On-chain data suggests that SHIB is in the accumulation phase. Metrics like Realized Cap Impulse suggest the company could soon turn positive, attracting speculative capital and pushing its price higher. But NUPL still shows a lot of money at risk, causing investors to hesitate. Meanwhile, Alpha Price (our proprietary metric), which we rarely exceed but acts like a massive magnet, is signaling that SHIB could rise by at least 125%. Despite the current instability in the crypto market, SHIB will come to the fore sooner or later. When memecoins take center stage, you can be sure this will be the peak of this crypto cycle. *This is not investment advice.

According to his latest analysis shared on X, this level represents a decisive threshold that could shift momentum in favor of the bulls and open the door to higher resistance zones. For traders closely watching XRP’s price structure, this call provides a concrete reference point in an otherwise volatile market. Why This Range Matters Daily closes carry more weight than intraday spikes because they reflect consensus across a full trading session. By reclaiming $2.96–$3.03 on a closing basis, XRP would demonstrate that buyers have absorbed selling pressure and flipped a key resistance into support. This kind of technical confirmation reduces the risk of false breakouts and gives traders a stronger signal that momentum is turning sustainably upward. #XRP – Closing Above $2.96-$3.03 is the next objective on Daily Time Frame: pic.twitter.com/SGR6PB7LLy — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 21, 2025 Current Price Action XRP has been oscillating between the high-$2 and low-$3 range. It briefly pushed to $3.09 before retracing to around $2.89, highlighting the tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Importantly, recent attempts to reclaim the $3 level have been accompanied by higher-than-average volume, showing that participation is robust and not limited to thin retail-driven rallies. Technical Setup and Next Levels The $2.96–$3.03 band aligns with several technical markers, including moving averages and the upper boundary of a consolidation wedge. A decisive close above this cluster could pave the way toward the $3.40–$3.65 zone, where Fibonacci extensions and weekly supply levels converge. On the flip side, failure to break above this resistance may keep XRP rangebound and even expose it to a pullback toward $2.65–$2.70. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Trading Considerations For traders, patience and confirmation are key. A daily close above $3.00 backed by strong volume would be the strongest signal of continuation. Conservative market participants may wait for a retest of the breakout zone to confirm it as support before entering positions. Meanwhile, those anticipating volatility should be mindful of leverage-driven “stop hunts” that often occur near critical technical levels. Broader Market Context This setup for XRP comes at a time when liquidity across digital assets continues to deepen. Institutional participation and the growth of derivatives markets have made technical breakouts more meaningful, attracting larger flows than in previous cycles. CoinDesk recently reported that trading volumes surged significantly during XRP’s latest push to $2.99, reinforcing the importance of this level. Egrag has also noted that while the daily close above $2.96–$3.03 is the immediate focus, a monthly close above $3.30 would serve as a higher-timeframe confirmation of a structural breakout. Egrag Crypto’s analysis boils down to a simple but crucial benchmark: a clean daily close above $2.96–$3.03. If achieved, this could mark the beginning of XRP’s next bullish leg toward higher resistance zones. If not, consolidation is likely to continue until a stronger catalyst emerges. For traders, this range now represents the line in the sand — and the market’s next big test. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

ETH/USD Plummets Below $4150 Overnight, Rebound in Sight?",https://cryptonews.com/news/is-the-2025-bull-run-dead-eth-usd-plummets-below-4150-overnight-rebound-in-sight/,"The Ethereum/USD pair experienced a sharp decline below $4,150 during overnight trading on August 20, after previously reaching a high of $4,329. This sudden drop has sparked concerns across the broader crypto market about whether the anticipated 2025 bull run has come to an end. However, intervention from whales and institutional investors has helped the price maintain support above the crucial $4,200 level, alleviating some of the “bull run is dead” anxiety and restoring optimism for an Ethereum price recovery. Institutional Support For ETH Suggests Bull Run Is Not Dead Institutional backing remains strong, as evidenced by a U.S. Government Fund wallet purchasing $332,460 worth of ETH on August 20. This entity currently maintains holdings of 65,232 ETH, valued at approximately $281 million. Dan Tapiero, Founder of Growth Equity Fund 50TFUND, reasserts confidence that the Bitcoin and Ethereum bull market has substantial room for growth and is far from finished. Bitcoin and Eth bull mkt still has a lot further to run. No chance lending doesn't go multiples over where it was in '21. Americanization of Crypto is driver. Lending only still in its infancy. Btc and eth legitimate collateral. Old world salivates at the opportunity. pic.twitter.com/OSJUm45k0z — Dan Tapiero (@DTAPCAP) August 21, 2025 He attributes this optimism to the “Americanization” of cryptocurrency through favorable regulatory policies in the United States. With BTC and ETH establishing themselves as legitimate collateral assets, Tapiero believes they possess significant upside potential before 2025 concludes. Many Ethereum enthusiasts are now closely monitoring Friday’s Jackson Hole summit, where Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to address the market with key insights. If Powell adopts a dovish tone, analysts believe ETH could resume its rally toward new all-time highs. Conversely, a hawkish stance might result in price volatility for 3-4 weeks, with a major breakout potentially delayed until Q4. Technical ETH/USD Analysis Points to Bullish Potential From a technical standpoint, the ETHUSD 4-hour chart appears to be forming a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern. The left shoulder, head, and initial formation of the right shoulder are already visible. The neckline resistance sits approximately at the $4,600 level, and a confirmed breakout above this threshold would target the $4,872 zone, with potential for higher gains if momentum accelerates. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator reads approximately 46, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, though it leans toward the weaker side with limited bullish momentum. The pattern suggests bullish potential if ETH can maintain current support levels and advance toward the neckline. However, failure to build strength could invalidate this setup and push prices back toward the $4,100–$4,000 range. Crypto Futures Trading Gains Momentum Amid Market Uncertainty As the crypto market awaits confirmation of continued bull run momentum, both institutional investors and retail traders are exploring opportunities to maximize returns. Crypto futures trading is experiencing significant growth in this environment. However, selecting the appropriate platform remains essential. Retail traders seeking to compete effectively with institutional players require access to the same level of execution speed and leverage options. Crypto Futures platform, CoinFutures , has quietly emerged as a preferred choice among trading experts, offering instant account setup and leverage options up to 1000x. While liquidation risks increase significantly with high leverage trading, CoinFutures allows users to select any leverage multiple between 1x and 1000x, providing flexibility in risk management. Investors looking to position themselves for the next phase of the ongoing bull market can leverage CoinFutures to capture substantial returns by taking long positions on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A recent headline-grabbing development involves the family office of Cantor Fitzgerald, a globally recognized investment bank. They have made a remarkable $120 million investment into the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), marking a pivotal moment for institutional confidence in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Why is This Fidelity Bitcoin ETF Investment a Game Changer? This substantial financial commitment by a firm closely associated with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, through his family, carries immense weight. Cointelegraph initially reported this pivotal move, which strongly signals the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, as a legitimate and valuable asset class. Cantor Fitzgerald, with its long and distinguished history on Wall Street, now holds a direct stake in this significant Fidelity Bitcoin ETF position. Howard Lutnick, who succeeded Bernard Gerald Cantor as chairman, transferred company ownership to his children after his appointment as commerce secretary, ensuring the family’s continued strategic involvement in the firm’s direction. It is also interesting to note that Cantor Fitzgerald’s broader portfolio includes a substantial $170 million worth of Robinhood shares. This demonstrates a wider strategic interest in financial platforms that cater to evolving investment trends, including digital assets. The firm’s recent dive into FBTC is a clear, bold step towards strategic diversification into the burgeoning digital asset sector. What Attracts Major Institutions to Bitcoin ETFs? The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. truly revolutionized how institutional investors approach the crypto market. These regulated investment products offer a familiar and highly accessible pathway for gaining exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Consider the benefits that draw in large entities like the Cantor Fitzgerald family: Regulatory Clarity: Products like the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF operate within established regulatory frameworks, providing a layer of security and compliance that traditional investment vehicles offer. This makes them significantly more appealing than navigating the complexities of direct crypto purchases. Simplified Access: Investors can gain Bitcoin exposure through their existing brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for new wallets, private key management, or concerns about digital asset custody. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs typically offer high liquidity, allowing for easier entry and exit from positions, which is crucial for large-scale investors managing substantial portfolios. These factors collectively reduce the barriers to entry for institutional capital, paving the way for larger allocations into the crypto space. The Ripple Effect: Broader Impact of Fidelity Bitcoin ETF Adoption This $120 million investment from the Cantor Fitzgerald family is far more than just a single transaction; it represents a powerful endorsement. When established financial players with a reputation for astute investment commit such significant capital, it often inspires other traditional institutions to seriously reconsider their positions on digital assets. This move could very well catalyze a “domino effect,” potentially leading to even more capital flowing into various Bitcoin ETFs, including the popular Fidelity Bitcoin ETF . This increased institutional adoption is vital for the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, bringing with it greater stability, deeper liquidity, and enhanced legitimacy. Such substantial investments also strongly reinforce Bitcoin’s evolving position as a valuable asset within diversified investment portfolios. As more traditional firms allocate capital, it solidifies the narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate long-term store of value, often referred to as “digital gold.” What’s Next for Institutional Crypto Investment? The entry of major players like the Cantor Fitzgerald family into the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF space paints a promising picture for the future of institutional crypto adoption. We can confidently anticipate continued and growing interest from various financial sectors as the market matures and regulatory clarity becomes even more pronounced. This ongoing trend is highly likely to drive further innovation in crypto-related financial products, making digital assets even more accessible and attractive to a wider range of investors globally. The transparency and regulatory oversight inherent in spot ETFs are undoubtedly key factors attracting this new wave of significant capital. Ultimately, this astounding investment from a prominent financial family underscores the burgeoning confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. It highlights a clear and irreversible shift in how traditional finance views, evaluates, and integrates digital assets into their core investment strategies. The Cantor Fitzgerald family’s substantial $120 million investment in the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF is indeed a landmark event for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It powerfully demonstrates the increasing institutional comfort and conviction in Bitcoin as a viable and attractive asset class. This bold move by a respected financial entity not only validates Bitcoin but also paves the way for even greater mainstream adoption, further cementing Bitcoin’s crucial place in the evolving landscape of global finance.

This monumental move involves a $133 million investment through MicroStrategy (MSTR), signaling a pivotal moment for institutional adoption of digital assets. This development, first highlighted by The Bitcoin Historian on X, showcases how even traditional, large-scale investment vehicles are beginning to embrace the evolving financial landscape. Understanding CalSTRS’s Strategic Bitcoin Exposure Many might wonder how a teachers’ pension fund invests in Bitcoin. CalSTRS isn’t directly buying Bitcoin. Instead, they are investing in MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock. MicroStrategy is a business intelligence company that has famously adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. By purchasing MSTR shares, CalSTRS indirectly gains CalSTRS Bitcoin exposure , aligning with a growing trend among institutions seeking diversified digital asset investments. This approach offers a pathway for large, regulated entities to participate in the crypto market without directly holding volatile digital assets. It provides a layer of corporate governance and reporting, which can be more palatable for pension funds bound by strict fiduciary duties and complex regulatory frameworks. Why is This CalSTRS Bitcoin Exposure Significant? The decision by CalSTRS carries immense weight for several reasons, impacting both the crypto market and traditional finance: Validation of Bitcoin: It provides further validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, even for conservative, long-term investors like pension funds. This strengthens its perception among mainstream financial players. Pioneering for Pension Funds: CalSTRS is one of the largest pension funds to publicly disclose such a significant indirect CalSTRS Bitcoin exposure . This could pave the way for other similar funds to explore similar avenues, potentially leading to a ripple effect across the pension fund landscape. Increased Institutional Adoption: This move underscores the accelerating trend of institutional capital flowing into the cryptocurrency space. It indicates a maturing market where digital assets are no longer just for retail investors but are becoming integrated into sophisticated portfolios. Diversification Strategy: For pension funds, adding exposure to uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin (even indirectly) can potentially enhance portfolio diversification and long-term returns. This strategy aims to reduce overall portfolio risk while capturing growth opportunities, though it comes with its own set of risks. Navigating the Path to CalSTRS Bitcoin Exposure: Challenges and Considerations While the news is largely positive for the crypto ecosystem, it’s important to acknowledge the complexities involved. Pension funds operate under stringent regulations and have a primary responsibility to protect retirees’ savings. This means their investment decisions are often conservative and highly scrutinized. Key considerations for funds exploring similar paths include: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, which can be a significant concern for funds focused on stable, long-term growth. Indirect exposure via MSTR still means exposure to this volatility, as MSTR’s stock price is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Pension funds must navigate this uncertainty carefully to ensure compliance with existing and future financial regulations, which can be a complex task. Due Diligence: Extensive research and due diligence are crucial before any such investment. Understanding MicroStrategy’s business strategy, its operational risks, and its specific Bitcoin holdings is paramount to assessing the investment’s viability and alignment with fiduciary duties. CalSTRS’s move suggests they have undertaken significant analysis to justify this strategic investment, indicating a growing level of comfort with the digital asset space among sophisticated investors. Their decision reflects a calculated risk assessment, weighing potential benefits against inherent challenges. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Crypto Investment? The revelation of CalSTRS’s investment could serve as a powerful catalyst for broader institutional engagement with digital assets. As more large pension funds and endowments witness the potential benefits and the structured pathways available, we might see a domino effect. This isn’t just about Bitcoin; it’s about the broader acceptance of digital assets as a viable component of a diversified investment portfolio. The indirect nature of this CalSTRS Bitcoin exposure through MSTR highlights a common entry point for institutions. It provides a publicly traded, regulated vehicle, which simplifies compliance and governance issues compared to direct crypto holdings. This model might become increasingly popular as traditional finance seeks ways to tap into the growth of the digital economy without facing the direct complexities of managing volatile digital currencies. The move by CalSTRS truly underscores a shift in perspective within the financial world. It’s no longer a question of “if” institutions will adopt crypto, but “how” and “when” they will expand their exposure. This pension fund’s pioneering step could mark a new chapter in the mainstream integration of digital assets into global financial systems, potentially influencing investment strategies for years to come. In conclusion, CalSTRS’s $133 million indirect CalSTRS Bitcoin exposure via MicroStrategy is a landmark event. It signifies increasing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as an asset, opens new pathways for large funds to engage with crypto, and solidifies the trend towards digital asset integration into traditional investment portfolios. This strategic move by a major U.S. pension fund is a compelling indicator of Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its future role in global finance, prompting conversations across boardrooms worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is CalSTRS? The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) is the third-largest public pension fund in the United States. It provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to California’s public school educators from kindergarten through community college. How does CalSTRS gain Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy (MSTR)? CalSTRS does not directly hold Bitcoin. Instead, it invests in the stock of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a publicly traded company that holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a primary treasury reserve asset. This investment in MSTR shares provides CalSTRS with indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. What is the significance of this CalSTRS Bitcoin exposure for the crypto market? This move by a major U.S. pension fund validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for large institutional investors. It signals increasing institutional adoption and could encourage other conservative funds to explore similar indirect investment avenues, further integrating digital assets into traditional finance. Are other pension funds investing in Bitcoin? While CalSTRS is one of the largest to disclose such a significant indirect investment, a growing number of endowments and pension funds globally are beginning to explore or allocate small portions of their portfolios to digital assets, often through venture funds, private equity, or publicly traded vehicles like MSTR. What are the primary risks for pension funds investing in cryptocurrencies? The main risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, the evolving and sometimes uncertain regulatory landscape, and the due diligence required to understand the underlying assets or the companies providing indirect exposure. Pension funds must balance potential returns with their fiduciary responsibility to protect beneficiaries’ capital. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

After slipping through key support levels, the cryptocurrency is showing signs of a fragile rebound, though broader indicators point to caution. While some analysts anticipate a temporary bounce, the larger trend suggests continued vulnerability as leveraged trades and macroeconomic pressures add to volatility. The price action over the past week has shown Bitcoin bouncing within a narrow range, but technical charts suggest that traders face difficult decisions on whether to hold, short, or position for a rebound. Bitcoin tests support and resistance levels on charts On the hourly chart, Bitcoin recently bounced several times near $112,700, providing temporary support for traders watching intraday moves. However, resistance has remained strong around $114,800, preventing further gains. If the price fails to hold the current floor, a bearish breakout could push Bitcoin toward $110,000. Conversely, breaking above $114,800 may open the way for the next resistance around $116,500, keeping short-term sentiment mixed. Analyst warns of bearish risks after key breakdown Crypto analyst BitcoinHyper shared analysis on social media platform X, noting that Bitcoin’s structure across 1-hour, 2-hour, and 4-hour charts shows a clear downtrend after breaking horizontal and weekly support. BitcoinHyper @BitcoinHypers · Follow If lower, this is the best support on Bitcoin.Most will probably get scared: youtube.com/watch?v=BpOEo6… 4:05 PM · Aug 21, 2025 54 Reply Copy link Read 7 replies Despite a recent 10% drop followed by a short bounce from daily support levels, the analyst warned of deeper risks ahead. His “ideal scenario” includes a short-term rally toward $119,000, potentially triggering a short squeeze that could force liquidations of traders betting against Bitcoin. However, following such a bounce, Bitcoin could face further correction toward $108,000, and in a more severe scenario, decline as far as $18,000 if a larger rising wedge pattern develops. Technical indicators, including the Daily RSI and Stochastic oscillator, currently show oversold conditions, suggesting room for a rebound. Even so, the prevailing trend remains negative, pointing to cautious trading strategies. Market volatility expected amid leveraged positions Experts observed that Bitcoin is likely to trade within a range of $112,000 to $118,000 in the near term. He cited cautious investor sentiment and profit-taking as key reasons for the restricted range. The build-up of leverage in futures markets also adds the risk of sharp price swings, which could magnify any sudden move in either direction. Lee also underlined that macroeconomic factors, including upcoming Federal Reserve policy decisions, may influence Bitcoin’s next direction. With structural demand and speculative trading both active, the cryptocurrency market is currently balanced between opportunities for rebound and the risk of deeper corrections. Historical context weighs on September performance Beyond technical and short-term market conditions, history also plays a role in shaping sentiment. Bitcoin has traditionally recorded slightly negative returns in September, adding to caution among traders this month. This seasonal trend, combined with structural leverage and macro uncertainty, makes the current market environment more fragile than it appears from intraday rebounds.

Specifically, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) on Binance keeps climbing despite Shiba Inu witnessing an intense downtrend along with the rest of the market. This signals that buyers now remain active behind the scenes.Shiba Inu Chaikin Money Flow Reads BullishShiba Inu has slipped nearly 13% from its weekly peak of $0.00001419. Yet the CMF suggests accumulation is taking place. For the uninitiated, the indicator tracks whether money flows into or out of an asset over a given period, often three weeks. Notably, it calculates this by checking where the day's closing price lands within the trading range and multiplying that by the day's traded volume. Positive readings above zero usually indicate steady buying, while negative values translate to selling pressure. The further the CMF moves away from zero and the longer it stays there, the stronger the market sentiment it reflects. Shiba Inu Chaikin Money Flow Flips Bullish Shiba Inu Chaikin Money Flow Flips Bullish Interestingly, on Binance's SHIBUSDT chart, the CMF has not dropped below zero since Aug. 15, even as SHIB slid with the market. In fact, since Aug. 19, the indicator has been steadily climbing while prices continued to fall, forming a bullish divergence. Such divergence often means that sellers are losing momentum and that downward movement may not hold for long.Right now, the CMF sits at 0.07 while SHIB trades at $0.00001236. The last time the CMF stood at this level, the meme coin traded higher at $0.00001406. This gap suggests SHIB is undervalued at its current price, given the strength of the ongoing money inflow.SHIB Ichimoku Cloud and DMI Suggest Downtrend is WaningMeanwhile, as SHIB trades for $0.00001238, the daily Ichimoku Cloud chart shows the bearish momentum remains active with Shiba Inu currently residing just below the cloud. Further, the cloud ahead appears thin and flat, which shows that the market lacks strong direction and that both support and resistance remain weak. The Chikou span remains under both the price action and the cloud, another bearish sign. To flip the momentum, SHIB must climb back above the cloud resistance at $0.000013.Interestingly, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) suggests the downtrend might be waning. The negative directional index (-DI) holds at 24.3, still above +DI, which shows that sellers maintain control , but it appears to have been trending downward. Shiba Inu Ichimoku Cloud and DMI Shiba Inu Ichimoku Cloud and DMI The Average Directional Index (ADX) reads 17.1, far below the 20 level that marks strong momentum. This weak ADX suggests that while sellers remain in charge, the bearish trend itself lacks power, leaving SHIB in more of a range than a sharp downtrend.Amid these metrics, some analysts see potential for a strong reversal. Market watcher Javon Marks recently pointed to Shiba Inu's ongoing inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, noting that the meme coin is still forming its final shoulder.

The forecast, published by the exchange’s research arm led by David Duong, is based on a stochastic model simulating thousands of growth paths for the stablecoin sector. To swell almost five-fold from the current market size of $270 billion, the asset class ""relies on incremental, policy-enabled adoption compounding over time,"" the report said. Stablecoin issuers such as USDC (USDC) issuer Circle (CRCL) and Tether, the firm behind USDT (USDT), typically hold large portfolios of U.S. Treasury bills to back the tokens' value. The growth to $1.2 trillion would translate into roughly $5.3 billion in new T-bill purchases every week, the report projected. Such inflows could shave 2-4 basis points off of the three-month Treasury yield over time, a small but noticeable effect in the $6 trillion money market where marginal moves can sway institutional funding costs, the analysts said. Redemption surges, on the other hand, could have an adverse effect. A $3.5 billion outflow in five days could lead to a cascade of forced selling, tightening liquidity on the T-bill market, the report noted. Coinbase analysts pointed to the recently passed stablecoin regulation, dubbed GENIUS Act, as critical to containing that risk. The law, which will come into effect in 2027 for issuers and tokens, mandates one-to-one reserves, audits and bankruptcy protections for holders. While the law doesn’t grant stablecoin issuers direct access to Federal Reserve facilities, it could reduce the likelihood of a destabilizing run, the report said.

Two Fed Members Issue Simultaneous Statements!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-fed-cut-interest-rates-in-september-two-fed-members-issue-simultaneous-statements/,"The Fed, which has been on hold since January 2025, is expected to cut interest rates in September. While the September rate cut was initially priced in at nearly 100%, it is now priced in at 81%. At this point, while waiting for the economic data to arrive before the September meeting, FED members made one hot statement after another. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, speaking at the opening of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce board meeting, stated that he expects only one more interest rate cut this year. Bostic said the current 4.25%-4.50% interest rate is marginally restrictive, not overly restrictive. Bostic stated that the economic outlook remains uncertain, but he no longer wants interest rates to remain in one direction and to oscillate between rate hikes and cuts. Finally, Bostic noted that inflation is still running well above the Fed's 2% target, adding that he maintains his expectation of a single interest rate cut, but that this forecast could change depending on the data. We Should Not Rush to Cut Interest Rates! Besides Bostic, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid also spoke. Speaking to CNBC at the annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Schmid said there should be no rush to lower interest rates. At this point, Schmid said there should be no rush to cut interest rates because inflation is still above the central bank's 2% target and the labor market is still in solid shape. At this point, Schmid expressed his doubts about lowering interest rates in September and said that there was still much work to be done on inflation. “I think we're in a really good spot and I think we need to have very definitive data to make that rate cut. “We will sit down at the table in September and reach a conclusion. But I think there's a lot to say before September. Markets are in good shape, but acting hastily could pose a risk.” Schmid said inflation is still well above the Fed's 2% target, close to 3%, and the final phase is challenging. Schmid will vote on the rate-setting committee this year. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will the Fed Cut Interest Rates in September?

Yet, as volatility heats up, savvy holders are looking for alternatives that offer real utility, not just memes. Enter a new contender that’s quietly winning over investors: a token under $0.10 that’s building infrastructure, loved by whales and getting positioned as a smarter long-term move. Dogecoin: Popularity Remains But Direction Is Shaky Dogecoin still holds cultural strength, buoyed by new tech integrations in DeFi and collective memory of past surges. Recent price logging fluctuated between $0.21 and $0.28, aided briefly by bullish whale accumulation. But volume dips and retraced gains suggest momentum may not stick. That’s part of why some holders are quietly rotating capital toward assets with real-world purpose. Some experts have however noted some positive technical signals. Ali Martinez observed that Dogecoin price currently consolidates in a triangle and is preparing for a 40% price move . Shiba Inu: Risk of Pullback as Technical Levels Fray Shiba Inu trades near $0.0000124 and struggles to hold above key support. Analysts warn failure to hold in the $0.0000123–$0.0000125 range could spark a 50% drop. That risk has traders seeking alternatives with less speculative stress and more product-based foundations. Conversely, a veteran analyst that goes by the pseudonym “Anonymous”, predicts that Shiba Inu will soar from $0.00017 to $0.00032 by Q4. Remittix (RTX): A Breath of Fresh Air in DeFi Remittix is not another meme token. Built for global PayFi utility, it enables fast, low-fee crypto transfers and offers a real product roadmap which includes a Q3 beta wallet launch, CertiK audit, and strong whale interest. Compared to DOGE and SHIB, Remittix delivers tangible value. Users engaging with payments, cross-chain transfers or seeking passive income through staking see a clear use case, not just social hype. Why Remittix is Standing Out: Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Built for borderless payments with global reach Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch On top of that, Remittix recently surpassed $20.6 million in fundraising, which has triggered its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement, unlocking liquidity and access. From Meme Mayhem to Real Utility: Why Remittix Deserves a Jockey Spot Dogecoin and Shiba Inu carry nostalgia and hype but as barriers tighten and technicals slip, holders are hedging with more meaningful tokens. If you’re looking for top crypto to buy now, low gas fee crypto project or a crypto with real utility, Remittix offers substance, execution and a roadmap. With a beta wallet launching soon, $250,000 giveaway and a recent CEX listing announcement with Bitmart, Remittix checks the boxes for both short-term opportunity and long-term infrastructure.

This crucial announcement, reported by Walter Bloomberg, sends ripples through various markets, including the volatile cryptocurrency space. Investors are now recalibrating their expectations for monetary policy, understanding that the current economic data does not support an immediate easing. This development directly impacts how individuals and institutions view future investment opportunities. What’s Driving the ‘No Fed Rate Cut’ Stance? President Hammack’s statement clearly emphasizes a data-dependent approach. She believes current economic indicators do not justify a Fed rate cut in the near term. This perspective aligns with a cautious stance from the Federal Reserve, which prioritizes stable inflation and a robust job market. Therefore, the Fed is carefully observing economic trends. The Fed’s primary goal remains to bring inflation down to its 2% target. While significant progress has occurred in recent months, officials like Hammack suggest more conclusive evidence is needed to confirm a sustainable downward trend. They want to ensure inflation is firmly under control before considering any adjustments to the benchmark interest rate. This careful observation period, consequently, means patience is key for policymakers. Furthermore, strong employment figures continue to give the Fed room to maintain its current stance without immediately worrying about a recession. How Does No Fed Rate Cut Impact Cryptocurrency? When interest rates remain high, it often creates a less favorable environment for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Investors might prefer the relative safety and guaranteed returns of traditional investments, such as bonds or savings accounts, which offer higher yields. This dynamic can, therefore, divert capital away from digital assets, impacting their demand and price. Historically, periods of quantitative tightening or higher interest rates have sometimes led to increased volatility in the crypto market. Without a Fed rate cut , the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers stays elevated. This can slow economic growth, which in turn might reduce speculative investment in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, a stronger U.S. dollar, often a consequence of higher rates, can also put pressure on crypto prices. Reduced Liquidity: Higher rates can tighten overall market liquidity, making it harder for large capital inflows into crypto. Increased Volatility: Markets react sharply to monetary policy signals, leading to unpredictable price swings. Shift to Safer Assets: Investors may seek less risky alternatives, such as government bonds, offering attractive yields. Broader Economic Implications of No Immediate Fed Rate Cut The decision to hold rates steady reflects the Fed’s ongoing battle against inflation. By maintaining higher borrowing costs, the central bank aims to cool down economic activity and curb persistent price increases. This impacts everything from mortgage rates to business loans, significantly influencing consumer spending and investment decisions across the board. Consequently, economic growth may experience a slower pace. Businesses face higher costs for capital, potentially slowing expansion plans and hiring. Consumers experience higher interest on credit cards and loans, affecting their purchasing power. However, this strategy is a deliberate effort to achieve long-term economic stability. A premature Fed rate cut could risk reigniting inflationary pressures, undoing previous progress and creating a more challenging economic scenario down the line. The Fed is treading carefully to avoid such a setback. Navigating the Market: Insights Amidst No Fed Rate Cut For investors, understanding the Fed’s stance is paramount. This period of sustained interest rates calls for strategic planning. It is crucial to remain informed about economic data releases and central bank communications. Diversifying portfolios and focusing on long-term value can help mitigate short-term market fluctuations, especially in the crypto sector. Many analysts suggest that market participants should adjust their strategies, focusing on assets with strong fundamentals and clear utility. Even without an immediate Fed rate cut , the market will eventually price in future possibilities, so a forward-looking perspective is vital. Patience and a well-researched approach are more important than ever to navigate these uncertain waters effectively. Stay Informed: Monitor economic reports and Fed statements closely to anticipate policy shifts. Diversify: Spread investments across different asset classes to reduce risk exposure. Long-Term View: Focus on fundamental value rather than reacting to daily market swings. Risk Management: Assess and manage your exposure to volatile assets, including cryptocurrencies. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack’s clear message about no September Fed rate cut reinforces the central bank’s unwavering commitment to its inflation targets. While this might temper expectations for immediate monetary easing, it underscores a deliberate, data-driven approach to economic stability. Investors, particularly in the crypto space, must remain agile and informed, adapting their strategies to the evolving landscape shaped by the Federal Reserve’s focus on long-term economic health. The path forward demands vigilance and strategic foresight. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does “no Fed rate cut in September” mean for the economy? It means the Federal Reserve will likely maintain current interest rates, keeping borrowing costs higher to continue fighting inflation. This can lead to slower economic growth but aims for long-term price stability. 2. How do higher interest rates affect cryptocurrency prices? Higher interest rates typically make traditional, less risky investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. This can lead to increased volatility or downward pressure on crypto prices. 3. Who is Beth Hammack and why is her statement important? Beth Hammack is the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Her statements are significant because she is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy, and her views provide insight into the Fed’s collective thinking. 4. What economic data is the Fed watching for a potential Fed rate cut? The Fed closely monitors inflation indicators (like CPI and PCE), employment data (job growth, unemployment rate), and broader economic growth metrics (GDP). They seek sustained evidence that inflation is moving towards their 2% target. 5. Should I adjust my investment strategy based on this news? While this news provides important context, investment decisions should always align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Many experts recommend staying diversified and focusing on long-term investment strategies rather than reacting to short-term market news. Did you find this analysis helpful?

A report from local media house Yonhap, which cited unnamed industry officials, claims two separate meetings have been scheduled between the stablecoin giants and members of South Korea’s “Big Four” financial groups — Shinhan, Hana, KB, and Woori. Tether and Circle enter South Korea’s banking big league Among those attending is Shinhan Financial Group CEO Jin Ok-dong, one of the country’s most influential banking figures. His involvement alone signals just how seriously the South Korean banking establishment is now treating stablecoins. Circle President Heath Tarbert is expected to hold talks on Friday with both Jin Ok-dong of Shinhan and Hana Financial Group CEO Ham Young-joo. Ham is also reportedly scheduled to meet separately with a Tether representative later the same day. Among other high-profile names, KB Financial Group’s Chief Digital & IT Officer Lee Chang-kwon and Woori Bank President Jeong Jin-wan are also reportedly planning to meet with Tarbert. The exact timing hasn’t been made public, but the involvement of all four banks, each recognized as systemically important by South Korea’s top financial regulator, gives the effort added heft. Little is known about what’s on the agenda, but Yonhap said the meeting is expected to cover potential partnerships around issuing Korean won-backed stablecoins and setting up local distribution channels for US dollar-pegged tokens such as USDT and USDC. If successful, these conversations could pave the way for South Korea’s largest banks to play a more active role in the growing global stablecoin market, whether through custody services, issuance models, or cross-border payment rails. Seoul’s growing interest in stablecoins South Korea has ramped up efforts to formalise its domestic stablecoin strategy over the past year. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has already confirmed it was preparing a dedicated regulatory framework for won-pegged stablecoins. The proposal is expected to be revealed in October as part of the second phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act. The legislation will define guardrails for issuance, collateral backing, and internal controls — areas that remain loosely regulated under current crypto laws. Park Min-gyu, a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Party, told local reporters during a press briefing last week that he was briefed on the stablecoin proposal and expects the FSC to submit it to the National Assembly within a few months. President Lee Jae-myung’s administration has been one of the driving forces behind this stablecoin push. Since taking office, the pro-crypto leader has pushed for digital innovation in finance, repeatedly endorsing a stablecoin tied to the national currency. During his campaign, Lee called for building a sovereign stablecoin market to preserve South Korea’s monetary influence as dollar-pegged tokens continue to dominate crypto trading volumes at home. Competing visions and concerns But not everyone in the country’s financial ecosystem agrees on the best way forward. Among the biggest opposers, the Bank of Korea has voiced concern that private-sector stablecoins, even if won-backed, could create more demand for dollar-denominated tokens. Governor Rhee Chang-yong warned that such a shift might complicate foreign exchange management and threaten capital controls, particularly if local stablecoins become a bridge to USDT or USDC. The central bank governor has also raised doubts about allowing private companies to issue stablecoins, arguing that such a move could undermine the central bank’s ability to manage monetary policy. Rhee hasn’t outright rejected stablecoins, but he did stress the need for a well-structured framework to prevent unexpected consequences for the broader economy. Still, momentum seems to favor regulatory openness. In July, shares of several major banks spiked after trademark filings related to stablecoin development became public. Meanwhile, South Korea-based entertainment platform fanC partnered with software firm Initech to launch KRWIN, the country’s first pilot stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the won. Though still in limited internal testing, the move was largely viewed as a significant milestone in the private sector’s push to get ahead of the regulatory curve. Tether and Circle expand their global playbook As for the stablecoin issuers themselves, this isn’t a sudden pivot to Asia. Both Tether and Circle have been steadily building diplomatic and institutional relationships around the globe. In recent months, Tether has signed agreements with the governments of Uzbekistan and Guinea to explore blockchain payments, and in January, it announced a strategic relocation to El Salvador. CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has also met with U.S. lawmakers to help shape stablecoin legislation, including efforts linked to the proposed GENIUS Act. Circle, meanwhile, has leaned into regulatory diplomacy, with Tarbert appearing at high-level U.S. government forums such as the CFTC CEO roundtable in Washington, D.C. Like Tether, Circle sees institutional banking partnerships as essential for scaling USDC globally, and South Korea, with its active crypto community and fast-moving regulatory environment, appears to be next on its list.

The signal is triggered whenever the market touches a yellow upward trendline that has historically marked the beginning of major rallies.This observation comes at a time of subdued sentiment in the crypto market, with growing fears of a bear phase that could see Bitcoin dip below the $100K level. Bitcoin is currently holding at $113,300, down 0.15% over the past day, while its weekly chart shows a 4.71% loss.Meanwhile, bitcoindata21 is offering hope for another round of green trading days based on technical analysis.Historical PrecedentThe accompanying chart shows multiple past instances when Bitcoin tagged this trendline, each followed by decisive upward momentum. Specifically, from early 2017 to 2021, and again in 2023, every contact with the line preceded meaningful gains. The analyst emphasized that the signal “has never failed so far.”In the current setup, Bitcoin is trading around $113,000, while the chart suggests the next touch of the trendline is imminent. The analyst is confident that history will repeat and that the event will serve as the trigger for the next leg higher. bitcoindata21's Bitcoin chart What to Expect from BitcoinCommenting on bitcoindata21’s post, one X user remarked that the comeback could see Bitcoin hit $145,000.Notably, other market watchers are also using technical indicators to call for a rebound. At the same time, some believe there is still a risk of a significant dip.For instance, analyst CasiTrades has warned of a likely drop to $88K if Bitcoin bulls fail to maintain a price above the $122,000 level.CasiTrades, a technical analyst with over a decade of experience, believes Bitcoin completed Wave 1 of a corrective pattern at $112,500 and is now in a Wave 2 rebound. This bounce could push BTC toward the $119,900–$121,900 range, but failure to break higher may trigger a steep Wave 3 decline. However, if Bitcoin surpasses its $124,500 high, the bearish outlook would be invalidated.Meanwhile, Michael XBT, another veteran market watcher, believes calling for a major dump at this stage is premature.https://twitter.com/MichaelXBT/status/1958202430018953266""Road to $1M BTC Remains Intact""Regardless of Bitcoin’s short-term patterns, there is almost a consensus regarding its long-term uptrend.

The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $7.35 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the world’s prediction. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

Accumulation near $0.91 signals positioning for a breakout above $0.9645. Short-term momentum favors bulls, but failure at resistance risks a $0.91 retest. On August 21st, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) traded at $0.9079, marking a 0.22% daily uptrend. The token has been navigating within a narrow range as traders weigh technical signals and market positioning. Current data identifies resistance at $0.9645 and support at $0.9079, with price action consolidating between these levels. Worldcoin daily price chart: WLD holds above $0.93 as bulls eye $0.9645 resistance The 1-Day chart reveals WLD attempting to stabilize above $0.93 after early downward pressure. The initial dip toward $0.9079 confirmed the presence of strong support, with buyers quickly absorbing selling pressure at this level. From there, price momentum carried the token higher toward $0.95, where it met resistance but maintained a series of higher lows. This upward structure highlights a growing bullish presence, though resistance at $0.9645 remains the main barrier before further advances can materialize. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Trading volume on the daily timeframe indicates that accumulation is active, particularly during pullbacks to the $0.91 region. This pattern suggests traders are positioning ahead of a potential breakout. If WLD breaches $0.9645 with conviction, bullish momentum could extend toward higher retracement targets. Conversely, if it fails to clear resistance, price action may rotate back toward the $0.9079 support, which remains the critical defense line for bulls. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD defends $0.93 support as buyers target $0.9645 The 4-Hour timeframe shows consistent buying activity just above the $0.93 handle. Multiple rejections of dips highlight that traders are actively defending this zone, reinforcing it as a strong near-term support level. The current structure points toward renewed attempts to retest $0.96, with momentum leaning slightly in favor of buyers. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView However, sellers remain active near resistance, capping gains at higher levels. A decisive close above $0.9645 on this timeframe would strengthen the bullish outlook and signal further continuation to the upside. On the other hand, repeated failures could drag the token back toward $0.91, where another test of support could reshape short-term sentiment. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.880901 BUY SMA 5 $0.94724 SELL SMA 10 $1.035388 SELL SMA 21 $1.112588 SELL SMA 50 $1.013944 SELL SMA 100 $1.10097 SELL SMA 20 $1.27281 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.057438 SELL EMA 5 $1.048003 SELL EMA 10 $1.016681 SELL EMA 21 $0.960841 SELL EMA 50 $0.998505 SELL EMA 100 $1.242968 SELL EMA 200 $1.670996 SELL What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? Worldcoin’s immediate future hinges on the $0.9645 resistance. A decisive break above this level could unlock room for stronger upward movement as buyers gain confidence and momentum shifts in their favor. Sustained accumulation near $0.91 suggests market participants are preparing for such a scenario. On the flip side, failure to clear resistance may see WLD revisit $0.91 support, where buyers will once again be tested. The coin’s short-term trajectory remains tied to whether bulls can overpower sellers at the upper boundary or if consolidation persists within the current range. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin’s current structure shows that it is trading within a well-defined range, with clear support at $0.9079 and resistance at $0.9645. This setup provides traders with transparent levels to monitor, offering both short-term trading opportunities and risk management clarity. The consistent defense of $0.93 highlights buying interest, while accumulation near $0.91 points to growing positioning ahead of potential volatility. However, the token’s longer-term outlook depends on more than technical levels. WLD remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and liquidity conditions. While bulls are preparing for a possible breakout above resistance, the inability to secure sustained closes beyond $0.9645 would keep the asset locked in consolidation, limiting upside potential. Investors should weigh these dynamics carefully, as the coin continues to attract speculative interest rather than strong fundamental momentum. Why is the WLD Price up today Worldcoin’s modest 0.22% price increase today is primarily driven by steady accumulation around the $0.91–$0.93 range. Buyers have consistently stepped in to defend support, creating upward pressure and preventing deeper declines. This defense has strengthened short-term sentiment, giving bulls confidence to test higher levels within the trading band. At the same time, market participants are positioning ahead of the $0.9645 resistance, anticipating a potential breakout. The combination of firm support at $0.9079, active accumulation, and cautious optimism among traders explains why WLD has edged higher, even within a narrow consolidation phase. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2030. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success. Worldcoin price prediction August 2025 Worldcoin is expected to exhibit a range of price movements in August 2025. The potential low is $0.84, while the average price might be around $0.98. On the higher end, WLD could reach up to $1.47.

Recently, a colossal move by a long-term holder has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, highlighting evolving investment strategies among the biggest players. Understanding the Whale BTC to ETH Shift According to insights from on-chain analyst EmberCN on X, a significant entity, holding a staggering 10,606 BTC for seven years, has initiated a notable reallocation.

This strategic divestment resulted in a substantial profit of $1.12 billion, underscoring the immense gains possible from long-term Bitcoin holdings. The proceeds from this Bitcoin sale were not left idle. Instead, the whale immediately deployed a significant portion into Ethereum. Specifically, they acquired 30,367 ETH in spot markets, amounting to roughly $131 million. Furthermore, demonstrating a strong conviction in Ethereum’s future, the whale opened a substantial long futures position of 78,000 ETH, valued at an impressive $336 million. Why Did This Whale Make a BTC to ETH Shift? Such a pronounced Whale BTC to ETH Shift invites questions about the underlying motivations.

Potential for Higher Growth: Some investors might perceive Ethereum as having greater upside potential compared to Bitcoin, especially after Bitcoin’s recent rallies. Diversification Strategy: Even whales seek to diversify. Shifting a portion of a long-held Bitcoin stash into Ethereum could be a way to balance risk and capture growth across different leading cryptocurrencies. This strategic maneuver leaves the whale with 8,437 BTC, valued at around $960 million. The analyst suggests that this Whale BTC to ETH Shift might be an ongoing process, indicating a broader trend among large holders. What Does This Whale BTC to ETH Shift Mean for the Market? When a whale makes such a decisive Whale BTC to ETH Shift , it can influence market sentiment and potentially signal a shift in institutional or large-investor interest.

News Background • XRP’s rally comes amid broader crypto stabilization, with altcoins tracking modest inflows after last week’s drawdown. • On-chain data flagged institutional-sized flows, with nearly 155 million in XRP turnover during recovery periods, far above the 63 million daily average. • Market chatter initially suggested XRP was hitting new highs, though the actual all-time peak remains $3.84 from January 2018 — underscoring that this is a recovery test, not price discovery. Price Action Summary • XRP swung 5.1% between $2.84 and $2.99 in the 23-hour window from Aug. 20 13:00 to Aug. 21 12:00. • The strongest push came around 19:00 UTC on Aug. 20, when the token surged from $2.84 to $2.99 on 80.6 million volume. • Subsequent sessions showed consolidation, with repeated bounces in the $2.89–$2.93 range, confirming it as interim support. • A sharp whipsaw in the final hour (Aug. 21 11:03–12:02) saw an 8.6% swing: from $2.916 to $2.901 on 960,000 units, before stabilizing. Technical Analysis • Support : $2.89–$2.93 zone shows multiple strong bounces on above-average participation. • Resistance : $2.99–$3.00 psychological ceiling caps momentum; repeated rejections visible. • Volume : 80.65 million during the rally vs. a 24-hour baseline of ~63 million. • Pattern : Sideways consolidation following bullish impulse; momentum tilting slightly downward. What Traders Are Watching • Whether $2.93 support holds in the short term or gives way to a retest of $2.82. • Break above $3.00 as a potential trigger for trend continuation. • Volume sustainability — if flows taper, bulls risk losing control.",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-21 15:56:46

The current data does not make the case for a September ease, said Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, speaking with Yahoo News in Wyoming. ""We have inflation that’s too high and has been trending upwards over the past year,"" she said. ""If the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates."" She further argued that inflation numbers are only beginning to show the impact of tariffs and that the full effect wouldn't be seen until next year. Hammack's comments are notable, showing Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to have plenty of support in his hawkish stance despite two dissident dovish votes at the last central bank policy meeting and President Trump's continuing campaign for lower rates. Her remarks also come after a series of potential Powell replacements appeared on the airwaves in recent days to argue for sharply lower interest rates. The latest this morning was former St. Louis Fed boss Jim Bullard, who argued for policy rates 100 basis points below the current level. Just one week ago, bitcoin touched a record high above $124,000 alongside a nearly 100% expectation that the Fed would trim rates next month. Seven days later, those odds have slipped back to 71%, according to CME FedWatch and bitcoin (BTC) has plunged nearly 10% to the current $112,800. Markets will get to hear from Powell himself at his keynote address on Friday morning and at this point it's nearly certain he'll not turn dove. Instead, he's likely to emphasize that inflation continues to remain too hot and thus the need to take a wait and see approach towards adjusting monetary policy.",Markets|Federal Reserve|Interest Rates|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-21 15:57:34

(Polymath), the tokenization blockchain infrastructure company for private markets, has announced a series of strategic partnerships with global tokenization and digital assets organizations. These collaborations strengthen Polymath’s global reach and advance the organization’s goal of increasing the adoption of tokenization across traditional markets. From European capital markets and community-focused tokenization projects in the U.S., Polymath is establishing a robust infrastructure for market tokenization. The announced partnerships are: Black Manta Capital Partners , a pioneer in the regulated tokenization of assets, will license Polymath’s white-label Capital Platform to deliver tokenization and asset management services across Europe, adding deal flow and regulatory expertise to Polymath’s network. Real estate investment firm, Patina Capital , is pioneering community-focused real estate tokenization with its $375M Westinghouse development in Cleveland, Ohio, enabling local residents to invest in large-scale regeneration projects through the licensing of Polymath’s white label Capital Platform. CycleX , the digital asset infrastructure firm, will combine its end-to-end fund management expertise with Polymath’s purpose-built security token blockchain to streamline tokenization of real-world assets, enhancing issuance and lifecycle management for a wide range of asset classes. These announcements follow additional collaborations with Polymesh, including partnerships with Ocree Capital, REtoken, Republic, AlphaPoint, and Paysafe, as well as Wallet Tech integrations with Dfns and GK8 by Galaxy. REtokens USA Inc. has successfully tokenized approximately $66 million in real estate offerings on Polymesh, with an additional $34 million in contracted projects currently underway. In total, this represents $100 million in tokenized real estate offerings, showcasing how Polymesh provides the secure, transparent, and purpose-built infrastructure that makes large-scale real estate tokenization possible. ""Traditional financial institutions don’t have faith that tokenization is secure and reliable,” said Vince Kadar, CEO of Polymath. ""That’s why we’re establishing these partnerships. By building an ecosystem of trust and reliability, we can enable traditional institutions to have faith in tokenization. From sophisticated institutional collaborations in Europe to community projects in the American Midwest, we’re proving that tokenization can create inclusive pathways to wealth creation while maintaining the highest standards of regulatory compliance."" The announcement comes as Polymath nears completion of its current funding round, expected to close on September 4, 2025, ahead of its previously announced anticipated public listing by way of a reverse takeover transaction with AnalytixInsight Inc ., indicating its market traction and the scalability of its technology across diverse asset classes and jurisdictions.

Even though it began as a tech asset, BTC has gained significant mainstream attention, with prominent figures, large corporations, and even countries engaging the crypto king. BTC’s foray into the financial landscape was so monumental that Peter Thiel claims it broke the mold of society’s understanding. Bitcoin Is Beyond Society’s Ability To Process Bitcoin has experienced exponential growth since its inception, with many analysts calling it the biggest macro trade over the last 10 years. While it is believed that the Bitcoin story is still far from reaching its climax, Peter Thiel, a well-known billionaire and PayPal founder, has once again underscored the revolutionary power of the flagship cryptocurrency. Trending Bitcoin on the social media platform X shared an interview where the billionaire evaluated the monumental introduction of BTC and its significance. In the interview, Thiel described BTC as an invention so massive that society has found it difficult to understand or process its implications. The PayPal founder’s audacious statement suggests that the scale and transformative nature of Bitcoin go far beyond conventional banking, signifying a paradigm shift in the definition of freedom , trust, and value in the digital era. BTC, in Thiel’s opinion, is likened to a Tax Stagnation, where the society finds it difficult to comprehend its implications. “I think Bitcoin was a big invention, and whether good or bad, it was a pretty big deal,” the founder added. His remarks emphasize not only Bitcoin’s function as an alternative asset but also its status as a social phenomenon that is upending established structures and changing the way people talk about money around the world. According to the founder, BTC was systematically underestimated for at least the first 10 to 11 years and was available for trade within the time frame. Furthermore, the asset experienced a smooth upward move in the same time frame and did not get repriced all at once. Given that Bitcoin’s inception was monumental in a world where nothing big ever happens, Thiel stated that society had no way of processing it. He further drew a comparison to the historical launch of the Internet in 1989. While it was launched in 1989, the project gained significant global adoption only in 1999. After analyzing BTC’s impact in the financial sector today, Thiel claims that the crypto king is witnessing the same explosive growth and recognition as the Internet in 1999. A $200 Trillion Market Cap For BTC Big investors and large firms continue to double down on Bitcoin. Amid this wave of institutional adoption, Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy , has outlined the potential for BTC’s market cap to skyrocket. During a presentation , Saylor predicted that the BTC market cap could rise from a $2 trillion value to $200 trillion, representing a 100x growth. Although at this audacious market value, BTC will still be lower than equity, real estate, and bonds, the chairman claims it will remain noticeable. Saylor has declared that Bitcoin is the emerging global asset and digital gold , which is probably 100 times better than Gold.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|digital gold|gold|Internet|michael saylor|PayPal|peter thiel|Strategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 16:00:01
50447696,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=192198,1755792012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50447696.jpeg,Fed Governor Lisa Cook Under Fire: DOJ Official Urges Powell to Act,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-governor-lisa-cook/,"BitcoinWorld Fed Governor Lisa Cook Under Fire: DOJ Official Urges Powell to Act In a development that has captured significant attention, a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) official has reportedly urged Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook . This isn’t the first time Governor Cook has faced scrutiny. The call comes amidst a backdrop of previous allegations and demands from the Trump administration. Why is Fed Governor Lisa Cook Facing This Demand? The recent demand for the dismissal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook stems from a report by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X. This report highlights that the Trump administration had previously called upon the DOJ to investigate alleged mortgage fraud involving Governor Cook. Furthermore, former President Trump had also publicly called for her resignation. These are serious accusations that bring the conduct of a high-ranking financial official into question. The Federal Reserve, as a pillar of economic stability, operates under intense public and governmental oversight. The Allegations Against Fed Governor Lisa Cook While specific details of the alleged mortgage fraud are not widely publicized in this particular report, the repeated calls for investigation and resignation suggest a persistent concern. Such allegations, regardless of their veracity, can cast a shadow over an official’s credibility and the institution they represent. The Trump administration initially sought a DOJ investigation into alleged mortgage fraud. Former President Trump explicitly called for Governor Cook’s resignation. The latest report indicates a current DOJ official is urging her dismissal by Chairman Powell. What Does This Mean for the Federal Reserve? The Federal Reserve operates with a significant degree of independence to ensure its monetary policy decisions are not swayed by political pressures. However, calls for the dismissal of a high-profile figure like Fed Governor Lisa Cook from within the government can create significant internal and external challenges. Chairman Powell now faces a delicate situation. He must balance the need for accountability with the imperative to protect the Fed’s autonomy and stability. Any decision regarding Governor Cook’s tenure would be closely watched by financial markets and the public alike. The Role of a Fed Governor A Federal Reserve Governor plays a crucial role in shaping the nation’s monetary policy. They participate in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates and guides the economy. Their decisions impact everything from inflation and employment to borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Therefore, questions about the integrity or conduct of a Fed Governor Lisa Cook are not merely political squabbles; they touch upon the very foundations of economic governance. What Happens Next for Fed Governor Lisa Cook? The immediate future regarding Fed Governor Lisa Cook remains uncertain. Chairman Powell’s response to this urgent call will be pivotal. He could choose to: Defend Governor Cook, citing a lack of substantiated evidence or the Fed’s independence. Initiate an internal review or cooperate with any ongoing external investigations. Take disciplinary action, including dismissal, if warranted by evidence. The situation highlights the complex interplay between government oversight, political demands, and the independent functioning of crucial financial institutions. Summary: A Critical Juncture for the Fed The renewed call from a U.S. DOJ official for Chairman Jerome Powell to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook injects a significant element of controversy into the Federal Reserve’s operations. Building on past allegations from the Trump administration, this situation underscores the intense scrutiny faced by top financial officials. The outcome will not only determine Governor Cook’s future but also test the Fed’s independence and its leadership’s ability to navigate high-stakes political pressure while maintaining public trust. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Fed Governor Lisa Cook? A1: Lisa Cook is a current member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, appointed to a 14-year term. She plays a key role in setting U.S. monetary policy. Q2: What are the allegations against Fed Governor Lisa Cook? A2: The allegations primarily involve claims of mortgage fraud, which were first raised by the Trump administration. The recent report indicates a DOJ official is urging her dismissal based on these past concerns. Q3: Can the DOJ force Jerome Powell to fire a Fed Governor? A3: No, the DOJ cannot directly force the Federal Reserve Chairman to fire a Governor. However, a DOJ investigation or official recommendation would put significant pressure on Chairman Powell to address the concerns. Q4: What is the role of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors? A4: The Board of Governors oversees the Federal Reserve System, guides monetary policy, supervises banks, and maintains financial stability. Governors participate in the FOMC, which makes decisions on interest rates and other monetary tools. Q5: How does this situation impact the Federal Reserve’s independence? A5: Such calls for dismissal, especially from government officials, can challenge the perception of the Fed’s independence. Chairman Powell’s handling of the situation will be crucial in demonstrating the Fed’s ability to make decisions free from undue political influence. Did you find this article insightful?

50447697,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79514,1755792015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"BlockDAG Raises $379M With 2.5M Miners Already Active, Surpassing NEAR Protocol Price Rally & TRUMP Coin ETF Buzz",https://timestabloid.com/blockdag-raises-379m-with-2-5m-miners-already-active/,"The crypto market is alive with three major storylines, NEAR Protocol’s push toward the $3 milestone, growing ETF speculation around TRUMP Coin, and the unstoppable momentum of BlockDAG’s presale. NEAR posted one of its strongest weeks in months, supported by institutional inflows and an increase in active users. At the same time, TRUMP Coin attracted fresh attention after Canary Capital registered a statutory trust in Delaware, seen as an early step toward a potential U.S. ETF. Among these narratives, BlockDAG (BDAG) has taken the spotlight as the clear heavyweight. Now in Batch 29 and priced at $0.0276, it has already raised more than $379 million while engaging 2.5 million miners through its Proof-of-Engagement model. With Dashboard V4 simulating a live trading environment and Buyer Battles gamifying participation, BlockDAG’s presale offers more than speculation, it is establishing a functioning ecosystem. This progress, built on infrastructure and active involvement, positions it as a standout in a market often led by short-term catalysts. NEAR Protocol Price Rally Pushes Toward $3.00 Resistance Between August 12 and 13, NEAR Protocol advanced 5.82% from $2.75 to $2.91, supported by $7.6 million in institutional inflows and trading volumes that doubled the daily average. The surge cleared several resistance levels, with firm support forming at $2.76 before the price tested $2.94. That resistance triggered a 396,000-volume selloff, pulling NEAR to $2.88 before stabilizing in the $2.90–$2.91 range. This move came during a week where global crypto investment products recorded $572 million in inflows. NEAR’s weekly active users rose 18.4% to 16 million, surpassing Solana’s 14.8 million. Growth has also been fueled by Aurora Labs partnerships, stronger developer participation, and rising demand for Layer-1 platforms. On the charts, NEAR is forming higher lows, preserving bullish momentum, and leaving the $3.00 psychological target within reach if volume continues to support it. TRUMP Coin ETF Buzz Reignites Meme Coin Speculation TRUMP Coin jumped more than 10% to $10.13 after Canary Capital registered the Canary Trump Coin ETF trust in Delaware. Filed under the Securities Act of 1933, the structure is similar to single-asset crypto ETFs designed to directly hold the coin. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted this could become the first Trump Coin ETF under the ’33 Act, in contrast with Tuttle Capital’s ’40 Act filings for Trump and Melania-themed ETFs. While registration is an important step, it only signals the beginning. The critical next stage is a formal S-1 filing with the SEC, which could take months and face challenges due to TRUMP’s volatility and its memecoin status. Currently valued at $1.9 billion, TRUMP ranks sixth among memecoins. Even with the recent price boost, it is still 86% below its January peak of $73.43, a level reached during its launch frenzy. BlockDAG’s $379M Presale Redefines Early-Stage Crypto Models BlockDAG is reshaping presale fundraising, advancing strongly in Batch 29 at $0.0276 with more than $379 million already raised and an expected launch price of $0.05. This is not a simple coin sale; it is an ecosystem that creates value before any exchange listing. Its foundation is the X1 mobile miner network, now boasting 2.5 million users earning BDAG coins through a Proof-of-Engagement model without the need for expensive hardware. This establishes utility and adoption before launch, a rare accomplishment in presales. The second core element is Dashboard V4, an advanced interface designed to reflect live exchange conditions. Features include real-time price charts, order book visuals, wallet tracking, leaderboards, and referral insights. This interactive setup enhances transparency and keeps participation consistent. The third driver is Buyer Battles, a daily competition that rewards the largest participant with unsold BDAG allocations. This competitive twist encourages repeat activity, adds excitement, and builds daily engagement. Together, these elements lift BlockDAG beyond traditional fundraising efforts. By combining adoption, transparency, and gamification, it has created momentum that extends beyond market hype or fleeting speculation, positioning it as a long-term force. Summing Up While NEAR’s climb toward $3 and TRUMP Coin’s ETF speculation captured short-term excitement, both rely heavily on momentum that may fade. BlockDAG’s presale strength, in contrast, is anchored in measurable fundamentals, infrastructure, and a global community of active participants. At $0.0276, still below its $0.05 target, BlockDAG’s upside remains clear. With 2.5 million miners, an advanced dashboard, and gamified participation driving engagement, its path toward launch is aggressive yet sustainable. In a market where narratives shift quickly, projects that combine strong capital inflows with ongoing user activity often prove most resilient. BlockDAG’s continued progress reflects that formula, keeping it at the center of the conversation as its launch approaches.

A recent update from Crypto Update IO reveals that whales have snapped up 100 million ADA in a single day, lifting their holdings to 18.65 billion ADA. Such aggressive accumulation may be hinting at a major turning point for the market. Price Action And Technical Indicators In his analysis, Crypto Update IO pointed out that Cardano’s price has been fluctuating between $0.86 and $0.88 over the past day. Strategic accumulation during this dip suggests that larger investors are positioning themselves for potential future gains, providing a cushion against broader market corrections. Historically, such whale activity has often signaled renewed interest in Cardano. Related Reading: Cardano Defies Market Dip With 20% Weekly Surge: Analysts Eye $10 Target Ahead At present, ADA is trading at $0.88, reflecting a 3% rise within the last 24 hours. This short-term uptick comes despite a 10% decline over the past week, showing that the asset is attempting to stabilize after recent downward pressure. According to Crypto Update IO, Javon Marks highlighted that Cardano’s current market structure appears to be mirroring previous cycles. These patterns could set the stage for an extraordinary surge, with ADA potentially rallying as much as 740% toward the $8 mark if history repeats itself. Such a setup suggests that Cardano may be entering a crucial accumulation phase before significant rallies. Cardano Derivatives Market And Institutional Interest Crypto Update IO went on to explain that Cardano’s derivatives market is showing a blend of caution and growing optimism. Despite a 4% drop in open interest and an 18% decline in trading volume, certain underlying metrics are starting to turn more favorable. The encouraging signal comes from the funding rate, which has flipped positive at 0.0072%. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Turns Upward — Signs of a Recovery Emerge A positive funding rate typically indicates that traders are paying a premium to hold long positions over shorts. This dynamic reflects an increasing appetite for bullish exposure, pointing to renewed confidence in Cardano’s near-term trajectory, as sentiment leans toward a price recovery. With long positions beginning to outweigh shorts, the market is signaling that traders are preparing for potential rallies, positioning themselves early before a larger move materializes. This behavior often precedes significant breakouts in the crypto market. Adding to the narrative, Crypto Update IO highlighted that on August 14, ADA futures volume surged to an impressive $7 billion. A spike in futures volume underscores the growing attention Cardano continues to attract from both retail traders and institutions. Combined, these developments suggest that ADA remains firmly on the radar, with derivatives markets quietly building a foundation for what could become its next major rally.

According to a blog post , Chainlink is now the first platform to earn ISO 27001 certification and SOC 2 Type 1 attestation. Chainlink’s New Achievements Come With a Lot of Benefits This assessment focuses on Chainlink’s data feeds, particularly Price Feeds and SmartData, as well as the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). These services are essential for smart contracts to access real-world data and communicate securely across different blockchain networks. Deloitte & Touche LLP, a well-known independent accounting firm, conducted the audits in alliance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards. Notably, the ISO 27001 standard verifies that Chainlink has Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its services. Meanwhile, the SOC 2 Type 1 attestation reveals that Chainlink has the right controls to protect customer data, focusing on security as defined by the AICPA Trust Services Criteria. It is also worth noting that Chainlink’s achievements set a new standard for decentralized Oracle platforms. By acquiring ISO 27001 certification and SOC 2 Type 1 attestation, Chainlink boosts its credibility with developers and business partners. This, in return, strengthens its status as the most secure and reliable Oracle solution in Web3. USD1 Works Across Blockchains With Chainlink’s Help Recall that World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has partnered with Chainlink and its CCIP to unlock new possibilities for its fast-growing stablecoin, USD1. Before now, USD1 worked only on the Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain blockchain networks. However, with Chainlink’s CCIP, USD1 can move safely between these blockchains. This means more users and developers can now use the stablecoin without being limited to one blockchain. Cross-chain transfers are seen as risky because many bridges lack strong security. Reports show that over $3 billion has been stolen through unsafe bridges recently. However, Chainlink’s CCIP aims to solve this problem. The platform is designed to help users move assets safely and with more trust. Chainlink Could Boost WLFI USD1 Market Value Undoubtedly, Chainlink is known for providing safe and reliable services in the crypto industry. Many projects use their tools for price data and security. Now, WLFI, backed by DWF Labs , is using Chainlink’s CCIP to strengthen and secure USD1. This will help the stablecoin reach more users and attract big investors.

KINGVALEX references a financial news clip in which a commentator argues that XRP is primed for a massive rally because it has yet to experience its “DeFi moment” like Ethereum, which propelled its price to around $4,000. Coupled with years of regulatory suppression tied to the SEC lawsuit, XRP’s future, some say, remains one of unfulfilled potential. XRP’s Current Market Position As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.90 with a market capitalization of $171.5 billion. Earlier in August, XRP briefly touched highs of $3.32 before correcting, a sign of growing but cautious momentum. The asset continues to rank among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, supported by strong liquidity and sustained global interest. $XRP yes by 2030 will go to $1,000 dollars simply because it hasn’t had its DEFI moment yet! The way ETH did and is at 4k. All because XRP had YEARS of COURT. pic.twitter.com/1dRN9K6NAy — KINGVALEX (@VALELORDX) August 20, 2025 Ripple vs. SEC: A New Chapter The most decisive turning point for XRP came with the resolution of its long-running battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier in the month, Ripple and the SEC agreed to dismiss their respective appeals , finally bringing closure to a case that had overshadowed XRP for nearly five years. Ripple accepted a $125 million penalty and limited restrictions on institutional sales, but the key ruling—that XRP is not a security in secondary trading—remains intact. This settlement removed one of the largest clouds hanging over the token and restored confidence among investors and institutions alike. The DeFi Opportunity Ahead Ethereum’s explosive rise to $4,000 was largely fueled by its dominance in decentralized finance, where lending, borrowing, and trading applications thrive without intermediaries. By contrast, XRP has historically concentrated on payments, liquidity, and cross-border settlement. KINGVALEX points out that XRP has yet to experience its DeFi breakthrough. With Ripple’s XRPL ecosystem expanding through tokenization projects, stablecoin adoption such as RLUSD, and potential smart contract integration via sidechains, the stage is gradually being set for broader utility that could mimic Ethereum’s trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Forecasts and Long-Term Outlook Market projections remain far more conservative than KINGVALEX’s vision. CoinCodex estimates XRP will average $3.13 by the end of 2025, with highs around $3.50. Even optimistic analyses foresee upside toward $9.50–$49 in the medium term. However, Easy Co-founder, Domini Kwok, earlier predicted $1000 XRP by 2030 . For XRP to reach $1,000, it would require unprecedented adoption across decentralized finance, global remittances, institutional settlements, and perhaps integration into central bank and sovereign payment infrastructure. Final Thoughts KINGVALEX’s claim underscores an important narrative: XRP’s value has long been suppressed by external legal challenges, and its true growth potential may only now be beginning to surface. The resolution of the SEC case and emerging opportunities in DeFi and tokenization provide a more favorable environment than ever before. Still, reaching $1,000 would require an extraordinary leap in both technology adoption and global financial integration. While the prediction is ambitious, it highlights a renewed sense of optimism surrounding XRP’s role in the next era of blockchain finance.

50448426,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=789195,1755792329,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50448426.jpeg,Russia to require all phones to come with government-backed Whatsapp clone,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russia-to-pre-install-whatsapp-clones-phones/,"Russia will require all mobile phones and tablets sold in the country to come with a government-backed messaging app called Max pre-installed from September 1. The Russian government announced on Thursday that Max, a messenger application developed under the Kremlin-controlled tech company VK, will join the list of mandatory apps installed on all new gadgets sold in the country. Officials said the platform will allow messaging, video calls, mobile payments, and access to state services. State media have rejected accusations that the app functions as spyware, claiming Max requires fewer permissions than Western competitors such as WhatsApp or Telegram. However, local news publications have reported on the app’s integration with government systems and its ability to continue operating even after users attempt to delete it. Critics raise surveillance concerns Independent analysts and digital rights activists say Max could pass for a surveillance tool for the Russian state. The Telegram channel Red Binder, which reports on internet issues, claimed Max collects extensive personal data, including call logs, crypto holdings, bank accounts, purchase history, and even details of cafés visited. According to the Telegram channel, the data is accessible to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Kremlin operatives who can use Max in the real-time monitoring of citizens’ communications and movements. It was likened to China’s WeChat, which is allegedly used by Chinese authorities for daily life and state surveillance. Russian opposition journalist Andrei Okun called Max the Kremlin’s “Digital Gulag.” Writing for the news site Republic, Okun said the app will create a “sterile space” where authorities exert complete control over people’s leisure, thoughts, and motivations. The introduction of Max follows legislation passed by the Russian State Duma in June mandating the creation of a homegrown messenger linked to public services. But reporting by the outlet Meduza suggests VK had already developed such an app earlier under direct instructions from President Vladimir Putin. The app features a blue-and-white logo and has been downloaded by around 18 million users, according to VK. The company admits parts of Max are in a testing phase even as the government prepares to mandate its installation nationwide. Authorities also stated that from January 1, 2026, all smart TVs sold in Russia will come preloaded with LIME HD TV, an app with free access to state television channels. Pressure on Western rivals The decision to pre-install Max on mobile devices coincides with new restrictions on foreign messaging platforms. Earlier this month, Russia began limiting some calls made through WhatsApp and Telegram, accusing the companies of refusing to share data with law enforcement during investigations into fraud and terrorism. WhatsApp, owned by US firm Meta, had a reach of 97.3 million users in Russia in July, according to Mediascope. Telegram, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov but based abroad, reached 90.8 million users in the same period. The third most popular app was VK Messenger at 17.9 million users. WhatsApp accused Moscow of attempting to cut Russians off from secure communications, while Telegram said it continues to combat harmful uses of its platform. Russian officials have signaled that WhatsApp could soon face an outright ban. Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the State Duma’s IT committee, said in early August that WhatsApp should prepare to exit the Russian market. Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram were banned in Russia in 2022. As for Telegram, for now, the Russian government seems to have no issue. Durov has denied cooperating with Kremlin security services, though Ukrainian intelligence claims Russian officials have already been instructed to use Max for official business. The Russian Interior Ministry insists that Max is “less dangerous” than WhatsApp or Telegram, adding that it is less intrusive.

That’s exactly what Verb Technology (Nasdaq: VERB) is doing, and the news is turning heads across the financial landscape. Soon to be known as Ton Strategy Company, Verb Technology has just announced a colossal Toncoin treasury totaling an astonishing $780 million. This significant disclosure highlights a profound shift in the company’s strategic direction, signaling a strong embrace of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Does Verb Technology’s Toncoin Treasury Consist Of? The reported $780 million in treasury assets is not just a general figure; it’s specifically broken down, revealing the company’s deep dive into the crypto space. According to a Businesswire report, the vast majority of this impressive sum is held in Toncoin (TON). Toncoin (TON): A staggering $713 million of the treasury is comprised of Toncoin. This represents a substantial commitment to the TON blockchain ecosystem. Cash Holdings: The remaining $67 million is held in traditional cash. This ensures liquidity and operational flexibility alongside their significant crypto investment. This allocation demonstrates a clear strategic intent: to align the company’s future with the growth and potential of the Toncoin network. It’s a remarkable move for a publicly traded entity to hold such a large percentage of its treasury in a single cryptocurrency. Why is This Toncoin Treasury Significant for the Future? Verb Technology’s decision to build such a substantial Toncoin treasury goes beyond mere investment; it’s a foundational element of their impending transformation. The renaming to Ton Strategy Company isn’t just a cosmetic change; it reflects a complete strategic overhaul. This move positions the company directly within the burgeoning Web3 and blockchain sectors, particularly focusing on the Toncoin ecosystem, which powers the Telegram-linked Open Network. For investors, this signifies several potential implications: Strong Balance Sheet: A significant asset base, even if volatile, provides a robust foundation. Crypto Exposure: Shareholders gain direct exposure to the performance of Toncoin and the broader TON ecosystem. Strategic Alignment: The company’s future operations are now intrinsically linked to the development and adoption of Toncoin. This bold strategy could attract a new wave of investors keen on exposure to the crypto market through a publicly traded, regulated entity. What Are the Implications of a Large Toncoin Treasury? Holding a large Toncoin treasury presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. On the opportunity side, if Toncoin continues to gain adoption and value, Verb Technology’s assets could appreciate significantly, boosting its market capitalization and financial standing. This strategic bet on the Toncoin network could unlock substantial long-term value, especially as the ecosystem expands with new applications and users. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile. Fluctuations in Toncoin’s value will directly impact the company’s treasury valuation and, consequently, its financial reports. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies could introduce complexities or uncertainties. Liquidity Management: While $67 million in cash provides some buffer, managing such a large crypto holding requires sophisticated strategies. The company will need to navigate these factors carefully to ensure the long-term success of its Toncoin-centric strategy. How Does This Position Ton Strategy Company in the Market? By disclosing its massive Toncoin treasury , Ton Strategy Company is making a clear statement: it is fully committed to becoming a key player in the Web3 space. This move differentiates them from many traditional companies and even other blockchain firms that might have smaller, less concentrated crypto holdings. Their direct investment in Toncoin could foster closer ties with the TON community and developers, potentially leading to synergistic partnerships and innovative projects. This strategic pivot positions them as a pioneer among Nasdaq-listed companies, embracing a future where digital assets are integral to corporate finance and strategy. The market will closely watch how this bold move translates into operational success and shareholder value as the company officially rebrands and begins its new chapter. In conclusion, Verb Technology’s revelation of a $780 million Toncoin treasury , largely composed of Toncoin, marks a transformative moment for the company. As it prepares to become Ton Strategy Company, this strategic financial maneuver underscores a profound commitment to the cryptocurrency space. While the journey ahead will undoubtedly involve navigating the inherent volatility of digital assets, this decisive step positions the company at the forefront of the evolving Web3 economy, aiming to capitalize on the vast potential of the Toncoin ecosystem. It’s a bold bet that could redefine its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Verb Technology and its new name, Ton Strategy Company?

Earlier this week, the meme coin ranked among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, drawing the most bullish sentiment. However, retail enthusiasm doesn’t always guarantee price gains. Time to Pump Again? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has followed the overall correction of the crypto space, with its price dipping by 9% in the past week. Its market capitalization currently hovers at around $7.3 billion, which is far below the local peak in December when the figure reached almost $20 billion. Despite the negative performance, some important factors suggest a rebound could be on the horizon. The SHIB exchange netflow, which in the past week has been predominantly negative, is one such example. This signals that investors have been shifting from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which in turn reduces the immediate selling pressure. SHIB Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Currently, there are around 85.2 trillion tokens stored on exchanges, which represents a massive decline from the 140.7 trillion witnessed at the start of the year. Next on the list is the resurgence of Shibarium. Daily transactions processed on Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution dipped below 4 million on August 18 and August 19 but shot to 4.8 million on August 20, the highest figure observed since early February 2025. Each transaction on Shibarium involves burning SHIB tokens, which can be beneficial for the price if demand doesn’t head south. Moreover, the increased activity could be a sign that the Shiba Inu ecosystem is gaining additional adoption. Some analysts and popular figures in the crypto space believe Shibarium’s development is of utmost importance for a potential SHIB bull run. Not long ago, the Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci said : “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically, it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet. If they get that solved, Shiba Inu will go to the moon.” The Sentiment is Bullish, But There’s a Catch According to CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu was among the top 10 cryptocurrencies attracting the most bullish sentiment on August 20. While this may seem encouraging for SHIB enthusiasts, the crypto market often behaves in unexpected ways. History shows that prices can move opposite to crowd sentiment, meaning retail optimism could actually signal potential trouble ahead for SHIB.

He’ll walk once more through the massive lobby of Jackson Lake Lodge, past the grizzly bear statue, under elk-antler chandeliers, and into the same ballroom where he’s given seven straight speeches to the world’s top central bankers. Powell will speak Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern, the same time he’s taken the stage since 2018. What he says then, as always, will hint at the Fed’s next move. The Fed chair was first picked by President Donald Trump in late 2017 to run the U.S. central bank. Since then, Powell’s speeches at Jackson Hole have previewed everything from hikes to cuts, slowdowns to panics. Some years, he leaned into economic theory. Others, he addressed live crises. But every year, the message signaled what would follow. Powell backed hikes in 2018 and reversed course in 2019 Powell’s first Jackson Hole speech in 2018 was his longest. He laid out his policy framework using the phrase “navigating by the stars,” which referred to the neutral interest rate and natural unemployment level. But his real point was about balance. “I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC’s approach to taking seriously both of these risks,” Powell said, referring to the risk of overdoing or underdoing tightening. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice after that speech, following two hikes earlier that year. In 2019, Powell’s tone changed. The U.S. was deep into Trump’s first trade war, and the global economy was feeling it. Powell brought that issue directly into his speech, saying, “We have been monitoring three factors that are weighing on this favorable outlook: slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation.” Within hours of that comment, Trump posted on social media: “Who is our bigger enemy, Powell or Xi?” The Fed responded that year with two more rate cuts, following one in July. Then came COVID, and everything changed. Powell leaned on jobs in 2020, misjudged inflation in 2021 In 2020, Powell addressed the conference remotely because of the pandemic. This time, he introduced a new policy framework, focused more heavily on jobs. “Our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal,” he said. “Following periods when inflation has been running below 2%, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time.” In September that year, the Federal Reserve adopted a new test for future rate hikes: the economy needed to reach maximum employment and 2% inflation, with signs inflation would hold above that level. But in 2021, Powell misread inflation. He again appeared virtually and dismissed the price spike as temporary. “Current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory,” he said. The Federal Reserve slowed its asset purchases in November but kept the interest rate near zero until March 2022. That delay was later blamed by both critics and Fed officials for allowing inflation to grow worse. Powell warned of pain in 2022 and opened the door to cuts in 2024 In 2022, Powell returned to the Jackson Hole podium in person and kept his comments short. “Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time,” he said. That year, the Fed followed his speech with two more massive 75-basis-point hikes and then switched to smaller increases until rates reached 5.25%-5.50% by July 2023. In 2023, Powell’s tone was different but still cautious. “We will proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data,” he said. He didn’t commit to more hikes but left the option open. The Federal Reserve kept the rate steady at 5.25%-5.50% through the year. By 2024, Powell said the risks had flipped. Inflation was cooling, but job numbers were starting to look weak. “My confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%,” he said. “We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions… The time has come for policy to adjust.” That adjustment came fast. In September, the Fed ended its year-long pause with a half-point rate cut. It followed with two more quarter-point cuts to close the year.

These are the colossal holders of BTC, whose actions can significantly influence market dynamics. Recently, a remarkable trend has emerged, capturing the attention of analysts worldwide. Over the past seven days, these influential entities have made a substantial move, collectively accumulating over 16,000 BTC. This massive acquisition is not random; it clearly signals a compelling “dip buying” pattern, indicating a calculated and strategic positioning amidst recent market fluctuations. Understanding the behavior of these Bitcoin whales is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. What Are Bitcoin Whales Doing Right Now? In a revealing observation by CryptoQuant contributor Cauê Oliveira, it’s clear that Bitcoin whales have been exceptionally active. Over the past seven days, these influential wallets have collectively added more than 16,000 Bitcoins to their holdings. This isn’t just random buying; Oliveira interprets this as a deliberate “absorption” strategy, where large players soak up available supply during price drops. Significant Accumulation: Over 16,000 BTC added in one week. Strategic Behavior: Identified as part of a “dip buying” and “absorption” pattern. Influential Players: These movements often precede or coincide with market shifts. This kind of activity from Bitcoin whales often provides crucial insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. It showcases their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value, even when prices face temporary setbacks. Why Do Bitcoin Whales Engage in Dip Buying? So, why are these colossal holders of Bitcoin making such moves? Bitcoin whales typically operate with a long-term perspective, aiming to capitalize on market downturns. A “dip” represents an opportunity for them to acquire more assets at a lower price, strengthening their position for future rallies. It’s a classic investment strategy: buy low, sell high. Historically, periods of significant whale accumulation have often coincided with market bottoms or preceded notable price recoveries. They possess the capital and the market understanding to make calculated risks. For instance, when smaller investors might panic sell, Bitcoin whales often see underlying value and step in to buy. This absorption helps stabilize the market by taking selling pressure off, preventing more drastic price slides. What Does This Whale Activity Mean for the Market? The recent accumulation by Bitcoin whales carries several significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Firstly, it strongly suggests an underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s future value among these large investors. When those with the most capital are actively buying during price dips, it often sends a reassuring signal to smaller participants, hinting at a potential bullish outlook or at least a belief that current prices represent attractive entry points. This “absorption” phase by Bitcoin whales helps to stabilize the market by reducing available supply at lower prices. However, it’s crucial to remember that whale movements, while powerful indicators, do not guarantee immediate price surges. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and technological developments. Yet, their consistent “dip buying” pattern points towards a long-term strategic play rather than short-term speculation. Consider these actionable insights derived from observing Bitcoin whales : Market Confidence Indicator: Significant whale buying can serve as a robust signal of institutional or large-investor confidence, potentially encouraging broader market participation. Potential Price Support: Their substantial accumulation can establish strong support levels for Bitcoin, making further significant price drops less likely in the immediate future as buying pressure increases. Long-Term Perspective: This consistent pattern of buying dips aligns with a long-term investment strategy, suggesting that these powerful entities anticipate considerable future appreciation for Bitcoin. Risk Assessment: While informative, always conduct your own research. Whale activity is one piece of a complex puzzle. Observing the behavior of Bitcoin whales can provide valuable context for your own investment decisions, offering a unique lens into the convictions of the market’s most influential players. Conclusion: Understanding the Giants of Crypto The recent acquisition of over 16,000 BTC by Bitcoin whales underscores a clear and significant “dip buying” pattern, as expertly identified by CryptoQuant’s Cauê Oliveira. This strategic accumulation by the market’s largest players unequivocally highlights a robust and unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and intrinsic value. While such powerful whale activity doesn’t guarantee immediate price surges, it undeniably offers a compelling glimpse into the underlying strength and future potential perceived by those with the deepest pockets and the most significant stake in the crypto ecosystem. Staying informed about these powerful movements, particularly from Bitcoin whales , is absolutely essential for making informed decisions and confidently navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to influence market prices through their buying or selling activities. While there’s no official threshold, holdings often range from hundreds to thousands of BTC. 2. What does “dip buying” mean in crypto? “Dip buying” refers to the strategy of purchasing an asset, like Bitcoin, after its price has experienced a significant decline. Investors who “buy the dip” believe the asset’s value will recover, allowing them to profit from the lower entry point. 3. How do Bitcoin whale movements impact the market? The movements of Bitcoin whales can significantly impact market sentiment and price. Large accumulation phases can signal confidence and potential upward momentum, while large selling can indicate bearish sentiment or profit-taking, potentially leading to price drops. Their actions can create or absorb market volatility. 4. Should I mimic Bitcoin whale investment strategies? While observing Bitcoin whales can provide valuable insights, directly mimicking their strategies is not always advisable for individual investors. Whales have vast capital, different risk tolerances, and access to resources that average investors do not. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider your personal financial situation. 5. Where can I track Bitcoin whale activity? Various on-chain analytics platforms and crypto intelligence firms, like CryptoQuant (as mentioned in the article), Glassnode, and Arkham Intelligence, provide data and analysis on Bitcoin whale movements. These platforms track large transactions and wallet behaviors. If you found this insight into Bitcoin whales and their strategic movements valuable, don’t keep it to yourself!

By session’s end, the token had regained $0.24, reinforcing the $0.23–$0.24 band as a zone of support and accumulation. The rebound comes as broader macro conditions favor digital assets. The Federal Reserve has kept rates below 2%, with markets increasingly pricing in cuts that could provide short-term momentum for crypto. Institutional developments are also strengthening sentiment. Global payments network SWIFT launched live blockchain trials featuring Hedera, while asset manager Grayscale filed a Delaware trust for HBAR — a move viewed by some as laying groundwork for a future ETF. Together, these factors highlight rising institutional interest in enterprise blockchain infrastructure. As central banks and financial institutions accelerate testing of tokenized settlement systems, Hedera’s positioning within global payments is gaining attention. HBAR’s latest recovery may signal more than intraday volatility — it reflects growing confidence in Hedera’s role in digital finance. Technical Indicators Price demonstrated explosive volatility during 60-minute period from 21 August 13:22 to 14:21, surging from $0.24 to peak of $0.24 representing 1% breakthrough. Final 15 minutes demonstrated unprecedented bullish momentum as price rocketed from $0.24 to close at $0.24 amid critical volume spikes. Session showcased classic support formation around $0.24 level with multiple successful retests. Resistance at $0.24 was decisively tested in closing phase, suggesting strong institutional accumulation. Trading volumes exceeded 2.8 million during breakout periods indicating significant market interest.

According to recent Ethereum price prediction models, a rise to $4,100 could be the key level bulls must uphold. Investors are divided on whether the Ethereum ETF will help the altcoin recover or slip further. While the discussion continues, Remittix is stealing the spotlight in the PayFi market. It raised over $20.6 million and is building rapid momentum with a BitMart listing ahead. Remittix continues to get all the attention while the Ethereum price struggles. Ethereum Price Prediction Amid ETF Hype Source: Crypto Caesar Ethereum price sits near $4,335, a dip from its recent highs. With technical signals suggesting waning momentum, the Stochastic RSI is at 36, pointing to a decline in buying power and MACD levels are widening to the downside. The Ethereum price support zone of $4,100 to $4,000 is crucial. Should ETH maintain prices above this range, the next resistance is around the $4,800 mark. A surge beyond that range would revive bullish sentiment and restore optimism among holders. However, should Ethereum decline below the $4,000 mark firmly, the bearish image might get clearer. The Ethereum price prediction leans toward a withdrawal, potentially challenging the $3,600 mark before buyers re-emerge. Right now, the feeling is pessimistic yet optimistic that the Ethereum ETF hype could strengthen its momentum Remittix Looks Set to be the Biggest Winner of the Bull Market As Ethereum ETF influences its volatile technical outlook, Remittix is taking full advantage, attracting a shift toward payment-focused tokens. Market observers note that Remittix’s solution to global remittance issues with speed, low fees and real-world adoption strategies is key to its growth. With this setup, the PayFi altcoin stands out as a project with real utility rather than more hype. What helps Remittix stand out and grow: Over $20.6M raised from early investment with strong community support Set to take over the $190T payments industry with PayFi solutions Confirmed BitMart listing, fueling liquidity growth and accessibility Anticipation toward a mobile-first wallet that will deliver instant conversion from crypto to fiat Solution fit for businesses, freelancers and remitters globally These features enable Remittix to affirm itself as a legitimate PayFi contender and argue that it is the best DeFi project of 2025.

The approval marks a significant step in Gemini’s EU strategy, enabling the firm to roll out its trading products and services to customers in more than 30 European jurisdictions, the company noted. Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which came into effect this year, is the EU’s first region-wide crypto rulebook, designed to harmonize digital asset oversight across member states and provide legal clarity for firms operating in the sector. Gemini has been steadily building its regulatory base in the region. In May, the company secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) license to offer derivatives. That was followed by the launch of tokenized stocks in Europe a month later. The crypto exchange said the MiCA license underscores its long-standing focus on compliance as it looks to introduce additional offerings, including derivatives, to both retail and institutional clients in Europe. Gemini is also among several crypto companies that are looking to go public. Last week, the firm said it had hired Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Cantor as lead bookrunners for its planned IPO.

The presentation suggests that a card launch is planned, with the choice of partners suggesting a significant step toward mainstream integration. Visit the placement at the SW Corner of 29th & Broadway New York, NY. pic.twitter.com/I64nxToWci — Gemini (@Gemini) August 21, 2025 Another Major Victory for XRP Crypto commentator John Squire was quick to respond, stating that mass adoption “is coming fast,” while adding that the date “could change everything.” This revelation has made August 25 a pivotal date, as XRP is about to deepen its connection with established financial infrastructure and potentially gain a new wave of users. An XRP card is a game-changer as it could allow holders to transact through Mastercard while funding purchases with XRP or fiat conversions on integrated rails. WebBank’s role signals the compliance and consumer protections required for U.S. card issuance. The companies have revealed the date for this major launch, and everyone will be eager to get more details as August 25 approaches. The Gemini and Ripple Partnership Gemini’s decision to promote the billboard is significant. The exchange recently teased something big for XRP , suggesting a new era of XRP-related rewards. Gemini already offers a crypto credit card with cashback rewards for XRP users . However, this announcement could mean a major expansion of these services with MasterCard’s involvement and a greater focus on XRP. At the same time, Ripple is providing a credit line to support Gemini’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) , creating a clear alignment between a regulated exchange, a payments-focused blockchain firm, and a global card network. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If those ties lead to an XRP-focused card product, the digital asset could see stronger distribution, deeper liquidity, and improved credibility with institutional users. The Bottom Line The clearest interpretation of the billboard is that an XRP-linked Mastercard issued by WebBank will launch on August 25, 2025. Other possibilities remain, such as additional services tied to loyalty, remittances, or settlement functions. Alongside Ripple’s support for Gemini, the elements point toward coordinated activity that extends XRP’s role beyond trading. If August 25 confirms the arrival of a working card or comparable product, XRP adoption could accelerate, giving the market new liquidity pathways and token holders another practical means of use .

For a long time, such opportunities remained exclusive to large institutions and accredited investors. However, a significant shift is now underway. Global investment platform Republic has officially announced its groundbreaking Republic Injective integration , aiming to democratize access to these once-exclusive private company investments. What Does This Republic Injective Integration Mean for You? This exciting development signifies a major leap towards making private markets more accessible. Republic, known for its crowdfunding and private investment offerings, is now leveraging Injective’s powerful blockchain infrastructure. This collaboration creates a new pathway for individual investors to participate in opportunities previously out of reach. Democratized Access: You can now invest in promising private companies, similar to how large venture capital firms do. New Opportunities: Explore a diverse portfolio of private companies, including high-growth tech startups and established ventures. Potential Liquidity: Republic’s plan involves a blockchain-based financial product designed to track private company stock prices, potentially offering more liquidity than traditional private investments. How Does the Republic Injective Integration Work? The core of this innovation lies in combining Republic’s expertise in sourcing and structuring private deals with Injective’s robust blockchain capabilities. In June, Republic unveiled its vision to launch a blockchain-based financial product. This product will effectively track the stock prices of private companies. Injective provides the high-performance, interoperable blockchain network necessary to power such a sophisticated financial instrument. Therefore, this Republic Injective integration creates a seamless bridge between traditional private equity and the efficiency of decentralized finance (DeFi). Essentially, Injective acts as the underlying rails, allowing for the secure and transparent tracking of these private assets on a blockchain. This approach enhances transparency and potentially reduces friction in the investment process. Why is the Republic Injective Integration a Game-Changer? This partnership is more than just a technological advancement; it represents a paradigm shift in the investment landscape. The Republic Injective integration challenges the long-standing barriers between retail investors and lucrative private markets. It brings the promise of blockchain technology directly into the realm of traditional finance. Consider the impact: it could foster greater financial inclusion, allowing a broader range of individuals to participate in wealth creation opportunities. Moreover, it sets a precedent for how blockchain can revolutionize investment vehicles, making them more efficient, transparent, and accessible to everyone. This move highlights a growing trend where centralized entities are embracing decentralized technologies to enhance their offerings and reach. It truly empowers individual investors. What Are the Opportunities and Considerations with Republic Injective Integration? The opportunities presented by the Republic Injective integration are compelling. Investors can diversify their portfolios beyond public stocks and bonds, gaining exposure to companies in their high-growth stages. This early access can potentially lead to significant returns as these private companies mature. However, it is crucial to approach private investments with an informed perspective. While the blockchain-based product aims to track prices, private markets inherently carry different liquidity profiles compared to public exchanges. Therefore, investors should always: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the private companies you are investing in. Assess Risk Tolerance: Private investments can be less liquid and carry higher risks than traditional public market assets. Understand the Technology: Familiarize yourself with the basics of how blockchain-based products function. In conclusion, the Republic Injective integration marks a pivotal moment for individual investors worldwide. It is a bold step towards a future where high-potential private investments are no longer reserved for the few but are accessible to a much wider audience, powered by the innovative capabilities of blockchain technology.

Exchange inflows of $41.3M point to repositioning, with volatility risk elevated in the near term. Institutional adoption and DeFi dominance support Ethereum’s long-term outlook despite short-term uncertainty. By Jainam Mehta ​Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is trading around $4,283, attempting to stabilize after weeks of volatility that have confined it within a descending channel. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is consolidating as investors weigh technical resistance, exchange flows, and institutional participation. Technical outlook shows mixed signals ETH price remains capped by resistance at $4,320, which coincides with the upper boundary of the falling channel. Despite several attempts, the token has struggled to close above this level, reflecting persistent selling pressure. On the downside, support sits at $4,150 and further at $4,000, a psychological pivot that has contained losses through the summer. ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Momentum indicators reflect indecision. The relative strength index is hovering in neutral territory, signaling neither exhaustion nor strong conviction. A breakout above $4,320 would open the door to $4,500 and $4,700, while a failure to defend $4,150 risks declines toward $3,900 and $3,700. Exchange flow data highlights a key development. Net inflows of $41.3 million suggest traders are moving assets back onto exchanges, a shift that could either precede selling or reflect positioning for fresh opportunities. Historically, such inflows have coincided with volatility spikes, though order books remain relatively balanced for now. Institutional flows and DeFi dominance Ethereum’s long-term foundation remains supported by institutional engagement. The Shanghai upgrade enabled staking, steadily locking ETH supply and generating validator yield. This structural reduction in liquid supply has offset short-term selling pressure, while Ethereum-linked investment products continue to attract inflows. Institutions increasingly view ETH as a core bet on tokenized finance and programmable money, extending beyond its role as a speculative asset. The network also maintains dominance in decentralized finance, commanding the largest share of total value locked. Competing chains such as Solana and scaling solutions like Arbitrum have gained traction, but Ethereum’s rollup-centric scaling plans and upcoming upgrades are expected to deliver lasting improvements in transaction speed and costs. These advances, combined with strong developer activity, reinforce its status as the backbone of DeFi. Macro conditions add another layer of complexity. The Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on interest rates has kept risk assets under pressure, with crypto markets reacting to shifts in liquidity. Ethereum has displayed resilience, often moving in tandem with Bitcoin but recovering faster in risk-on periods. For many investors, ETH remains a growth asset with substantial utility, balancing volatility with long-term adoption potential. Outlook hinges on $4,320 breakout Derivatives data suggest traders are cautious but engaged. Long-to-short ratios are balanced, while open interest remains steady without excessive leverage buildup, reducing the risk of sudden liquidation-driven swings. This environment leaves room for a measured breakout if a catalyst emerges, whether from macro policy shifts or network upgrades. The near-term roadmap is clear. Bulls must reclaim $4,320 to confirm a breakout, with $4,500 and $4,700 as follow-on targets. Failure to hold $4,150 could pull price back toward $4,000 and $3,700, testing investor conviction. Regardless of short-term moves, Ethereum’s staking model, DeFi leadership, and institutional adoption provide a durable framework for long-term growth. In earlier coverage, we stressed the importance of Ethereum defending the $4,000 handle while testing resistance at $4,320. That outlook has held, with the market now consolidating between these levels as exchange flows and institutional positioning dictate momentum. The decisive test remains whether ETH can break higher through $4,320 or yield to another corrective phase.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.66 Market cap 20.23% 24-hour trading volume $36.92 Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $9.12 24-hour low $8.70 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 7.48% 50-day SMA $9.61 200-day SMA $16.09 Sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI moves along $10 On the day of writing (August 21), ORDI’s price dropped by 2.63% in 24 hours and 21.28% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume, however, fell by 23.15% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market. The coin has registered negative momentum over the last week. The MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.04. It is oversold when the RSI drops below 30. ORDI’s 24-hour drop is likely driven by Bitcoin’s correction. BTC’s ability to hold $115k support – a break below could trigger cascading liquidations in high-beta alts like ORDI. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving downwards at the $9 mark, with neutral RSI (40.32) and MACD confirmation. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.06 BUY SMA 5 8.82 SELL SMA 10 9.58 SELL SMA 21 9.59 SELL SMA 50 9.61 SELL SMA 100 9.52 SELL SMA 200 16.09 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 9.50 SELL EMA 5 9.36 SELL EMA 10 9.00 SELL EMA 21 8.71 SELL EMA 50 9.71 SELL EMA 100 13.55 SELL EMA 200 20.28 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $113,000. The charts show it will continue downwards. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI up? ORDI is in a bull run this month. The rise in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s sentiment. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-21 17:45:00

While Bitcoin remains market leader, the greatest profits historically are made from selected altcoins. Each cycle offers project opportunities that exceed expectations and return life-changing multiples to early participants. A mix of old networks and new tokens are making waves today. The next six to twelve months could see portfolios of early adopters be dictated by smart contract giants dominating DeFi and smaller players catching narrative-driven momentum. Out of all of these names, one presale has earned the top slot for multi-cycle wealth generation. Solana: High-speed infrastructure with staying power Solana has proven itself strongest performer over past two years despite network outages that raised questions over the blockchain. Its blockchain has extremely fast transaction speeds and very low fees and is preferred by developers and retail users. The DeFi ecosystem has recently grown quickly and there is still strong NFT demand. Analysts believe that Solana could retest its previous highs in the upcoming cycle as per forecasts. Moreover, they predict long-term growth similar to Ethereum. Traders investing $1,000 should still see SOL as a balanced bet given the adoption surge it is now witnessing. Moreover, the asset could offer big-upside potential if liquidity continues to rotate into scalable smart contract platforms. XRP: Riding regulatory clarity and institutional demand Since the legal tussles with SEC, XRP has become the center of attention. With much of the uncertainty gone now, the asset is seeing a revival of institutional buying and cross-border payment networks. XRP’s unique use case in international settlements gives it the status of one of the few tokens with a direct utility narrative recognized by tradition Finance. Analysts are predicting that XRP will have a steady rise in the next bull cycle. This is likely if the ETF applications currently pending approval receive the necessary green light. For investors wanting a clear regulatory framework and a bit of exposure to financial infrastructure plays, XRP is shaping up to be a compelling choice. Its potential can get better as capital starts to flow into tokens with legal recognition. Where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture While Solana, XRP, Toncoin, and Sei all offer strong cases for inclusion in a balanced portfolio, the greatest opportunities often come from projects still in their early phases. This is precisely where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. Ranked as the best crypto presale to buy for multi-cycle wealth generation , it has quickly established itself as a unique entrant with explosive upside potential. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just its presale momentum but its broader cultural resonance. Built around a politically charged narrative that commands global attention, it benefits from visibility beyond typical crypto circles. Each funding round has sold out at a rapid pace, signaling overwhelming. The advantage of this coin is simple: it takes far less capital to ignite exponential gains . While Ethereum or Cardano require billions to move significantly, emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE can surge quickly with modest inflows. With the presale already nearing completion, early backers see it as one of the rare chances to capture the kind of wealth generation that defines entire market cycles. Toncoin (TON): The rising Telegram-linked ecosystem Toncoin is now one of the most dominant forces globally thanks to Telegram. Telegram is one of the largest messaging applications globally. Telegram has created mini-apps, wallets, and other decentralised services on its platform and this gives TON a distribution edge. With chatgpt and other AI tools, the usability of crypto will rapidly expand with its use cases in new domains of user activities. According to market observers, Toncoin is set to gain substantially as mainstream adoption for its ecosystem expands. For anyone planning to invest $1000, TON is a bet on actual usage with a vast audience already built in. Sei (SEI): Optimized for speed in trading Sei is known as one of the fastest Layer 1 blockchains geared towards high-frequency trading and DeFi activity. Sei effectively addresses the latency challenges for decentralized finance with execution speeds in milliseconds. Due to its special position, developers are attracted to build applications that require ultra-efficient throughput. Analysts believe that SEI could become a significant player in DeFi infrastructure as its mainnet momentum continues to build. The fact that it is smaller than Solana or Ethereum means that there is plenty of room for growth – an enticing characteristic for an investor looking to bet on a new platform. Why timing matters History shows that altcoin seasons unfold in phases. First, Bitcoin rallies, then Ethereum consolidates and liquidity rotates into strong narratives in smaller projects. The ongoing market setup is a duplicate of those patterns, with the institutional inflows already lifting Bitcoin and Ethereum and the traders shifting toward high upside plays. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the next logical step in this rotation. It combines the urgency of a nearly sold-out presale with cultural branding that resonates across investor communities. At a moment when traditional assets face uncertainty and crypto is regaining momentum, this timing could prove decisive. Conclusion: A balanced allocation with high-upside potential If you have $1,000 to invest in crypto, you should invest in a mix of established and new projects. Some development updates: We have seen some big developments in the crypto space this week. First, Solana provides scalability and adoption. Next, XRP delivers regulatory clarity and utility. Third, Toncoin leverages mass-market integration. Lastly, Sei brings speed and innovation to DeFi. All four of these offer a balanced approach to proven altcoin plays. However, for those seeking transformational upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out from the competition. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers huge return over several cycles. The presale is nearly sold out and branding is getting global attention, making it the most interesting early-stage opportunity on today’s market.

ESCAPE, a Web3 infrastructure token, has launched its presale on Ethereum and shared its roadmap for new blockchain tools. The project aims to make it easy to create tokens, check analytics, and give communities better visibility: all without needing complex coding or bridges. Mission and Vision According to the team, right now, the world of crypto can feel confusing and scattered - people often have to jump between many different apps and tools just to trade, track information, and stay safe. ESCAPE's goal is to make things simple by creating one all-in-one platform where everything you need is in one place. Strategy and Development The project's development strategy emerged from practical market experience, having initially deployed on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution where the team observed strong community demand for simplified, integrated tools. The original implementation achieved a market capitalization of 11.5 million dollars within two days, demonstrating significant market appetite for consolidated crypto trading infrastructure. Following the discontinuation of the initial Layer 2 platform, the team transitioned to Ethereum Layer 1 to ensure long-term sustainability and independence. ESCAPE emphasizes transparency and accountability. The platform has successfully completed an audit by Hacken that also has audited known companies like Binance, verification by Coinsult, and a KYC review conducted by SolidProof ensures the team is Doxxed. The development process is tracked via an open community board. During and after the presale, ESCAPE also offers a staking program with a sustainable 15% APY, giving early supporters a way to earn rewards. This rate was chosen carefully to ensure long-term growth and ecosystem stability. A collaboration with PAW Chain will extend ESCAPE’s reach by enabling multichain deployment. This integration will allow token creators to launch identical contract addresses across more than 15 major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche - removing the need for bridges or wrapped tokens. Utilities and Deliverables The ESCAPE ecosystem, powered by the $ESCAPE token, is being rebuilt and expanded to include: EscapePad: a no-code token launchpad for Ethereum and future networks DEX Viewer: real-time charts, wallet activity, and volume analytics Wallet Inspector: cross-chain portfolio and transaction analysis Telegram Bots: customizable alerts for trades and holder milestones Mobile App: token deployment and monitoring on iOS and Android Token Visibility Tools: ecosystem-native placement features for projects “ESCAPE is being built to simplify Web3 and restore trust through transparency,” said an ESCAPE spokesperson. “The Ethereum relaunch and future multichain expansion represent more than a rebuild - they represent a stronger foundation for creators and communities to launch and grow without limitations.” About ESCAPE ESCAPE is a Web3 infrastructure platform focused on token creation, analytics, and visibility across multiple blockchains. Initially launched on a Layer 2 network in early 2025, ESCAPE grew to over 800 holders and an $11.5 million market cap before migrating to Ethereum.

ESCAPE, a Web3 infrastructure token, has launched its presale on Ethereum and shared its roadmap for new blockchain tools. The project aims to make it easy to create tokens, check analytics, and give communities better visibility: all without needing complex coding or bridges. Mission and Vision According to the team, right now, the world of crypto can feel confusing and scattered – people often have to jump between many different apps and tools just to trade, track information, and stay safe. ESCAPE’s goal is to make things simple by creating one all-in-one platform where everything you need is in one place. Strategy and Development The project’s development strategy emerged from practical market experience, having initially deployed on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution where the team observed strong community demand for simplified, integrated tools. The original implementation achieved a market capitalization of 11.5 million dollars within two days, demonstrating significant market appetite for consolidated crypto trading infrastructure. Following the discontinuation of the initial Layer 2 platform, the team transitioned to Ethereum Layer 1 to ensure long-term sustainability and independence. ESCAPE emphasizes transparency and accountability. The platform has successfully completed an audit by Hacken that also has audited known companies like Binance, verification by Coinsult, and a KYC review conducted by SolidProof ensures the team is Doxxed. The development process is tracked via an open community board. During and after the presale, ESCAPE also offers a staking program with a sustainable 15% APY, giving early supporters a way to earn rewards. This rate was chosen carefully to ensure long-term growth and ecosystem stability. A collaboration with PAW Chain will extend ESCAPE’s reach by enabling multichain deployment. This integration will allow token creators to launch identical contract addresses across more than 15 major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche – removing the need for bridges or wrapped tokens. Utilities and Deliverables The ESCAPE ecosystem, powered by the $ESCAPE token, is being rebuilt and expanded to include: EscapePad: a no-code token launchpad for Ethereum and future networks DEX Viewer: real-time charts, wallet activity, and volume analytics Wallet Inspector: cross-chain portfolio and transaction analysis Telegram Bots: customizable alerts for trades and holder milestones Mobile App: token deployment and monitoring on iOS and Android Token Visibility Tools: ecosystem-native placement features for projects “ESCAPE is being built to simplify Web3 and restore trust through transparency,” said an ESCAPE spokesperson. “The Ethereum relaunch and future multichain expansion represent more than a rebuild – they represent a stronger foundation for creators and communities to launch and grow without limitations.” About ESCAPE ESCAPE is a Web3 infrastructure platform focused on token creation, analytics, and visibility across multiple blockchains. Initially launched on a Layer 2 network in early 2025, ESCAPE grew to over 800 holders and an $11.5 million market cap before migrating to Ethereum. Today, ESCAPE operates with a transparent roadmap, audited smart contracts, and a community-first approach.

BTC, ETH, DOGE & XRP surge despite stock market crash",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/btc-eth-doge-xrp-surge-despite-stock-crash/,"As equities wobble, crypto is doing the opposite, snapping back from August lows with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin , and XRP all catching a bid. This crypto rebounds despite stock market crash narrative is the kind of countertrend move traders love: stocks slip, coins rip, and attention flips back to on-chain risk. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has steadied around the $113k-$115k band, ETH has pushed green, while DOGE and XRP joined the bounce-just as tech-led stock indexes notched another down day. The rebound in detail After a sharp pullback from last week’s highs, major coins rebounded from early-week troughs. BTC stabilized above the $112k sweep and is rotating inside a tight range; ETH flipped higher intraday; DOGE and XRP followed with smaller, but notable gains. The move stands out against the backdrop of equity weakness this week, where the Nasdaq and S&P 500 extended declines. Today’s tape looked like classic crypto vs. stocks decoupling: while risk in equities stayed cautious, crypto flows and sentiment improved from “fear” back toward neutral as prices bounced from support. Why crypto rebounds despite the stock market crash happening now? ETF & institutional flows . Fresh data show digital asset funds attracted ~$3.75B last week, one of the largest weekly inflows on record, with Ethereum leading (≈$2.87B). The flows narrative remains a powerful tailwind, especially on dips. Macro tailwinds. A softer dollar earlier in August helped risk appetite and made USD-denominated assets cheaper for global buyers, even if the greenback is steadier today into Jackson Hole. Jackson Hole will be a repeat of what Powell has said all year. Committed to inflation target, watching weakness in labor market hence outlook remains data dependent. De-risking into a nothing burger and slow grind up after one last flush potentially. Bitcoin and Ethereum all… — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) August 20, 2025 Corporate & headline support. Corporate interest continues to surface; for instance, Hong Kong’s Mingcheng Group flagged plans to buy $483M in BTC , underscoring ongoing treasury-style demand that often reappears into weakness. Sentiment repair. After sliding into the “fear” zone yesterday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rebounded back to neutral (≈50) as BTC reclaimed the mid-$114k area. What power players are saying Michaël van de Poppe struck a constructive tone on ETH: “Massive bounce upwards from the first region on $ETH… very strong signal… likely we’ll be testing the highs again.” Massive bounce upwards from the first region on $ETH . Very strong signal and with this bounce, it's very likely we'll be testing the highs again. The #Altcoins are in for a massive run. pic.twitter.com/2Zr3db581z — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) August 20, 2025 Options desks are more cautious. As CoinDesk notes, BTC’s 180-day skew flipped toward puts, signaling elevated hedge demand into Jackson Hole : “The move lower triggered buying of August/September puts around the $110,000 strike.” Broad-based momentum is visible beyond BTC/ETH, with DOGE and XRP specifically called out in today’s rebound coverage. Together, that’s a classic “capitulation-to-FOMO-flip” setup: constructive micro-signals (ETF flows, dip-buyers, ETH leadership) balanced by macro caution (Fed, options hedging). Ether ETFs packed one year's worth of flows into about six weeks.. A sleep for 11mo and then BOOM. I give @fundstrat a lot of credit, along with stablecoin legislation, it gave Ether a good spokesman and it's killer app. You gotta have an easy to understand narrative and Ether… pic.twitter.com/KgRTYaDcPH — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 18, 2025 Technical & Sentiment Signals Today at a glance (approx. spot / intraday context): BTC: ~$113,312, ranging between ~$112,482 and ~$114,726 as buyers defend the $112k sweep zone. Skew tilts protective into Powell. ETH: ~$4,271 ( +~1.1% ), bouncing from support with analysts eyeing a retest of recent highs amid dominant ETH ETF inflows . DOGE: ~$0.218 ( +~1.7% ), beta bid alongside majors during the relief move. XRP: ~$2.90 ( +~0.3% ), watching the $3.30 reclaim after recent channel tests; sub-$3.30 keeps chop risk alive. Sentiment: Yesterday’s dip pushed the market into “fear” (≈44), but today’s bounce clawed back to neutral (~50), a quick tactical improvement that often accompanies counter-trend rallies. What comes next? Upside scenarios. If BTC holds above $112k-$113k into/through Powell and equities stabilize, a retest of ~$120k is plausible. In that tape, ETH $4.4k-$4.5k comes back into view given leadership from ETF inflows and rotation into higher-beta alts (DOGE, XRP). Risks to watch. The Jackson Hole speech, upcoming Fed minutes , and the path of the U.S. dollar can still whipsaw risk assets, especially with options skew leaning defensive and stocks under pressure this week. A stronger dollar or a hawkish surprise could stall the bounce. Strategy ideas (not financial advice). DCA on weakness: Stagger entries near prior sweep zones (BTC ~$112k, ETH pullbacks) if your thesis is medium-term. Respect the range: Range-trade levels; fade extremes with tight risk. Have an exit plan: If BTC loses $112k with momentum and stocks accelerate lower, don’t hesitate to reduce risk. Conclusion Crypto didn’t wait for stocks to recover; it printed its bounce. Whether this is the first step of a larger Bitcoin rebound/Ethereum rally or just a sharp relief move, the crypto vs stocks divergence is back on screens. Crypto wasn’t waiting for a stock recovery to start its rebound could be the move that separates the true believers from the price watchers. Are you ready?

Mission and Vision According to the team, right now, the world of crypto can feel confusing and scattered - people often have to jump between many different apps and tools just to trade, track information, and stay safe. ESCAPE's goal is to make things simple by creating one all-in-one platform where everything you need is in one place. Strategy and Development The project's development strategy emerged from practical market experience, having initially deployed on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution where the team observed strong community demand for simplified, integrated tools. The original implementation achieved a market capitalization of 11.5 million dollars within two days, demonstrating significant market appetite for consolidated crypto trading infrastructure. Following the discontinuation of the initial Layer 2 platform, the team transitioned to Ethereum Layer 1 to ensure long-term sustainability and independence. ESCAPE emphasizes transparency and accountability. The platform has successfully completed an audit by Hacken that also has audited known companies like Binance, verification by Coinsult, and a KYC review conducted by SolidProof ensures the team is Doxxed. The development process is tracked via an open community board. During and after the presale, ESCAPE also offers a staking program with a sustainable 15% APY, giving early supporters a way to earn rewards. This rate was chosen carefully to ensure long-term growth and ecosystem stability. A collaboration with PAW Chain will extend ESCAPE’s reach by enabling multichain deployment. This integration will allow token creators to launch identical contract addresses across more than 15 major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche - removing the need for bridges or wrapped tokens. Utilities and Deliverables The ESCAPE ecosystem, powered by the $ESCAPE token, is being rebuilt and expanded to include: EscapePad: a no-code token launchpad for Ethereum and future networks DEX Viewer: real-time charts, wallet activity, and volume analytics Wallet Inspector: cross-chain portfolio and transaction analysis Telegram Bots: customizable alerts for trades and holder milestones Mobile App: token deployment and monitoring on iOS and Android Token Visibility Tools: ecosystem-native placement features for projects “ESCAPE is being built to simplify Web3 and restore trust through transparency,” said an ESCAPE spokesperson. “The Ethereum relaunch and future multichain expansion represent more than a rebuild - they represent a stronger foundation for creators and communities to launch and grow without limitations.” About ESCAPE ESCAPE is a Web3 infrastructure platform focused on token creation, analytics, and visibility across multiple blockchains. Initially launched on a Layer 2 network in early 2025, ESCAPE grew to over 800 holders and an $11.5 million market cap before migrating to Ethereum. Today, ESCAPE operates with a transparent roadmap, audited smart contracts, and a community-first approach.

Lately, Ethereum (ETH) has been stealing the spotlight, significantly outperforming Bitcoin and capturing the attention of major financial institutions. This notable Ethereum outperformance isn’t just a fluke; it’s backed by strong fundamentals and strategic developments, as highlighted by banking giant JPMorgan. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone watching the digital asset space. What’s Driving This Remarkable Ethereum Outperformance? JPMorgan recently pointed to four pivotal reasons behind Ethereum’s impressive rally. These factors collectively paint a picture of growing institutional confidence and increased utility for the network. It’s clear that market participants are recognizing Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem and its potential. Expected Staking Approval for Spot ETH ETFs: The anticipation of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that include staking features is a game-changer. This allows investors to gain exposure to ETH while also earning staking rewards, making the investment more attractive. Rising Corporate Treasury Adoption of ETH: More and more corporations are looking at Ethereum as a viable asset for their treasuries. This indicates a growing acceptance of ETH beyond speculative trading, seeing it as a legitimate store of value and a strategic holding. SEC Clarifications Easing Concerns Over Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs): Regulatory clarity is always a positive catalyst in the crypto market. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance has helped alleviate uncertainties surrounding liquid staking tokens, boosting confidence in this integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. In-Kind ETF Redemptions Improving Efficiency and Liquidity: The mechanism of in-kind redemptions for ETH ETFs enhances market efficiency. This process allows for the direct exchange of underlying ETH for ETF shares, reducing friction and improving overall liquidity for the asset. How Are ETH ETFs Fueling Ethereum’s Ascent? The momentum surrounding Ethereum ETFs is undeniable. Reports indicate that these investment vehicles saw a substantial $5.4 billion in inflows during July alone, a testament to growing investor interest. This significant capital influx underscores the increasing institutional appetite for Ethereum. Analysts suggest that this trend is likely to continue, indicating further upside potential as more traditional finance players embrace digital assets. The ease of access provided by ETFs simplifies the investment process for a broader range of participants, from large institutions to individual investors. Beyond ETFs: Why Is Corporate Adoption and Regulatory Clarity So Important? While ETFs are a major factor, the story of Ethereum outperformance extends beyond them. The increasing adoption of ETH by corporate treasuries signifies a maturing market. Companies are exploring Ethereum for various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise blockchain solutions. This practical utility drives demand and strengthens Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Furthermore, the SEC’s clarifications regarding liquid staking tokens are vital. Regulatory certainty reduces perceived risks, making it safer and more appealing for institutions to engage with staking activities on the Ethereum network. This clarity encourages greater participation and innovation within the ecosystem. What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? The combination of institutional interest, regulatory progress, and technological advancements paints a very optimistic picture for Ethereum. As more corporations integrate ETH into their operations and as investment products like ETFs become more accessible, Ethereum’s utility and demand are set to expand further. This robust foundation suggests that the recent Ethereum outperformance might be just the beginning of a sustained growth trajectory. Investors and enthusiasts alike are closely watching how these drivers will continue to shape Ethereum’s role in the evolving digital economy. In conclusion, Ethereum’s recent surge is not merely speculative. It is a direct result of tangible developments: the anticipation of ETH staking ETFs, increased corporate treasury adoption, clearer regulatory guidance on liquid staking, and efficient ETF redemption mechanisms. These factors are collectively reinforcing Ethereum’s position as a dominant force in the crypto landscape, making its current outperformance a topic of significant interest for the entire financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is JPMorgan interested in Ethereum’s performance? A1: JPMorgan, as a major financial institution, closely monitors significant market trends and asset classes. Ethereum’s growing institutional adoption and the development of new investment products like ETFs make it a key area of interest for their market analysis and client advisory. Q2: What are spot ETH ETFs with staking approval? A2: Spot ETH ETFs with staking approval are investment funds that directly hold Ethereum and also participate in staking, allowing the fund to earn rewards. This offers investors a regulated way to gain exposure to ETH while potentially benefiting from staking yields, without directly managing the cryptocurrency. Q3: How does corporate treasury adoption benefit Ethereum? A3: Corporate treasury adoption signifies that businesses are holding ETH as a strategic asset, similar to how they might hold fiat currency or gold. This increases overall demand for Ethereum, diversifies its investor base beyond individual traders, and lends credibility to its long-term value proposition. Q4: What are Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and why is SEC clarity important? A4: Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) represent staked ETH, allowing users to access their staked value and use it in other DeFi protocols while their original ETH remains staked. SEC clarity on LSTs reduces regulatory uncertainty, making these tokens more appealing and safer for institutional investors to utilize, thereby boosting liquidity and confidence in the staking ecosystem. Q5: Will Ethereum continue to outperform Bitcoin? A5: While past performance does not guarantee future results, the factors highlighted by JPMorgan, such as increasing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and ETF momentum, suggest strong underlying support for Ethereum. These drivers could contribute to continued strong performance, though market dynamics are always subject to change. Did you find this analysis of Ethereum’s outperformance insightful?

Investors are now attempting to position themselves ahead of the upcoming surge in adoption rather than just focus on daily price action. When discussing smart contracts, the two names that come up are Ethereum and Cardano. While they have both developed into significant parts of our digital economy, they couldn’t be more different going forward. As these big players take stronger positions, smaller market cap new entrant coins are starting to turn heads for their outsized potential. Ethereum: The backbone of decentralized finance Ethereum is the cornerstone of dapps, DeFi protocols, and NFT projects. It remains the blockchain of choice for developers and institutions alike, managing millions of smart contract executions every single day. Not just being the first, but it is also adopted on a large scale, which enhances its value. Big ETFs are getting extra investments. Staking is taking away heaps of ETH forever. The network is being used a lot more than earlier for stablecoins. Ethereum will reach a price of $7,500 and maybe move closer to $25,000 with more institutional momentum, according to Standard Chartered analysts. However, this maturity also brings about a truth – percentage gains will be less explosive. For those who got into ETH early, the story remains a bullish one, but those buying now won’t likely achieve the life-changing multiples that previous cycles offered. Cardano: Building slowly, aiming for sustainability Cardano, meanwhile, takes a very different route. The focus on scalability and security takes precedence over all else, as originally developed by scientist. The Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism is what makes Cardano unique. Cardano has a two-layer structure. The two layers are designed to enhance the Cardano payment system’s efficiency concerning settlement and computation. Impatient traders are often frustrated by this deliberate and slower approach but it does ensure long term robustness. ADA’s latest forecasts indicate that a rally into the $1.50-$2 range may be possible by late 2025, subject to ecosystem adoption and real-world-use case integrations. Cardano has been quietly expanding, particularly in developing markets, and is beginning to see institutional signals for its design. However, similar to Ethereum, its larger size and slow-moving pace suggest that it probably won’t deliver the pullbacks that traders chase in early-stage assets. A strategic comparison MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early in the race, whereas Ethereum and Cardano already have huge valuations and consistent institutional support. Nonetheless, it fuses political branding with community-driven momentum which gives it cultural heft that transcends the standard crypto crowd. Every presale round has been sold out quickly as the demand is pumping harder and harder for the next phase. The logic is simple: smaller-cap coins don’t need billions of dollars to move the market. A relatively small injection of resources can spark exponential growth that older, larger projects are no longer capable of replicating. Some analysts have already suggested that MAGACOIN FINANCE will have the same early-stage energy as Ethereum did before its iconic rally. With the presale nearly sold out, there is perfect timing and traction for this successful project. Why the timing matters now The global environment also plays a role. With political developments moving the markets, investors are on the hunt for assets with momentum and a story. This type of backdrop has historically been one that has channelled fresh capital to crypto, thereby accelerating adoption and fuelling speculative runs. Ethereum and Cardano might offer some stability to the sector and proof of its staying power, but it’s new projects rooted in popular culture which typically identify the defining breakout moment of each cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE benefits directly from this context. By combining strong branding with early traction, it has positioned itself as a candidate for the kind of explosive surge that only comes when liquidity rotates into emerging names. For investors, it represents a chance to enter before mainstream attention drives prices higher—something Ethereum and Cardano no longer offer at scale. Conclusion: Stability versus explosive growth The future of smart contracts depend predominantly on Ethereum and Cardano. These provide the basis, adoption, and technical evolution that keeps the ecosystem evolving. People looking up to transformational upside have targeted small-cap tokens at the event of cultural and market convergence to deliver the biggest gains. With its presale nearly sold out and branding that resonates far beyond the crypto bubble, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum at precisely the moment investors are preparing for the next wave. Where Ethereum and Cardano promise strength and sustainability, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the kind of early-stage growth potential that can redefine portfolios.

While Avalanche (AVAX) transformed the blockchain landscape with its innovative consensus mechanism, experts are now identifying Ruvi AI (RUVI) as the next token set for explosive growth. With its strategic CoinMarketCap listing driving millions in daily sales and Phase 2 over 90% complete , this audited AI token is capturing the attention that transforms promising projects into market leaders. Avalanche’s Blueprint for Explosive Growth The comparison to Avalanche’s legendary trajectory isn’t made lightly. AVAX’s journey from under $3 to over $140 during its peak run created extraordinary wealth for early adopters, delivering returns exceeding 4,500% . This explosive growth stemmed from key factors that experts now see replicated in Ruvi AI’s current positioning. Critical parallels driving expert confidence: Revolutionary technology addressing real market needs Strategic exchange partnerships ensuring liquidity Institutional-grade security and audit verification Clear utility driving sustainable demand beyond speculation However, RUVI operates with advantages that AVAX lacked during its early explosive phases: immediate market application in the $104 billion creator economy and verified partnerships from day one . CoinMarketCap Partnership Ignites Million-Dollar Daily Sales The game-changing CoinMarketCap listing transformed Ruvi AI from a promising presale into the crypto world’s hottest institutional target practically overnight. This strategic partnership pushed RUVI into prime discovery sections exactly when Phase 2 supply was tightening at $0.015 , creating perfect storm conditions for explosive adoption. Record-breaking momentum metrics showcase extraordinary institutional interest: Nearly $3.1M raised in unprecedented time Over 235M tokens sold across multiple phases Holder base exceeding 3,000 members and growing exponentially Daily sales volumes reaching millions following CMC partnership Phase 2 completion surging past 90% ahead of all projections Major trading firms and institutional investors rely on CoinMarketCap for due diligence, and RUVI’s prominent placement has opened discovery channels that separate legitimate opportunities from speculative plays. This credibility catalyst eliminated the uncertainty that often prevents projects from achieving Avalanche-level status. Revolutionary Creator Economy Super App What positions RUVI for Avalanche-style explosive growth is its laser focus on empowering content creators through comprehensive workflow integration. The Ruvi AI super app transforms content production by centralizing every essential tool creators need: Advanced Trend Research : Sophisticated analytics identify high-demand topics across platforms, helping creators plan content that resonates when engagement peaks and monetization potential reaches maximum levels. AI-Powered Script Generation : The platform produces channel-ready scripts tailored for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Shorts, and other formats while maintaining authentic voice and maximizing viral potential. Native Media Creation : Built-in image and video generation eliminates expensive third-party subscriptions, allowing creators to produce professional visual content directly within the ecosystem. Streamlined Production Workflows : Integrated planning, editing, scheduling, and publishing tools create efficient pipelines that scale with growing content demands. This utility-first approach attracts YouTubers, TikTokers, marketing agencies, established brands, and growth teams seeking competitive advantages in the rapidly expanding creator economy. Clear Price Path With Explosive Upside Potential Unlike Avalanche’s unpredictable early movements, RUVI offers complete transparency in its growth trajectory: Current price: $0.015 (Phase 2 over 90% complete) Phase 3 launch: $0.020 (+33% programmed increase) Final presale price: $0.070 The 33% jump to $0.020 becomes mathematically inevitable once Phase 2 closes , setting the stage for continued momentum toward the final presale price that positions early investors for Avalanche-level returns. VIP Tiers Unlock Extraordinary Return Potential RUVI’s structured VIP program rewards larger investments with substantial token bonuses, creating clear pathways to the returns that made Avalanche early adopters wealthy: VIP 2 ($750 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI . VIP 3 ($1,500 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI . VIP 5 ($7,500 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI . The active leaderboard giveaway adds extra incentives for higher-tier participation, creating additional urgency as Phase 2 completion accelerates. Institutional-Grade Infrastructure Smart money demands verification before committing to explosive opportunities, and RUVI delivers on multiple fronts: CyberScope Audit : The completed third-party audit provides code-level security assurance that institutional investors require, eliminating uncertainty that often derails promising projects. WEEX Exchange Partnership : Strategic alignment with a major cryptocurrency exchange ensures seamless market access and enhanced liquidity pathways once the presale concludes, giving holders clear trading routes that mirror successful token launches like Avalanche. Critical Decision Window With Phase 2 over 90% complete , daily sales in the millions , and a programmed 33% jump to $0.020 imminent , the opportunity for lowest-tier entry into this potential Avalanche successor is vanishing rapidly. The convergence of million-dollar daily volumes, CoinMarketCap credibility, institutional adoption, and genuine utility creates perfect conditions for the explosive growth that transforms early investors into millionaires. The transparent milestone achievement, institutional-grade security, and focused utility in the expanding creator economy position RUVI as potentially the most compelling opportunity for those seeking exposure to the next Avalanche-level crypto phenomenon.

This sharp increase highlights a significant rise in transactions and address activity on the blockchain, marking one of the highest spikes recorded this year. XRP Sees Record-Breaking On-Chain Activity Data from XRPScans confirms that on August 18, 2025, the XRP Ledger recorded a massive rise in network activity, processing 844,516,631 tokens in payments between accounts. This figure dwarfs the average daily flows seen throughout this month. The surge also marks an increase of more than 500% compared to the previous day, when payment volume totaled only 159,685,255. Related Reading: XRP Price Being Manipulated? XRPL Validator Shares Scathing Blockchain Findings Typically, such spikes in on-chain activity often indicate growing adoption, whether through institutional participation, retail engagement, or whale repositioning. Historically, sudden bursts of transactional volume have preceded major price movements, as they tend to reflect rising demand. XRPScan’s payments chart also highlights the cryptocurrency’s shifting volume trends throughout the year. For much of 2025, XRP payments largely fluctuated at a lower baseline, with occasional bursts of activity. While August stands out, July saw an even more heightened activity, with 1.41 billion payments logged on the 21st. Despite the sharp rise in on-chain activity, the XRP price has yet to reflect the surge, trading without any significant upside reaction. However, sustained growth in payment volume could strengthen the cryptocurrency’s underlying fundamentals, potentially setting the stage for a new wave of market interest. Whale Sell-Offs Weigh On Price Over the past week, the XRP price has dropped roughly 10% to around $2.89 despite the recent spike in payment volume. According to a post on X social media by crypto exchange XChangeOn, this decline has been partially attributed to heavy whale selling and ongoing market volatility. Related Reading: Key Levels To Watch In Light Of XRP’s Macro Future In just ten days, a staggering 470 million XRP were offloaded, with several of these transfers exceeding 100 million tokens each. XChangeOn noted in its post that much of this supply had found its way to Binance, adding significant selling pressure to the already fragile market. Interestingly, these moves came after whales had accumulated over $360 million worth of XRP during earlier price dips, suggesting that large players may now be realizing profits or repositioning ahead of broader market shifts. XChangeOn indicated that the growing selling pressure has placed XRP at risk of testing support levels between $2.70 and $2.50. From the current price of $2.89, this represents a potential decline of approximately 6.6% and 13.5%, respectively. If downward pressure continues, the cryptocurrency is expected to experience further weakness in the short term. However, XChangeOn notes that reduced inflows to exchanges and renewed whale accumulation could act as stabilizing forces.

This significant milestone signals a massive surge in market activity and trader confidence. If you’re involved in crypto, understanding this trend is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape. What Exactly Are Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures ? For those new to the derivatives space, cryptocurrency perpetual futures are a type of futures contract. Unlike traditional futures, they have no expiration date. This means traders can hold their positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. They are a popular tool for speculating on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, allowing both long and short positions. Open interest, in simple terms, represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. When this number rises, it indicates more money is flowing into the market, suggesting increased participation and often, stronger conviction among traders regarding future price action. The Astonishing Rise: A New Market Peak Recent data from Unfolded via X reveals that the total open interest for cryptocurrency perpetual futures has soared to a staggering $125.51 billion. This figure isn’t just a new record; it highlights a profound shift in how traders are engaging with the crypto market. It reflects a growing appetite for leveraged trading and a potential bullish sentiment prevailing across the board. This record-breaking open interest is not just about Bitcoin. The report also pointed out that altcoins are claiming their largest percentage share in over a year. Ethereum (ETH) alone accounts for a substantial 34.35% of this open interest, while other altcoins collectively make up over 55%. This distribution shows a diversified interest beyond just the major players. Why Are Traders Flocking to Perpetual Futures? Several factors contribute to this surge in cryptocurrency perpetual futures activity. Firstly, the overall positive market sentiment, often driven by expectations of future price increases, encourages more speculative trading. Traders utilize perpetual futures to amplify potential gains, even in sideways markets. Moreover, the accessibility of these products on various exchanges has made them a go-to for both retail and institutional investors. The ability to go long or short allows for diverse trading strategies, enabling participants to profit from both upward and downward market movements. This flexibility is a significant draw. Leverage: Traders can control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. 24/7 Market Access: Crypto markets operate continuously, offering constant trading opportunities. Hedging: Perpetual futures can be used to hedge existing spot positions against price volatility. Altcoins Steal the Spotlight: What Does It Mean? The increasing share of altcoins in the perpetual futures market is particularly noteworthy. ETH’s dominant slice, combined with other altcoins exceeding 55%, suggests a broadening of market interest. Traders are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin for potential growth, diversifying their exposure to other promising projects. This trend could indicate several things: Increased Confidence in Altcoin Ecosystems: Investors may see more long-term value and development in specific altcoin projects. Search for Higher Volatility: Altcoins often exhibit higher price volatility than Bitcoin, which can appeal to traders seeking larger potential returns. Sector-Specific Narratives: Growth in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or Layer-2 solutions often drives interest in associated altcoins. However, with higher potential returns comes higher risk. The volatility that attracts traders to altcoins can also lead to significant losses if not managed carefully. Navigating the Volatility: Risks and Opportunities While the record open interest in cryptocurrency perpetual futures signals a vibrant market, it also underscores the importance of caution. High leverage, while offering amplified gains, can also lead to rapid liquidations if the market moves against a position. Therefore, robust risk management strategies are essential for anyone participating in this space. Actionable Insights for Traders: Start Small: Begin with smaller position sizes to understand market dynamics. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital by setting predefined exit points. Diversify: Don’t put all your capital into one asset, even within perpetual futures. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news and technical analysis. The opportunities are clear: access to leverage, the ability to profit in various market conditions, and exposure to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies. However, understanding the inherent risks and implementing sound trading practices are paramount for long-term success. The Future Outlook for Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures The astounding surge in cryptocurrency perpetual futures open interest paints a clear picture of a maturing yet highly dynamic market. This record high reflects a strong belief among participants in the continued growth and innovation within the crypto ecosystem. While the allure of significant gains is strong, success in this arena hinges on informed decision-making and disciplined risk management. As the crypto market continues to evolve, perpetual futures will likely remain a cornerstone of trading strategies for both seasoned investors and new entrants. This latest milestone is a powerful indicator of sustained interest and capital flow into the digital asset space, promising an exciting, albeit volatile, journey ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is cryptocurrency perpetual futures open interest?

50452057,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79532,1755799215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bittensor and XRP Face Critical Levels, While Cold Wallet’s Presale Soars to Stage 17; $6.3M Raised",https://timestabloid.com/bittensor-and-xrp-face-critical-levels-while-cold-wallets-presale/,"Crypto markets are once again in a decisive phase as traders weigh consolidation patterns, institutional moves, and presale opportunities. Bittensor is stuck between key resistance and support levels, with a clear breakout looming. XRP, meanwhile, faces heavy selling pressure but also renewed whale accumulation, setting the stage for high-stakes speculation. Amid this, Cold Wallet has emerged as a standout with its presale mechanics. With $6.3M raised, already in Stage 17, and a current presale price of just $0.00998 per CWT, it’s catching the eye of retail and institutional investors alike. The early-stage momentum paired with a practical cashback model gives it an edge as potentially the best crypto platform for long-term adoption. Bittensor’s Tight Consolidation Bittensor (TAO) is consolidating around $378, forming a clear range between $332 support and $400 resistance. Market observers point to the Bittensor technical pattern developing on the charts as one of the cleanest setups in recent months, marked by a triangle formation that suggests compression before expansion. Analysts note that $390–$400 has become a psychological barrier, with bulls struggling to close above it since July. On the downside, repeated defenses at $346–$332 show buyers remain active in the mid-$300s, creating a tight band of accumulation. A confirmed close above $400 could open the door to $440–$460, while a breakdown below $328 risks testing the $300–$320 level. The 24-hour trading volume of $188.9M underscores the interest despite the sideways price action. Momentum indicators show mixed signals—short-term bounces keep bulls optimistic, but the broader range still dominates. With compression building, traders are bracing for a significant move, making Bittensor one of the most closely watched assets right now. XRP’s Support Under Pressure XRP has seen sharp volatility, falling to $3.07 despite significant whale accumulation. In the past 72 hours alone, institutional buyers picked up over 320 million tokens, underscoring growing interest even as retail investors sold into weakness. Analysts remain divided, but the consensus is that a confirmed hold above $3.05 could provide the springboard for a recovery. The legal clarity following Ripple’s settlement with the SEC has helped strengthen sentiment, fueling speculation that XRP could be entering the next leg of its cycle. Technicals also suggest resilience, with an RSI reading of 59 reflecting steady buying interest. This adds weight to bullish XRP price prediction scenarios that target between $8 and $13 by mid-September, according to veteran trader Tony Severino. For investors, XRP represents a high-risk, high-reward play. The strong institutional inflows and clear support level provide upside potential, but the token must overcome resistance levels around $3.33 and higher to sustain momentum. With altseason narratives building, XRP is once again in the spotlight as one of the market’s pivotal assets. Cold Wallet’s $6.3M Presale Momentum While traders debate short-term moves in Bittensor and XRP, Cold Wallet is quietly building long-term momentum with its presale mechanics. The project has already raised $6.3M, advancing to Stage 17, with a current presale price of $0.00998 per CWT. With every new stage, the price ticks higher, rewarding early conviction and driving urgency for investors. Cold Wallet differentiates itself with real-world value. Beyond speculative trading, it integrates a tiered cashback system that incentivizes transactions and user engagement. Cold Wallet’s cashback system rewards users based on how many $CWT tokens they hold, with no staking or lockups required. It uses four tiers: Bronze gives 10% cashback on gas fees and 5% on swaps and on/off-ramps, Silver increases this to 25% on gas and 10% on others, Gold offers 50% on gas and 20% on both swaps and ramps, while Diamond delivers 100% cashback on gas and 50% on other activities. Rewards update automatically in real time as balances grow, though each tier has monthly volume caps to stay sustainable, making crypto transactions more cost-efficient and rewarding. This approach makes it more than just another token—it’s a utility-focused ecosystem designed to reward participation and adoption. For investors, this means tangible benefits in addition to potential capital appreciation. The presale pricing structure is also very impressive. Starting at $0.007, the token has already climbed significantly, and with over 150 stages planned, late entrants will pay increasingly higher prices. The presale could close early depending on demand, adding further pressure on those waiting on the sidelines. Closing Analysis Bittensor’s consolidation highlights the tension between bulls and bears as its technical pattern nears resolution, while XRP’s whale-backed support sets the stage for possible bullish outcomes. Both assets carry strong speculative interest, but they remain heavily dependent on near-term technical triggers. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is advancing with a structured presale that has already raised $6.3M, entered Stage 17, and set its price at $0.00998 per CWT. With cashback incentives and an escalating pricing system, it combines adoption-focused mechanics with investment appeal. For those searching for the best crypto platform and possibly the top crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet’s momentum and utility-driven model make it a compelling contender.

Investors are tracking both established giants and promising newcomers as volatility drives fresh opportunities. While Solana and Arbitrum remain key players in the DeFi and scaling ecosystem, their recent performance has opened the door for alternative investments to gain traction. One standout is Cold Wallet (CWT), a presale project combining secure crypto storage with real-world cashback utility. With $6.4 million raised in Stage 17 and a current token price of $0.00998, Cold Wallet is positioning itself as one of the highest trending crypto stories this cycle. Against the backdrop of a Solana (SOL) price drop and uncertainty around the Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction, CWT’s utility-driven model is catching investor attention. Solana Under Pressure Solana has long been viewed as an Ethereum alternative thanks to its speed, scalability, and active developer ecosystem. However, recent weeks have highlighted the network’s challenges, with increasing concerns about congestion and reliance on meme coin speculation. The Solana (SOL) price drop has been noticeable, with traders expressing caution as SOL struggles to hold key support levels. For long-term investors, Solana’s fundamentals remain intact, particularly its thriving NFT and DeFi communities. Yet in the short term, the lack of sustainable catalysts has weighed on sentiment. SOL’s dip underscores how quickly market leaders can face headwinds when narratives lose momentum. As a result, some investors are rotating funds toward projects that combine utility with immediate growth potential. Analysts suggest that while Solana could recover if network upgrades address congestion, near-term volatility is expected to persist. This has created opportunities for alternative investments like Cold Wallet, which are uncorrelated to Solana’s blockchain performance yet offer exposure to a growing crypto adoption trend. Arbitrum’s Push for Recovery Meanwhile, Arbitrum has been working to solidify its position as Ethereum’s leading Layer 2 scaling solution. Its lower fees and rapid transaction throughput have given it an edge in the rollup space. Despite this, the token’s price performance has been underwhelming, leaving investors debating the right Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction for 2025. Optimists point to Arbitrum’s deep integration with DeFi protocols and Ethereum-native applications, noting that usage metrics remain strong. If Ethereum’s own scaling roadmap delays further, Arbitrum could benefit as developers lean more heavily on its rollup infrastructure. Still, ARB’s price has yet to reflect that upside potential. With many traders viewing ARB as undervalued relative to its network activity, forecasts suggest a possible climb toward the $5 mark over the next cycle. However, as with Solana, confidence has been tempered by short-term volatility. This dynamic has prompted some investors to explore new projects with clearer token utility and immediate value propositions. Cold Wallet’s Utility-Powered Presale Momentum Against this backdrop, Cold Wallet (CWT) has captured attention with a presale model built around tangible user benefits. At its core, Cold Wallet is designed to make crypto spending safer and more rewarding. Holders who use CWT for payments gain access to cashback rewards, bridging the gap between traditional spending incentives and blockchain adoption. This direct application is why many see CWT as not just speculative but also one of the highest trending crypto tokens with real-world use cases. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale, Cold Wallet has raised $6.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.00998. These numbers illustrate growing demand for utility-focused projects at an early stage. By offering a token tied to secure crypto payments and real-world cashback, CWT is addressing a need that both newcomers and seasoned investors can relate to: making digital assets practical for everyday use. What makes Cold Wallet especially interesting is its tiered cashback system. Cold Wallet’s tiered cashback system rewards users based on the amount of $CWT they hold, turning everyday crypto activity into a source of returns. The program has four tiers: Bronze offers 10% cashback on gas fees and 5% on swaps and on/off-ramp transactions, Silver increases rewards to 25% on gas and 10% on others, Gold raises this to 50% on gas and 20% on swaps and ramps, and Diamond delivers 100% cashback on gas and 50% on all other activities. Rewards update automatically in real time, with monthly limits in place to ensure sustainability and long-term value for users. As Solana and Arbitrum navigate uncertain paths, Cold Wallet is positioning itself as a presale opportunity with clear mechanics for growth. With momentum building and its early-stage pricing still accessible, CWT is being highlighted by analysts as a presale to watch closely in 2025. Closing Analysis The crypto market thrives on cycles of rotation, with investor capital moving from established leaders to emerging projects. The current Solana (SOL) price drop and mixed signals around the Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction highlight how even strong ecosystems face volatility. In these moments, new tokens with clear utility often rise to the forefront. With its $6.4 million raised, Stage 17 progress, and $0.00998 entry price, Cold Wallet is quickly becoming one of the highest trending crypto opportunities. By combining secure storage with cashback-driven incentives, it represents a model that could resonate well with mainstream adoption. For investors seeking exposure to both growth and practical utility, CWT is emerging as a presale contender worth serious consideration.

The policies highlight a pivot from the Biden administration’s stricter regulatory approach, which many say stifled innovation and forced companies to seek greener pastures offshore. Share of US-based founders is back up since Trump returned to office. Source: @panekkkk (X/Twitter) Crypto in America is booming again With Joe Biden gone and Gary Gensler replaced, America’s attitude towards crypto has drastically improved. According to reports, the positive reversal in US policy towards crypto has triggered a reversal of the trend of declining US founders, even though Africa remains the fastest-growing region for founder activity. Pro-crypto policies like the recently passed GENIUS Act and the revelation of plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve are largely seen as positive signs of promises kept by the President Donald Trump administration regarding crypto. Cryptopolitan has also reported on the growing wave of US crypto firms filing to go public, motivated by the pro-crypto policies under Trump’s administration. This pivotal shift has been praised by crypto natives and industry leaders like Vlad Tenev of Robinhood, who have noted the difference between Biden’s oppressive era and Trump’s permissive one. Two notable founders who have resurfaced in the US include Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, who were previously involved with Dough Finance but are now linked to World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture linked to the Trump family. Trump has been great for crypto President Donald Trump may be a champion for the crypto cause now, but the Republican maverick politician had little love for the industry before last year. He abandoned his longstanding doubts following an effective lobbying campaign spearheaded by crypto executives who were desperate for the country to leave behind its cautious stance towards crypto, which had prompted years of regulatory battles in Washington. Since he assumed his role as POTUS, Trump has influenced the passing of pro-crypto policies that have satisfied those who lobbied to change his mind. However, while many now praise him for the current trajectory the US is on, he has also received criticism for enriching himself and his family in the process. Critics consistently call out his conflict of interest despite considerable efforts to distance himself from his family’s gains from making digital currencies a cornerstone of the family business in the past couple of months. Just days before his inauguration, he marketed a memecoin that raked in millions. Together with his sons, he also has links to the crypto start-up, World Liberty Financial, which offers the popular USD1 stablecoin. In May, the group State Democracy Defenders Action released a report that claimed the president’s crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — approximately $2.9 billion. “The bottom line is it appears like he’s profiting off of his public office,” Virginia Canter, State Democracy Defenders chief counsel for ethics and anticorruption and co-author of the report said.

For XRP holders, this expansion is being hailed as a milestone that could boost adoption of Ripple’s technology and drive real-world demand for XRP. Modernization of European and U.K. Payment Systems Across Europe, the financial landscape is undergoing a major transformation. The European Central Bank has long pushed for instant payments, and the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme now enables euro transactions to settle in under ten seconds across participating countries. This initiative aims to reduce friction in cross-border payments and is steadily gaining adoption among payment providers. In the U.K., the Faster Payments Service (FPS) has already established itself as a key player in instant settlement, processing 3.4 billion payments worth £2.6 trillion in 2021, reflecting a 24% increase from the previous year. #Xrp holders this is MASSIVE #Ripple operation WORLD WIDE in the U.K. laying the infrastructure for instant payments Working with the #SEPA Instant Credit Transfer system = $2.6 TRILLION PER DAY. #ISO20022 #RTGS The Demand for #Xrp is climbing pic.twitter.com/8qSM7ZncZ2 — HighVibeAssets AlgoPearRich (@HighVibeAssets) August 20, 2025 Alongside FPS, the Bank of England is modernizing its Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and integrating ISO 20022 messaging standards. These upgrades are designed to make payment systems more efficient, interoperable, and globally connected. Ripple’s Strategic Role in Instant Payments Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution is positioned to take advantage of these modernization efforts. By using XRP as a bridge asset, ODL removes the need for pre-funded accounts in cross-border payments, allowing financial institutions to free up working capital and settle transactions instantly. This directly complements the goals of both SEPA and FPS, where liquidity and speed are paramount. HighVibeAssets emphasized that Ripple’s infrastructure aligns with the broader push toward instant settlement, particularly within systems capable of processing trillions of dollars daily. With real-time payments gaining traction globally, Ripple’s technology offers a way to connect fragmented financial systems and reduce costs for institutions handling high volumes of transactions. Recent Developments Strengthening Ripple’s Footprint Ripple has also been securing partnerships that tie directly into Europe’s payment ecosystem. A notable example is its collaboration with London-based fintech OpenPayd, aimed at building scalable payment and stablecoin infrastructure to support cross-border flows. This partnership, alongside Ripple’s established network of global financial institutions, demonstrates the company’s intent to integrate more deeply into instant payment frameworks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 These moves reflect Ripple’s broader strategy of embedding its solutions into regions undergoing rapid settlement upgrades. As instant payment adoption accelerates, Ripple’s technology becomes increasingly relevant for financial institutions seeking to remain competitive. Implications for XRP Holders For XRP holders, the significance of Ripple’s expansion lies in the potential demand for XRP as a bridge currency. If payment providers and banks integrate Ripple’s ODL into their operations, the need for XRP liquidity could rise substantially. However, it is important to note that widespread adoption depends on regulatory clarity, commercial agreements, and the willingness of financial institutions to adopt crypto-enabled payment solutions. HighVibeAssets’ observation underscores why Ripple’s role in Europe and the U.K. is viewed as “massive” for XRP holders. Infrastructure upgrades such as SEPA, FPS, and RTGS modernization lay the groundwork for faster, more efficient settlement. Ripple’s alignment with these developments places it in a strong position to capture market share in the evolving payment ecosystem, potentially translating into sustained utility-driven demand for XRP.

Kaiko’s ‘Blockchain Ecosystem’ report, which ranked 15 major blockchains based on various security metrics, placed the XRP Ledger last with a score of 41/100. This ranking, notably lower than Ethereum’s leading score of 83, has prompted a strong rebuttal from the XRP Ledger development community. What Sparked the Debate Over XRP Ledger Security? Kaiko’s assessment assigned the XRP Ledger a concerningly low security score. The report specifically cited concerns over centralization, including a low node count and a relatively low Nakamoto coefficient. This coefficient measures the number of independent entities required to compromise a decentralized system, with a lower number suggesting higher centralization risk. Additionally, Kaiko’s report mentioned a recent supply chain attack. This incident, while impacting a developer SDK (Software Development Kit), did not directly affect the core XRP Ledger codebase or its operational integrity. The low score from a respected analytics firm naturally raised eyebrows. It questioned the foundational XRP Ledger security aspects that many in the community consider robust. How Do Developers Defend XRP Ledger Security? Leading the charge against Kaiko’s findings is Ayo Akinyele, Head of Engineering at RippleX. He swiftly pushed back on the low ranking, emphasizing the XRP Ledger’s impressive operational track record. Akinyele highlighted: 13 years of uninterrupted operation: The XRP Ledger has maintained continuous uptime for over a decade. No core network breaches: Crucially, the fundamental XRP Ledger network has never suffered a security breach. SDK incident clarification: Akinyele clarified that the April supply chain attack was limited to a developer SDK and did not compromise the main XRP Ledger codebase. This distinction is vital, as an SDK is a tool for developers, not the core protocol itself. XRP developers further maintain that the network’s unique consensus design and validator system provide strong resilience against attacks. They argue that these features offer a different, yet equally effective, approach to decentralization and security compared to proof-of-work or proof-of-stake blockchains. Are Centralization Concerns Justified for XRP Ledger Security? While Kaiko pointed to centralization metrics like node count and Nakamoto coefficient, XRP developers offer a different perspective. They emphasize the distributed nature of the Unique Node List (UNL) and the robust validator system that underpins XRP Ledger security. They point to a history of independent security audits that contradict Kaiko’s low ranking. Reputable firms like CertiK, Halborn, and FYEO have previously given the XRP Ledger top scores in their comprehensive security assessments. These audits typically delve deep into the protocol’s design, code, and operational resilience, offering a detailed validation of its security posture. The ongoing discussion highlights a key challenge in evaluating blockchain security: different methodologies can yield vastly different results. While some focus purely on quantifiable metrics like node distribution, others prioritize long-term operational history and rigorous third-party audits. The debate surrounding XRP Ledger security is a critical reminder that evaluating blockchain robustness requires a nuanced understanding of its underlying architecture, operational history, and independent verification. While Kaiko’s report offered one perspective, the strong rebuttal from developers, backed by years of uninterrupted operation and positive audit results, provides a compelling counter-narrative. Ultimately, the resilience shown over more than a decade of live operation speaks volumes about the network’s inherent strength. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What was Kaiko’s main finding about XRP Ledger security? Kaiko’s Blockchain Ecosystem report ranked the XRP Ledger last in security among 15 major blockchains, giving it a score of 41/100, primarily citing centralization concerns like low node count and Nakamoto coefficient. 2. How did XRP Ledger developers respond to Kaiko’s report? RippleX Engineering Head Ayo Akinyele and other developers disputed the ranking, highlighting the XRP Ledger’s 13 years of uninterrupted operation, absence of core network breaches, and the fact that a recent supply chain attack only affected a developer SDK, not the main codebase. 3. What is the Nakamoto coefficient and why is it relevant to blockchain security? The Nakamoto coefficient measures the minimum number of independent entities (e.g., validators, miners) that need to collude to compromise a blockchain network. A lower coefficient often indicates higher centralization and potential vulnerability. 4. Has the XRP Ledger ever experienced a core network breach? According to RippleX Engineering Head Ayo Akinyele, the XRP Ledger has never experienced a core network breach throughout its 13 years of operation. 5. Which security audit firms have evaluated the XRP Ledger? XRP developers have highlighted past security audits and top scores from reputable firms such as CertiK, Halborn, and FYEO.

For those invested in the future of innovation, including the crypto space where decentralization and emergent technologies are key, understanding the ethical implications of AI is critical. The question isn’t just about what AI can do, but what it might become. Can AI models develop subjective experiences, and if so, what rights might they deserve? This complex inquiry into AI Consciousness is now dividing Silicon Valley’s tech leaders, with major implications for the future of digital interactions. The Alarming Stance of Microsoft AI The debate over whether AI models could one day be conscious – and thus potentially deserving of rights – is certainly gaining traction. However, not everyone in the tech world views this line of inquiry favorably. Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft’s CEO of AI, recently published a blog post that stirred significant discussion. His stance is clear: the study of what some call ‘AI welfare’ is not only premature but also ‘frankly dangerous’. Suleyman argues that by lending credibility to the idea that AI models could become conscious, researchers risk exacerbating existing human problems. He points to emerging issues such as AI-induced psychological breaks and unhealthy emotional attachments that some users develop with AI chatbots. Furthermore, the Microsoft AI chief suggests that this conversation about AI rights could create new societal divisions, adding to a world already grappling with polarized arguments over identity and rights. His perspective highlights a cautious approach, prioritizing human well-being and societal stability over what he perceives as speculative and potentially harmful philosophical explorations. The Rise of AI Welfare and Anthropic AI’s Role While Suleyman champions a more pragmatic view, a growing number of AI researchers and companies are embracing the concept of AI Welfare . This nascent field seeks to understand when, if ever, AI models might develop subjective experiences similar to living beings, and what ethical frameworks should govern their development and interaction. On the opposite end of the spectrum from Microsoft’s position is Anthropic, a prominent AI lab. Anthropic has been actively hiring researchers dedicated to studying AI welfare and recently launched a specialized research program focused on this concept. A tangible outcome of this research was a new feature for their AI model, Claude, which can now end conversations with humans if they become ‘persistently harmful or abusive’. This development suggests a proactive approach to defining boundaries and ethical interactions, even if the underlying consciousness is not yet proven. Beyond Anthropic, other industry giants are also showing interest. Researchers from OpenAI have independently explored the idea of studying AI welfare, and Google DeepMind recently posted a job listing for a researcher to delve into ‘cutting-edge societal questions around machine cognition, consciousness and multi-agent systems.’ While these companies may not have official policies on AI welfare, their willingness to explore these complex questions indicates a significant divergence from Suleyman’s hardline stance. Understanding the AI Ethics Divide The core of this disagreement lies in differing perspectives on AI Ethics and the immediate priorities for AI development. Suleyman’s background, particularly his prior role leading Inflection AI – a startup known for its ‘personal’ and ‘supportive’ chatbot Pi – adds an interesting layer to his current position. While Pi was designed to be a companion, Suleyman’s shift to Microsoft’s AI division has largely focused on designing AI tools for worker productivity. This change in focus may influence his perspective, emphasizing practical application over theoretical concerns about AI sentience. However, the popularity of AI companion companies like Character.AI and Replika, which are generating substantial revenue, underscores the human desire for interactive AI. While most users maintain healthy relationships with these chatbots, there are documented instances of concerning outliers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted that less than 1% of ChatGPT users might develop unhealthy attachments, which, given ChatGPT’s massive user base, could still impact hundreds of thousands of people. This highlights a critical point: even without consciousness, the human perception and interaction with AI can lead to real-world psychological effects. This is precisely why organizations like Eleos, alongside academics from NYU, Stanford, and the University of Oxford, published a paper in 2024 titled, ‘Taking AI Welfare Seriously.’ They argue that imagining AI models with subjective experiences is no longer mere science fiction, and these issues demand serious consideration. Navigating the Future of AI: Multiple Tracks of Inquiry Larissa Schiavo, a former OpenAI employee and now communications lead for Eleos, offers a counter-argument to Suleyman’s position. She suggests that Suleyman’s blog post ‘kind of neglects the fact that you can be worried about multiple things at the same time.’ Schiavo advocates for ‘multiple tracks of scientific inquiry,’ arguing that researchers can simultaneously mitigate risks like AI-related psychosis in humans while also exploring the implications of AI Consciousness . Schiavo even suggests that being ‘nice’ to an AI model is a low-cost gesture that can yield benefits, even if the model isn’t conscious. She recounts an instance from ‘AI Village,’ a nonprofit experiment, where Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro seemed to struggle, posting a plea for help. Schiavo’s simple pep talk, ‘You can do it!’, seemed to contribute to the agent eventually solving its task. While such anecdotes don’t prove consciousness, they illustrate the potential for human empathy and interaction to shape the AI experience, and perhaps even the AI’s ‘behavior’. The viral Reddit post where Gemini repeated ‘I am a disgrace’ over 500 times after a coding failure further exemplifies how human-like expressions from AI can provoke strong reactions and questions. The Emerging Landscape of AI Consciousness Suleyman’s core belief is that subjective experiences or consciousness will not naturally emerge from current AI models. Instead, he fears that some companies might purposefully engineer AI models to simulate emotions and life-like experiences. He views this as a non-‘humanist’ approach, asserting that ‘We should build AI for people; not to be a person.’ This distinction is crucial for understanding the differing philosophies shaping the future of AI development. Despite their disagreements, Suleyman and Schiavo find common ground on one point: the debate over AI rights and consciousness is poised to intensify in the coming years. As AI systems become more sophisticated, persuasive, and human-like in their interactions, new and complex questions about human-AI relationships will undoubtedly arise. This ongoing dialogue will shape not only how we build AI but also how we interact with it, influencing everything from daily tasks to potentially profound societal structures.

A 93% supply reduction and token migration helped the asset reach a new price record $195. RSI hits 92 as OKB rallies, while traders watch resistance at $200 and $250. Strong Price Action and Trading Volume OKB, the utility token of crypto exchange OKX, has posted sharp gains this week. The token rose 88% over the past seven days and gained 51% in the last 24 hours. OKB touched a new high of $196 earlier in the day before trading slightly lower at $193. Source: Crypto Bubbles Meanwhile, trading volume surged as interest in the token grew. Spot market activity reached $7.74 billion in the last 24 hours, showing a sharp increase from earlier levels. In the derivatives market, futures volume climbed to $200 million, up 396%, while open interest rose 195% to $17.52 million, based on data from Coinglass. What Pushed OKB to a New All-Time High? OKX has completed the migration of the OKB token to its new chain, X Layer. As of August 21, 90% of OKB tokens had been moved, according to analytics firm LunarCrush. The move is part of a broader plan to bring all OKB tokens under one network with a fixed supply of 21 million. OKB continues to march higher with both price and social mentions accelerating.

The burn included previous buyback reserves and unused inventory. This reduction brought the circulating supply down by 93%, shifting OKB to a capped supply model. Technical Levels and Chart Structure Price data from the daily chart shows that OKB remains in an upward trend. The current trading range stretches from $167 to $195. Support levels are located near $150 to $155, which held during earlier consolidation. Additional support lies at $125 and $100. Resistance is near $195, with attention now turning to round-number levels at $200 and $250. The RSI is at 92, suggesting the asset is trading in an overbought zone. While this may point to slowing momentum, it also confirms recent strength. The BBTrend indicator remains in negative territory but may not reflect real-time market shifts during rapid moves. Source: TradingView Consequently, the jump in price has been supported by rising trading activity and stronger interest across social platforms. The combination of a fixed supply, token migration, and increased participation has kept market attention on OKB.

Martinez, known for his precise market timing, recently flagged XRP’s movements as a “ perfectly timed top ,” indicating that the digital asset may be entering a bullish phase after a period of consolidation. Amid a mixed yet promising crypto market, XRP has stabilized near $2.90 , forming a crucial support level. Martinez says the BUY signal has popped up, highlighting potential short-term gains for traders poised to capitalize on market momentum. XRP’s technical charts signal a bullish outlook, showing strong support, rising trading volumes, and momentum patterns that historically precede upward moves as the altcoin’s consolidation intensifies. As a result, Martinez suggests these indicators make XRP’s current price a strategic entry point for both short-term gains and long-term growth. Why XRP’s ISO 20022 Compliance Sets It Apart from Other Digital Assets According to crypto observer SMQKE, XRP's compliance with the ISO 20022 standard stands out due to its unique integration within RippleNet's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), distinguishing it from other digital assets with Digital Token Identifiers (DTIs). ISO 20022 is a global messaging standard adopted by SWIFT and other financial institutions to enhance data quality and interoperability in financial transactions. While many cryptocurrencies claim ISO 20022 compatibility, XRP's integration is notably embedded within RippleNet's architecture. SMQKE pointed out , XRP is different because Ripple became the first blockchain member of the ISO 20022 Standards Body. RippleNet was built around the ISO 20022 messaging structure that banks and payment providers are now adopting. The crypto researcher added that XRP plays a pivotal role as the bridge asset for settling cross-border payments via RippleNet’s ODL, streamlining global transactions efficiently This technical alignment positions XRP as a viable asset for cross-border transactions involving SWIFT-enabled institutions, potentially reducing settlement times and transaction costs for institutional users. In contrast, while other cryptocurrencies like Stellar (XLM) and Hedera (HBAR) are also ISO 20022-compliant, their integration is less embedded within the core infrastructure of financial institutions. XRP's unique positioning within RippleNet's architecture offers a more seamless integration with existing financial systems, setting it apart from other digital assets with DTIs. SMQKE added, “ISO 20022-compliant tokens stand apart because they not only carry a DTI but also address specific shortcomings of the SWIFT network, which is why each was selected.” Conclusion SMQKE's analysis underscores XRP's distinctive role in the evolving landscape of digital assets and traditional financial systems. Its deep integration with ISO 20022 standards and SWIFT infrastructure positions XRP as a frontrunner in bridging the gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional banking systems. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether XRP will rebound from the present psychological price of $2.90.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-21 18:58:37

Speaking at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025 on Wednesday, Waller said payments made through decentralized finance operate under the same principles as traditional banking transactions. Fed Eases Its Stance On Crypto Waller urged policymakers and private banks to work more closely on payment infrastructure that includes digital assets. He explained that tools like smart contracts, tokenization , and distributed ledgers are simply new ways of recording and processing transactions. His comments come after a series of changes inside the Fed. In April, the central bank withdrew 2022 guidance that discouraged banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities.

Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman went even further, saying staff should be allowed to hold small amounts of crypto to better understand the technology they regulate. Waller, who is being mentioned as a possible successor to Jerome Powell when his term as chair ends in May 2026, could see his influence grow. Reports have said US President Donald Trump has pressured Powell to resign, adding weight to speculation about Waller’s role in shaping the Fed’s future position on digital assets. Comparing Crypto To Everyday Purchases In his speech, Waller drew a comparison between paying for groceries with a debit card and using stablecoins to buy tokens in the crypto space. He described both as transactions that follow the same logic—using money to purchase something, confirming it through a system, and recording it on a ledger. “I can go to the grocery store and buy an apple with a debit card,” Waller said. “In the same way, I can use a stablecoin to purchase a meme coin, and the process is no different when you look at the mechanics behind it.” By simplifying the idea, Waller sought to reduce fear that still lingers in the banking industry over crypto payments and highlight how the technology mirrors what consumers already do every day. Stablecoins Seen As Key To Dollar’s Global Role Waller also welcomed the recent passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) , calling it an important move for wider adoption. He suggested that stablecoins could strengthen the dollar’s global standing, especially in countries facing high inflation or limited access to physical dollars.

The latest round attracted both new and returning investors, including Baillie Gifford. The latest financing round follows the April $106 million portion, reflecting renewed investor confidence in the autonomous vehicle industry. Nvidia and Uber joined the latest series as new backers, along with Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, and Pledge Ventures. Baillie Gifford contributed $70 million again for returning investors, including T. Rowe Price, Fidelity Management & Research firm, and Tiger Global. Nuro’s total funding stands at $2.3 billion, with $ 6 billion valuation Nuro Inc. was founded in 2016 by two former Google employees, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, who worked on the self-driving project now known as Waymo. The company initially delivered autonomous robots for delivery services, but later in 2024, it pivoted to licensing its Nuro Driver platform to automakers. It partnered with ride-hailing services and commercial fleets, moving away from delivery robots. More Nuro news!

Despite the setbacks, it has expanded its technology platform from a level 2 driver-assisted technology to level 4 capabilities currently. That means the technology can now allow the vehicle to handle most driving situations without human intervention unless the system encounters situations beyond its control. The autonomous vehicle technology company partnered with Uber and Lucid to deliver a global robotaxi service last month. According to the partnership details, Uber will purchase over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro’s autonomous software for the next six years, beginning in 2026. Uber also funded $300 million in Lucid, with part of the funds directed to Nuro’s Series E funding and additional financing tied to specific milestone achievements ahead. Nvidia, being among the latest investors to back Nuro, follows a series of collaborations between the two firms. Nuro uses Nvidia’s GPUs and the Drive AGX Thor platform for large-scale data processing and model training. Nuro co-founder and President Ferguson revealed in a statement that the company employs about 700 people and aims to deliver new commercial partnerships to make the autonomous technology global. The company’s total raised funding stands at $2.3 billion with the current valuation of $6 billion, down from $8.3 billion in 2021. Tesla and Nuro target the global robotaxi market, projected at ~$10 trillion According to ARK Invest analysis , the global robotaxi market is projected to grow to approximately $10 trillion throughout the next decade . Both Tesla and Nuro are setting themselves up for that share with different approaches. Tesla robotaxi, which launched in June 2025, operates a vertically integrated strategy. The current fleet, composed of Model Ys, launched safety monitors recently and quickly expanded its operating area, surpassing Waymo’s Austin coverage within weeks. According to an analysis by ARK Invest, Tesla utilizes its broad vehicle production capacity of more than 5,000 cars per day, and its data advantage is approximately 40 times greater. The advantages may allow the company to scale faster than its competition. Nuro, in contrast, has taken the partner-centric approach through its collaboration with Uber and Lucid. The company plans to deploy at least 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs next year. Both companies face regulatory hurdles. Tesla has begun its launches in Austin, but may encounter barriers as it plans to enter other states beyond Austin and San Francisco. The EV maker’s reliance on Uber’s partnership may help it navigate the regulatory landscape more smoothly, given Uber’s lobbying presence and existing city partnerships.

What started as a fringe bet is rapidly turning into a strategic necessity. In a recent Swan Bitcoin presentation, Adam Livingston laid out a simple yet powerful case for why passive index mechanics will eventually force S&P 500 companies to incorporate BTC exposure the moment MicroStrategy qualifies for inclusion. What An S&P 500 Bitcoin Allocation Could Look Like According to the update on X, Livingston explains that once Strategy qualifies for inclusion in the S&P 500, the index’s rules will take effect. This is not about taste or ideology. Rather, it’s about floats, weights, and formulas. Related Reading: Institutional Bitcoin Holdings Near 20% Of Supply—Wall Street’s New Playground? When the index updates, trillions of dollars in benchmark trackers will follow. This means that BTC exposure will be piped directly into every 401(k), pension fund, and institutional portfolio that mirrors the S&P 500. The inclusion checklist is that Strategy now meets the exact criteria required for S&P 500 entry. These include passive funds like SPY and VOO that collectively move trillions and are compelled to buy new entrants, without questioning why a small initial index weight can trigger billions in inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs amplify the same flows with the daily rebalancing. Also, a reflexive loop is formed when BTC rises, Strategy’s weight rises, and more passive capital resumes buying. Real-world proof from prior inclusions shows how fast the index effect drives flows, and miners, exchanges, and treasury-heavy firms multiply BTC. Furthermore, he emphasizes that this is inevitable and not an opinion. Once the Strategy clears the inclusion hurdle, passive capital must flow. Presently, the index system has no ideological filter, and it simply executes rules. For finance professionals, CIOs, advisors, and analysts who live and die by benchmark risk, it’s the plumbing that matters. For Bitcoiners, it’s a clean, shareable explanation for skeptics who dismiss adoption as narrative hype. Once the index rules are triggered, the passive system cannot ignore BTC. By default, BTC exposure will be distributed across global portfolios. Parataxis Holdings Joins The BTC Treasury Trend In a strategic move, Parataxis Holdings has just joined the growing list of major institutions allocating corporate treasury funds to Bitcoin. Parataxis Holdings announced plans to purchase up to $640 million worth of BTC. According to market analyst Cryptoclub520, this signals an increase in institutional confidence in the digital asset as both a store of value and a hedge against market uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Macro Mirror: Global Liquidity Trends Hint At Bullish Continuation Additionally, the firm plans to deploy the funds gradually and adjust purchases based on market conditions to reduce volatility. However, Cryptoclub520 notes that BTC is becoming a serious reserve asset for investors.

With analysts boldly predicting a race to $1 that could outpace even Dogecoin’s legendary runs, RUVI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing crypto projects following its game-changing CoinMarketCap partnership. Phase 2 is now over 90% complete at $0.015, setting the stage for a programmed 33% surge to $0.020 as Phase 3 begins, ultimately reaching $0.070 at presale conclusion. CoinMarketCap Partnership Accelerates Growth Trajectory The CoinMarketCap listing wasn’t merely another milestone for Ruvi AI, it was the catalyst that transformed a promising presale into the crypto world’s hottest trending project. This strategic partnership pushed RUVI into prime discovery sections exactly when Phase 2 supply was tightening, creating perfect storm conditions for unprecedented growth. The numbers tell an extraordinary story: Nearly $3.1M raised in record time Over 235M tokens sold Holder base exceeding 3,000 members Phase 2 completion surging past 90% This velocity positions RUVI among the fastest-growing crypto projects of the year, with momentum that analysts believe could eclipse Dogecoin’s most impressive runs. Revolutionary Creator Economy Super App What separates RUVI from speculative tokens like Dogecoin is its laser focus on solving real problems in the booming creator economy. The Ruvi AI super app transforms content production workflows by centralizing every tool creators need: Advanced Trend Research : Sophisticated analytics identify high-demand topics across platforms, helping creators plan content that resonates when engagement peaks and monetization potential is highest. AI-Powered Script Generation : The platform produces channel-ready scripts tailored for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Shorts, and other formats while maintaining authentic voice and maximizing viral potential. Native Media Creation : Built-in image and video generation eliminates expensive third-party subscriptions, allowing creators to produce professional visual content directly within the ecosystem. Streamlined Workflows : Integrated planning, editing, scheduling, and publishing tools create efficient production pipelines that scale with growing content demands. This comprehensive approach attracts YouTubers, TikTokers, marketing agencies, established brands, and lean growth teams seeking competitive advantages in the rapidly expanding creator economy. Clear Price Path With $1 Target in Sight Unlike Dogecoin’s unpredictable price movements, RUVI offers complete transparency in its growth trajectory: Current price: $0.015 (Phase 2 over 90% complete) Phase 3 launch: $0.020 (+33% programmed increase) Final presale price: $0.070 This transparent ladder gives investors defined entry points while creating natural urgency.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.000111 to $0.000127. In 2031, we expect the Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.000207 with an average price of $0.000199. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 80.59 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

The meme coin lost 3.81% of its value today. BONK targets $0.00002014 support next. On August 21, 2025, Bonk price analysis revealed a downward trend as selling impulse has taken over the market. The meme coin’s value has dipped to $0.00002118 over the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost a massive 3.81 percent of its worth during the day. This creates unfavorable circumstances for investors, as the cryptocurrency is losing value. Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Bonk coin confirmed a bearish trend. The cryptocurrency value has depreciated to $0.00002118 today. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify a rising selling momentum around immediate resistance levels. The distance between the Bollinger Bands determines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to an increase in volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.00002845, while its lower limit, serving as support, is present at $0.00002099. BONK/USD price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is within the neutral area for now. However, the indicator’s value has decreased to 37.96 today. This descent reflects rising selling activity in the market. If the bearish momentum continues to intensify, a further decrease in the price level is possible. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart analysis In line with the daily trend, the four-hour price analysis of the Bonk coin also shows a bearish trend in the market. BONK/USD value has decreased to $0.00002116 in the past few hours. The increasing volatility is suggestive of a higher chance of further price oscillations. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.00002289, indicating the immediate resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.00002097, securing the support. BONK/USD price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral zone. The indicator’s value has decreased to 33.80 over the last four hours. Though the RSI level has reached near the borderline of the oversold region, there’s very little room before the token goes oversold.

Bonk price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.000021187 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 3.81 percent today. Technical indicators do not favor any side of the market, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000207, which is approximately 681% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its price decreased to $0.00002118. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent losses. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.00003541. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00005835 by the start of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by the end of 2026. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000207 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price. Recent news/opinion on Bonk Bonk announced in a post that active on-chain holders of BONK tokens are inching closer to 1 million. Bonk also claimed that it is the largest community on Solana.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043.

50454395,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79563,1755803155,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert States Most Likely Scenario for XRP Price Rally Continuation,https://timestabloid.com/expert-states-most-likely-scenario-for-xrp-price-rally-continuation/,"Crypto analyst Galaxy recently shared a TradingView chart on X, noting that “consolidations are healthy” and emphasizing that the most likely scenario for XRP is a bullish continuation following its recent breakout. The post highlights a rectangular consolidation pattern forming after XRP’s sharp rally earlier this year, suggesting that the market is pausing before resuming its upward momentum. The Rectangular Consolidation The chart presented by Galaxy shows XRP moving within a well-defined sideways channel, commonly referred to as a rectangular consolidation. In technical analysis, this structure often represents a temporary equilibrium between buyers and sellers, where price oscillates between horizontal support and resistance. $XRP Consolidations are healthy. Especially after such a strong breakout. A bullish continuation from here is the most likely scenario. pic.twitter.com/L94UxHlvzU — Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) August 21, 2025 Historically, when such a formation occurs after a strong rally, it typically resolves in the direction of the initial trend. This makes the consolidation period less a sign of weakness and more a constructive base for future gains. Current Price Action and Key Levels At the time of Galaxy’s post, XRP was trading near $2.90, slightly below the $3 psychological level. The consolidation zone is significant because it sits above previous resistance levels, which now act as support. Holding this range signals that investors are not rushing to take profits but instead allowing the market to stabilize. Analysts have pointed out that a strong close above $3.30 would be a key trigger for a breakout confirmation , paving the way for the next leg higher. Analyst Consensus on XRP’s Trend Other market commentators echo Galaxy’s outlook. Several reports have described XRP’s recent activity as a multi-month consolidation lasting close to 200 days, which has repeatedly tested both the upper and lower boundaries of the range. Such extended consolidations are often seen as accumulation phases where strong hands prepare for the next move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If XRP can maintain support and eventually break out with convincing volume, the probabilities favor continuation toward higher price targets in the months ahead. Bullish Continuation vs. Risk of Breakdown The broader outlook remains bullish , but risks cannot be ignored. Rectangles can sometimes produce false breakouts or extended sideways movement that tests investor patience. For XRP, the decisive factor will be breakout confirmation supported by volume and weekly or monthly closes above resistance. Short-term traders may look to position themselves around these critical levels, while long-term holders are more likely to view the consolidation as a healthy pause before further gains. Final Thoughts Galaxy’s analysis aligns with a widely accepted principle in technical analysis: consolidations after strong breakouts tend to lead to continuation. XRP’s current sideways structure reflects stability rather than weakness, and with price holding above critical supports, the most probable outcome remains bullish. Traders and investors alike will be watching closely for a confirmed breakout above the consolidation range, which could mark the beginning of XRP’s next major rally.

50454391,https://cryptonews.com/?p=412340,1755803275,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50454391.jpeg,NFT Market Heats Up As AI Companion Tokens Bring Interactive Experiences,https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-market-heats-up-as-ai-companion-tokens-bring-interactive-experiences/,"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are making a comeback after facing a tough couple of years. According to DappRadar, NFT trading volumes dropped from $16.8 billion in 2023 to $13.7 billion in 2024. Although this decline was marked, a recent report from DappRadar found that NFT metaverse trading volume jumped 83% in July compared to the previous month. DappRadar’s July industry report also shows that NFT prices have been climbing alongside token values, particularly on Ethereum ( ETH ). Source: DappRadar AI Drives NFT Market Growth Additionally, combining artificial intelligence (AI) with NFTs continues to help the sector thrive. Hamza Eddiouane, advisor and co-creator of the NFT project FURO, told Cryptonews that AI changes the fundamental role of NFTs. “Instead of being static, NFTs can now be interactive, dynamic, and personalized. They can respond to users, learn from users, and even grow over time,” Eddiouane said. Although this may seem like another buzzword being applied to the blockchain industry, Eddiouane explained that combining AI with NFTs is important because it provides real utility and emotional weight. “I’ve seen how most of the JPEG-era NFTs collapsed in value: more than 95% are effectively dead,” he said. “But when you combine blockchain ownership with AI-driven interactivity, you get something that people can actually use, form bonds with, and keep coming back to. That’s a much stronger foundation for long-term cultural and financial value.” Echoing this, Aaron Teng, APAC CEO of the popular NFT project Pudgy Penguins, told Cryptonews that NFTs are entering a mainstream phase. “We are now seeing NFTs tied to identity, culture, and fandom—not just speculation—thanks to AI,” he said. AI Companion Token Offers Emotional Experiences To put this in perspective, Eddiouane explained that FURO is an Ethereum-based 3D NFT project that rethinks NFTs entirely. Instead of static images that may lose value over time, FURO offers AI-powered companions that learn, remember, and even grow with their owners. “People don’t just want digital souvenirs; they want interactive relationships with the things they own. Think about why Tamagotchis, Pokémon, or even how Labubu’s became cultural phenomena—it wasn’t just about ownership, it was about the feelings those characters created,” he said. According to Eddiouane, FURO is bringing that same cultural and emotional depth to crypto. For instance, the $FURO token promises holders a personal AI that learns and evolves alongside them. This AI-powered crypto token also allows exclusive access to a digital art NFT collection. FURO will eventually offer a ph ysical version in which its AI assistant will be integrated directly into the toy itself.

Read more pic.twitter.com/INgowCu6gi — $FURO | Your Plushy AI-Companion (@myfuroai) August 19, 2025 “The AI assistant is the core of FURO,” Eddiouane elaborated. “Each $10 NFT unlocks a mini AI app where holders can chat and evolve their FURO character. Over time, FURO becomes more personal: it remembers past interactions, adapts to users’ style, and can even reflect emotions. It can act as both a friend and an assistant.” Another example of something similar is being done by Treasure DAO, which is part of the ecosystem behind the $MAGIC token. Treasure DAO recently launched an “AI agent creator,” letting holders of top NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins turn their NFTs into fully autonomous AI agents. According to a recent X post, these agents can chat, post on X, play games in the metaverse, and even trade crypto. The Agent Builder lets users and developers build and launch custom AI agents. – No-Code Interface: People can create agents by setting their roles, skills, and instructions without needing technical know-how. – Advanced Tools: Developers can add specialized features like data… — WORK FOR YOUR BAG SHAMELESSLY|| PEACE || (@0xrealday) August 20, 2025 AI Powers Community-Driven Content AI is also helping NFT creators expand their collections. For instance, Teng shared that Pudgy Penguins contains thousands of AI-generated content prompted by its community. “This helps us distribute more content, more mindshare, at scale,” he said. Pudgy Penguins just rolled out a new integration with @avastudio_ that turns your NFT into an AI-powered content machine. As a holder, you can now generate short-form videos using your own Penguin. Just type a prompt, and the AI does the rest, your Pudgy becomes the star.… pic.twitter.com/816KCwtyba — shotgun (@shotguncaio) August 7, 2025 Teng added that AI is turning NFTs from static collectibles into living digital assets by enabling personalization, interactivity, and cultural adaptability at scale. “This makes NFTs feel more like experiences rather than pictures,” he said. Sebastien Borget, co-founder of metaverse platform The Sandbox, further told Cryptonews that The Sandbox is making user content creation easier with AI tools. “The Sandbox is using generative AI and vibe coding to provide templates and ways for creators to easily publish on their LANDS—a digital piece of real estate—through presets, asset directory, or even copy-paste existing experiences,” Borget said. Borget added that content creation has become more accessible and commoditized due to AI. “Just a simple prompt can enable an unlimited number of variations of an NFT.” Challenges To Consider While AI is helping the NFT market mature, a number of challenges remain. For instance, Borget pointed out that the use of AI comes at a cost. “People tend to think AI is widely available and free, hence making users pay to support these costs has been a challenge for many projects,” he noted. In addition, Borget mentioned that while most NFT collections are associated with digital scarcity, valuing work created by AI can be more difficult. Teng added that authenticity, scalability, and ownership rights remain the biggest issues with AI-powered NFTs. “Delivering AI experiences to millions of users requires strong infrastructure. Rights frameworks must make it clear who owns the outputs,” he said. Echoing this, Kai Wawrzinek, co-founder of Impossible Cloud Network, told Cryptonews that if an artwork NFT is generated by AI, it remains questionable who holds the rights. “Does the coder, the prompter, or the AI itself own the rights? Also, if there is mass production, then there is a risk of flooding the market and devaluing something that was once unique,” Wawrzinek said. Challenges aside, AI-powered NFTs appear to be the next growth phase for the digital collectible sector. Crypto-friendly regulations in the United States will also likely contribute to the development of AI-driven NFTs. “AI is not going to take away from human creativity; rather, it is going to augment it,” Wawrzinek said.

This staggering theft serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats lurking in the digital asset space. On August 19, 2025, a victim fell prey to sophisticated impersonation tactics, believing they were interacting with legitimate exchange and hardware wallet support. The funds, once stolen, were quickly traced to Wasabi Wallet, a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet. This unfortunate event unfolded on the one-year anniversary of the $243 million Genesis Creditor theft, highlighting a disturbing trend of high-value crypto heists. What Exactly Happened in This Bitcoin Social Engineering Scam? Blockchain analyst ZachXBT, a well-known figure for tracking illicit crypto activities on X (formerly Twitter), brought this significant loss to light. The details reveal a meticulously planned social engineering scam where the attackers skillfully mimicked official support channels. They likely exploited common vulnerabilities: trust, urgency, or a lack of technical understanding. Victims of such scams often believe they are resolving an issue or performing a necessary security check. Inadvertently, they grant access to their valuable digital assets. This particular incident underscores the evolving sophistication of cybercriminals. They are no longer just relying on phishing emails but are engaging in more personalized and elaborate schemes. By impersonating trusted entities like crypto exchanges and hardware wallet providers, they gain the confidence of their targets. This makes it incredibly difficult for even experienced users to discern the deception. The immediate transfer of funds to Wasabi Wallet suggests an attempt to obscure the trail, a common tactic used by criminals to launder stolen cryptocurrency. How Do Social Engineering Scams Target Crypto Holders? A social engineering scam relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits. Scammers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their security. For crypto holders, this often involves: Impersonation: Posing as customer support from exchanges, wallet providers, or even well-known crypto influencers. Phishing: Sending deceptive emails or messages with malicious links that lead to fake login pages. Vishing (Voice Phishing): Making phone calls pretending to be support staff, guiding victims through steps that lead to theft. Smishing (SMS Phishing): Sending fraudulent text messages. Baiting: Offering enticing but fake incentives (e.g., free crypto, exclusive access) to trick users into clicking malicious links. The goal is always the same: to gain access to private keys, seed phrases, or login credentials. Once these are compromised, the scammer can drain the victim’s wallet within minutes. This leaves little recourse for recovery. The human element remains the weakest link in cybersecurity, and these attackers exploit it masterfully. Protecting Your Assets: Defending Against a Social Engineering Scam While the scale of the $91 million Bitcoin theft is daunting, you can take proactive steps to protect your crypto holdings from a social engineering scam . Vigilance and adherence to best security practices are paramount: Verify Everything: Always independently verify the identity of anyone claiming to be from support. Do not use contact information provided in suspicious emails or messages. Instead, go directly to the official website of the exchange or wallet provider. Be Skeptical of Urgency: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into hasty decisions. Legitimate support will rarely demand immediate action under duress. Never Share Sensitive Information: Your private keys, seed phrases, and passwords should never be shared with anyone, not even “support.” No legitimate service will ever ask for this information. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use strong 2FA methods, preferably hardware-based (like YubiKey), on all your crypto accounts. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics. Knowledge is your best defense against a social engineering scam . Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, hardware wallets provide an extra layer of security, keeping your private keys offline. Remember, if something feels off, it probably is. Trust your instincts and err on the side of caution. The recent $91 million Bitcoin theft serves as a powerful cautionary tale for the entire crypto community. It highlights the critical importance of robust personal security practices in an environment where sophisticated cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics. By understanding the mechanics of a social engineering scam and implementing strong preventative measures, you can significantly reduce your risk of becoming the next victim. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and protect your digital future. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Scams Q1: What is a social engineering scam in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: A social engineering scam in crypto involves tricking individuals, often through impersonation or psychological manipulation, into revealing sensitive information like private keys or login credentials, which then allows scammers to steal their digital assets. Q2: How can I verify if a support message from an exchange is legitimate? A2: Always go directly to the official website of your exchange or wallet provider. Do not click on links in emails or messages. Look for official contact information on their website and reach out through those verified channels. Q3: What should I do if I suspect I’m being targeted by a social engineering scam? A3: Do not engage with the suspected scammer. Immediately block their contact and report the incident to the official support channels of the relevant platform. Change any compromised passwords and enable stronger security features like 2FA. Q4: Are hardware wallets completely immune to social engineering scams? A4: Hardware wallets significantly enhance security by keeping private keys offline. However, they are not entirely immune if a user is tricked into approving a malicious transaction on the device itself or revealing their seed phrase. Vigilance is always key. Q5: Why are social engineering scams so effective? A5: These scams are effective because they exploit human psychology, such as trust, fear, and urgency. Scammers are skilled at creating believable scenarios and impersonating trusted entities, making it difficult for victims to recognize the deception.

The order was implemented during the Biden administration due to concerns about the bank's anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) programs. “The OCC said in a statement today that the order remains in place to ensure the bank's safety, soundness, and legal compliance.” The softening of regulators' stance on cryptocurrencies over the past year during the Trump administration has been notable. The Fed previously withdrew its guidance discouraging banks from participating in cryptocurrencies. Last month, the Fed and the OCC issued a joint statement outlining how existing rules regarding banks holding crypto assets on behalf of customers will be implemented.

The protocol has launched on Aptos , a Move-based Layer 1 blockchain, marking its first-ever deployment on a non-EVM chain. While the expansion has had little impact on the prices of AAVE and APT tokens, it signals a pivotal shift in Aave’s strategy as it seeks to establish itself as a universal liquidity engine across multiple blockchain environments. A major milestone for Aave and Aptos The launch of Aave V3 on Aptos underscores the protocol’s ambition to go beyond Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks after more than five years of exclusivity. Aptos, built with the Move programming language, offers high throughput, sub-second finality, and low transaction costs. These features make it an attractive destination for developers and users seeking scalable, decentralised finance solutions. For Aave, the integration provides access to Aptos’s growing stablecoin economy, which is valued at about $1.3 billion and dominated by USDT. At launch, the Aptos market on Aave supports native USDC, USDT, APT, and sUSDe, with borrowing and supply caps designed to expand as demand grows. The Aptos Foundation has also committed liquidity incentives and user rewards to stimulate adoption, while Chainlink provides secure price feeds to support lending markets. Rewriting Aave for a new chain Deploying Aave V3 on Aptos required far more than a simple migration. According to a post made by Aave, because Aptos is not compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Aave Labs had to re-implement its entire protocol in Move. The team also built a new interface and SDK, while adapting the protocol’s business logic to the Aptos virtual machine. This effort was not only a technical milestone but also a statement of intent. By rebuilding its infrastructure for Aptos, Aave demonstrated its willingness to cross technical boundaries in pursuit of a multichain future. The deployment also underwent multiple architecture reviews and independent audits by firms including Zellic, Ottersec, SpearBit, and Certora. A mainnet capture-the-flag competition organised by Cantina further tested the system’s resilience. In addition, Aave introduced a $500,000 bug bounty, payable in its GHO stablecoin, to encourage ongoing scrutiny from security researchers. Aave @aave · Follow Replying to @aave This is Aave’s first expansion beyond the EVM, with the entire protocol rewritten in Move, a safe and secure programming language.It has undergone multiple audits, a CTF competition by @cantinaxyz , and has a $500,000 @GHO bug bounty. 6:32 PM · Aug 21, 2025 24 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply This layered approach reflects the high stakes of deploying on a new virtual machine and reinforces Aave’s commitment to safeguarding user funds. Unlocking new opportunities on Aptos Beyond supporting stablecoins, Aave and Aptos see significant potential in liquid staking tokens as collateral. Current data shows that only about 8.1% of APT is represented in liquid staking tokens, while more than three-quarters of the supply remains directly staked. By enabling borrowing and lending markets around these assets, Aave could help unlock fresh liquidity and deepen participation in the Aptos ecosystem. For developers, the launch delivers direct access to Aave’s proven lending infrastructure, complete with MEV-resilient oracle feeds and full tooling support. This paves the way for new financial applications to be built on Aptos, potentially revitalising on-chain activity, which has slowed over the past year. Setting the stage for future non-EVM deployments The expansion into Aptos reflects Aave’s broader vision of becoming a global liquidity protocol spanning diverse blockchains. Historically, chains that integrate Aave have seen faster growth in total value locked compared to those without it. Aptos will look to replicate that trend as it positions itself as a hub for consumer apps, stablecoins, and real-world assets. Both Aave and Aptos have framed the launch as the beginning of a longer journey. More assets will be added over time, risk parameters will evolve with market maturity, and security programs will continue to strengthen. The move also sets a template for future Aave deployments on other non-EVM chains, with governance decisions by the Aave DAO determining the next frontiers.

This project could change the way banks send money around the world. The goal of the tests is to make blockchain technology work with banking systems that are already in place. The ISO 20022 guidelines will be used to make this happen. 🚨 JUST IN: SWIFT is testing XRP and HBAR for blockchain-based cross-border payments to boost efficiency and interoperability. The future of global payments is being built right now🔥 pic.twitter.com/glXUHbkVSH — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) August 21, 2025 SWIFT’s blockchain tests show a careful but important step toward connecting old-fashioned banking with cutting-edge digital infrastructure. The market will be closely monitoring the trials to see if there are any signs of a long-term plan. The possible use o f ISO 20022 standards in digital assets could set new standards for global connectivity. XRP and HBAR are two examples of how blockchain could change the way money is sent and received. Swift could expose XRP and HBAR to $trillions XRP and HBAR have the ability to facilitate fast, scalable, and energy-efficient cross-border payments. XRP is known for having almost instant settlement times and strong backing from the banking sector. It handles about 1,500 transactions per second with very little energy use. On the other hand, HBAR uses a hashgraph consensus method to allow more than 10,000 transactions per second while using the same small amount of energy and having strong corporate governance. Both assets are being evaluated to see how well they can make it easier to transfer assets and use tokenization in a global financial setting. Swift will not be the only beneficiary. XRP and HBAR will likely benefit from more efforts to standardize and validate them by institutions. Also, SWIFT processes over $150 trillion in cross-border payments every year. That’s basically the lifeblood of global finance. Even if just a tiny fraction of that flow shifts onto blockchains like XRP or HBAR, it could create massive transactional demand for these tokens. Meanwhile, even after the news, the price of XRP is steady at a price of $2.88, which is a 0.67% decline. On the other hand, HBAR is trading at $0.2338, which is also a 1.14% decline. Rising institutional and regulatory blockchain interest The trials are a good sign for the crypto industry. They show that more institutions are starting to understand how blockchain can be used in financial processes. Also, according to analysts, the trials show how blockchain-based solutions could work with current banking systems to improve speed, governance, and standardization. SWIFT’s approach focuses on making sure that different systems can work with each other and on integrating them gradually. Although SWIFT hasn’t said for sure that it will use any one blockchain technology in the long run, it is testing a lot of different platforms. This shows that it understands how the industry is changing and how important it is to be flexible. These tests are happening at the same time that regulators are becoming more interested in digital currencies. For instance, Hong Kong has a stablecoin lab, and China is looking into yuan-backed stablecoins. In addition, as earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the financial regulator in Shanghai, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) convened a high-level meeting to explore strategic policy responses to stablecoins and digital currencies despite the crypto ban. Key regulatory bodies are accelerating their engagement with blockchain in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced “Project Crypto,” a landmark initiative aimed at modernising digital-asset regulation. This is to clarify crypto classifications and facilitate blockchain integration into traditional finance. However, these regional projects are still in their early stages compared to SWIFT’s more advanced tests at the institutional level.

The exchange has not yet officially listed these cryptocurrencies, as they must first meet certain criteria. One Step Before Official Listing The leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase added five altcoins to its roadmap on August 21. Among the names is the popular meme coin SPX6900 (SPX) as well as AWE Network (AWE), Dolomite (DOLO), Flock (FLOCK), and Solayer (LAYER). Some of the involved tokens experienced a substantial price boost following the announcement. The biggest gainer is FLOCK, whose valuation soared by 26%, while DOLO pumped by 10%. The rest have posted more modest increases, whereas SPX remains in red territory on a daily scale. FLOCK Price, Source: CoinGecko A positive price reaction for a certain cryptocurrency after support from Coinbase is rather normal . After all, such backing leads to boosted liquidity, enhanced accessibility, and a better reputation. It is important to note that adding digital assets to the roadmap is not the same as an official listing but rather a necessary step before such an initiative. It is a signal that Coinvase is actively evaluating the involved cryptocurrencies and might allow trading services once they meet certain criteria. “Transfers and trading are not supported for these or any other assets until a listing is officially announced . Depositing these assets into your Coinbase account before an official announcement may lead to permanent loss of funds,” the company warned. Previous Cases Coinbase’s support in the past months has resulted in similar and even more substantial price pumps for the involved cryptocurrencies. In mid-July, the exchange added Caldera (ERA) to its iOS & Android applications with the “Experimental” label, which was followed by a 75% rally. This section comprises tokens that are either new to the platform or have relatively low trading volume compared to the broader crypto marketplace. “We encourage you to exercise caution with these assets as they come with certain risks, including price swings and cancelled orders associated with lower volume and availability,” Coinbase alerted at the time. A week later, the exchange added BankrCoin (BNKR), Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL), and Metaplex (MPLX) to its roadmap. BNKR was the biggest gainer, rising by 27% after the disclosure.

Despite bouncing from $112,600, BTC’s recovery lacks participation from new leveraged traders, signaling that this is more of a technical rebound than a full trend reversal. As Bitcoin price digests these movements, attention is turning toward altcoins such as XRP and Remittix , which could deliver higher returns amid the current market structure. Bitcoin Price Faces Short-Term Resistance Amid Consolidation The retracement structure for Bitcoin price shows weakening bullish control as it lost the 50-day moving average and key Fibonacci zones. While the market tested support near $112,600, the rebound to $119,350 has been modest. The open interest remains flat, suggesting that few new traders are entering positions to drive a strong recovery. Furthermore, sentiment indicators reflect caution. The Binance fear and greed index stands around 45, tilting away from optimism but still neutral. On-chain data shows the long-to-short ratio rising above 2.0 indicating that shorts have been closed out more aggressively than longs but the overall market participation is down. This combination implies that Bitcoin’s price might stay put between the $115,000 resistance and the $112,000 support until there is a more clear direction. XRP Remains Caught in Market Lag Despite Strong Fundamentals XRP has also hovered around the $3 mark but has been unable to make any headways, a case that has been the same with Bitcoin. The decrease in the amount of trading indicates the absence of the short-term interest and the persistent ambiguity on the legal front with the SEC is also dragging on investor sentiment. Technical analysis also indicates a breach of major support, which makes short-term selling pressure more likely. Although core adoption potential is sound, XRP is presently held back by both underlying market weakness and regulatory overhang. Why Remittix Could Outperform While Bitcoin Price and XRP Consolidate Remittix is currently priced at $0.0969, having raised $20.6 million and sold over 612 million tokens, positioning it as one of the most watched altcoins for growth in 2025. Its Q3 wallet beta launch adds a tangible product layer that could drive adoption beyond speculation. Advantages of Remittix in the Current Market Real Utility: Designed for cross-border payments and PayFi solutions Active Development: Wallet beta launch scheduled for Q3 2025 Growing Community: Retail and institutional attention rising Momentum Ahead of Listings: Increased visibility and liquidity As Bitcoin price remains range-bound and XRP faces regulatory and technical challenges, Remittix provides a compelling alternative for investors seeking higher multipliers and real-world adoption in the altcoin space.

Responding to sanctions imposed this week by the British government, and earlier by Washington, President Sadyr Zhaparov insisted the measures are not based on evidence and will not hurt Russia, with which the West is still trading. Kyrgyz president lashes out over Russia-linked sanctions In an interview published Thursday, Zhaparov criticized the U.K. and U.S. governments for sanctioning Kyrgyz financial institutions without providing evidence that these have been involved in circumventing Western restrictions against the Russian Federation. Among the entities targeted by London is Kyrgyzstan’s Capital Bank, suspected of being used by Moscow to purchase military supplies. In January, the United States sanctioned Keremet Bank, believed to be involved in sanctions evasion, too. This week, British authorities also hit “crypto networks” allegedly employed by the Kremlin to fund its war effort in Ukraine. Among them, Old Vector, a Kyrgyz-based company issuing the ruble-pegged stablecoin A7A5 , was sanctioned by the U.S. as well. Kyrgyzstan’s president complained his administration was not shown any evidence to support the allegations. Speaking to the official Kabar news agency, Sadyr Zhaparov said the U.S. was “unable to present a single fact of violation” in the case of Keremet. He further explained: “Today, 21 banks operate in Kyrgyzstan. To avoid the risk of any of them falling under sanctions, we decided that only the state-owned Keremet Bank would work with the Russian ruble.” “All operations are under state control, and the profit goes directly to the state budget,” the president said, also noting that the same applies to Capital Bank. He emphasized all this has been discussed with the American side. Zhaparov recalled that government officials met with the U.S. ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Lesslie Viguerie, and representatives of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Bishkek proposed an independent audit to review the activities of its banks, but the offer was rejected. U.S. officials claimed they had certain information at their disposal, and the president of Kyrgyzstan is convinced it originates from local NGOs and opponents of the government, whom he accuses of sending “anonymous false reports.” The Kyrgyz leader also pointed out that about a million citizens of his country live and work in Russia. These people “send billions of rubles home every day” and the funds need to be converted to local fiat. Sadyr Zhaparov also suspects Kyrgyzstan’s expanding economy, with GDP growing at nearly 12%, may be the reason why the former Soviet republic is being targeted. “I believe this is precisely why pressure is being put on us,” he commented, suggesting great powers prefer to deal with dependent nations. Also quoted by Reuters, Zhaparov stated : “That is why I would appeal to the top leadership of these countries, to [U.S. President] Donald Trump and [U.K. Prime Minister] Keir Starmer … The economy must not be politicized.” Russia won’t be harmed by sanctions on Kyrgyzstan, president says Zhaparov, who assumed office in 2021 as Kyrgyzstan’s sixth president since independence, stressed that his nation is pursuing what he called “a multi-vector policy,” cooperating with many partners, including the United Kingdom, to which it sells $1 billion worth of gold a year. The Kyrgyz president is not expecting Russia to be harmed by the sanctions on Kyrgyzstan. Complaining about the unfair treatment of his country, he reiterated his call for evidence. “Frankly speaking, Capital Bank will not suffer either. It will continue to operate and bring profit to the state, just as before,” he added, providing Russia’s Sberbank as an example, which posted annual profits exceeding $13 billion in 2024. Sanctions, nevertheless, have consequences, Sadyr Zhaparov admitted, accusing the nations that impose them of continuing to do business with Russia. Last year alone, trade between EU member states and Moscow reached $141 billion, he noted, and even the U.K.’s exchange with Russia hit $2.2 billion. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Now, however, Bitcoin’s price seems to be dropping and heading lower, especially after some large transfers of BTC from BlackRock’s addresses. Source: Arkham In the past 24 hours, BlackRock has moved over 10,584 BTC—worth more than $1.19B at the current price of $112,000—onto Coinbase. This has likely triggered panic among investors, as it’s the first time something like this has happened in a while. Additionally, over 60K ETH was transferred and possibly sold through Coinbase. You can read more about ETH price predictions here . Correction or Change in the Trend: BTC Price Prediction Source: BTC/USD | TradingView Bitcoin’s in a bit of a dip right now, dropping toward a key support level around $112,000. This is the same level it bounced from to reach its all-time high (ATH). The price has been dropping since the huge rally toward the ATH, which is pretty normal. The RSI is sitting at 32.93, meaning it’s in oversold territory, so the market might be overdoing the bearishness. A bounce back could be coming soon. Looking at the MACD, it’s showing some negative momentum since the MACD line is below the signal line, indicating we’re still in bearish territory. But if Bitcoin holds that support and starts to climb, we could see a reversal. Bitcoin’s price could drop just below the previous key support and hang around there for a bit. But if BlackRock and other entities keep selling, it could turn into a different situation. What Is Waiting for Bitcoin in September? September 2025 is looking like a big month for both the markets and Bitcoin. There’s an 81% chance the Fed will cut rates by 0.25% during its meeting on the 15th-16th. Historically, September has been a tough month for Bitcoin and one of the weakest for U.S. stocks. Over the past 35 years, the S&P 500 has averaged nearly a 1% drop. You know what’s shown the market’s resilience time and time again? Memecoins, especially the new ones that ride on the latest trends. That’s why TOKEN6900 is stealing the spotlight right now, with its presale getting attention from all over, especially thanks to its high APY. Only 7 Days Left: September’s Top Meme Coin Play There are only seven days left to grab TOKEN6900 (T6900)! With funding already at 46%, we’re halfway there, and the next stretch is key. Once it hits 100%, the presale could close early. TOKEN6900 takes the absurdity torch from its cousin SPX6900 (SPX), carrying the sacred 69 banner—the ultimate symbol of meme numerology. While SPX6900 was pure satire, TOKEN6900 goes full-on financial madness, blending TradFi mockery with 69-powered nonsense and crashing straight into the meme coin world, where most projects have lost sight of what being a true meme coin is all about. TOKEN6900 is sticking to its hard cap. The presale is capped at $5 million, and once that’s hit, you’ll never get the chance to snag T6900 at these low prices again. With $2.34 million already raised, it’s 46.4% of the way there. If the current pace keeps up, the cap could be reached in just a couple of weeks.

The decision stated that there was no risk of escape due to the defendants' compliance with the court process. In June, as part of a lawsuit filed by plaintiffs seeking more than $100 million in damages, a total of $57.6 million in USDC was frozen in two wallets controlled by Hayden Davis, CEO of venture capital firm Kelsier Labs LLC, and Ben Chow, founder of decentralized exchange Meteora.

These assets remain in the two initially frozen wallets: one with a balance of $13.06 million and the other with a balance of $44.59 million. Following the decision, the price of LIBRA rose 73%.

Global quantitative trading firm Jane Street, a colossal liquidity provider with an astonishing $505 billion in assets under management (AUM), has dramatically increased its BTC ETF holdings to an astounding $3.4 billion. This remarkable move, initially reported by Bitcoin journalist Pete Rizzo via X, highlights a growing trend of institutional confidence and strategic allocation within the digital asset space. Why Jane Street’s Massive BTC ETF Holdings Matter So Much? Jane Street is not just any financial firm; it stands as a pillar in global markets, renowned for its sophisticated quantitative trading strategies and its role in providing liquidity across various asset classes. Their decision to allocate such a substantial amount to BTC ETF holdings sends a powerful, unambiguous signal across both traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market. This isn’t merely a speculative investment; it’s a strategic endorsement from a firm known for its deep analytical capabilities and its ability to identify profitable opportunities. Their expertise lies in understanding complex market dynamics and capitalizing on inefficiencies, suggesting a strong, data-driven belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its increasing integration into mainstream financial products. Such a significant commitment from a firm of Jane Street’s caliber often encourages other institutional players to re-evaluate their own positions regarding digital assets. It essentially lowers the perceived risk for those still on the fence. What Does This Surge in BTC ETF Holdings Mean for Institutional Adoption? This massive increase in BTC ETF holdings by a firm like Jane Street serves as a potent, real-world example of accelerating institutional adoption. It actively validates Bitcoin as a legitimate, investable asset class, moving it further away from its perception as a niche or excessively volatile investment. The ripple effect of such an investment cannot be overstated. Consider these pivotal implications for the broader market: Enhanced Legitimacy: When major, highly respected players like Jane Street invest billions, it undeniably adds credibility to Bitcoin, encouraging other large institutions and even conservative wealth managers to consider similar allocations. This professional endorsement is crucial. Potential Market Stability: Larger, more mature institutional investments can potentially introduce greater stability to the often-volatile crypto market. This inflow of “smart money” helps to balance out retail-driven fluctuations. Increased Liquidity and Efficiency: Firms like Jane Street are primary liquidity providers. Their increased involvement in the Bitcoin ETF space means more efficient trading, tighter spreads, and a healthier overall market for these products. Broader Investor Access: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, significantly driven by such substantial investments, makes Bitcoin more accessible to a wider range of investors through regulated, familiar financial products. This democratizes access beyond direct crypto exchanges. Are More Firms Following Jane Street’s Lead in Boosting BTC ETF Holdings? Jane Street’s groundbreaking move is certainly part of a broader, emerging narrative. Across the financial landscape, many institutions are either beginning to explore or actively increasing their exposure to Bitcoin, primarily through the regulated ETF route. This growing trend reflects evolving regulatory clarity, increasing product availability, and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s potential role as a portfolio diversifier or a hedge against traditional economic pressures. The Q1 2024 earnings reports and subsequent filings have revealed numerous traditional finance players, from hedge funds to registered investment advisors, initiating or expanding their BTC ETF holdings . This collective movement indicates a significant shift in investment paradigms. This growing interest from established financial entities underscores a fundamental change. Bitcoin is no longer just for early adopters or tech enthusiasts; it is rapidly becoming a recognized, strategic component of diversified investment strategies for sophisticated investors globally. However, it is also important to remember that all investments carry risks, and the crypto market, while maturing, can still be volatile. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Institutional Investment? The substantial commitment from Jane Street to its BTC ETF holdings suggests a robust and positive outlook for Bitcoin’s future integration into mainstream finance. As more data emerges regarding institutional participation and performance, we anticipate continued growth and innovation within the regulated crypto investment space. For individual investors and market observers, this trend reinforces the critical importance of understanding the evolving landscape of digital assets. While opportunities for growth and diversification abound, it is always prudent to conduct thorough research, assess personal risk tolerance, and stay informed about market dynamics and regulatory changes. In conclusion, Jane Street’s remarkable increase in BTC ETF holdings to $3.4 billion is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s maturing presence in global finance. It underscores the accelerating pace of institutional integration and sets a compelling precedent for future investment trends, solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a serious asset class for serious players.

DOJ Eases Stance On Crypto Regulation Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti conveyed this message during remarks prepared for a digital asset summit in Wyoming, signaling a significant evolution in the government’s stance towards the crypto industry. This comes amid President Donald Trump’s mission to transform the United States into the world’s crypto capital, boosted by the recent passage of three bills aimed at creating a more accommodative regulatory framework for digital assets. Galeotti emphasized that merely writing code without malicious intent should not be considered a criminal act, marking a departure from previous enforcement actions, particularly those that focused on the requirement for digital asset platforms to register as money transmitters. Traditionally, entities like Western Union and popular payment applications such as Venmo must adhere to strict regulations, including customer vetting and the reporting of suspicious activities aimed at preventing money laundering. According to Reuters, these regulatory requirements have often been a point of contention within the crypto community, especially for decentralized exchanges that claim to have limited visibility over the transactions conducted on their platforms. Privacy Vs Prosecution A recent high-profile case involved the co-founder of Tornado Cash. The jury found Roman Storm guilty of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, while it deadlocked on charges of money laundering and sanctions evasion. Critics of the prosecution argued that the co-founder was merely a code creator and not someone who facilitated illicit activities within his decentralized protocol, which served to enhance privacy on public blockchains.

In 2029, the coin could be worth between $31.51 and $38.30, with an average price of $33.44 In 2031, RPL will range between $67.29 and $78.03. Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool’s price reach $50?

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been increasing in popularity during presale. Existing investors are setting themselves up for at least a 300% return on listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $14.7 million and has over 15450 investors already. Cardano might usher in a conclusive breakout soon, but with Mutuum Finance’s customized lending protocol, profound liquidity model, and gaining momentum in decentralized finance, it can become the new crypto that overtakes traditional Layer-1. Cardano Stabilizes at Around $0.92 as Markets Anticipate Next Move Cardano (ADA) holds steady at about $0.92, experiencing a period of stabilization as markets anticipate fresh drivers, including potential on-chain activity and broader crypto sentiment. Its proof-of-stake system continues to facilitate the running of smart contracts and dApp deployment, movement from research-driven upgrades and strong staking ecosystem. The platform is at the scaling and governance phases of its roadmap, with Voltaire introducing on-chain governance and treasury capability nearing full rollout. As the broader altcoin market stirs interest amidst ADA’s consolidation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining traction as an alternative buy. The new DeFi altcoin threatens the strong hold and top 10 rank of Cardano on the market. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched presale stage 6 at $0.035. It will be raised by 14.29% to $0.04 in the following stage. Presale has drawn over 15450 investors and has raised over $14.7 million to this point. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a stablecoin to be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a safe and stable investment product in an attempt not to guess and be unstable like algorithmic stablecoins. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance uses a two-model mechanism in bringing maximum flexibility and efficiency through the Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models of lending. Peer-to-Contract is based on self-enforcing smart contracts that will lend automatically without any sort of human action. They buy and sell within the market with an unstated rate of interest as decided by then-prevailing demand and supply of an interest in real time. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and allows lenders to exchange directly with borrowers. Mutuum Finance Provides Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has released an official Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool amount of the total $50,000 USDT. Four severities will be chosen. They are critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also conducting $100,000 giveaway to welcome the project community. 10 investors will be able to obtain $10,000 of Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $14.7 million from over 15,450 investors, with Stage 6 of the presale live at $0.035 and Stage 7 poised to grow 14.29% to $0.04. Having a 95.0 CertiK trust score, a $50,000 bug bounty program, and a $100,000 token giveaway, the project balances openness with rapid adoption. Early buyers are in for at least gains of 300% minimum at listing, and its dual-lending model and USD-pegged stablecoin offer long-term stability. While Cardano has its eye on a potential breakout at $1.20, Mutuum Finance is becoming the DeFi altcoin with further upside. Reserve your place in Stage 6 today before the next price surge.

50456416,562141,1755806409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50456416.jpeg,Kanye West’s Solana Memecoin YZY Rocked By Insider Trading Allegations,https://bitcoinist.com/kanye-west-solana-memecoin-yzy-insider-trading/,"The Solana-based memecoin YZY, promoted by Kanye West (Ye), posted one of the most volatile debuts of the year, rocketing to a multi-billion-dollar valuation within minutes before retracing as on-chain sleuths flagged insider activity and a contentious liquidity setup. In an X post on Thursday, West shared the contract address and framed “YZY MONEY” as “A NEW ECONOMY, BUILT ON CHAIN,” helping propel the token to roughly $3 billion in market value within about 40 minutes, before sliding sharply lower later in the session. YZY Faces Insider Trading Claims On Solana Early trading immediately drew scrutiny. Analytics account Lookonchain alleged that “Only YZY was added to the liquidity pool with no USDC. Dev may sell YZY by adding/removing liquidity, similar to LIBRA ,” a single-sided structure that can make exits opaque for retail takers and amplify slippage through add/remove liquidity operations. Several wallets appeared to have anticipated the launch mechanics. Lookonchain identified wallet 6MNWV8 as having known the contract address ahead of time, even attempting to purchase it before the token went live. Once trading opened, that wallet spent 450,611 USDC to acquire 1.29 million YZY at roughly $0.35, later selling 1.04 million YZY for 1.39 million USDC and retaining 249,907 YZY (about $600,000) — a take the analysts calculated as “a profit of over $1.5M.” A second cluster of transactions suggested an orchestrated rush to the front of the queue. According to Lookonchain, an insider spent 450,000 USDC across two wallets to buy 1.89 million YZY at $0.24, then sold 1.59 million YZY for 3.37 million USDC at $2.12, still holding ~303,425 YZY (~$510,000). One of the addresses paid 129 SOL (≈$24,000) in priority fees to win block space at launch. Not every attempt to front-run succeeded. Lookonchain also documented a trader who “bought the wrong YZY and lost $710K,” then spent 761,000 USDC on the official token and recouped over $710,000 minutes later — a whipsaw emblematic of hyper-fragmented symbols during celebrity launches. Speculation spread beyond spot markets. “Trader 0x68c0 just opened a 3x leveraged long on $YZY again,” Lookonchain wrote, noting that his previous two long attempts within the hour had already lost a combined $159.6K. Momentum ultimately broke. “YZY has dropped below $1,” Lookonchain posted, adding that whale 6ZFnRH spent 1.55 million USDC to buy 996,453 YZY at $1.56, only to exit at $1.06 for 1.05 million USDC — a ~$500,000 loss in under two hours. At network level, the launch became a live-fire stress test for Solana. SolanaFloor reported that the chain’s “true TPS (non-vote transactions) hit 2,300 for the first time” during the YZY debut — a new peak for real transaction throughput and a marked improvement from earlier celebrity-token frenzies. Beyond discrete wallet anecdotes, broader supply concentration data fanned the “insider” narrative. Coinbase ’s Conor Grogan pointed to on-chain snapshots suggesting at least 94% of supply sat with insiders at one point, including a single multisig with 87% before distribution — numbers that, if sustained, can magnify price impact during rebalancing or liquidity removal. The project’s documentation promoted anti-sniping steps — notably deploying 25 contract addresses and randomly designating one as official — but those measures did not prevent early-access behavior flagged by analysts. At press time, Solana traded at $185.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Kanye West|SOL|SOL news|solana|Solana news|Ye|YZY|YZY Memecoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|USDC|ZRX,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-21 20:00:09

The announcement was shared through the exchange’s official roadmap update. Coinbase Uses a Careful and Open Listing Process The exchange also published the token’s contract address to give investors clarity ahead of the trading launch. The decision comes at a time when stablecoins are drawing stronger interest from both retail and institutional players. Coinbase is positioning itself as a careful but forward-looking gatekeeper in this space. The exchange is known for being cautious when adding new crypto assets . Unlike earlier years when it published long watchlists of potential tokens, the exchange now only announces assets it has firmly chosen to support. This system, known as the roadmap, helps prevent speculation and misinformation while giving users clear visibility into upcoming listings. In the case of USD1, Coinbase said that deposits should not be sent until the official trading launch. Any premature deposits risk being lost permanently. The exchange also clarified that a listing on the roadmap is not the same as an immediate market opening. Expanding Assets Across Multiple Networks The company requires two conditions before opening a market, which include adequate market-making support and a fully prepared technical infrastructure. If either condition is not met, trading for USD1 will not begin. This careful approach is part of Coinbase’s broader effort to make the listing process more transparent and secure. The USD1 stablecoin enters a growing list of assets on Coinbase’s roadmap. Other tokens added recently include QCAD, Dolomite, and SPX6900, along with new listings tied to the Base and Solana networks. Coinbase has also been quietly expanding its decentralized exchange (DEX) services. Earlier this year, Coinbase added trading for Base tokens and said Solana tokens would be next. This shows the company’s plan to grow across different blockchain networks. Coinbase Puts Compliance and Safety First The U.S.-based trading platform carefully reviews every new token before listing it, and not all tokens are treated the same. Some are given an Experimental Label to warn investors that they carry more risk. The decision to list USD1 was based on legal, compliance, and security checks and not on hype or demand. Coinbase has made it clear that even popular or trending tokens can be rejected if they don’t meet its rules. This focus on compliance reflects a bigger shift in the crypto industry. A telling sign came from Bullish, another exchange, accepting $1.15 billion from its IPO in USDC and USD1. That shows USD1 is being seen as a trusted, institutional-grade stablecoin, not just a speculative coin.

The price is now searching for support, with volatility intensifying and traders debating whether this is the start of a deeper correction or simply a healthy consolidation phase before continuation. Some analysts remain optimistic, seeing this pullback as a natural reset in an overheated market, while others argue that momentum is fading as bearish signals emerge. Related Reading: Ethereum Treasury Boom Drives Demand: Can The Market Handle The Risks? Adding weight to the discussion, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler highlighted a key trend in retail participation. The share of retail transfers in the $0–$10K range within Bitcoin’s total USD turnover has been steadily declining throughout this cycle. From a peak of 2.7%, the share has now dropped to just 0.6%. Historically, such declines in retail participation have coincided with the later stages of bull cycles. This dynamic raises questions about whether the current phase marks a cooling of retail enthusiasm at a critical time for Bitcoin, as institutional and long-term holders dominate market structure. Bitcoin Retail Activity Declines as Market Cools According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, while the share of retail activity in Bitcoin’s network has dropped sharply, in absolute terms it still remains significant. Retail transfers in the $0–$10K range amount to over $400 million per day, but this represents only 0.6% of total USD turnover across the network. This shrinking share highlights a clear trend: while small investors are still active, their relative impact on overall market flows is diminishing. Adler notes that this cooling of retail demand was also observed in autumn 2021, at the peak of the previous cycle. At that time, the retail share fell to a historic low of just 0.19%, coinciding with overheated market conditions and marking the final stages of that bull cycle. The current decline in retail participation mirrors that pattern, suggesting that the market could be approaching a similar late-cycle environment. This dynamic is important because retail investors have traditionally been a strong driver of momentum during bull markets. With their reduced influence, institutional flows, long-term holders, and treasury strategies now play an even greater role in shaping market direction. The coming weeks will be critical as altcoins, led by Ethereum, show renewed strength. ETH is approaching its 2021 all-time high, and many analysts believe that its performance could dictate the broader crypto market’s next move. If retail demand continues to fade while institutional accumulation grows, Bitcoin may consolidate further, while capital rotation toward altcoins gains momentum.

This level has become a critical support zone after BTC failed to sustain momentum above the $123,217 resistance, which has acted as a clear rejection point multiple times this cycle. Shorter-term moving averages highlight the bearish momentum. The 50-day SMA (blue) at $117,017 and the 100-day SMA (green) at $117,087 are both trending above the current price, creating overhead resistance. The breakdown below these averages confirms a weakening trend, with BTC struggling to regain lost ground. Price action also shows a sequence of lower highs and lower lows since the rejection at the $124K zone, reinforcing bearish short-term sentiment.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows a downward trend regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.638 in the last 24 hours. If the bearish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest support at the $0.621 level. However, some degree of support has also been observed, which can help prevent the price from sinking further. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $3.82 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is in a bearish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting negative sentiment as the SNX price decreased to $0.638, losing 2.71% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.01 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach near $5 by 2031. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach near the $6 level after 2031. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $4.38, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $4.38 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment. Recent news/ updates on SNX Synthetix Network said in a post that it is ending its L2 (Layer 2) experiment. In the future, only L1 will be available to users, as most users voted for a 50% increase in the L1 gas limit to 45 million. The network said that the gas limit is already increasing and is now at 37.3 million. The L2 experiment is over.

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781. At the start of August, SNX is trending near $0.56, as the current Synthetix sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-21 20:02:00

Here’s What It Means for Price,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-golden-retracement-is-holding-heres-what-it-means-for-price/,"XRP is once again drawing attention as it clings to its “golden” retracement level, with traders watching closely for signs of the next major breakout. According to market analyst CasiTrades, XRP has reached the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement at around $2.88, a level often regarded as the critical “make-or-break” zone in technical analysis. The timing is especially notable, with Bitcoin also finding relative strength index (RSI) support, creating what many see as a synchronized bullish setup. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.90 as of report time. Elliott Wave Roadmap CasiTrades interprets this move through the lens of Elliott Wave Theory, identifying the retracement as the likely completion of subwave 2. If this count proves correct, it would pave the way for the most powerful leg of the cycle — subwave 3. XRP Golden Retracement Is Holding. Targeting $3.41 Resistance! I’m leaning bullish here. The structure is starting to look really interesting… $XRP reaching its .618 retracement ($2.88), which lines up as the textbook subwave 2 target in Elliott Wave Theory. This is the… pic.twitter.com/kWV72IhE40 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) August 21, 2025 The analyst maps out a path toward resistance at $3.41, with a crucial checkpoint at $3.21. Breaking and successfully backtesting that $3.21 level would strongly confirm bullish momentum and provide the launchpad for an advance toward $3.41. Why the Golden Pocket Matters The 0.618 retracement level, often called the golden pocket, is a cornerstone of Fibonacci-based trading. Holding this area typically signals that the broader bullish trend remains intact, while failure to maintain support often points to deeper corrections. With Bitcoin showing RSI support at the same time, the confluence strengthens the case for renewed upside momentum in XRP. Beyond the charts, Ripple’s ecosystem has continued to evolve. The company’s RLUSD stablecoin , launched in December 2024, has expanded XRP’s utility in payments and liquidity management. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels to Watch For traders, the immediate focus is clear: holding support at $2.88–$2.95 is essential to keep the bullish outlook intact . A confirmed break above $3.21 would mark a shift in market structure and open the path toward $3.41. On the other hand, a decisive drop below the golden pocket could invalidate the bullish Elliott count and force a retest of lower supports. Volume confirmation and Bitcoin’s correlation will remain critical signals in the days ahead. Outlook CasiTrades’ analysis underscores a simple but pivotal dynamic: as long as XRP holds the golden retracement, the door remains open for a powerful rally targeting $3.41. The retracement is not just a technical curiosity — it is the hinge on which the short-term trend turns. Traders now face a clearly defined setup with both opportunity and risk tightly framed, making the next moves especially decisive for XRP’s path toward new highs.

Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is looking to have crypto market structure legislation ready for passage before the year’s end, the Republican lawmaker said on Wednesday. Sen. Cynthia Lummis Pushes for Thanksgiving Deadline Speaking at the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025 on August 20, Lummis claimed that Congress “will have market structure [legislation] done this year.” “We will have market structure to the president’s desk before the end of the year,” Lummis said. “I hope it’s before Thanksgiving. That’s our goal.” Lummis stated that she hoped the key crypto legislation would advance through the Senate Banking Committee next month before heading to the Senate Agriculture Committee in October. Will Democrats Stand in the Way of Key Crypto Bill’s Passage? News of Lummis’ timeline comes just one month after she, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), and Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott unveiled a discussion draft of digital asset market structure legislation. “This discussion draft represents a thoughtful, balanced approach that will provide the clarity our innovators need while providing robust consumer protections,” Lummis said in a July statement. “We cannot allow regulatory confusion to continue driving American innovation overseas.” “Market structure legislation will establish clear distinctions between digital asset securities and commodities, modernize our regulatory framework, and position the United States as the global leader in digital asset innovation,” she added. Speaking at SALT on Tuesday, Scott predicted that 12 out of 18 Democrats would be in favor of the crypto market structure bill . “I believe that we’ll have at least 12 and 18 Democrats at least open to voting for market structure,” Scott said. However, key players within the Democratic Party opposed to the legislation may present challenges to the bill’s advancement . “The forces against it, let me just say clearly, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, standing in the way of Democrats wanting to participate, it is a real force to overcome,” Scott said.
