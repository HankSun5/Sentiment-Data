For institutional players like Strategy, navigating these cycles requires more than just hope; it demands a robust financial blueprint. Recently, prominent cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo offered a compelling insight into Strategy’s approach to its substantial Bitcoin holdings. He believes the company is highly unlikely to sell its BTC, even during the next bear market, providing a fascinating glimpse into their carefully crafted Strategy Bitcoin Strategy . This assessment, initially reported by Cointelegraph, suggests a deep-rooted conviction and a well-thought-out financial architecture designed to weather market volatility. It’s a bold stance that has caught the attention of many in the crypto community, eager to understand how a major corporate entity plans to maintain its position through potentially challenging times. What Drives Strategy’s Unwavering Bitcoin Strategy? Willy Woo’s analysis centers on Strategy’s convertible notes, which are a key component of their financial planning. These notes, essentially a type of debt that can be converted into equity, play a crucial role in the company’s ability to manage its obligations without liquidating its valuable Bitcoin assets. The crucial date for these notes is their maturity in September 2027. Woo explains that if Strategy’s stock price remains above a specific threshold of $183.19, the company could repay its debt without needing to sell any of its Bitcoin. This stock price, he notes, corresponds to a Bitcoin price of approximately $91,500. Key Financial Levers: The convertible notes provide a pathway for debt repayment through equity conversion. Stock Price Threshold: Maintaining a stock price above $183.19 is vital for this strategy. Bitcoin Price Correlation: This stock price implicitly links to a Bitcoin valuation around $91,500. This mechanism underscores the sophistication behind Strategy’s overall Strategy Bitcoin Strategy , demonstrating a clear intention to hold onto their digital gold for the long term. Could Strategy’s Bitcoin Strategy Face Challenges? While Woo’s assessment paints a picture of resilience, he also acknowledges potential hurdles. No financial strategy is entirely without risk, and Strategy’s approach is no exception. The analyst points out specific scenarios that could make things difficult for the company, even with its current planning. One primary concern is if Bitcoin fails to rally sufficiently in the next bull market. A weaker-than-expected upward trend could prevent BTC from reaching the implied $91,500 price point, which is indirectly tied to the stock price needed for debt repayment. Additionally, Strategy could face difficulties if Bitcoin comes under sustained and intense downward pressure. Consider these potential risks: Insufficient Bull Market Rally: If Bitcoin’s price doesn’t reach the levels necessary to support Strategy’s stock valuation. Sustained Bearish Pressure: Prolonged and severe market downturns could strain their financial position. These factors highlight that while Strategy has a robust plan, external market conditions remain a critical variable in the success of their Strategy Bitcoin Strategy . Broader Implications for Institutional Bitcoin Holders Strategy’s proactive and well-articulated approach to managing its Bitcoin holdings offers significant insights for the broader institutional crypto market. Their commitment to HODLing (holding on for dear life) through various market cycles, backed by sophisticated financial engineering, sets a precedent. This strategy demonstrates a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, moving beyond short-term speculative plays. It suggests that institutions are increasingly looking at creative ways to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets, using instruments like convertible notes to mitigate immediate selling pressures during downturns. The transparency and rationale behind Strategy’s decisions provide a valuable case study for other companies considering similar ventures into the digital asset space. The detailed analysis of Strategy’s financial maneuvers, particularly its Strategy Bitcoin Strategy , provides valuable lessons on risk management and strategic positioning within the volatile crypto landscape. It underscores that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is evolving, becoming more nuanced and financially engineered. In conclusion, analyst Willy Woo’s assessment paints a compelling picture of Strategy’s resilience. The company’s financial architecture, particularly its use of convertible notes and a specific stock price target, suggests a strong commitment to its Bitcoin holdings. While challenges such as insufficient market rallies or sustained bearish pressure exist, Strategy’s current setup indicates a sophisticated and enduring Strategy Bitcoin Strategy designed to navigate the turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market. This approach is a testament to their long-term vision for Bitcoin and offers valuable insights for the entire crypto ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Strategy’s primary motivation for holding Bitcoin? Strategy views Bitcoin as a long-term treasury reserve asset, believing in its potential as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. Their motivation is to protect and grow shareholder value over time. Who is Willy Woo, and why is his analysis significant? Willy Woo is a well-known on-chain analyst in the cryptocurrency space. His analysis is significant because he uses public blockchain data and financial models to provide insights into Bitcoin’s market dynamics and investor behavior, offering a data-driven perspective. What are convertible notes, and how do they impact Strategy’s debt? Convertible notes are a type of debt that can be converted into equity (company stock) under certain conditions. For Strategy, these notes allow them to raise capital without immediately selling their Bitcoin. If their stock price performs well, the debt can be repaid through equity conversion, avoiding the need to sell BTC. What stock price does Strategy need to maintain to avoid selling BTC? According to Willy Woo, Strategy would need its stock price to remain above $183.19 to repay its convertible notes without selling any Bitcoin. This stock price correlates with a Bitcoin price of approximately $91,500. What are the risks associated with Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy? Key risks include Bitcoin failing to rally sufficiently in the next bull market to support the necessary stock price, or the cryptocurrency market experiencing sustained and intense downward pressure that could challenge Strategy’s financial position and plans.

For those invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding the broader macroeconomic landscape, particularly the traditional forex markets, is becoming increasingly vital. Today, the Asia FX outlook presents a compelling narrative of divergence: a general weakening across most Asian currencies contrasting sharply with a strengthening Japanese Yen. This dynamic scenario is largely driven by evolving rate cut expectations from major central banks and the distinct stance of the Bank of Japan. Let’s dive deeper into these pivotal movements and what they mean for the global currency markets . Asia FX Outlook: Navigating the Headwinds The majority of Asian currencies are currently experiencing a period of weakness. This trend is not isolated but rather a synchronized response to a significant recalibration of market expectations regarding future interest rate cuts, particularly from the U.S. Federal Reserve. As the likelihood of a December rate cut diminishes, the allure of higher-yielding U.S. assets strengthens, drawing capital away from emerging markets and putting downward pressure on Asian currencies. Several factors contribute to this challenging Asia FX outlook : Reduced Rate Cut Bets: The primary driver is the market’s reassessment of when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates. Strong U.S. economic data, including robust job reports and persistent inflation, has led investors to believe that rates will stay ‘higher for longer’. U.S. Dollar Strength: A stronger U.S. dollar, fueled by higher interest rates and its safe-haven status, makes it more expensive for countries to service dollar-denominated debt and impacts trade balances. Capital Outflows: As interest rate differentials widen in favor of the U.S., capital tends to flow out of Asian markets seeking better returns, weakening local currencies. Regional Economic Conditions: While some Asian economies show resilience, others face domestic challenges that exacerbate currency weakness in this global environment. Consider the performance of several key Asian currencies: Currency Recent Trend Key Influencers Korean Won (KRW) Weakening U.S. monetary policy, export performance Singapore Dollar (SGD) Mildly Weakening Global growth concerns, U.S. dollar strength Taiwan Dollar (TWD) Weakening Tech sector outlook, U.S. interest rates Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) Weakening Commodity prices, domestic politics, U.S. rates Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) Weakening U.S. monetary policy, foreign investment flows Philippine Peso (PHP) Weakening Inflation, remittances, U.S. interest rate outlook This widespread weakness underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and the significant influence of U.S. monetary policy on regional markets. For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions, even within the crypto space, as capital flows and risk appetite are deeply intertwined. Japanese Yen Forecast: The BOJ’s Hawkish Stance Amidst the general weakening of Asian currencies, the Japanese Yen forecast stands out as a notable exception. The Yen has shown signs of strength, primarily buoyed by recent hawkish minutes from the Bank of Japan (BOJ). This unexpected shift from a traditionally dovish central bank has sent clear signals to the market. What exactly do ‘hawkish BOJ minutes’ imply? Policy Normalization Hints: The minutes revealed discussions among BOJ policymakers about the potential for an earlier-than-expected end to the negative interest rate policy. This suggests a move towards policy normalization, a significant departure from years of ultra-loose monetary policy aimed at stimulating the economy and combating deflation. Inflationary Concerns: The BOJ appears to be acknowledging more persistent inflationary pressures within Japan, moving away from its long-held view that current inflation is temporary. This recognition paves the way for tighter monetary policy. Reduced Intervention Risk: A more hawkish stance could also reduce the perceived need for direct currency intervention by the Japanese authorities, as a stronger Yen would be a natural outcome of policy tightening. For years, the Yen has been a popular funding currency for ‘carry trades’ – borrowing in low-interest-rate Yen and investing in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. A shift in the BOJ policy towards tightening could unwind these trades, leading to a repatriation of capital back into Japan and further boosting the Yen. This creates a compelling scenario for the Japanese Yen forecast , as it moves against the prevailing trend in other Asian markets. The contrast between the BOJ’s potential tightening and the Federal Reserve’s ‘higher for longer’ stance, even if not directly cutting rates, creates a complex interplay. Investors are now keenly watching for any concrete moves from the BOJ, as a definitive end to negative rates would mark a historic turning point for one of the world’s major currencies. Rate Cut Expectations: Why December Hopes are Fading The narrative around rate cut expectations has undergone a significant transformation. Just a few months ago, market participants were pricing in multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, with some even anticipating a move as early as December. However, a series of robust economic indicators from the United States has largely extinguished these hopes. Key data points influencing this shift include: Strong Employment Data: Consistently low unemployment rates and solid job creation figures indicate a resilient labor market, suggesting the economy can withstand higher interest rates for longer. Persistent Inflation: While inflation has moderated from its peaks, it remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Policymakers are wary of cutting rates prematurely and risking a resurgence of inflationary pressures. Resilient Consumer Spending: Despite higher borrowing costs, consumer spending has held up well, further contributing to economic robustness. Federal Reserve Commentary: Recent statements from Fed officials have consistently reiterated a cautious approach, emphasizing data dependency and a willingness to maintain restrictive policy until inflation is firmly under control. This ‘higher for longer’ paradigm has profound implications. For Asian currencies, it means the interest rate differential with the U.S. dollar will likely remain wide, making it less attractive to hold non-U.S. dollar assets. This sustained pressure from the U.S. interest rate environment is a critical component of the current Asia FX outlook and will continue to shape the direction of capital flows. Understanding the nuances of these rate cut expectations is not just for forex traders; it informs the broader risk sentiment that can influence everything from equity markets to cryptocurrency valuations. When global liquidity tightens, and the cost of capital rises, speculative assets often feel the pinch. Global Currency Markets: Broader Implications and Volatility The interplay of weakening Asian currencies, a strengthening Yen, and recalibrated rate cut expectations creates a complex and dynamic environment across global currency markets . The U.S. Dollar remains a central player, its strength impacting virtually every other currency pair. The broader implications include: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding central bank policies and economic outlooks fuels currency volatility, creating both risks and opportunities for traders and investors. Impact on Trade: A strong U.S. dollar can make imports cheaper for U.S. consumers but makes U.S. exports more expensive, potentially affecting trade balances globally. For Asian economies, a weaker local currency can boost exports but makes imports, especially essential commodities priced in USD, more costly. Debt Servicing Challenges: Countries and corporations with significant dollar-denominated debt face higher repayment burdens when their local currency weakens against the U.S. dollar. Capital Allocation Shifts: Investors continuously re-evaluate their portfolios, moving capital to regions or assets that offer better risk-adjusted returns, leading to significant shifts in investment flows. The interconnectedness of these markets means that even if your primary interest is in digital assets, ignoring the traditional financial landscape is a risky proposition. Macroeconomic trends, driven by central bank actions and economic data, dictate the ebb and flow of liquidity and investor sentiment across all asset classes, including the crypto sphere. The current climate in global currency markets suggests a period of caution and strategic positioning. Challenges and Opportunities in This Evolving Landscape Every market shift brings both challenges and opportunities. For those monitoring the global currency markets , the current environment is no different. Challenges: Currency Risk: Businesses operating internationally face increased currency risk, requiring sophisticated hedging strategies. Inflationary Pressures: Weaker Asian currencies can lead to imported inflation, as goods priced in stronger currencies become more expensive locally. Economic Uncertainty: The divergence in central bank policies adds a layer of uncertainty to global economic forecasts, making long-term planning more difficult. Opportunities: Yen as a Safe Haven: The strengthening Japanese Yen forecast could position it as an attractive safe-haven asset, especially if global economic uncertainties persist. Strategic Investing: For investors with a long-term view, periods of currency weakness can present opportunities to acquire assets in certain Asian markets at a discount. Diversification: Understanding these dynamics allows for better portfolio diversification, potentially including non-traditional assets like certain cryptocurrencies that may act as hedges against traditional market volatility. Actionable Insights for Navigating Currency Volatility Given the current state of global currency markets , what can investors and businesses do? Stay Informed on Central Bank Policies: Keep a close eye on announcements from the Federal Reserve , Bank of Japan , and other major central banks. Their forward guidance on interest rates is a primary driver of currency movements. Monitor Economic Data: Key economic indicators like inflation, employment figures, and GDP growth in major economies provide clues about future monetary policy decisions. Consider Hedging Strategies: For businesses with international exposure, implementing currency hedging strategies can mitigate risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations. Diversify Portfolios: A diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies can help cushion against adverse currency movements. This includes considering how traditional forex trends might impact your crypto holdings. Consult Experts: For complex situations, seeking advice from financial advisors specializing in international markets can provide tailored insights. FAQs: Addressing Your Burning Questions Let’s clarify some common questions regarding the current currency market dynamics: Q1: What exactly are “hawkish BOJ minutes” and why are they important for the Japanese Yen forecast? A1: “Hawkish BOJ minutes” refer to the summary of discussions from the Bank of Japan’s policy meetings that indicate a more aggressive stance towards monetary tightening. They are important because they signal the BOJ’s potential willingness to raise interest rates or reduce stimulus, which typically strengthens the Japanese Yen by making it more attractive for investors. Q2: How do U.S. interest rates affect Asian currencies, impacting the Asia FX outlook? A2: Higher U.S. interest rates, as set by the Federal Reserve , make dollar-denominated assets more attractive compared to those in Asian markets. This leads to capital flowing out of Asia into the U.S., weakening most Asian currencies . This capital flight puts downward pressure on the Asia FX outlook . Q3: Is the Japanese Yen considered a safe-haven currency? A3: Yes, the Japanese Yen is traditionally considered a safe-haven currency. During times of global economic uncertainty or market stress, investors often flock to the Yen, along with the U.S. Dollar and Swiss Franc, seeking stability. The recent hawkish shift in BOJ policy could reinforce this status. Q4: What does “higher for longer” mean for global currency markets? A4: “Higher for longer” refers to the expectation that central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve , will maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period to combat inflation effectively. For global currency markets , this implies sustained strength for currencies with higher rates (like the USD) and continued pressure on currencies from economies where rates are lower or expected to fall, impacting capital flows and investment decisions. Q5: How might these forex trends indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets? A5: While not directly linked, traditional forex trends can influence cryptocurrency markets indirectly. A strong U.S. Dollar and tightening global liquidity (due to ‘higher for longer’ rates) can reduce risk appetite, potentially leading investors to pull capital from more speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, significant shifts in major currencies can prompt investors to seek alternative stores of value, sometimes benefiting digital assets. Understanding the global currency markets helps gauge overall market sentiment and liquidity conditions. Summary: Navigating the Complex Currents The current landscape of global currency markets is marked by a fascinating divergence. While most Asian currencies face headwinds from easing rate cut expectations and a strong U.S. dollar, the Japanese Yen forecast shines brighter due to a pivotal shift in BOJ policy . These movements are not just abstract financial data; they have profound implications for global trade, investment flows, and even the broader sentiment that influences asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating these complex currents and making sound financial decisions in an ever-evolving economic environment.

The token is still under pressure, dropping another 2% in the past 24 hours, bringing its weekly losses to 20%. Despite the downtrend, trading volume remains unusually high at $680 million, representing 29% of PEPE’s circulating market cap. Meanwhile, open interest (OI) in Pepe futures has plunged to its lowest point since April, according to CoinGlass – a sign that traders may be giving up just as the next big move brews. The last time OI was this low, PEPE reversed sharply, jumping 150% in just a few days . History may not repeat perfectly, but in crypto, it often rhymes. Pepe Price Prediction: 380% Gains Ahead if Traders Jump Back Into The Market The daily chart shows that PEPE has reacted positively upon hitting a key support at $0.0000055. This is near the level at which the token bottomed in April, and could favor a bullish outlook in the near term. A move toward $0.0000090 would set things in motion for PEPE and would already deliver some attractive gains for those who enter a long position at the current price. Meanwhile, if the rally accelerates toward $0.000012, that would set the stage for a full-blown recovery toward $0.000025, meaning p otential gains of 382% for PEPE by year’s end . Similarly, identifying the best early presales of this cycle could deliver big returns to investors. A Pepe-inspired mine-to-earn (M2E) game called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) could be one of those hidden gems that the market is starting to recognize. The presale has already raised over $2 million in a matter of weeks, with exchange listings coming soon. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Turns Meme Coin Mining Into a Fun and Rewarding Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is an interactive M2E game that makes it easy to launch a virtual mining operation. Players can easily l aunch virtual rigs and upgrade them to earn rewards in real time. As they climb the leaderboard, they participate for airdrops of top tokens like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) and Bonk ($BONK). Every upgrade triggers an automatic token burn of up to 70% of the tokens used, giving $PEPENODE a deflationary edge as players race to climb the scoreboard. In addition, the project’s staking rewards are also quite attractive, sitting at 627% per year at the time of writing. This explains why investors have poured more than $2 million into the project in just a few weeks. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, visit the official Pepenode website , and link up your favorite wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ). You can swap ETH or USDT for this token or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

These three tokens have been unable to escape the selloff, with all three down by double-digit percentages within the past week, as investors worldwide fear that this year’s AI-led stock bubble may burst. However, all three tokens remain as strong as ever in fundamental terms, and will rebound sharply soon enough, along with one new token in particular, which looks set to grow once it launches in the coming weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Launches Will Help Alt Surge from Hugely Oversold Position XRP is hovering in the $2.24 zone, which means that it’s down by 15% in a week and by 25% in a month. Despite these losses, the altcoin has rebounded from a 24-hour low of $2.09, suggesting that its support in the $2.10 region is holding up. And in the medium- and long-term, few coins are as promising as XRP, which should witness a big recovery once the first wave of XRP ETFs launches . This could be in a matter of weeks, while Ripple’s ongoing growth as a cross-border and stablecoin firm should help boost the coin into the New Year and beyond. Its chart today indicates that it may have begun bouncing from a bottom, with its relative strength index (yellow) starting to rise from an oversold 30. Source: TradingView Its MACD (orange, blue) remains below 0, yet it has risen in the past couple of days, a sign that XRP wants to recover. Assuming that the AI-related selloff doesn’t continue, and expecting XRP ETFs to arrive this month, we could therefore see the altcoin return to $3 in the next few weeks. From there, it could hit $4 in December, before rising higher in the New Year. Crypto Price Prediction: Bitcoin ($BTC) – Correction Will Clear Path for Climb Towards $150,000 Even Bitcoin hasn’t escaped today’s selloff, which has dragged it down to $101,686, a 2% loss in 24 hours. It’s also down by 10% in a week and by 18% in the past month, although it does retain a decent 47% gain in a year. And even with recent losses, Bitcoin arguably remains the strongest and most promising crypto in the market, with its attractiveness to institutions likely to support it for years to come. Its chart today suggests that BTC can’t really fall much further, seeing as how its RSI has just hit 30. Source: TradingView Likewise, its MACD also appears to have bottomed out, indicating that a rebound is now a matter of time. Bitcoin ETFs did experience around $945 million in outflows last week , a symptom of negative sentiment in the global financial market, yet this could also be a sign that selling has almost played out. If so, we could see the Bitcoin price return to $110,000 in the next couple of weeks, while the launch of altcoin ETFs could help boost the wider market, pushing it to $150,000 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – Altcoin Will Recover Strongly Amid Institutional and Corporate Investment Ethereum has fallen by 5% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $3,297 representing a 17% decline in a week and a 27% fall in a month. However, ETH has kept a 35% gain in the last 12 months, which has witnessed some significant institutional inflows into the altcoin. Indeed, Ethereum ETFs currently manage around $34.8 billion in assets , while this year has also witnessed significant growth in public companies buying ETH as a reserve asset. So when combined with Ethereum’s seemingly unassailable position as the biggest layer-one network in crypto, the future should be kind to the ETH price. We can see that its indicators are also bottoming out, again signalling that the coin should rebound strongly soon enough. Source: TradingView It will therefore be interesting to see whether its current support, at around the $3,200 level, can hold up in the next day or so. If ETH resists a decisive drop to $3,000, it will likely recover in a matter of weeks, with the launch of altcoin ETFs also helping to improve the mood of its investors. It could return to $4,000 by the beginning of December, before entering 2026 at around $5,000. PEPENODE Presale Raises $2 Million As Investors Await Launch of Crypto’s First Mine-to-Earn Token If traders want to maximize their exposure to potential gains, they may also want to diversify into newer coins and presale tokens, since these can outpace the market when they list on exchanges for the first time. Possibly the most interesting presale coin available right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that launched its sale in September. It has already raised in excess of $2 million, providing a clear indication of its potential. Gonna need some power tools for a bag this heavy https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/2YssmFbjm2 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 4, 2025 PEPENODE’s unique selling point is that it’s a mine-to-earn token, providing users with the opportunity to build and earn from their own virtual mining rigs. To build their own rigs, all they need to do is spend PEPENODE on acquiring mining nodes, with more nodes providing greater rewards. The platform pays out rewards in external coins such as Fartcoin and Pepe, providing users with a strong incentive to acquire more PEPENODE. As such, it could experience steady price growth over time, helped along by the fact that you can also stake it for a regular yield. Its sale doesn’t have that long left to run, and investors can join it by going to the PEPENODE website. The token currently costs $0.0011317, but investors should act quickly, since this price will rise regularly until the sale ends.

Just as a crypto exchange thrives on user interaction and retention, traditional consumer brands need powerful tools to connect with their audience. This is precisely where MoEngage , a leading customer engagement platform, steps in, and its recent funding round, led by existing investor Goldman Sachs Alternatives, marks a significant milestone. This investment not only validates MoEngage’s innovative approach but also signals a strategic push towards deeper global reach and advanced AI capabilities, impacting how brands interact with customers worldwide. Goldman Sachs’ Strategic Bet on MoEngage’s Future The financial world has taken note of MoEngage’s impressive trajectory, culminating in a substantial Series F funding round. Goldman Sachs Alternatives, an existing and deeply informed investor, has doubled down on its commitment, leading this latest round. This move saw $100 million in shares change hands, with approximately 60% allocated to primary investment and 40% to secondary transactions. The round also welcomed a new prominent investor, Indian venture firm A91 Partners , further diversifying MoEngage’s financial backing. This significant infusion of capital brings MoEngage’s total funding to an impressive $250 million. For a company, especially a startup, having a major financial institution like Goldman Sachs lead successive funding rounds is a powerful endorsement of its business fundamentals and future potential. As Raviteja Dodda , co-founder and CEO of MoEngage, noted, existing investors possess the most comprehensive understanding of a company’s performance, making their continued leadership a strong validation. The investment will primarily fuel two key areas: accelerating MoEngage’s global expansion and enhancing its already robust AI capabilities. This strategic direction positions MoEngage to capitalize on the increasing demand for personalized and efficient customer interaction across diverse markets. Why the Focus on AI Marketing? In today’s crowded digital ecosystem, consumer brands face an unprecedented challenge: cutting through the noise to capture and retain customer attention. This intense competition has driven a critical need for more sophisticated, data-driven marketing strategies. Companies are increasingly leveraging their first-party customer data to deliver highly personalized marketing messages and experiences. While established marketing platforms have long served this space, there’s a growing demand for AI-driven tools that can automate decision-making, optimize campaign performance, and significantly reduce manual effort. This is precisely the gap MoEngage aims to fill with its innovative Merlin AI suite. Merlin AI is designed to empower marketing and product teams to: Launch campaigns faster and more efficiently. Improve targeting accuracy and personalization. Automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for strategic initiatives. MoEngage has invested heavily in generative AI and decisioning AI capabilities over the past two to three years. These efforts are embodied in Merlin AI, which offers a range of AI agents tailored for various marketing use cases. These agents can function as virtual copywriters, assisting brands in drafting compelling marketing messages, generating multiple campaign variants, and even creating natural language text paired with relevant images. Furthermore, the suite includes decisioning AI tools that intelligently determine the optimal customer, channel, and time for delivering specific messages or offers, ensuring maximum impact. This focus on advanced AI Marketing is not just a trend; it’s a necessity for brands looking to thrive in the digital age. By providing tools that automate and personalize at scale, MoEngage helps brands engage more effectively and build stronger customer relationships. MoEngage’s Phenomenal Global Expansion Journey MoEngage’s journey from a regional player to a global powerhouse is a testament to its scalable platform and strategic vision. For its initial seven years, the 11-year-old startup primarily focused on the markets of India and Southeast Asia. However, over the past four years, MoEngage has aggressively pursued global expansion , successfully establishing a significant footprint in new markets. North America has emerged as a particularly strong growth engine, now contributing over 30% of MoEngage’s total revenue. Europe and the Middle East collectively account for approximately 25% of the business, with India and Southeast Asia making up the remaining 45%. This diversified revenue base highlights the platform’s adaptability and appeal across different cultural and economic landscapes. The renewed backing from Goldman Sachs in this latest funding round is expected to further accelerate MoEngage’s global presence. This strategic capital will enable the company to invest more heavily in market penetration, localize its offerings, and scale its operational capabilities in key growth regions. MoEngage currently operates across 75 countries, serving a diverse portfolio of consumer brands. This global reach is crucial for MoEngage’s mission to become a dominant customer engagement platform . By expanding its operational footprint and customer success teams in North America and Europe, MoEngage aims to deepen its relationships with international clients and capture a larger share of the global market. The Power of a Unified Customer Engagement Platform What truly sets MoEngage apart is its ability to serve as a unified Customer Engagement Platform , consolidating disparate marketing tools into a single, cohesive solution. This approach resonates strongly with modern brands, many of whom previously relied on a fragmented ecosystem of point solutions for specific tasks, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs. MoEngage currently serves over 1,350 consumer brands worldwide, encompassing a wide array of industries. Its impressive client roster includes global giants like SoundCloud , McAfee , Kayak , Domino’s , Deutsche Telekom , and Travelodge . In India, it boasts prominent household names such as Swiggy , Flipkart , Ola , Airtel , and Tata . The platform’s versatility extends to the financial sector, working with more than 25 global banks and several large insurers, including JPMorgan Chase , Citibank , and India’s largest insurer, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) . This diverse client base underscores MoEngage’s capability to cater to both traditional enterprises (accounting for 60% of its business) and internet-focused firms (40%). Many of these brands previously relied on legacy marketing platforms from incumbents like Adobe , Oracle , and Salesforce . MoEngage has successfully won over more than 300 of these clients, a key driver of its growth in North America and the EMEA regions. A notable example is SoundCloud, which migrated over 120 million users to MoEngage within just 12 weeks. Hope Barrett , senior director of martech at SoundCloud, highlighted how the platform’s AI-driven insights accelerated product launches and enhanced retention among paid users. By unifying customer data from all touchpoints – including offline stores, websites, and mobile apps – MoEngage enables brands to gain a holistic view of their customers. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for delivering truly personalized and impactful engagements. MoEngage’s Vision: Growth and IPO Readiness MoEngage is not just resting on its laurels; it has ambitious plans for sustained growth and market leadership. The company reported approximately 40% year-over-year growth last year and aims to maintain a robust 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) this year. Furthermore, MoEngage expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA-positive status on a quarterly basis by the end of the current fiscal year, demonstrating a clear path to profitability. While MoEngage acknowledges competition from companies like Braze and CleverTap , as well as the legacy marketing clouds, its focus on AI-driven personalization and a unified platform gives it a distinct edge. The company currently employs about 800 individuals across 15 global offices and plans to expand its workforce, particularly in North America and Europe. This expansion will focus on scaling customer success, support, sales, and marketing teams to deepen its market presence. In addition to workforce expansion, MoEngage intends to continue investing in building advanced AI Marketing capabilities and hiring top talent to support these efforts. The long-term vision for MoEngage is clear: to become IPO-ready within the next couple of years. Raviteja Dodda expressed confidence in the company’s potential, stating, “We see an opportunity to build a multi-billion dollar revenue company in our space.” Summary: A New Era for Customer Engagement The latest funding round, spearheaded by Goldman Sachs , underscores the immense potential of MoEngage as a pivotal Customer Engagement Platform . With a strategic focus on AI Marketing and an aggressive roadmap for global expansion , MoEngage is poised to redefine how brands connect with their customers. Its ability to unify data, automate personalization, and deliver tangible results for a diverse range of clients, from tech giants to global banks, positions it as a leader in the evolving martech landscape.

Analysts Weigh the Possibility,https://timestabloid.com/could-xrp-revolutionize-corporate-treasury-and-fx-hedging-analysts-weigh-the-possibility/,"The possibility of corporate treasuries using XRP to manage foreign exchange (FX) exposure has become a growing topic of interest among financial analysts. As multinational corporations face increasing currency volatility, digital assets like XRP could eventually play a role in improving the speed and efficiency of FX transactions. However, such adoption remains theoretical at this stage. Global FX Hedging Practices FX hedging is a core function for companies that operate internationally, helping them protect earnings from currency fluctuations. Data from Milltech covering the 2024–2025 period shows that 86% of European corporations and 82% of North American firms currently hedge their currency exposure. On a global scale, the average hedge ratio stands at 48%, meaning roughly half of global FX risk is actively managed. Larger firms, particularly those listed in the FTSE 350 or major U.S. indices, typically operate comprehensive hedging programs. Conversely, companies that neglected FX protection experienced significant losses; around three-quarters of unhedged firms suffered financial setbacks in 2024. Traditional hedging instruments remain dominant in treasury operations. Forward contracts represent 60–70% of all hedging activity, while options and swaps account for 15–20% and 10–15%, respectively. A smaller share, typically 20–40%, comes from “natural” hedging, matching revenues and expenses in the same currency. Despite this, many organizations continue to face challenges such as high operational costs, complex reporting requirements, and increased risk when dealing with emerging market currencies. Exploring XRP for Corporate Treasury Use According to Reuters , global hedgeable assets tied to the U.S. dollar total roughly $33 trillion, but a large proportion remains unhedged. Treasury experts suggest that as global financial flows expand, companies will seek faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional methods. This has sparked early discussions about whether digital assets like XRP could be used to streamline cross-border FX management. In a hypothetical model, corporations could allocate 5–10% of their cash reserves to XRP and use the XRP Ledger (XRPL) or RippleNet for international payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These transactions settle in three to five seconds, often at negligible fees, and could significantly reduce settlement delays and transaction costs. In practice, firms might convert receivables or payables into XRP, transfer the tokens across borders almost instantly, and then convert them back into their target currencies. This process would minimize the time funds remain exposed to exchange rate movements. However, analysts caution that XRP’s annualized volatility of 50–100% makes it considerably riskier than major fiat currencies, which typically fluctuate between 5–15%. For this reason, XRP is presently more suitable as a liquidity and payment medium than as a direct hedging tool. Potential Market Impact on XRP To estimate what such adoption could mean for XRP’s price, Google’s Gemini AI simulated a scenario in which corporate treasuries adopted XRP for part of the $200 billion annual global FX hedging activity. Based on its current market capitalization of around $136.31 billion and a circulating supply of 60.1 billion tokens, Gemini projected that XRP’s value could rise to approximately $25 per token, corresponding to a $1.5 trillion market capitalization. The model further indicated that if institutional use expanded in parallel with retail demand, and if liquidity constraints or spot ETF approvals amplified buying pressure, XRP’s market value could surge even higher. In such a case, Gemini estimated a potential price range between $90 and $120, implying a total market cap of $5.4 to $7.2 trillion. While the idea of corporate treasuries adopting XRP for FX hedging remains speculative, the concept reflects growing interest in integrating blockchain solutions into traditional finance.

Meme coins as a group have been hit hard recently, dropping 37% after President Trump shocked markets by imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. That said, BONK could be one of the first to recover. Its value may have plunged, but so has selling pressure – and its strong community, consistent burns, and real-world utility set it apart. The token’s LetsBonk.fun launchpad is now Solana’s third-largest, with $2 billion in 30-day volume and nearly 12% of the market share. Transaction fees from the launchpad are used to burn BONK, driving long-term scarcity and making every bounce more explosive. Bonk Price Prediction: BONK Could Gain 112% If It Bounces Off This Level Looking at the daily chart, BONK has dropped to a key support at $0.00001150. The last time the token hit this mark, it bounced strongly, delivering gains of 231% in less than a month. History doesn’t necessarily repeat, but it often rhymes. If buying pressure accelerates as BONK hits this mark again, we could expect a significant uptick moving forward. The market may have exaggerated its reaction to last week’s comments from the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. If it starts to recover from this point, BONK could rise to at least $0.000025, meaning a 112% upside potential. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) would have to start climbing above the 14-day moving average and past the mid-line to confirm a bullish outlook. Apart from Bonk, a new crypto presale called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has been raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors to launch a community-centered token that fully embodies the “up only” attitude characteristic of bull markets. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings Traders Together and Raises $4M In The Process Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the spirit of Dogecoin and infuses some of the adrenaline that comes with leveraged trading. This meme coin hosts a community of retail traders who love taking bold positions — the kind that define crypto bull markets. By holding $MAXI, users gain their way into a thriving community where they can share strategies , insights , and setups with peer ‘degens’. The project will also host weekly challenges like Max Gains and Max Ripped, where top performers earn bragging rights and special rewards. In addition, through the Maxi Fund, up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will be invested into the most promising tokens of the cycle, and the earnings will be reinvested in marketing to make Maxi Doge a viral sensation. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, visit the official Maxi Doge website , and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this meme coin or use a bank card instead.

The highly anticipated XPLA token name change to CONX has officially passed, securing a remarkable 100% approval from its dedicated community. This significant development marks a pivotal new chapter for the digital asset associated with the Com2uS Holdings blockchain mainnet. While the token is getting a fresh identity, it’s crucial to understand that the underlying mainnet’s name and the total token supply will remain exactly as they are. This unanimous decision highlights strong community support and a clear, forward-thinking vision for the future of the project. Why Did the Community Unanimously Approve the XPLA Token Name Change ? The proposal for the XPLA token name change to CONX received overwhelming and complete support, indicating a powerful consensus within the XPLA ecosystem. While the specific, detailed rationale for the rebranding initiative wasn’t extensively publicized in the initial announcement, such strategic changes in the cryptocurrency space often aim to achieve several key objectives: Enhance Brand Identity: A new, distinct name can provide a fresh, more memorable brand image. This can make the token stand out and be more easily recognized in the increasingly crowded and competitive crypto market. Improve Market Clarity: Sometimes, a name change can help effectively differentiate the token from other similar-sounding projects or prevent potential confusion with existing brands, thereby simplifying its market positioning. Align with Future Vision: The chosen new name, CONX, might better reflect the long-term goals, upcoming partnerships, or significant technological advancements planned for the XPLA mainnet. It could signal a new direction or focus. The perfect 100% approval rate powerfully underscores the community’s profound trust in the development team’s strategic direction and commitment. This move is a testament to active, decentralized governance and a unified approach to evolving the blockchain’s overall presence and appeal. What Does the Introduction of the CONX Token Mean for Current Holders? For existing holders of the XPLA token, this significant change primarily involves a new label for their digital assets. It’s absolutely crucial to understand that the fundamental aspects of the blockchain infrastructure remain stable and unchanged. The mainnet itself will continue to operate robustly under its original XPLA name, ensuring seamless continuity for developers and users who interact with the underlying technology and decentralized applications (dApps). Furthermore, one of the most reassuring aspects is that the total token supply will not be altered. This means there will be no dilution of value or inflationary impact solely due to this name change, preserving the economic integrity of the asset. The transition to CONX is widely expected to be smooth and largely automatic. Users will likely observe their XPLA tokens being automatically updated to CONX on all supported cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets. However, as always, it is prudent to stay well-informed by diligently checking official announcements from XPLA and your preferred trading or storage platforms. Navigating the Transition: Key Takeaways from the XPLA Token Name Change The successful passage of this proposal represents a monumental step forward for the XPLA ecosystem. But what are the practical implications and key considerations for everyone involved? Users, developers, and enthusiasts should be keenly aware of a few important points during this transition: Mainnet Stability: The core XPLA blockchain infrastructure, which diligently underpins the entire ecosystem, proudly retains its original name. This guarantees vital stability for all existing and future dApps and services built upon it. Tokenomics Unaffected: The total number of tokens in circulation remains absolutely constant, meticulously preserving the established economic model and value proposition of the asset. Platform Updates: Reputable cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallet providers will be diligently implementing the name change. Users are strongly advised to monitor official communications from these platforms regarding the specific timeline and process for the transition. Unified Community: The remarkable 100% approval clearly demonstrates a highly engaged, unified, and supportive community. This is an incredibly positive indicator for the project’s future development, widespread adoption, and long-term success. This strategic shift powerfully highlights the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the crypto space, where projects consistently adapt and refine their strategies to better serve their communities and optimize their market positioning. The XPLA team, backed by the robust Com2uS Holdings, is clearly committed to continually refining its brand and vision as it moves confidently forward. The unanimous decision regarding the XPLA token name change to CONX is a powerful statement of community alignment, strategic foresight, and a shared vision for the future. This pivotal transition, while fundamentally changing the token’s identity, meticulously maintains the integrity and stability of the underlying blockchain and its supply. It represents a bold and decisive step towards establishing a clearer, potentially more impactful brand presence for the asset within the broader and highly competitive crypto landscape.

The latest data from the top three crypto futures exchanges by open interest offers a fascinating glimpse, revealing a slight, yet crucial , short bias in Bitcoin perpetuals . This trend suggests more traders are currently betting on a price decline rather than an increase for BTC. What Are Bitcoin Perpetuals Telling Us About Current Market Sentiment? Recent 24-hour long/short ratios for Bitcoin perpetuals futures on leading exchanges provide clear insights. Across Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit, shorts hold a noticeable edge. This indicates a prevailing cautious or bearish sentiment among a significant portion of traders. Overall Market: Longs account for 48.29%, while shorts stand at 51.71%. Binance: The ratio is 48.72% long to 51.28% short. Gate.io: A stronger short presence at 47.71% long to 52.29% short. Bybit: Similar to Gate.io, with 47.96% long to 52.04% short. This consistent pattern across major platforms highlights a unified, albeit slight, lean towards bearish positions. Understanding these ratios is key for anyone trying to gauge immediate market direction. Decoding the Short Bias: Why Are Traders Betting Against BTC? A slight short bias in Bitcoin perpetuals often reflects a prevailing market sentiment where traders anticipate a downward price movement. What drives this outlook? Factors range from broader macroeconomic concerns to specific technical analysis indicators suggesting potential resistance or corrections. Traders might be reacting to: Global economic uncertainties impacting investor confidence. Anticipated regulatory changes affecting the crypto market. Technical chart patterns indicating bearish signals. Profit-taking after recent rallies, leading to short positions for hedging or speculation. These ratios represent a snapshot of trader positioning, not a guaranteed future outcome. However, they offer valuable context regarding collective market psychology. Navigating Market Sentiment: How Can You Use Bitcoin Perpetuals Data? For both seasoned and new traders, understanding the long/short ratio for Bitcoin perpetuals can be a powerful tool. While not a standalone signal, it serves as an excellent sentiment indicator. When shorts hold an edge, it suggests many participants believe the path of least resistance for BTC is downwards, at least in the short term. Consider these actionable insights: Confirmation Tool: Use the ratio to confirm or challenge your existing market bias. Risk Management: A dominant short position could indicate higher volatility. Adjust stop-loss orders or position sizes. Contrarian Play: An overwhelming sentiment can sometimes lead to a “short squeeze” if the price moves unexpectedly upwards. Always combine this data with other analytical tools, such as on-chain metrics, technical analysis, and fundamental news, for a comprehensive trading strategy. Understanding the Risks and Rewards of Bitcoin Perpetuals Trading Trading Bitcoin perpetuals comes with inherent risks, especially given their leveraged nature. While offering potential for significant gains, substantial losses, including liquidation, are ever-present. The slight short bias we observe means many traders are taking on this risk, betting on a price dip. Key considerations for traders include: Leverage: High leverage amplifies both profits and losses. Manage it carefully. Funding Rates: These can make holding a position costly, especially if the market moves against you. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to rapid changes in sentiment. Educating yourself on these mechanisms is crucial before engaging in perpetual futures trading. The current short edge reminds us of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. In conclusion, the consistent slight short bias in Bitcoin perpetuals across major exchanges is a compelling indicator of current market sentiment. It highlights a cautious, if not bearish, outlook among a significant segment of traders. While not a definitive forecast, this crucial data point should be integrated into any robust market analysis, offering a deeper understanding of the collective mood surrounding Bitcoin’s immediate future. Traders are encouraged to use this information as part of a broader strategy, always prioritizing risk management and continuous learning.

The crypto world is no stranger to dramatic price movements, and recently, Momentum (MMT) delivered one of the most astonishing performances. We’re talking about an incredible MMT surge that saw its value skyrocket by a staggering 1330% on Binance. This phenomenal rally has captured the attention of traders and investors alike, highlighting the volatile yet potentially rewarding nature of the digital asset market. Let’s dive deeper into what fueled this rapid ascent and what it means for Momentum. What Fueled This Incredible MMT Surge? The numbers behind this MMT surge are truly eye-opening. Momentum (MMT) recently traded at $1.43 against USDT on Binance. This valuation represents an approximate 1330% increase, a truly remarkable feat in such a short span. To put this into perspective, MMT’s public sale on Biddle Pad was priced at $0.25. The current price is a significant 5.7-fold increase from that initial offering. Furthermore, for those who participated in the Binance Wallet Prime sale, where MMT was available for just $0.10, the current price signifies an astonishing 14.3-fold return. Such a rapid appreciation often follows a major listing on a top-tier exchange like Binance, which provides immense liquidity and exposure to a global audience. The immediate impact of this visibility can be profound. Decoding Momentum (MMT): Beyond the Price Action While the price action is undoubtedly exciting, it’s important to understand the project behind the ticker. Momentum (MMT) is a digital asset, typically associated with a specific blockchain project or ecosystem. These projects often aim to solve real-world problems or introduce innovative solutions within the decentralized space. For instance, MMT could be a utility token powering a new DeFi protocol, a governance token for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), or even a medium of exchange within a gaming metaverse. The specifics of Momentum’s underlying technology and use cases are crucial for its long-term viability, beyond just the initial MMT surge . Strong fundamentals, an active development team, and a vibrant community are key indicators of a project’s potential to sustain growth after an initial pump. Therefore, looking beyond the immediate price movement is always a wise approach. The Binance Effect: A Catalyst for Explosive Growth Why is a Binance listing so impactful, often leading to an MMT surge or similar price rallies? Binance is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, boasting millions of users and immense trading volume. A listing on such a platform instantly grants a project unparalleled access to a vast pool of potential investors and traders. This exposure dramatically increases a token’s liquidity, making it easier for users to buy and sell. Moreover, a Binance listing often lends credibility and trust to a project, attracting more attention from the broader crypto community. The phenomenon of a ‘Binance pump’ is well-known, as new listings frequently see significant price appreciation shortly after going live on the exchange. It’s a powerful demonstration of how exchange listings can act as a crucial catalyst for market movements, sometimes leading to truly explosive growth. Navigating the Volatility: Opportunities and Potential Pitfalls While the recent MMT surge presents clear opportunities, it also comes with inherent risks. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and rapid gains can often be followed by swift corrections. Understanding both sides of the coin is essential for any investor. Opportunities: Significant Returns for Early Investors: Those who bought MMT during its public or prime sales have seen remarkable profits. Increased Project Visibility: The surge brings Momentum (MMT) into the spotlight, attracting more users and developers to its ecosystem. Funding for Development: Increased market capitalization can provide the project team with more resources for future innovation and expansion. Potential Pitfalls: High Volatility: Prices can drop as quickly as they rise, leading to potential losses for those who buy at the peak. Risk of ‘Pump and Dump’: Some initial surges can be driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental value, leading to eventual crashes. Market Corrections: Even fundamentally strong projects can experience pullbacks after massive rallies. It is crucial to approach such high-flying assets with caution and a well-thought-out strategy. What Does the Future Hold for Momentum (MMT)? The future of Momentum (MMT) will depend on several factors beyond its initial MMT surge . The project’s ability to deliver on its roadmap, build a robust ecosystem, and foster a strong community will be paramount. Investors should consider the following actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Delve into Momentum’s whitepaper, team, technology, and partnerships. Understand the Use Case: How does MMT provide value within its ecosystem? Is there a sustainable demand for its utility? Monitor Development: Keep an eye on project updates, new features, and community engagement. Invest Responsibly: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Ultimately, sustained growth in the crypto space is built on innovation, utility, and community support, not just speculative trading. In conclusion, the recent MMT surge on Binance is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such rapid gains can be exhilarating, they also underscore the importance of diligent research and a balanced investment approach. Momentum’s journey will be fascinating to watch as it navigates the post-surge landscape, aiming to convert short-term hype into long-term value. Always remember to prioritize informed decisions in your crypto endeavors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Momentum (MMT)? Momentum (MMT) is a digital asset or cryptocurrency token associated with a specific blockchain project. While the exact details of its utility vary, it typically serves a purpose within its ecosystem, such as facilitating transactions, enabling governance, or providing access to services. 2. Why did MMT surge on Binance? The primary driver for the MMT surge was likely its listing on Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This listing provided MMT with immense liquidity, exposure to millions of traders, and increased credibility, leading to significant price discovery and investor interest. 3. Is it too late to invest in MMT after such a massive surge? Whether it’s too late to invest depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. While early investors saw phenomenal returns, buying after a significant surge carries higher risk due to potential price corrections. It’s crucial to conduct your own research and assess the project’s long-term potential rather than chasing short-term gains. 4. What are the risks associated with investing in volatile cryptocurrencies like MMT? Investing in highly volatile cryptocurrencies like MMT involves risks such as rapid price drops, market manipulation (e.g., pump and dump schemes), and potential loss of capital. Always invest only what you can afford to lose and consider diversifying your portfolio. 5. How can I research MMT further? To research MMT, you should look for its official website, whitepaper, project roadmap, and social media channels. Explore its use case, team background, partnerships, and community sentiment. Reputable crypto news sites and analytics platforms can also provide valuable insights. Did you find this article insightful?

Recent data from the Strategic ETH Reserve reveals a startling reality for two Nasdaq-listed companies, Bitmine and SharpLink, which are grappling with substantial unrealized ETH losses . Their combined paper losses on Ethereum holdings have reached an astonishing $2.57 billion, a figure that certainly captures attention across the market. Understanding the Scale of Unrealized ETH Losses When we talk about unrealized ETH losses , we’re referring to a situation where the current market value of an asset is lower than its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. For companies like Bitmine and SharpLink, heavily invested in Ethereum, these figures represent a significant paper setback. Let’s break down the numbers: Bitmine: This company holds approximately 3.4 million ETH. With an average purchase price of $4,037, their current holdings, valued at $11.32 billion, reflect an unrealized loss of $2.4 billion. This is a substantial sum, highlighting the risks involved in large-scale crypto investments. SharpLink: Holding 860,000 ETH, SharpLink’s average purchase price stands at $3,609. Their current valuation of $2.86 billion translates into an unrealized loss of $170 million. While smaller than Bitmine’s, it is still a significant amount for any corporation. What Do These Unrealized ETH Losses Mean for Investors? The concept of unrealized ETH losses is crucial for investors to understand. It signifies that while the companies haven’t sold their assets at a loss yet, the current market conditions would result in a loss if they were to liquidate their positions. This can impact investor sentiment and potentially influence future strategic decisions. For Bitmine and SharpLink, these figures reflect a period where Ethereum’s market price has dipped below their acquisition costs. Such situations often prompt questions about portfolio management, risk assessment, and long-term investment strategies in the crypto space. Navigating Market Volatility and Institutional Holdings The cryptocurrency market is known for its dramatic price swings. Companies that hold large amounts of digital assets, like Ethereum, are directly exposed to this volatility. Managing such substantial holdings requires a robust strategy, often involving hedging, diversification, or simply a long-term conviction in the asset’s future. The fact that these are Nasdaq-listed companies further emphasizes the growing intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies brings both capital and credibility, but it also exposes these firms to the unique risks of the crypto market, including the potential for significant unrealized ETH losses during downturns. The Path Forward: What’s Next for Bitmine and SharpLink? While the current situation highlights substantial unrealized ETH losses , it is important to remember that these are not realized losses until the assets are sold. Companies often hold digital assets with a long-term view, anticipating future price appreciation. However, sustained periods of unrealized losses can put pressure on financial statements and investor relations. It will be interesting to observe how Bitmine and SharpLink manage their ETH portfolios going forward. Their strategies could involve holding through the downturn, potentially averaging down their purchase price, or even re-evaluating their crypto exposure based on market outlooks. This scenario serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rewards associated with institutional cryptocurrency investments. Conclusion The $2.57 billion in combined unrealized ETH losses faced by Bitmine and SharpLink underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. For investors and market watchers, this situation offers a valuable case study in institutional crypto exposure, market volatility, and the strategic decisions companies must make when navigating significant paper losses. It’s a vivid illustration that even the most prominent players are not immune to the market’s ebb and flow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are unrealized ETH losses? A1: Unrealized ETH losses occur when the current market price of Ethereum (ETH) falls below the price at which a company or individual purchased it. These are ‘paper losses’ because the asset has not yet been sold. Q2: How much ETH does Bitmine hold, and what is their unrealized loss? A2: Bitmine holds approximately 3.4 million ETH with an average purchase price of $4,037, resulting in an estimated unrealized loss of $2.4 billion. Q3: What is SharpLink’s unrealized ETH loss? A3: SharpLink holds 860,000 ETH with an average purchase price of $3,609, leading to an estimated unrealized loss of $170 million. Q4: Do unrealized losses impact a company’s financial statements? A4: While not a cash outflow, unrealized losses can impact a company’s balance sheet by reducing the reported value of its assets. They can also influence investor perception and future investment decisions. Q5: What could cause such significant unrealized ETH losses? A5: Significant unrealized ETH losses are typically caused by a downturn in the cryptocurrency market, where the price of Ethereum drops considerably below the average acquisition cost of large holders.

Related Reading: ‘Good News’ Finally Arrives For SHIB Army As Team Unveils New Update He argued the ledger’s payment features make it a practical tool for moving money across borders. His remarks come as several big fund managers update filings for potential XRP exchange-traded funds, and as traders watch for approvals that may arrive as soon as mid-November. XRP Ledger Framed As Payment Rails McClurg drew on his background as an emerging-market bond manager when he pointed to high remittance costs as a clear problem. Workers often pay between 8% and 15% to send money home, he said. Blockchain rails like the XRPL can cut those fees, the CEO added, and that use case is part of why he believes institutional interest will grow. He also repeated a prediction he has made before: that XRP ETFs could see $10 billion in inflows in their first month if they launch with strong backing.

Franklin removed an 8(a) clause from its S-1, a change that reduces a procedural reason for delay. Grayscale has filed a second amendment and has named key executives and counsel on its paperwork. Market participants say these moves suggest managers are preparing for a possible rollout in November, though SEC timing still matters. Payments Utility Versus Investment Structure McClurg argued that XRP’s role as a payments token gives it a different profile from assets that rely on staking. He suggested ETF holders would not face the tradeoff of missing staking yields, which has affected some Ethereum products. That claim is used to explain why an XRP ETF might attract distinct flows, rather than simply following the path of prior crypto funds. Ecosystem Bets And Industry Players Ripple has pushed XRPL-focused products such as RLUSD and institutional services under the Ripple Prime brand. Reports mention partnerships with GTreasury and Rail to boost clearing and custody capabilities. Those efforts are designed to make XRPL more useful for banks and large treasuries that need predictable settlement and custody options.

The sharp decline reflects mounting fear across the market as aggressive selling pressure forces short-term holders to capitulate. What began as a controlled retracement has quickly evolved into panic-driven behavior, with traders rushing to exit risk exposure. As volatility spikes and sentiment deteriorates, market participants are closely monitoring key support levels to assess whether Bitcoin can stabilize or whether a deeper downside is still ahead. According to top on-chain analyst Axel Adler, loss-making transactions among short-term holders are surging during this downturn. The 7-day Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR) currently sits at 0.9904, indicating that most coins moved by newer holders are being sold at a loss. This sustained breakdown below the critical parity level (1.0) signals that reactive market participants are offloading positions under stress, reinforcing the narrative of fear and liquidation-driven selling. While this surge in realized losses highlights panic behavior, it also historically occurs near cycle stress points where weaker hands exit the market. The coming days will determine whether this capitulation pressure exhausts sellers — or whether further losses still lie ahead. Short-Term Holder Stress Rising, But Not at Capitulation Levels Yet Axel Adler highlights that although Bitcoin is under meaningful sell pressure, current on-chain stress has not yet reached full capitulation. The STH-SOPR Z-score sits at −1.29, signaling growing loss realization among short-term holders. This negative reading confirms mounting sell-side momentum, yet Adler notes that the stress level is still moderate compared to previous major flushes. For context, during the heavy correction in August 2024, the STH-SOPR dropped to 0.9752 with a Z-score of −2.43 — a reading consistent with deep capitulation. By comparison, today’s metrics reflect pain and fear, but not a full exhaustion of sellers. This important distinction suggests the market may still be in the middle phase of its correction rather than at its terminal point. Data also shows a steady climb in loss-making activity over recent weeks, illustrating a sustained shift in sentiment as traders unwind positions. While the SOPR momentarily flipped above parity to 1.0005 at the end of October — hinting at attempted recovery — renewed selling in early November quickly invalidated that momentum. Still, metrics have not yet revisited previous extremes. In essence, the market remains under pressure, but the classic wash-out signal of complete capitulation has not fully triggered — leaving room for either further downside, or a potential stabilization should buyers reclaim control. Price Action Analysis: Testing Deep Support After Sharp Breakdown Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize after a sharp breakdown that sent the price below the psychological $100,000 level. The daily chart shows a notable acceleration in selling momentum, with multiple long-bodied bearish candles forming on rising volume — a clear sign of aggressive distribution. After losing the $110,000 region last week, buyers failed to defend the cluster of support around the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, resulting in a swift move down toward deeper demand. Price briefly dipped under $99,000 before reclaiming the area, suggesting initial buyer interest near these lower supports. However, the recovery so far lacks strength, with candles closing weak and the 50-day and 200-day moving averages now sloping downward above price — a structurally bearish alignment for the short term. The prior key demand zone around $105,000–$107,000 has flipped into resistance, and Bitcoin must reclaim this range to shift momentum. For now, BTC trades in a vulnerable posture, and failure to build support above $100,000 could expose the next liquidity pocket toward $96,000–$98,000. Still, the sharp volume spike at the lows may indicate early accumulation attempts. A sustained bounce requires buyers to step in decisively and defend current levels as the market tests conviction under stress.

His remarks were part of an ongoing discussion within the XRP community that began after the Balancer protocol hack, which sparked broader debates about blockchain design and network security. The XRPL’s Design Philosophy During the discussion, an XRP community member questioned Schwartz about whether mechanisms such as token burns or growing institutional demand, potentially from a future Grayscale XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , could strengthen the XRPL’s long-term security and participation incentives. In response, Schwartz outlined his view of the ledger’s core philosophy, emphasizing that the XRPL’s main function is utility, not speculation. I think three things: 1) Greater adoption and use of XRPL will add value to XRP because of its privileged place on the ledger. It's the only asset with no counterparty that anyone can hold. It's jurisdictionless. It's favored by autobridging. 2) If what you really care about is… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) November 4, 2025 He explained that the value of XRP arises primarily from how widely the ledger is used, not from artificial efforts to raise its price. As more participants adopt the XRPL for payments and liquidity operations, XRP’s demand naturally grows because it functions as the bridge asset that connects various currencies on the network. This position makes XRP distinct, as it operates without a central issuer, governing body, or national affiliation, unlike fiat-backed or corporate-backed tokens. Schwartz on Price, Stability, and Functionality Schwartz further noted that price fluctuations in the short and medium term are less dependent on the network’s utility and more on market stability, user trust, and the asset’s technical strengths. He emphasized four attributes that give XRP resilience, scarcity, fungibility, resistance to censorship, and ease of transfer and storage. Importantly, he reiterated that the XRPL’s original developers, himself included, did not build the network with the intention of increasing XRP’s market price. The project was meant to establish a secure and efficient infrastructure for cross-border value exchange, not a speculative vehicle. Schwartz acknowledged that other Ripple executives might interpret the network’s goals differently, but he made clear that this perspective reflects his own understanding of the technology’s purpose. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Debate Over Middlemen and Validators Schwartz’s clarification came amid a related discussion about whether the XRPL depends on intermediaries. The conversation followed the Balancer hack, which resulted in more than $120 million in losses and reignited debate about the safety of smart contracts. Some XRP proponents argued that the XRPL avoids such vulnerabilities because it relies on built-in features rather than external smart contracts. A community member known as xmoonkie asserted that this design eliminates the need for intermediaries, positioning XRPL ahead of other blockchains that rely heavily on complex contract layers. Another participant, Dondropit, supported this argument, referencing Schwartz’s earlier comments that the XRPL prevents individuals from profiting through transaction fees, thereby maintaining a trustless and intermediary-free structure. However, a critic countered that Ripple and its early founders benefited from XRP’s premine, suggesting that validators effectively act as middlemen similar to Bitcoin miners. Addressing this point, Schwartz clarified that validators on the XRPL function differently from miners. They do not receive payments from users or determine which transactions to include. Instead, validators coordinate transaction ordering and ensure consensus integrity to prevent double-spending, operating as neutral participants rather than profit-seeking intermediaries. Schwartz’s comments reinforce the notion that the XRP Ledger was built to serve as a functional payments network, not an investment tool. While XRP’s value may rise as adoption increases, its growth remains tied to practical usage rather than deliberate price engineering. The discussion also highlights how Ripple’s technology distinguishes itself from smart contract-heavy systems by emphasizing efficiency, decentralization, and security.

Recent actions by South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) highlight a serious effort to combat South Korea crypto manipulation . This move sends a clear message: illegal activities will not be tolerated in the nation’s burgeoning crypto space. What Triggered South Korea’s Crypto Manipulation Crackdown? The FSC recently announced it had filed formal complaints with law enforcement regarding two distinct cases of alleged cryptocurrency market manipulation. This decision came after a thorough investigation, leading to a vote to refer the suspects for further inquiry. These actions underscore the increasing vigilance of financial regulators worldwide. They aim to ensure fair play and protect investors from fraudulent schemes that undermine trust in the crypto ecosystem. For many, this is a welcome development. The alleged schemes involve sophisticated tactics designed to artificially inflate prices and trading volumes, misleading unsuspecting market participants. Let’s delve into the specifics of these cases. Unpacking the Price Pumping Tactics in South Korea Crypto Manipulation In the first case, individuals stand accused of orchestrating a classic ‘pump and dump’ operation. Here’s how the alleged scheme unfolded: Pre-accumulation: Suspects reportedly acquired billions of won worth of a specific cryptocurrency. Targeted Selling: They then placed sell orders significantly above their purchase price, aiming for a substantial profit. Artificial Inflation: To reach their target, they allegedly used tens of billions of won to repeatedly submit high-priced buy orders. This tactic created false demand, artificially pushing the coin’s price upward. This type of South Korea crypto manipulation is particularly damaging. It creates an illusion of organic growth, luring in retail investors just as the manipulators prepare to offload their holdings, leaving others with devalued assets. How Automated Bots Fueled South Korea Crypto Manipulation The second case reveals a different, equally insidious form of South Korea crypto manipulation : volume inflation. This scheme involved the alleged use of automated trading programs, commonly known as bots. Investigators found that the suspects: Repeatedly executed market buy and sell orders. These transactions occurred multiple times per second. The activity lasted for tens of minutes. Ultimately, it inflated the transaction count for a specific coin by tens of millions. Such tactics create an illusion of high liquidity and active trading, making a cryptocurrency appear more attractive and legitimate than it truly is. Investors might then enter trades based on this false information, unaware they are participating in a manipulated market. Why Is Regulatory Action Against Crypto Manipulation Crucial? These actions by the FSC are vital for several reasons. Firstly, they protect individual investors from financial harm. Secondly, they foster greater trust in the digital asset market by demonstrating that authorities are actively monitoring and enforcing regulations. Moreover, robust oversight can deter future attempts at South Korea crypto manipulation . It signals that regulators are serious about maintaining market integrity, which is essential for the long-term health and growth of the cryptocurrency industry. Without such vigilance, the crypto space risks becoming a haven for illicit activities, undermining its potential. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the balance between innovation and regulation remains a critical discussion point. However, protecting market participants from fraud is a universally accepted necessity. The complaints filed by the FSC represent a significant step in South Korea crypto manipulation efforts. They highlight the ongoing commitment to creating a safer and more transparent environment for everyone involved in digital assets. This proactive approach by South Korean authorities sets an important precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. Conclusion: A Clear Message Against Illicit Gains South Korea’s FSC is sending an unequivocal message: market manipulation will be met with firm regulatory action. These two cases demonstrate the varied and sophisticated methods manipulators employ, from price pumping to volume faking. By referring these suspects to law enforcement, South Korea is reinforcing its commitment to a fair and transparent crypto market, ultimately benefiting legitimate investors and fostering sustainable growth in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto market manipulation? A: Crypto market manipulation involves intentionally influencing the price or behavior of a cryptocurrency through deceptive practices, such as spreading false information, creating artificial trading volume, or engaging in coordinated buying/selling to inflate or deflate prices. Q2: How does South Korea’s FSC identify manipulation? A: The FSC utilizes various investigative tools, including analyzing trading patterns, transaction data, and market behavior. They often look for unusual spikes in price or volume that lack fundamental drivers, or coordinated actions by specific groups of traders. Q3: What are the consequences for individuals found guilty of crypto manipulation in South Korea? A: Consequences can vary but typically include significant fines, imprisonment, and bans from participating in financial markets. The severity depends on the scale of manipulation and the financial harm caused. Q4: How can individual investors protect themselves from market manipulation? A: Investors should conduct thorough research, be wary of ‘get-rich-quick’ schemes, avoid acting on unverified social media tips, and understand the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies they invest in. Diversifying portfolios and using reputable exchanges also adds a layer of protection. Q5: Is crypto manipulation a global issue? A: Yes, crypto market manipulation is a global concern. Regulators in many countries are increasing their efforts to identify and prosecute individuals and entities involved in such illicit activities to protect their markets and investors.

This was confirmed by Monica Long, the president of Ripple, during the company’s Swell conference in New York, in an interview reported by Bloomberg. Monica said, “We do not have an IPO timeline. No plan, no timeline.” Meanwhile, many major companies in the crypto industry have already completed initial public offerings as the value of crypto climbed across the first nine months of the year. Stablecoin issuer Circle, exchanges Bullish and Gemini, and blockchain lender Figure all did their IPOs this year. Crypto sxchange Kraken is also preparing for its own debut. Ripple receives new investment and expands customer base Ripple announced that it raised $500 million at a $40 billion valuation. The investment round included participation from funds linked to Fortress Investment Group, Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace. The new funding allows Ripple to continue developing its products, securing partnerships, and expanding operations without using public markets. Monica said Ripple is able to fund its operations on its own. In her words, “We’re in a fortunate position where we’ve been able to be very well capitalized and fund all of our organic growth, inorganic growth, strategic partnerships, anything we want to do.” She did not disclose the company’s revenue for 2024. What she did share was that Ripple doubled its customer base from one quarter to the next. She credited this to an increase in companies using stablecoin-based payments and a shift in the regulatory climate that made things clearer for businesses both in the United States and internationally. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse also commented on the funding, saying the investment “reflects both Ripple’s incredible momentum, and further validation of the market opportunity we’re aggressively pursuing by some of the most trusted financial institutions in the world.” Ripple continues to market itself as an “infrastructure partner for banks and institutions that want access to crypto and blockchain tech without building those systems themselves. Regulatory changes boost Ripple after ending infamous SEC lawsuit Ripple’s business has been boost by changes in U.S. regulatory policy since the beginning of Donald Trump’s second administration, which has so far approved the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, giving companies a clearer understanding of how to launch and operate stablecoin-related products. This has encouraged traditional financial institutions all over Wall Street to enter the crypto market in larger numbers. Earlier this year, the SEC ended its infamou scase against Ripple, which had been going on since 2020 when the agency accused Ripple of offering unregistered securities through the sale of its native token XRP. XRP has rallied by around 8% this year following expanded adoption and reduced legal uncertainty. Meanwhile, the currently U.S. government shutdown (which is the largest ever) has slowed down public offering processing, affecting companies that filed IPO paperwork in September and October. Companies Andersen Group, Medline, and Wealthfront had aimed to list before Thanksgiving, but the slowdown disrupted those plans. According to Bloomberg, some companies that proceeded with public debuts faced mixed responses, meaning those that waited may not regret delaying. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

What will it truly take for the world’s leading cryptocurrency to shatter its previous records and embark on an unprecedented price surge? This isn’t just about hitting a number; it’s about market dynamics, investor sentiment, and critical technical levels that pave the way forward. Understanding the Crucial Levels for a Bitcoin ATH Breakthrough According to the astute observations from Negentropic, the X account managed by Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, the path to a new Bitcoin ATH isn’t a straight shot. They’ve outlined specific price levels that BTC must decisively conquer before we can realistically anticipate an all-time high. This expert analysis offers a crucial roadmap for understanding Bitcoin’s immediate future and what investors should watch for. The journey to a new Bitcoin ATH , as highlighted by these seasoned analysts, involves two significant thresholds. First and foremost, Bitcoin must reclaim the formidable $103,000 mark. This isn’t just a random number; it represents a psychological and technical barrier. Overcoming this level would signal strong bullish momentum and could shift market sentiment significantly, paving the way for further upward movement. Think of it as clearing a major checkpoint in a long-distance race. Following a successful reclaim of $103,000, the next critical hurdle lies at $106,000. A decisive break above this level, they suggest, could trigger a rapid acceleration in price. We could then witness Bitcoin making a swift ascent towards the $110,000 to $113,000 range, a move that would undoubtedly excite the entire market and confirm the strength of the rally. This tiered approach emphasizes the importance of sequential milestones rather than a single, sudden leap, providing a clearer picture of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. How Altcoins Respond to Bitcoin’s Path Towards ATH It’s not just about Bitcoin; the broader crypto ecosystem is intrinsically linked to BTC’s performance. As Bitcoin gears up for a potential new Bitcoin ATH , major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), are expected to follow suit and begin showcasing their own strength. This phenomenon, often referred to as “altcoin season” or a general market rally, typically occurs once Bitcoin has established its dominance and confidence permeates the market. When Bitcoin consolidates or makes strong upward moves, it often pulls the rest of the market along. Investors, seeing Bitcoin’s stability and growth, tend to then diversify into altcoins, seeking higher percentage gains. This can lead to impressive rallies across various cryptocurrencies. For example, during previous bull runs, once Bitcoin cleared key resistance, many altcoins saw exponential growth in the subsequent weeks. The analysts advise a strategy of patience during this period. While the allure of quick gains can be strong, understanding market cycles and waiting for confirmation signals from Bitcoin’s price action is paramount. This patient approach can help investors position themselves strategically to benefit from the subsequent altcoin rallies, rather than chasing pumps prematurely. Why Patience is a Crucial Strategy for Navigating the Bitcoin ATH Journey Navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market, especially when anticipating a new Bitcoin ATH , requires a steady hand and a clear strategy. The Glassnode co-founders’ advice to exercise patience is not merely a suggestion but a critical insight for long-term success. Market movements are rarely linear, and corrections or consolidations are natural parts of any upward trend. Trying to predict every twist and turn can be exhausting and often counterproductive. So, what does patience truly entail in this context? It means more than just waiting; it involves strategic observation and preparedness. Here are some actionable insights: Understand Market Cycles: Recognize that significant price surges often follow periods of accumulation and consolidation. These quieter phases are opportunities for research and planning. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Hasty decisions based on short-term fluctuations, fear of missing out (FOMO), or panic selling can lead to missed opportunities or unnecessary losses. Stick to your investment plan. Strategic Positioning: Patience allows for better entry points and more informed investment choices as the market develops. Instead of buying at the peak, you might find better opportunities during pullbacks. Risk Management: A patient approach encourages thorough research and calculated risk-taking, rather than impulsive trades. Always consider your risk tolerance and diversify your portfolio. Stay Informed: While being patient, stay updated with expert analyses, market news, and fundamental developments. This keeps you prepared for when the market truly shifts. Remember, the goal isn’t just to catch the absolute peak, but to participate profitably in the overall upward trend. By understanding the Glassnode co-founders’ perspective, investors can adopt a more measured and potentially more rewarding approach to the exciting journey toward a new Bitcoin ATH . The Road Ahead: What to Expect After Reaching a New Bitcoin ATH Once Bitcoin successfully reclaims these crucial levels and potentially sets a new Bitcoin ATH , the market dynamics often shift again. Historically, new all-time highs can lead to periods of price discovery, where Bitcoin explores uncharted territory without previous resistance levels. This can be a time of rapid growth, but also increased volatility as profit-taking occurs at various new highs. Investors should be prepared for potential pullbacks even after a new ATH is established. These are healthy corrections that allow the market to consolidate gains before another leg up. The key is to remain disciplined and focused on the long-term vision, rather than getting caught up in short-term price swings. The journey to a new Bitcoin ATH is an exciting one, but it demands both vigilance and a calm demeanor. In summary, the road to a new Bitcoin ATH is clearly defined by these expert analysts. Reclaiming $103,000 and then $106,000 are the critical steps that could propel Bitcoin into uncharted territory, potentially reaching $110,000 to $113,000. As Bitcoin paves this path, the wider altcoin market, including ETH, is poised for its own significant gains. However, the overarching message is clear: patience is not just a virtue, but a strategic necessity for investors looking to capitalize on the next major crypto market cycle. The future of Bitcoin, and indeed the entire crypto market, hinges on these pivotal moments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are the key price levels Bitcoin needs to reclaim for a new ATH? According to Glassnode co-founders, Bitcoin must first reclaim $103,000, followed by a break above $106,000, to pave the way for a new Bitcoin ATH . 2. How do Glassnode co-founders define the path to a new Bitcoin ATH? They define it as a two-step process: first reclaiming $103,000, then breaking $106,000, which could lead to a rapid move towards the $110,000 to $113,000 range. 3. Will altcoins rally if Bitcoin reaches a new ATH? Yes, the analysts suggest that as BTC moves toward a new peak, major altcoins like ETH will begin to show strength, often leading to broader market rallies. 4. Why is patience important for crypto investors right now? Patience allows investors to understand market cycles, avoid emotional decisions, find strategic entry points, and manage risk effectively, especially during the anticipation of a new Bitcoin ATH . 5. What happens after Bitcoin sets a new all-time high? After a new Bitcoin ATH , the market often enters a period of price discovery and can experience rapid growth, but also increased volatility and healthy corrections as profit-taking occurs.

If you’ve been following the cryptocurrency space, you know that stablecoins – digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value – are a critical component. Now, the Canadian government is making a significant move to bring these assets under a robust regulatory framework, signaling a new era for digital finance in the country. What’s Driving Canada Stablecoin Regulation? The Canadian government has unveiled plans to integrate a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins into its 2025 federal budget. This proactive step, as reported by CryptoBriefing, underscores a growing global trend towards formalizing the digital asset landscape. But why now, and what does this mean for users and issuers? Essentially, stablecoins aim to bridge the gap between traditional fiat currencies and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. They are pegged to assets like the US dollar or gold, offering stability. However, without proper oversight, they can pose risks related to financial stability, consumer protection, and illicit activities. Canada’s move is a clear effort to mitigate these potential dangers. Who Will Oversee Canada’s Stablecoins? Under the proposed framework, the Bank of Canada, the nation’s central bank, is slated to assume regulatory jurisdiction over stablecoin issuance. This is a crucial detail, as it places the authority in the hands of an institution deeply rooted in maintaining financial stability. This direct oversight ensures that stablecoins operating within Canada adhere to the highest standards of financial integrity. The Bank of Canada’s involvement is not just about control; it’s about fostering trust. By having the central bank at the helm of Canada stablecoin regulation , the government aims to instill confidence among users and investors, knowing that these digital assets are backed by credible oversight. Key Obligations for Stablecoin Issuers The proposed framework isn’t just a broad stroke; it outlines specific and stringent obligations for stablecoin issuers. These requirements are designed to safeguard users and maintain the stability of the financial system. Here’s a closer look: Reserve Requirements: Issuers will need to hold sufficient reserves to back their stablecoins, ensuring that each digital coin can be redeemed for its pegged value. This is fundamental to preventing ‘runs’ and maintaining liquidity. Risk Management Systems: Robust systems must be in place to identify, assess, and mitigate operational, financial, and cybersecurity risks. This proactive approach helps protect against potential vulnerabilities. Redemption Policies: Clear and transparent policies for how users can redeem their stablecoins for fiat currency or other assets will be mandatory. This ensures accessibility and prevents arbitrary restrictions. Data Protection Duties: Protecting user data is paramount. Issuers will be obligated to implement strong data privacy and security measures, aligning with Canada’s existing privacy laws. These obligations are critical for building a resilient and trustworthy stablecoin ecosystem within Canada. They represent a balanced approach, allowing innovation while prioritizing safety. What Are the Benefits of This Regulatory Push? The implementation of robust Canada stablecoin regulation offers several significant advantages, not just for the government but for everyday users and the broader financial market: Enhanced Consumer Protection: Users will have greater assurance that their stablecoin holdings are secure and that issuers are held accountable. Financial Stability: By mitigating risks associated with stablecoin collapse or manipulation, the framework helps protect the wider financial system. Increased Adoption: With clear rules and oversight, more institutions and individuals may feel comfortable using stablecoins, potentially driving innovation and economic growth. Combating Illicit Activities: Regulatory clarity can help prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering or other illegal financial transactions. This forward-thinking approach positions Canada as a leader in creating a safe environment for digital assets. The Future Landscape of Digital Assets in Canada Canada’s move to regulate stablecoins is more than just a legislative update; it’s a foundational step towards integrating digital assets more deeply into the mainstream economy. This framework could set a precedent for how other countries approach similar challenges, especially as the global financial system continues to digitize. As we look ahead, the implementation of these regulations will likely foster a more mature and secure environment for stablecoins. It will be interesting to observe how the market responds and what innovations emerge under this new era of oversight. Conclusion: A Pivotal Step for Canada’s Digital Future The Canadian government’s decision to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins marks a pivotal moment for the country’s digital economy. By entrusting the Bank of Canada with oversight and imposing strict obligations on issuers, Canada is proactively addressing the inherent risks while fostering a secure environment for innovation. This strategic move not only safeguards consumers and promotes financial stability but also positions Canada as a forward-thinking nation in the global digital asset space. The future of digital finance in Canada looks both secure and promising, thanks to this decisive action on Canada stablecoin regulation .

Following this partnership, the iPhone maker intends to allocate approximately $1 billion to Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., each year to acquire its advanced artificial intelligence model, which has 1.2 trillion parameters, according to sources close to the situation. While remaining anonymous because the matter had not yet been made public, the sources hinted that both tech companies were close to securing an agreement that would allow the iPhone maker to utilize Google’s technology. This move was initiated after the tech firms thoroughly reviewed their partnership. The new partnership follows French prosecutors’ saying that they are investigating tech giant Apple’s voice assistant after getting a complaint from a tech researcher accusing the company of illicit data collection. Reports indicate that the probe was entrusted to a police force specialised in cybercrime; the prosecutors’ office in Paris said this without providing further details. Tech researcher Thomas Le Bonniec stated that he was the source of the complaint filed by the French human rights organization Ligue des Droits de l’Homme (LDH). Initially, LDH noted the complaint accused Apple of collecting, recording, and analysing Siri conversations without users’ consent. Apple seeks to remain competitive in the industry with several updates Apple depends on Google to improve its Siri voice assistant and solidify its position as a leader in the tech industry. This is because Google’s artificial intelligence model is superior to Apple’s models as it features 1.2 trillion parameters, surpassing the company’s current capabilities. As individuals eagerly await the launch of Siri’s new features, sources indicate that the release is scheduled for next year. The smartphone manufacturer’s decision came after considering using other third-party models for this task earlier. The company tried various models to find the most suitable one, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude. After several considerations, Apple chose Google’s model earlier this year. Following this action, reports indicate that the tech giant’s goal is to employ this technology temporarily until its models become sufficiently robust . Regarding Apple’s commitment to remain competitive in the industry, reliable sources pointed out that the updated version of Siri will be introduced next spring. However, the sources asserted that since the launch is still months away, partnership deals and plans may change before then. This statement sparked heated discussions among individuals. Still, when reporters requested that representatives from Apple and Google comment on the situation, they chose not to respond. Meanwhile, when this news update leaked on Wednesday, November 5, shares for both tech firms soared to their record high. To illustrate, Apple’s stock escalated by less than 1% to reach $271.70, while Alphabet’s stock surged as much as 3.2% to reach $286.42. The new Gemini system represents a substantial upgrade from the existing model, featuring 150 billion parameters that Apple Intelligence utilizes in its cloud version. Analysts commented that this change will significantly improve the system’s capabilities, enabling it to handle complicated data and grasp context more effectively. Google and Apple collaborate to improve Siri voice assistant The project to enhance Siri with a third-party model is internally known as Glenwood. Currently, the initiative is under the leadership of Mike Rockwell, who developed the vice along with Craig Federighi, a Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Apple, said sources. The sources also mentioned that the new voice assistant, Linwood, is coming soon with iOS 26.4. Under this partnership, Google’s Gemini model is responsible for Siri’s planner and summarizer functions. Notably, these two are the crucial parts that assist Siri in combining information and determining the best way to complete complicated tasks. Some Siri features will still utilize Apple’s own models. Sources familiar with the situation mentioned that the model will operate on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, safeguarding users’ information and keeping it separate from Google’s systems.

He pointed to SpaceX as one company able to handle that job, according to a 62‑page document. The plan, called Project Athena, was drafted earlier this year when Jared was first being evaluated for the NASA role. It lays out how SpaceX and other private companies could be used to carry out key missions that align with Trump’s goals. The document mentions Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Axiom Space, and others as partners that could support different programs. It also outlines how the agency could shift away from its current setup and rely more on commercial systems. Trump announced Jared’s nomination this week, ending a messy search for a NASA chief. Jared has strong ties to the commercial space industry, and he has flown on private missions financed with his own money. That relationship with SpaceX was questioned during a Senate confirmation hearing in April. Elon Musk founded SpaceX with the long-term goal of building a settlement on Mars, and the company is developing the Starship launch system to execute that mission. Jared outlines commercial partners for new Mars program NASA, the White House, and representatives for Jared did not respond to comment requests. On November 4, Jared confirmed online that the draft plan was real, but said, “it was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.” The plan gives a view of how he intends to run NASA as it tries to return humans to the moon before China. One section, titled Vendor Focus Areas, lists the roles different aerospace companies could play. Next to SpaceX, the document proposes a “Mars Discovery Base contract”, tied to a new Mars effort called Project Olympus, which would test landing and base‑building methods for future human missions. The plan also mentions putting NASA’s Orion crew capsule on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. It suggests moving away from the current moon mission architecture built around Boeing’s Space Launch System and Lockheed Martin’s Orion spacecraft. Instead, it proposes a shift to smaller and cheaper commercial launch systems. The ideas mirror Trump’s earlier budget requests, which aimed to shrink NASA’s structure and push more responsibilities onto private companies. Human spaceflight is listed as the top priority. Congress has resisted these proposals by approving more funding than the administration requested, creating tension between agency plans and lawmakers. Jared plans nuclear propulsion and restructuring of NASA centers Project Athena calls for redirecting NASA resources toward nuclear electric propulsion, with the goal of flying nuclear‑powered spacecraft within a few years. The document says this technology could also support defense systems linked to Trump’s Golden Dome and other Department of Defense programs. The plan describes changes at NASA facilities, including expanding commercial access to launch sites and building nuclear launch support structures at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It also proposes cutting, merging, or restructuring parts of the Goddard Space Flight Center, and shifting some scientific programs at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia to private contractors or academics. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, which tests rocket engines, could move under state-level management to reach financial stability, though the plan does not explain how this transition would work. Other proposals include renegotiating fixed-price contracts, reviewing NASA’s ten highest‑cost programs, and speeding up launch timelines for science missions “to the earliest that physics would support.” Reporting on parts of the document first appeared on Ars Technica and Politico .

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor should understand. The Altcoin Season Index has dropped four points to 24, signaling changing market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. This important metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable insights into whether alternative cryptocurrencies are outperforming the market leader. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Drop to 24? The recent four-point decline in the Altcoin Season Index tells a compelling story about current market conditions. When the index moves downward, it indicates that fewer altcoins are beating Bitcoin’s performance. This particular drop to 24 suggests that only about a quarter of major altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin over the 90-day measurement period. Several factors could be driving this shift in the Altcoin Season Index: Bitcoin dominance increasing in the market Risk aversion among cryptocurrency investors Market rotation from altcoins back to Bitcoin Regulatory concerns affecting specific altcoin projects How Close Are We to a True Altcoin Season? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index threshold is crucial for timing your investments. The market officially enters an altcoin season when 75% of top cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. With the index currently at 24, we’re quite far from that magic number of 100 that would signal strong altcoin dominance. This current reading of the Altcoin Season Index suggests that Bitcoin continues to lead the market. However, experienced traders know that these conditions can change rapidly. The Altcoin Season Index serves as an early warning system for potential market shifts. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The declining Altcoin Season Index presents both challenges and opportunities. While altcoins may be underperforming currently, this could create buying opportunities for patient investors. The key is to monitor the Altcoin Season Index regularly while maintaining a balanced portfolio strategy. Consider these actionable insights based on the current Altcoin Season Index reading: Diversify strategically between Bitcoin and promising altcoins Monitor the index weekly for trend changes Research fundamental projects that may outperform during the next cycle Set realistic expectations based on current market conditions The Bottom Line: Navigating Current Market Conditions The Altcoin Season Index at 24 clearly indicates we’re not in an altcoin season. However, this doesn’t mean opportunities don’t exist. Savvy investors use tools like the Altcoin Season Index to make informed decisions rather than emotional ones. Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical, and conditions can change faster than many anticipate. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a good Altcoin Season Index score? A score above 75 on the Altcoin Season Index typically indicates altcoin season conditions, where most major cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates regularly, with the most recent data showing a drop from 28 to 24 in just one day, reflecting dynamic market changes. Should I avoid altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index might present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong projects at better prices. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market crashes? While it measures relative performance, the index alone cannot predict crashes but can indicate shifting market sentiment and risk appetite. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for trading decisions? It’s one valuable tool among many. Combine the Altcoin Season Index with other technical and fundamental analysis for best results. What was the highest recorded Altcoin Season Index? During strong altcoin seasons, the index has approached 100, indicating nearly all major altcoins were outperforming Bitcoin.

54077299,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=853279,1762390800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54077299.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Whales Are Taking Profit, Here’s Where Capital Could Be Headed Next",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/btc-whales-are-taking-profit-heres-where-capital-could-be-headed-next/,"Following recent rallies, whales in Bitcoin are currently taking profits, quietly withdrawing capital from exchanges and hinting at caution in the short-term momentum. While BTC is consolidating and mixed signals abound within the market, many investors have now started searching for cryptos with greater growth potential beyond Bitcoin’s established trajectory that moves a bit more slowly. Against that backdrop, one of the projects getting serious attention is Mutuum Finance , or MUTM. Currently priced at $0.035 in Stage 6 of its presale, with over 85% already sold out, MUTM combines a dual-lending DeFi protocol with a clear roadmap. The project has raised over $18.4 million and attracted upwards of 17,700 investors, making it the next crypto to explode and the top crypto to buy in 2025. Smart money is watching closely as Bitcoin whales cash out According to Santiment, this pressure is placed on Bitcoin, as whale addresses holding 10–10,000 BTC collectively sold approximately 23,200 BTC since October 12. A movement this big means that holders within the mid-to-large sizes are either taking profits from their holdings or repositioning in preparation for the next move of Bitcoin. Historically, such periods of whale activity marked pivotal moments for the market, and investors should monitor the trend closely for possible opportunities. While this redistribution is taking place in BTC, the focus has shifted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining rapid momentum among early investors on the back of its game-changing dual-lending DeFi protocol and almost fully sold-out Phase 6 presale. This has led analysts to label MUTM the next crypto to explode and recommend it as the top crypto to buy now for early-stage investors. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars as 2025’s Fastest-Growing Crypto Mutuum Finance is one of the hottest names in DeFi right now in 2025. Since the commencement of its multi-phase presale, the project has been very transparent about its roadmap and has provided early investors with a great opportunity to get in before the token hits public exchanges. Currently in Phase 6, MUTM is priced at $0.035, over three times the original price of $0.01 during Phase 1 and rewarding early participants with close to 3x returns. The presale has already collected $18.4 million with more than 17,700 investors, and 85% of Phase 6 tokens have already been sold. As it approaches Phase 7, the token will see further demand and excitement by increasing the price to $0.04. 1.76 billion of the total 4 billion MUTM tokens were allocated for presale, out of which 760 million have already been sold. The strong uptake, including significant institutional participation, underlines growing confidence in the utility-driven, long-term DeFi ecosystem of Mutuum Finance, making it the top crypto to buy and solidifying it as the next crypto to explode in 2025. Stablecoins and Oracles: Building Stability Mutuum Finance also continues to build a more secure and predictable DeFi ecosystem. The USD-pegged stablecoin, with on-chain verified assets for its backing, will anchor its lending and borrowing architecture, ensuring liquidity, reducing volatility risks, and making returns predictable for the users. To further enhance reliability, the platform will utilize high-performance oracles to enable real-time market data such as accurate valuation of collateral, borrowing limits, and liquidation thresholds. Redundant security systems guarantee smooth operations of the platform in highly volatile markets. With the stablecoin infrastructure and advanced oracle technology, Mutuum Finance will mark a significant course in redefining DeFi with stability, transparency, and scalability, while creating a sustainable ecosystem for both retail and institutional investors. Having raised over $18.4 million already from more than 17,700 investors, there is significant market confidence in the DeFi ecosystem at Mutuum Finance. Priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6, with over 85% sold, there is a very limited window for early adopters to secure tokens ahead of the price increase to $0.04 in Phase 7. Investors looking for the next crypto to explode and the top crypto to buy in 2025 should not hesitate to get in on Mutuum Finance to experience firsthand the power of this dual-lending protocol and set themselves up for long-term gain.

For the second straight quarter, the electric carmaker missed revenue expectations and posted a bigger-than-expected loss, while competitor Rivian flexed a much stronger performance. In the third quarter, Lucid pulled in $336.6 million, below the $379.1 million analysts had forecast. Its net loss hit $978.4 million, or $3.31 per share, slightly better than last year’s $992.5 million loss, but that’s not saying much. Adjusted, Lucid lost $2.65 per share, worse than the $2.27 loss Wall Street was ready for. Lucid’s financial pain didn’t stop there. Its adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $717.7 million, up 17% from a year earlier and also worse than the $597.4 million loss analysts had expected. But not everything was down. Revenue did jump 68% from the $200 million it posted in the same quarter last year. Still, that bump wasn’t enough to offset the company’s rising costs and slow progress in scaling production. Lucid cuts forecast again and turns to Saudi funding Lucid once again slashed its production outlook. The company now expects to produce around 18,000 vehicles this year, trimming both ends of its previous forecast range of 18,000 to 20,000 units. At the start of the year, it had boldly aimed for 20,000. It also reduced its capital spending target, bringing the lower end down by $100 million to between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. To keep itself funded, Lucid turned to its largest shareholder, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which agreed to boost an existing delayed draw term loan from $750 million to roughly $2 billion. That pushed Lucid’s total liquidity to $5.5 billion, including the unused loan. The company said its cash pile stayed flat at around $1.6 billion, giving it enough fuel to keep going until early 2027. The company is still trying to launch the long-awaited Gravity SUV, which has been slowed by supply chain chaos and internal missteps. Marc Winterhoff, Lucid’s interim CEO, admitted back in August that there were “problems with Gravity,” but told investors this week the company is still hoping to ramp deliveries by the fourth quarter. “We remain intensely focused on ramping up production and addressing the significant supply chain disruptions impacting the entire industry,” Winterhoff said Wednesday. CFO Taoufiq Boussaid added that while Gravity production improved from the previous quarter, it’s still at an “unmeaningful level.” The company said it’s also exploring new financing options outside of Saudi support as it moves forward with the Gravity launch and a new midsize model that’s not expected to enter production before late 2026. Rivian beats estimates and widens the gap with Lucid Lucid’s numbers looked even worse next to Rivian’s third-quarter results. Rivian reported earnings and revenue that both topped Wall Street’s forecasts, helping its stock surge during Wednesday’s trading. While Lucid shares are down more than 40% in 2025, Rivian’s are up around 16%, even after doing a 1-for-10 reverse split this summer. Rivian also posted a surprise gross profit of $24 million, beating expectations of a $38.6 million loss, according to FactSet. That included gains from both its auto and software divisions. “While we face near-term uncertainty from trade, tariffs, and regulatory policy, we remain focused on long-term growth and value creation,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe wrote in a shareholder letter. Rivian didn’t change its already-lowered 2025 forecast: it’s still expecting to lose between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, spend $1.8 to $1.9 billion, and deliver between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles this year. The EV maker also reaffirmed a plan to launch its R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 at its plant in Illinois. It ended Q3 with $7.7 billion in liquidity, most of that in cash and short-term investments. Scaringe said they’re “really well positioned” for the launch and don’t expect supply issues from China’s rare earth minerals or chips from Nexperia to delay the R2. Meanwhile, Lucid’s Q3 vehicle deliveries hit 4,078, up from last year but still missing expectations. The company also pointed to partnerships as a sign of progress, including a $300 million deal with Uber to deliver over 20,000 Gravity SUVs over six years, and an expanded agreement with Nvidia to use its tech in future autonomous vehicles.

Despite short-term weakness, sentiment around SOL remains steady, with traders viewing the dip as a potential accumulation opportunity before momentum shifts back in favor of the bulls. Triangle Breakdown Brings SOL To A Critical Accumulation Zone According to the latest outlook from Crypto VIP Signal, Solana’s price recently broke out of a downward triangle, signaling a temporary shift in market structure. This move has brought SOL down to a crucial support region where buyers have previously shown strong interest. The reaction from this area will likely determine whether the market stabilizes for a rebound or continues its downward trajectory in the short term. Related Reading: Solana Price Drops Below $180 Despite $199M ETF Inflows, What’s Behind the Decline? At present, Solana is hovering around the $160 zone, which many analysts view as an important accumulation range. Historically, this level has acted as a reliable base where bullish momentum often begins to build. If demand increases and the broader market sentiment improves, SOL could see a bounce that propels it back toward higher resistance levels. Even with this potential upside, caution remains necessary. Market volatility continues to influence price movements, and a decisive drop below the $150 level could signal a deeper bearish extension. The expert noted that setting a stop-loss slightly under $150 helps protect against this scenario while allowing room for short-term fluctuations. For now, speculation is whether Solana can hold its current support and attract renewed bullish pressure, potentially marking the start of a recovery phase in the coming days. Solana Steadies At Key Weekly Levels Amid Market Slowdown In a recent post on X, CryptoPulse highlighted that SOL is currently holding around key weekly levels as it works to regain strength following recent market pullbacks. The analyst noted that despite short-term weakness in momentum, the overall market structure remains resilient, suggesting that the asset could soon stabilize and prepare for its next move. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Decline Intensifies — Bears Tighten Grip, Recovery Looks Unlikely According to CryptoPulse, Solana’s long-term outlook is supported by solid fundamentals and a growing ecosystem. The project continues to attract increasing adoption across decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and enterprise applications. Moreover, heavy institutional interest has further strengthened confidence in Solana’s potential to remain one of the leading blockchain platforms in the crypto space. At the moment, CryptoPulse recommends maintaining a neutral and patient stance as the price consolidates, which could offer a more favorable entry point, especially if SOL begins to recover. Once momentum returns, the analyst believes Solana could swiftly reclaim higher resistance levels and potentially resume its broader upward trajectory.

The deal marks the company’s fourth acquisition in recent months and is a clear escalation in what many describe as the company’s competition with SWIFT, the dominant global payments messaging network. Ripple Makes Another Major Acquisition Palisade announced the acquisition on X, noting that its wallet-as-a-service technology will now form part of Ripple’s next-generation payments and custody infrastructure. The startup noted that its platform will help power the firm’s next-gen custody and payments infrastructure in order to bring its technology to businesses worldwide. Ripple also confirmed the news with a corresponding statement, describing the acquisition as a major step in advancing institutional-grade digital asset custody. Ripple said Palisade’s scalable wallet solution is ideal for on-and off-ramps and corporate payments, adding that the integration accelerates value transfer across Ripple Payments and Custody. The company’s post ended with a bold statement that noted the importance of secure custody to the on-chain economy, linking the acquisition to its broader goal of building what it calls the Internet of Value. XRP analysts and crypto market commentators have described the acquisition news as bullish for XRP. XRP, on the other hand, is witnessing an ongoing price crash alongside the rest of the crypto market. The Battle Against SWIFT Rages On The Palisade purchase is only the latest in a string of aggressive acquisitions by Ripple in 2025. In April, Ripple announced its acquisition of the prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion and rebranding to Ripple Prime, a deal that significantly expanded its reach in institutional liquidity and trading services. Just months later, it finalized the acquisition of stablecoin platform Rail for $200 million. This was followed by its $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury , a treasury management firm, in October. Altogether, the payment firm says it has deployed approximately $4 billion into the crypto ecosystem through a mix of mergers, acquisitions, and strategic investments. Each of these moves strengthens its infrastructure to handle every aspect of value transfer from custody and liquidity to stablecoin issuance and institutional settlements, forming the backbone of its long-term plan to challenge SWIFT’s global dominance in cross-border transactions. As the firm continues to scale its infrastructure with acquisitions like Palisade, analysts view these moves as part of a broader strategy to build a vertically integrated financial ecosystem that can rival SWIFT’s legacy dominance. Meanwhile, Ripple’s highly anticipated SWELL 2025 event is already underway after kicking off yesterday, bringing together key partners, regulators, and financial executives from around the world to discuss the company’s vision for the next era of blockchain-based finance.

Industry projections suggest that the cross-border B2B payments market could reach $50 trillion by 2032, and if Ripple secures even a significant fraction of that, the resulting liquidity demand could affect XRP’s price substantially. Ripple’s Focus on Institutional Payments Recent conversations within the XRP community were reignited after Western Union announced plans to pilot a stablecoin on the Solana blockchain, a move that many observers saw as a shift away from Ripple’s technology. In response , several XRP proponents highlighted that Ripple’s strategic focus differs from Western Union’s. According to community analyst Anderson , Ripple’s core market lies in B2B transactions, which he initially claimed had reached $187 trillion in 2024. However, data from FXC Intelligence offers a more precise picture; the cross-border segment of that market stood at $31.6 trillion in 2024, encompassing transactions between corporations across different nations that sustain global trade. FXC Intelligence further estimates that this segment will expand by 58% to reach approximately $50 trillion by 2032, driven by technological innovation, growing international trade, and the shift toward digital payments. Despite being less transparent than consumer remittance markets, B2B payments remain a critical component of global commerce. Assessing Ripple’s Potential Share Ripple’s decision to prioritize institutional payment infrastructure rather than consumer remittances positions it for deeper integration within the corporate payments ecosystem. If Ripple were to handle 40% of the projected 2032 B2B cross-border market, the company would process more than $20 trillion annually through its network. Given XRP’s function as the native bridge currency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), such growth could increase liquidity demand and influence price performance. To understand how this might translate into potential market outcomes, the AI model ChatGPT was consulted. The analysis emphasized that XRP’s value would not be determined solely by the total payments processed but rather by the liquidity required to facilitate those transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP would circulate multiple times per day as a settlement asset, meaning that even a small portion of locked liquidity could support significant payment flows. Key Drivers of XRP Value ChatGPT highlighted several variables that would shape XRP’s market response if Ripple achieved large-scale adoption. These include the depth of institutional liquidity pools, the number of active payment corridors, and the extent of XRP holdings by banks and corporations to maintain efficient settlement channels. As adoption grows, reduced token availability and increased network usage could create upward price pressure. Moreover, institutional demand and market speculation would likely amplify this effect, particularly if Ripple continues to expand partnerships and regulatory frameworks become more favorable. The model also noted the importance of transaction velocity, the rate at which XRP moves through the system. Faster transaction turnover would mean each XRP unit supports more payments, reducing the need for higher prices. However, establishing large and deep liquidity pools across regions would still be essential for high-value transfers. Projected XRP Price Scenarios Based on these assumptions, ChatGPT outlined several price scenarios. In a moderate growth case, where Ripple dominates major corridors such as USD/EUR and USD/JPY without achieving total market dominance, XRP could trade between $25 and $50. If Ripple were to handle 30% to 40% of the global B2B payment network, the token’s value could rise to the $100–$500 range. In an extreme case where XRP becomes the preferred global settlement asset, prices could theoretically exceed $1,000 per token. Even at a valuation of $100 per XRP , its market capitalization would remain relatively small compared to the trillions in payment volume it would enable. The projection reinforces the idea that XRP’s value stems from its utility and liquidity function, rather than being a store of value.

The four companies (Rigetti, IonQ, D‑Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing Inc) have become the center of one of the market’s most heated trends, even as investors struggle to figure out what any of these valuations are actually supposed to mean. The pricing has been unstable, with wide swings happening in short periods. Traders and analysts are working to understand how to value technology that is still developing and is not yet widely commercialized. The companies are working to build machines that use Quantum theory to solve tasks that current computers cannot handle, possibly supported by artificial intelligence. Supporters say the technology could reshape areas such as cryptography and drug development. The wave of interest has led to sharp moves in share prices. Many investors are treating these companies as early claims on a future computing model that has not yet arrived. Valuations swing as investors try to price the future Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs, who oversees the Defiance Quantum fund (QTUM), said, “All of a sudden, it feels like science fiction has moved into the world of real technological possibility.” The statement reflects how quickly sentiment around the sector has changed, even though the businesses remain unprofitable. Financial statements show losses, though Rigetti posted a quarterly profit in early 2025 due to changes in the value of securities it held, not core operations. The volatility has been especially clear in Rigetti’s stock. Steve Sosnick, chief markets strategist at Interactive Brokers, said, “What is the right price to pay for a piece of the future?” Rigetti traded at $1.06 a share earlier in the year before climbing to $58. By late October, it was the fourth‑most actively traded stock among Interactive Brokers customers. More Rigetti shares changed hands than Apple or Amazon, two of the largest companies in the world. Rigetti now trades near $38, giving it a valuation of more than 1,000 times its sales. For comparison, Nvidia trades at about 50 times sales. Christopher Poch, CEO of Promethium Advisors, who works with wealthy clients, described the pricing as “a magic act.” He said, “How else can you explain a company that has a $13 billion market capitalization but only $22 million in forecast revenues?” LSEG earnings consensus shows Rigetti projected to earn $21.9 million in 2026. The numbers illustrate the valuation disconnect investors are facing. Analysts change their price targets as corporate interest surges Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, said traders have grouped these four companies together as the “Quantum 4,” separating them from larger names like IBM and Alphabet, which also work on Quantum computing. Even with the high valuations, some analysts still recommend the stocks. David Williams at Benchmark Equity Research rated Rigetti as a “buy” and raised his price target from $20 to $50 last month. He allegedly told Reuters, “The valuation on quantum names is more of an art than science.” On Monday, B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis downgraded Rigetti to “Neutral,” citing its “premium valuation” and risks tied to possible U.S. government shutdowns. Yet Ellis raised his price target from $35 to $42. Rigetti traded at $36.43 on Tuesday, down nearly 7%. Banks and corporations have begun showing interest. JPMorgan Chase said last month it plans to invest up to $10 billion in strategic sectors such as Quantum computing. IBM and HSBC said in September that they used Quantum‑based systems to create a new bond trading algorithm. Reports surfaced last week suggesting the U.S. government may also consider funding Quantum firms in exchange for equity stakes. A U.S. Department of Commerce official said the agency is “not currently negotiating” such plans. A McKinsey report estimates the Quantum computing market could grow beyond $100 billion. But progress so far has been limited. Rick Bradt, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, said, “It’s the holy grail of computing; the use case is undeniable, and undeniably awesome. But there’s still a lot of uncertainty about the timing.” Get seen where it counts.

Recent data reveals an astonishing development that could shape the cryptocurrency market for months to come. Massive Bitcoin whale activity has emerged as a dominant force, with $6.8 billion worth of BTC flowing into Binance over just 30 days. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Whale Activity Mean? According to Darkfost, a CryptoQuant contributor, this substantial movement represents one of the most significant Bitcoin whale activity periods in the current market cycle. The analyst tracked approximately 9.8185 trillion won worth of BTC transfers from whale addresses to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This level of Bitcoin whale activity typically indicates major strategic shifts among large holders. Whales might be: Taking profits after recent price gains Adjusting their portfolio positions Optimizing liquidity for future moves Preparing for market volatility Why Should You Care About Whale Movements? Historical patterns show that similar Bitcoin whale activity often precedes important market turning points. Darkfost notes that these periods have frequently coincided with either short-term price peaks or the beginning of market downturns. However, the current situation presents an intriguing twist. Bitcoin continues trading strongly at $103,563, showing a 3.04% increase despite the selling pressure. This suggests the market might be absorbing the whale deposits better than expected. What’s Next for Bitcoin Prices? The critical question now becomes: will this Bitcoin whale activity trigger a major correction or simply represent a healthy market recalibration? Much depends on whether Bitcoin can break through key resistance levels while facing this substantial selling pressure. Darkfost suggests an interesting possibility. If Bitcoin maintains its strength, some whales might shift from selling to long-term holding strategies. This could actually benefit the market by reducing circulating supply and potentially driving prices higher. How to Interpret Whale Signals Understanding Bitcoin whale activity requires looking beyond surface-level data. While $6.8 billion sounds alarming, consider these factors: Whale movements don’t always predict immediate price drops Large transfers might represent internal portfolio rebalancing Some whales use exchanges for custody rather than selling Market depth has improved significantly in recent years The current Bitcoin whale activity certainly warrants attention, but it doesn’t necessarily spell doom for the cryptocurrency. Markets have become more sophisticated at handling large movements, and institutional participation provides additional stability. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This episode of intense Bitcoin whale activity teaches us several important lessons. First, always monitor large transfer data but interpret it within broader market context. Second, remember that whale movements represent opportunities as well as risks. Finally, understand that sophisticated players often have multiple motivations beyond simple profit-taking. The $6.8 billion deposit represents significant Bitcoin whale activity, but it’s happening within a robust market structure that has proven resilient throughout 2024. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin whale activity? Bitcoin whale activity refers to large transactions by holders of significant amounts of BTC, typically those controlling thousands of coins worth millions of dollars. Why do whales deposit to exchanges? Whales might deposit to exchanges for various reasons including selling, trading, moving to different wallets, or using exchange services like lending and staking. Does whale selling always cause price drops? Not necessarily. While large sells can create downward pressure, modern markets have sufficient depth to absorb significant volumes without major price impacts. How can I track Bitcoin whale activity? You can monitor whale movements through blockchain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and various on-chain data providers. Should I worry about current whale deposits? While worth monitoring, current deposits represent normal market activity. The Bitcoin market has matured significantly and can handle large movements better than in earlier years. What’s the difference between whale selling and distribution? Selling implies immediate liquidation, while distribution might involve gradual position adjustments or transfers between entities under common control.

The deal will allow Perplexity’s AI search engine to be distributed to Snapchat’s global user base. The companies said the integration will begin appearing inside Snapchat in early 2026, where Perplexity’s tool will take default placement in the chat inbox. Snap said its existing My AI chatbot will stay and users can choose between both. The company described this as the start of a wider plan to open Snapchat to more external AI partners. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said the company sees rising demand for conversational interfaces. He said: “We certainly see a lot of opportunity to open up Snapchat to more AI partners over time. The conversational interface has become a lot more valuable with the advent of conversational AI.” Perplexity will pay Snap through a combination of cash and equity. Snap said revenue from the partnership will begin showing on its books in 2026, once the global rollout is in motion. Snap integrates Perplexity as default search inside chat Snap said Perplexity has over 20 million active users, and the company’s product will appear directly inside Snapchat’s chat inbox. Spiegel said Perplexity will control the responses generated within Snapchat. He said the chatbot will be visible by default, but users can continue using Snap’s own chatbot if they want. Spiegel also said Snap will not sell ads against Perplexity responses. He explained that the integration is expected to help Perplexity gain additional paying subscribers, which is part of Perplexity’s business model. Snap and Perplexity described the deal as “a first step in Snap’s effort to make Snapchat a platform where leading AI companies can connect with its global community in creative and trusted ways.” The agreement also comes while Perplexity faces lawsuits from Amazon and Reddit, accusing it of violating terms of service around data usage. The companies did not comment further on those disputes during the earnings call. Users will still be able to chat with My AI, but Snap said the new integration will allow users to get “real‑time answers from credible sources and explore new topics within the app.” Snap reports Q3 results and issues Q4 guidance Snap reported $1.51 billion in revenue for the third quarter, beating Wall Street’s $1.49 billion expectation. The company posted a loss of 6 cents per share, which Snap said was not directly comparable to analyst estimates. Global daily active users reached 477 million, compared to expectations of 476 million. The company’s average revenue per user was $3.16, slightly above the $3.13 expected. Snap also approved a $500 million stock repurchase program. Third‑quarter sales grew 10% year over year, while the company reported a net loss of $104 million, an improvement from a $153 million net loss in the same quarter last year. Snap reported adjusted EBITDA of $182 million, ahead of the $125 million projection. The company expects fourth‑quarter sales between $1.68 billion and $1.71 billion, with midpoint slightly above Wall Street estimates. It also expects Q4 adjusted EBITDA between $280 million and $310 million, compared to $255.4 million projected. Snap shares had been down 32% this year before the earnings release, while the Nasdaq gained 22% in the same period. While shares jumped as much as 25% after the news, gains faded during the call after Snap’s finance chief Derek Andersen highlighted ongoing challenges in the North America LCS segment, calling it the “primary headwind to our overall revenue growth.” Derek said Snap is seeing stronger demand from small‑to‑medium businesses in other regions. Meanwhile, Spiegel also said Snap is forming a separate subsidiary to handle development of its Specs AR glasses to improve work with external partners.

Established in unison with US payment infrastructure company Paera, the pay card allows users to deposit and spend Circle’s USDC stablecoin on the Polygon network, the company said in an announcement on Wednesday. “Once the user deposits into their Tangem Pay account, they can spend anywhere Visa is accepted, regardless of the local currency,” Tangem Pay CEO Marcos Nunes said, noting that the solution supports Apple Pay and Google Pay for instant Visa payments. 42 countries set to receive Tangem Pay cards in major rollout Tangem Pay cards will begin to be issued in late November across the United States, Latin America, and major Asia-Pacific markets, with a European launch planned for 2026. The initial rollout will cover 42 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the U.S. “The virtual card is just the beginning — we are already working on expanding to new countries and offering incentives to make this our users’ go-to card for daily spending,” Nunes said. Tangem describes the pay card as a central component of its broader vision for a comprehensive self-custody crypto ecosystem, encompassing storage, growth, and spending. Unlike custodial wallets, self-custodial options have the added benefit of providing users with direct ownership of their cryptocurrency without having to adhere to any KYC mandates. A Tangem hardware wallet-centered crypto card does act as a cold wallet, consistent with the “be-your-own-bank” guidelines; however, the Tangem Pay account is still regulated by KYC regulations. Tangem itself does not have access to user data, and KYC is only required for the pay card balance. If a user is blacklisted or engaged in criminal conduct, the partner regulatory authority that monitors compliance may disconnect the card from the payment network without compromising the hardware wallet. Rain manages compliance and settlement for Tangem Pay, a stablecoin payment infrastructure provider. Rain recently revealed plans to integrate with Western Union’s upcoming stablecoin-based settlement system. Western Union’s Solana-based Digital Asset Network, officially announced in late October, will feature the company’s proprietary stablecoin and is expected to launch in the first half of 2026. Global stablecoin oversight guides Tangem Pay functionality The functionality of the pay card is subject to ongoing global regulatory developments. Fiat-pegged digital tokens, commonly referred to as stablecoins, have garnered regulatory attention due to concerns over their potential risks to financial stability, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. In the U.S., the GENIUS Act of 2025 established a federal definition for “payment stablecoins.” The law would also require issuers to maintain full-reserve backing in liquid assets, publish monthly disclosures, and prohibit misleading marketing that suggests government backing. In addition, it helps resolve that federally regulated stablecoins are neither securities nor bank deposits, which provides both issuers and users with legal predictability. Globally, regulators are taking note. EU’s MiCA framework, the UK’s plans for specific rule regimes on stablecoins, and guidance from international bodies such as FSB or FATF) that are focused on transparency, operational resiliency, and cross-border co-ordination. This is especially critical for Tangem Pay, which operates in 42 markets with a broad range of rules governing reserve requirements, consumer protection, and AML compliance.

According to Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, sophisticated strategies separate the winners from the also-rans in digital asset management. Let’s explore why complex operational approaches are becoming essential for success. Why Do Crypto Treasury Firms Need Advanced Strategies? Hougan argues that simply adding cryptocurrency to a balance sheet no longer cuts it in today’s competitive landscape. The most successful crypto treasury firms employ sophisticated methods that go far beyond passive holding. These complex strategies help companies maximize returns while managing risk effectively. Anyone can buy Bitcoin and wait. However, true value creation comes from actively managing digital assets through innovative financial engineering. This approach separates industry leaders from followers. What Makes MicroStrategy’s Approach So Effective? MicroStrategy exemplifies how complex strategies create substantial value. The company holds approximately $64 billion in Bitcoin against only $8 billion in debt. This creates $56 billion in equity from BTC holdings alone. The firm’s sophisticated approach includes: Using Bitcoin as collateral for convertible notes Issuing preferred stock to acquire more BTC Creating structures that enable premium stock valuation This multi-layered strategy demonstrates why crypto treasury firms must think beyond simple accumulation. Which Complex Strategies Deliver Superior Returns? Hougan highlights several advanced approaches that successful crypto treasury firms employ. These methods require expertise but offer significant rewards. The most effective strategies include: Sophisticated covered call programs on crypto assets Active participation in the DeFi ecosystem Strategic lending operations with proper risk management Each approach demands specialized knowledge and careful execution. However, the potential returns justify the complexity for forward-thinking crypto treasury firms. How Can Companies Avoid Being ‘Lazy’ DAT Operations? Hougan warns that companies taking passive approaches will face valuation discounts. Meanwhile, crypto treasury firms executing difficult strategies will capture market premiums over time. The key differentiator lies in active management and financial innovation. Companies must continuously explore new ways to leverage their digital asset positions. Successful crypto treasury firms treat their digital assets as dynamic financial instruments rather than static holdings. This mindset shift enables creative strategies and superior performance. What Does the Future Hold for Crypto Treasury Management? The evolution continues as more companies recognize the limitations of basic approaches. Crypto treasury firms that adapt and innovate will likely dominate the landscape. We expect to see increased specialization and more sophisticated financial products emerging. The bar for success keeps rising, pushing crypto treasury firms toward greater complexity and expertise. In conclusion, the era of simple buy-and-hold strategies for crypto treasury firms is ending. Companies must embrace complex operational approaches to survive and thrive. Those executing sophisticated strategies will likely outperform their passive counterparts significantly over time. Frequently Asked Questions What are crypto treasury firms? Crypto treasury firms manage digital assets for companies, using various strategies to maximize returns and manage risk beyond simple buying and holding. Why do crypto treasury firms need complex strategies? Complex strategies help companies extract more value from their digital assets, manage risk better, and avoid valuation discounts that affect passive holders. What makes MicroStrategy’s approach successful? MicroStrategy uses Bitcoin as collateral to issue financial instruments, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of acquisition and value creation that supports premium valuation. What are some examples of complex crypto strategies? Effective strategies include covered call programs, DeFi participation, lending operations, and using digital assets as collateral for various financial instruments. How do complex strategies affect company valuation? Companies executing sophisticated strategies typically trade at premiums, while passive holders often face valuation discounts relative to their asset values. Can small companies implement complex crypto strategies? While challenging, smaller companies can implement scaled versions of complex strategies, though they may need specialized expertise or external partners.

Global asset managers are increasingly adopting tokenization in their operations The “Fintech 2030” programme includes more than 40 measures to integrate AI, set up a tokenisation system and strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. Regarding this progress, Yue commented that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is developing a framework for tokenized deposit settlements that can eventually include a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for bank transactions, according to a South China Morning Post report. Yue shared these plans in his latest article, which also highlighted the achievements they have made so far in their “Fintech 2025” strategy. The executive also discussed the future direction of the initiative, which aims to cement Hong Kong’s position as a global fintech leader . Yue noted that “Financial infrastructure is like a highway, enabling capital and financial assets to travel safely and efficiently through our economy.” The CEO pointed out the need to build this financial infrastructure, stating, “For Hong Kong’s digital economy to thrive, not only do we need those as mentioned earlier ‘soft infrastructure,’ robust financial ‘hard infrastructure’ is equally crucial.” Franklin Templeton is partnering with HSBC and OSL Group on Project Ensemble to establish this framework effectively. OSL Group is a licensed virtual asset platform in Hong Kong. Notably, this project is part of the HKMA’s sandbox testing of tokenized deposits and money transfers. HSBC leaders say this setup could permit nearly instant settlements between traditional and blockchain-based systems. In the meantime, Franklin Templeton introduced Hong Kong’s first tokenized fund, following the observation that global asset managers were increasingly adopting tokenization to enhance efficiency and transparency. This shift towards tokenization followed a report from Ripple and the Boston Consulting Group, dated April of this year, which forecasted that the value of tokenized real-world assets would escalate from approximately $36 billion today to $19 trillion by 2033. Institutional investors increase their confidence in blockchain-based assets As tokenization becomes increasingly popular in the ecosystem, sources noted that institutional investors are swiftly shifting their focus towards tokenization technology and blockchain last month. This followed their belief that their average investment in digital assets will double in the next three years, according to a recent study by State Street, a global leader in custody and asset management. The reports also noted that around 60% of firms plan to increase their digital asset exposure significantly next year. This is indicative of continued strong institutional confidence in the long-term role of blockchain-represented digital assets. The results are part of State Street’s 2025 Digital Assets Outlook, which aggregated views from top executives at asset managers and owners around the world as to how they feel, what they are planning, and how adventurous (or otherwise) their approach is towards new technologies. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that State Street, founded in 1792 and based in Boston, is ranked as one of the key financial institutions globally. As of June 30, 2025, it managed approximately $49 trillion in assets under custody and administration, and around $5.1 trillion through its investment division.

In a surprising market move, the Bitcoin price has tumbled below the crucial $103,000 level, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $102,974.6 on the Binance USDT market, marking a significant downturn that has investors scrambling for answers. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below $103,000? The sudden Bitcoin price decline has left many wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors that could be influencing this downward movement. However, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and price fluctuations are common occurrences in this dynamic space. Several key elements typically affect Bitcoin price movements: Market sentiment and investor psychology Global economic conditions Regulatory developments Trading volume and liquidity Institutional investment patterns What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, investors naturally become concerned about their portfolios. The current drop below $103,000 represents a critical psychological barrier for many market participants. Therefore, understanding the context of this Bitcoin price movement is essential for making informed decisions. Historically, the Bitcoin price has shown remarkable resilience despite temporary setbacks. Many long-term investors view these dips as potential buying opportunities, while short-term traders might adjust their strategies accordingly. The key is to maintain perspective and avoid panic-driven decisions. How to Navigate Bitcoin Price Volatility Navigating the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin price movements requires careful planning and risk management. Here are some practical strategies: Dollar-cost averaging to smooth out purchase prices Setting clear investment goals and sticking to them Diversifying your portfolio across different assets Staying informed about market developments Using stop-loss orders to manage risk What’s Next for Bitcoin Price? While the current Bitcoin price situation might seem concerning, cryptocurrency markets have consistently demonstrated their ability to recover from downturns. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged, and many experts believe this could be a temporary correction rather than a long-term trend. Market analysts will be closely watching how the Bitcoin price behaves around the $103,000 level in the coming days. A sustained break below this point could signal further downward pressure, while a quick recovery might indicate strong buyer support at these levels. Conclusion: Understanding Bitcoin Price Movements The Bitcoin price dropping below $103,000 serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. However, experienced investors understand that these fluctuations are part of the landscape. By focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements, investors can navigate these market conditions with greater confidence and clarity. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price fall below $103,000? The Bitcoin price decline can be attributed to various market factors including profit-taking, changing investor sentiment, and broader economic conditions affecting cryptocurrency markets. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price drop? Investment decisions should align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Many investors view price dips as potential buying opportunities, but always conduct your own research. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is challenging. The Bitcoin price is influenced by numerous factors, and while technical analysis can provide guidance, there are no guarantees in cryptocurrency markets. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some investors consider price corrections as entry points, but timing the market perfectly is difficult. Dollar-cost averaging is often recommended for long-term investors. What support levels should I watch for Bitcoin price? Traders typically monitor previous resistance-turned-support levels, with $100,000 being a key psychological level to watch following the break below $103,000.

Chainlink struggles near $14 as traders eye a possible $27 rebound, and Hyperliquid loses 7% amid fading momentum. Meanwhile, presales with clear structures and real scarcity are drawing smart money. Projects with defined price stages, staking rewards, and transparent supply mechanics now stand out as safer high-upside bets for late-2025. Among these, BullZilla has become the name echoing through trading chats. It pairs Ethereum-based utility with cinematic lore, blending storytelling and tokenomics. Price steps rise every $100K raised or every 48 hours, keeping momentum on schedule. Staking and referrals lock tokens while expanding reach. The formula is math over hype and community over chaos. As major tokens stall, BullZilla continues to dominate conversations around the top crypto presales to buy with $500. Don’t Watch The Next Stage Pass You By: Get BullZilla At $0.00022573 Before The Automatic Price Lift Hits. Chainlink (LINK) Battles To Hold $14 Support As Volume Surges Chainlink trades around $14.34 after falling 6.9% in 24 hours. According to TronWeekly, LINK’s support between $14 and $15 remains the decisive zone. MACD and RSI both show cooling pressure, while 24-hour volume has climbed 72%, suggesting accumulation at lower bands. Analysts believe holding above $14 could spark a rally toward $27 or even $46 if buying momentum strengthens. The fundamentals still support optimism. Institutional integrations with Mastercard and rising DeFi adoption keep LINK relevant even through drawdowns. Traders expect short-term volatility but recognise the long-term upside if on-chain activity continues to expand. For now, those seeking faster compounding opportunities are turning toward structured presales like BullZilla, where returns and timelines are clearly mapped out. Frequently Asked Questions About Chainlink Why Is Chainlink Trading Near $14 Support? Chainlink is consolidating after a 7% decline as traders test the $14–$15 support range. Analysts view this level as crucial for a rebound, with rising volumes suggesting strong buyer accumulation and renewed investor interest in LINK’s fundamentals. Can Chainlink Recover From This Decline? Yes. If Chainlink holds the $14 support zone, analysts project a rally toward $27–$46. Continued institutional adoption, growing DeFi integrations, and increased trading volume could accelerate recovery and restore positive momentum in the coming weeks.

Roar Burn Mechanism And Its Supply Impact BullZilla’s Roar Burn permanently eliminates 8 billion tokens throughout its 24 lore chapters. Each burn event reduces the circulating supply and ignites community hype. This ongoing deflation strengthens the long-term value of the token and turns narrative milestones into measurable scarcity. The process creates an emotional and economic feedback loop in which each story chapter tightens supply and fuels buying pressure. Frequently Asked Questions About BullZilla Presale What Is The Current BullZilla Presale Price? BullZilla’s presale price is $0.00022573 in Stage 9, Phase 2. The next price step to $0.00023239 activates automatically once $100K in sales is reached or 48 hours pass, ensuring consistent upward momentum for early participants. What Is The BullZilla Presale Price Prediction? Analysts project BullZilla’s listing price near $0.00527, representing potential gains above 2,000% from current stages.

The Bullzilla presale will conclude once all stages are sold out or the funding cap is met. Investors can track real-time progress, remaining stages, and price updates directly through the official BullZilla presale dashboard at bullzilla.com. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Drops 7.06% As Liquidity Rotates Hyperliquid fell to $37.37 after traders shifted funds into structured presales and DeFi yield programs. The token’s recent decline mirrors broader sentiment in speculative markets. Despite the short-term weakness, on-chain participation and staking data remain strong. Analysts see the drop as tactical rather than structural, with recovery potential once volatility subsides. Hyperliquid’s ecosystem continues to expand, yet capital prefers predictable reward cycles. This migration underscores the growing appeal of projects like BullZilla, which offer both entertainment and precision in tokenomics. Investors are learning that mechanical scarcity often outperforms pure momentum in turbulent weeks. Frequently Asked Questions About Hyperliquid Why Did Hyperliquid Fall 7.06%? Hyperliquid’s decline followed short-term profit-taking and trader rotation into structured presales. Liquidity shifted toward tokens offering scheduled price mechanics and straightforward utility, with analysts labeling the move tactical rather than reflective of long-term weakness. Will Hyperliquid Recover Soon? Recovery is possible. On-chain participation, staking volumes, and project fundamentals remain strong. If overall market stability improves, analysts expect Hyperliquid’s token to regain traction, supported by user growth and potential ecosystem integrations later this quarter. How To Spot Fake Telegram Presale Channels Fraudsters exploit hype by cloning official presale groups. Always verify channels via the official website or verified X handles. Never share wallet seed phrases or private keys. Confirm contract addresses on Etherscan before any transaction. Genuine admins never ask for direct payments or personal access. For larger allocations, consider hardware wallets. A simple rule: if a deal looks impossibly generous, it usually is. Vigilance and small test transactions can prevent heavy losses. Act Now: Stage 9C Approaches. Lock Your BullZilla Tokens Before The Next 2.95% Price Rise. Conclusion As the market recalibrates, Chainlink steadies near $14, while Hyperliquid slides 7%, showing a rotation toward structured opportunities. Smart investors scanning the top crypto presales to buy with $500 are prioritizing projects built on transparency, community alignment, and timed scarcity.

Fresh on-chain data reveals a surprisingly optimistic picture that suggests we’re witnessing a healthy market transition rather than a catastrophic downturn. Let’s explore what the blockchain numbers really tell us about Bitcoin’s current state. What does on-chain data reveal about Bitcoin’s health? Despite recent market turbulence causing over $1.7 billion in liquidations, the underlying on-chain data tells a different story. CryptoQuant’s analysis shows exchange balances continue their steady decline, indicating investors are moving their Bitcoin to self-custody rather than panic selling. This critical on-chain data pattern mirrors historical market stabilization phases where smart money accumulates during periods of fear. Why the MVRV ratio matters for Bitcoin investors Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio currently sits at 1.8, its lowest level since April. This key on-chain data metric has historically signaled accumulation zones when dropping into the 1.8 to 2.0 range. The current reading suggests: Large-scale profit-taking is nearly complete We’re likely in a medium-term bottom formation Early recovery phases often begin from these levels How exchange flows validate the transition theory The steady outflow from exchanges represents one of the most reliable pieces of on-chain data available. When investors withdraw Bitcoin to personal wallets, they demonstrate long-term conviction rather than short-term trading intentions. This on-chain data pattern contrasts sharply with true bear markets, where exchange inflows typically spike as investors prepare to sell. What stablecoin supply tells us about market readiness High stablecoin supply remains another crucial piece of supportive on-chain data. With ample ‘dry powder’ waiting on the sidelines, the market maintains strong buying potential. This on-chain data element, combined with completed profit-taking, creates conditions ripe for the next upward move. Key takeaways from current on-chain data analysis The collective on-chain data paints a picture of rational market reshuffling rather than panic-driven collapse. We’re seeing: Strategic accumulation rather than distressed selling Historical pattern alignment with past recovery phases Strong fundamental support from multiple on-chain metrics This comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin’s on-chain data suggests we’re experiencing a necessary market transition that typically precedes stronger, more sustainable price advances. The blockchain doesn’t lie – and currently, it’s telling a story of accumulation and preparation rather than capitulation. Frequently Asked Questions What is on-chain data in cryptocurrency? On-chain data refers to all publicly available information recorded on a blockchain, including transactions, wallet balances, and network activity that provides insights into market behavior. Why is the MVRV ratio important for Bitcoin? The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value, helping identify whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued relative to its historical cost basis. How reliable is on-chain data for predicting market moves? While not perfect, on-chain data provides objective insights into investor behavior and has historically correlated well with major market turning points when multiple metrics align. What does declining exchange balance indicate? Reducing exchange balances typically signals investors are moving coins to long-term storage, suggesting confidence in future price appreciation rather than imminent selling. How often is on-chain data updated? Most on-chain data updates in real-time as new blocks are added to the blockchain, providing current insights into market dynamics. Can on-chain data predict exact price bottoms? While on-chain data can identify accumulation zones and potential bottoms, it works best as part of a comprehensive analysis rather than a standalone timing tool.

That’s exactly what happened to Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who made headlines by converting his entire compensation into cryptocurrency. This bold move has paid off spectacularly, demonstrating the potential of Bitcoin salary arrangements for forward-thinking individuals. How Did the Miami Mayor’s Bitcoin Salary Strategy Work? Mayor Francis Suarez began his Bitcoin salary journey when the cryptocurrency was trading around $30,000. He committed to receiving his entire compensation in Bitcoin, a decision that required significant conviction in digital assets. This approach to Bitcoin salary payments represents a growing trend among public figures and tech-savvy professionals who believe in cryptocurrency’s long-term value. The mayor’s Bitcoin salary strategy wasn’t without its challenges. He experienced periods when Bitcoin dipped below his entry price, yet he maintained his commitment to the digital currency. His persistence highlights an important lesson about cryptocurrency investing: short-term volatility often gives way to substantial long-term gains for those who stay the course. What Returns Has the Bitcoin Salary Generated? The results speak for themselves. Mayor Suarez’s Bitcoin salary has delivered impressive returns: 300% overall gain after four years of consistent Bitcoin salary payments 400% peak returns when Bitcoin reached approximately $120,000 Consistent growth despite market fluctuations These returns demonstrate the power of dollar-cost averaging through regular Bitcoin salary deposits. Rather than trying to time the market, the mayor consistently accumulated Bitcoin regardless of price movements, which smoothed out his average purchase price over time. Why Choose a Bitcoin Salary Over Traditional Payments? Mayor Suarez emphasizes that his focus isn’t on short-term price movements. Instead, he views his Bitcoin salary as exposure to what he believes is a superior store of value. This perspective aligns with many cryptocurrency advocates who see Bitcoin as digital gold – a hedge against inflation and traditional financial system risks. Choosing a Bitcoin salary requires considering several factors: Long-term investment horizon Risk tolerance for volatility Belief in cryptocurrency fundamentals Diversification from traditional assets The success of this Bitcoin salary approach has inspired other cities and individuals to explore similar compensation arrangements. However, it’s crucial to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, and cryptocurrency investments carry substantial risk. What Can We Learn From This Bitcoin Salary Success Story? Mayor Suarez’s Bitcoin salary experience offers valuable insights for anyone considering cryptocurrency exposure. His strategy demonstrates the importance of conviction during market downturns and the potential rewards of maintaining a long-term perspective. The 300% return on his Bitcoin salary validates his approach, though individual results may vary. This Bitcoin salary success story also highlights how traditional compensation models are evolving. As digital assets become more mainstream, we may see more employers offering Bitcoin salary options to attract forward-thinking talent. The key is understanding both the opportunities and risks involved in such arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions How does receiving a Bitcoin salary work technically? Employers typically convert the dollar amount of salary into Bitcoin at the current market rate and transfer it to the employee’s digital wallet on payday. Some use specialized payroll services that handle the conversion automatically. What are the tax implications of a Bitcoin salary? In most countries, Bitcoin salary is treated as property for tax purposes. You’ll owe taxes on the fair market value of Bitcoin received as ordinary income, plus capital gains tax when you sell or trade it. Is a Bitcoin salary suitable for everyone? No, a Bitcoin salary carries higher volatility risk than traditional currency. It’s best suited for those with strong risk tolerance, emergency savings in stable currencies, and long-term investment horizons. Can employers legally pay salaries in Bitcoin? Legality varies by jurisdiction. Some countries fully allow Bitcoin salary payments, while others have restrictions or require simultaneous payment in traditional currency. Always consult local regulations. How do you manage daily expenses with a Bitcoin salary? Most people convert portions to traditional currency as needed for expenses while keeping the remainder as investment. Some use Bitcoin debit cards or payment platforms that automatically convert cryptocurrency during transactions. What happens if Bitcoin price crashes after receiving salary? Like any volatile investment, value can decrease. This risk underscores why financial experts recommend keeping essential living expense funds in stable currencies and only investing what you can afford to lose.

54080010,621807,1762394450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54080010.jpeg,Bitcoin Accumulation Hits Record High Despite Market Fear: 375K BTC Added in 30 Days,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-accumulation-hits-record-high-despite-fear/,"Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim higher levels after several days of intense selling pressure and a brief dip below the critical $100,000 mark. The market is showing signs of exhaustion as bulls attempt to regain momentum, yet price continues to trade under key resistance zones. Sentiment has turned increasingly bearish, with fear beginning to creep into market behavior as traders question whether the recent move was the start of a deeper correction or a temporary shakeout. Despite the growing pessimism, on-chain signals paint a far more constructive picture beneath the surface. According to data shared by analyst Darkfost, Bitcoin accumulator addresses — wallets that steadily acquire BTC without selling — are now storing coins at record pace. Over the last 30 days alone, these wallets have added more than 375,000 BTC, marking a new all-time high in accumulation activity. This divergence between price weakness and large-scale accumulation suggests that long-horizon investors are treating the pullback as opportunity rather than threat. While short-term sentiment remains fragile, the behavior of strategic buyers adds a layer of confidence to Bitcoin’s long-term outlook, hinting that strong hands are positioning for future upside even as short-term traders panic. The coming days will test whether this underlying demand can stabilize price and eventually fuel a rebound. Long-Term Accumulators Continue to Buy Aggressively Darkfost highlights that accumulation activity has intensified sharply, even as broader market demand cools. Just yesterday alone, accumulator addresses added more than 50,000 BTC — an extraordinary signal of conviction amid volatility. Over the past two months, this cohort has doubled its pace of accumulation, with the monthly average jumping from roughly 130,000 BTC to 262,000 BTC. Such acceleration during a period of price weakness underscores a powerful long-term bid absorbing supply. Accumulator addresses follow strict criteria: they must have made at least two inbound transactions above a minimum BTC threshold and must have never sold a single coin. This wallet behavior aligns closely with long-term holders who operate independently of short-term sentiment trends, macro headlines, or intraday price movements. In other words, these are strategic participants positioning for future cycles — not traders reacting to fear. Even as the market debates whether the recent drop marks the start of a deeper correction, this group continues accumulating without hesitation. These flows also coincide with increasing institutional exposure through spot Bitcoin ETFs, which likely amplifies long-duration demand. Together, the consistent accumulation behavior and ETF-driven structural bid reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term strength, even as short-term price action remains clouded by uncertainty and emotional selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Retail Retreat: Shrimp Deposits Drop 5x Since Early 2023 BTC Weekly Outlook: Bulls Defend Key Structure as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a decisive shift in sentiment as price continues to struggle below the $110,000 mark and recently dipped under $100,000. This sharp pullback comes after multiple failed attempts to break higher, reflecting weakened bullish momentum and increased profit-taking across the market. Despite the drop, BTC remains above its 50-week moving average, which continues to act as a key dynamic support zone. As long as the weekly candle structure holds above this level, the broader uptrend remains technically intact. However, a clean breakdown below this support would open the door to deeper retracement levels near $95,000 and potentially $88,000 — areas where buyers previously stepped in aggressively. Volume has increased during this sell-off, which suggests genuine liquidation and not just low-liquidity volatility. Yet, importantly, the volume spike is still smaller than the capitulation clusters seen during past cycle resets, hinting that this move may represent a shakeout rather than a full trend reversal. Momentum indicators are cooling, and sentiment has clearly turned cautious. Still, long-term structure remains constructive while Bitcoin holds above major support. For now, BTC sits in a critical zone where bulls must defend trend structure to avoid a broader corrective phase.

Experts Predict The Timeline,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/when-will-the-crypto-market-surge-again/,"The question dominating crypto desks this week is whether the cycle is intact, and when the bull run will return. Two widely followed macro commentators sketched the same causal chain from public-sector cash management to crypto asset beta, arguing that the current drawdown is a liquidity story first and a sentiment story second—and that its reversal hinges on the mechanics of the US Treasury General Account (TGA), Federal Reserve balance-sheet policy, and the timing of Washington’s reopening. Crypto Market Awaits US Government Shutdown Resolution Macro analyst @plur_daddy on X summarizes the current state bluntly: “We are seeing the contraction in liquidity flowing through into risk markets. Naturally it first showed up in BTC and market internals within equities, and now is finally hitting the broader indices.” He describes a textbook quality rotation underway—speculative thematics “such as quantum, nuclear, drones, and alt energy have been getting destroyed,” while flows consolidate into the megacap cohort and earnings-backed momentum, notably the AI capex complex. The underlying plumbing, in his reading, is starved of bank reserves as cash piles into the TGA and quantitative tightening (QT) continues to shrink the Fed’s balance sheet. “Monetary liquidity is drawing down as the TGA has become overfilled beyond the Treasury Dept’s $850bn cap, due to mechanical factors around higher issuance, timing of specific payments, and the government shutdown. There is a broader lack of bank reserves which continues to fall below the key $3trn threshold.” His conclusion is conditional but clear: these stresses “will precipitate actions to calm market plumbing but it will take time.” Related Reading: Caution In The Crypto Market: Expert Warns Of Bearish Phase Unfolding This November On the dollar and cross-asset risk, he points to a crucial level: “The DXY has been rallying and is now approaching a key level at 101, which would be a logical point for it to top. I continue to believe the Trump administration wants a lower dollar.” The path to a crypto bottom, in his cadence, is explicitly tied to policy milestones: “The government reopening provides a clear catalyst to mark the bottom in liquidity conditions. Then, we get QT unwinding Dec 1 and then potentially more Fed actions (such as hints on bills repurchases) on Dec 10. The fiscal deficit will expand significantly starting Jan 1 as the OBBBA will fully kick in.” He characterizes Bitcoin’s behavior as resilient—“BTC has held in well despite tremendous OG selling, the aftermath of 10/10, and the factors above”—and describes his own playbook accordingly: “I currently have a sizable cash position and plan to aggressively add equities (especially the memory trade) and BTC once the government reopening looks imminent.” Hours later he added, “Bought some BTC. Seeing progress being made towards government reopening and signs that liquidity headwinds have peaked. Risk/reward here is strong with sentiment bombed out.” When The Liquidity Returns Raoul Pal, whose framework centers almost entirely on the global liquidity cycle, pushes the same thesis to its logical macro conclusion. “If global liquidity is the single most dominant macro factor then we MUST focus on that,” he writes, before distilling the next year of market structure into a single constraint: “REMEMBER — THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN IS ROLLING $10TRN IN DEBT. EVERYTHING ELSE IS A SIDESHOW. THIS IS THE GAME OF THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.” In Pal’s telling, the shutdown’s effect is immediate and mechanical—“the gov shutdown has forced a sharp tightening of liquidity as the TGA builds up with no where to spend it. This is not offset by the ability to drain the Reverse Repo (it is drained). And QT drains it further”—and crypto, as the highest-beta liquidity asset, takes the brunt. The pivot, he argues, is likewise mechanical once fiscal operations restart: “As soon as the gov shutdown ends, the Treasury begins spending $250bn to $350bn in a couple of months. QT ends and the balance sheet technically expands. The Dollar will likely begin to weaken again as liquidity begins to flow.” Related Reading: Crypto Isn’t Topping Yet: Arthur Hayes Says Stealth QE Is Near He layers on prospective policy and regulatory catalysts—“SLR changes free up more of the banks balance sheets allowing for credit expansion. The CLARITY Act will get passed, giving the crypto regs so desperately needed for large scale adoption by banks, asset managers and businesses overall. The Big Beautiful Bill then kicks in to goose the economy into the midterms”—and frames the global backdrop as additive, with China’s balance-sheet expansion and Japan’s policy mix supporting a broader risk rally. His tactical advice is to accept bull-market volatility without over-reacting: “Always remember the Dont Fuck This Up rules… and wait out the volatility. Drawdowns like this are common place in bull markets and their job is to test your faith. BTFD if you can.” The punchline comes down to a single indicator within his dashboard: “td:dr — When this number goes up, all numbers go up.” The through-line across both perspectives is the primacy of dollar liquidity—specifically, the interaction of Treasury cash balances, Fed asset purchases or run-off, and the available stock of bank reserves after the Reverse Repo Program has largely normalized. When the TGA rises without offset, it functions as a suction pump on aggregate reserves; when it falls as the Treasury spends, reserves rebuild, the marginal cost of leverage eases, and high-beta assets—crypto first—tend to outperform. Where does that leave the timing question implied by every red candle on crypto Twitter? Neither source offers a date, but both tether the next leg higher to the same sequence: a resolution in Washington that flips the TGA from hoarding to spending, visible easing in reserve scarcity as QT pauses or is unwound, a swerve lower in the dollar from resistance, and renewed fiscal impulse that re-steepens the growth impulse into 2026. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.38 trillion.

The Coinbase acquisition strategy reveals a master plan to build the most comprehensive blockchain ecosystem in the industry. According to groundbreaking research from Tiger Research, this isn’t just about buying companies—it’s about creating an unstoppable growth machine. What Makes the Coinbase Acquisition Strategy So Revolutionary? Tiger Research’s analysis shows that every acquisition serves a specific purpose in building the Base chain ecosystem. The firm identifies a clear industry consensus: Base will eventually launch its own token. For this token to achieve maximum valuation, the underlying ecosystem must be incredibly robust. Therefore, the Coinbase acquisition strategy focuses on creating a seamless system that eliminates traditional barriers for quality projects. How Does This Strategy Benefit the Entire Crypto Space? The research highlights several key advantages of this approach. First, it creates a win-win situation for both Coinbase and project developers. Projects gain access to: Legal framework support Technical infrastructure Fundraising assistance Market access and visibility Meanwhile, Coinbase strengthens its position as the go-to platform for serious blockchain development. The Coinbase acquisition strategy essentially builds moats around their ecosystem while making it easier for others to join. What Tools Power This Ecosystem Growth? Tiger Research specifically mentions tools like Liquify and Echo that will become central to the onboarding process. These tools represent the practical implementation of the Coinbase acquisition strategy . They allow projects to: Streamline technical integration Navigate regulatory requirements Access funding networks Connect with potential users This infrastructure-first approach distinguishes Coinbase from competitors who focus primarily on trading volume. Why Should Investors Care About This Strategy? The long-term implications of this Coinbase acquisition strategy are significant for several reasons. A strong Base ecosystem means: Higher potential token valuation Increased platform utility Stronger network effects Reduced project failure rates Moreover, this approach positions Coinbase as more than just an exchange—it becomes the foundation for Web3 innovation. What Challenges Does This Strategy Face? Despite the brilliant planning, the Coinbase acquisition strategy must overcome several hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty remains the biggest challenge, especially given the evolving nature of crypto regulations globally. Additionally, integrating multiple acquisitions smoothly requires exceptional operational excellence. The strategy also depends on continuous project adoption and maintaining quality standards across the ecosystem. Conclusion: A Visionary Path Forward The Coinbase acquisition strategy represents one of the most sophisticated approaches to ecosystem building in cryptocurrency history. By focusing on infrastructure and removing barriers, Coinbase positions itself not just as a platform, but as an essential partner for blockchain innovation. As Tiger Research suggests, this could fundamentally reshape how we think about exchange value and ecosystem growth in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main goal of Coinbase’s acquisition strategy? The primary goal is to build a comprehensive ecosystem around Base chain that makes project onboarding seamless while ensuring long-term value creation. How will this strategy affect Base token valuation? A robust ecosystem with many quality projects increases utility and demand, which typically leads to higher token valuation over time. What tools are mentioned for project onboarding? Tiger Research specifically highlights Liquify and Echo as key ecosystem tools that help projects overcome technical, legal, and fundraising challenges. How does this strategy benefit smaller projects? Smaller projects gain access to infrastructure and support that would otherwise require significant resources to develop independently. What makes this different from other exchange strategies? Unlike competitors who focus mainly on trading, Coinbase emphasizes ecosystem building and infrastructure development for long-term dominance. When can we expect to see results from this strategy? While some benefits are immediate, the full impact will likely materialize over the next 12-24 months as more projects onboard and the ecosystem matures. Found this analysis insightful?

Recent data reveals an unprecedented surge in bearish bets, indicating growing caution among market participants about Bitcoin’s near-term prospects. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Options Market Shift? Crypto options exchange Deribit reports staggering numbers that highlight this trend. The open interest for put options with an $80,000 strike price has surpassed $1 billion, while puts with a $90,000 strike have reached $1.9 billion. This massive positioning suggests traders are actively hedging against potential price declines. Interestingly, this combined bearish positioning nearly equals the total open interest for call options with strike prices between $120,000 and $140,000. However, market analysts caution against interpreting this as purely bullish sentiment on the other side. Are These Really Bullish Bets? CoinDesk’s analysis reveals a crucial nuance in the Bitcoin options market data. A significant portion of the high-strike call options likely results from a covered call strategy rather than simple bullish speculation. This sophisticated approach involves: Existing BTC holders selling call options Generating premium income from their holdings Managing risk while maintaining exposure This strategy indicates that even long-term holders are becoming more cautious in the current Bitcoin options market environment. Why the Sudden Caution in Bitcoin Options Trading? Several factors are contributing to the shifting sentiment in the Bitcoin options market. Traders appear to be bracing for potential volatility amid: Regulatory uncertainty in major markets Macroeconomic pressures affecting risk assets Technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions Institutional profit-taking after recent gains The concentration of put options at specific strike prices suggests traders are establishing clear risk management levels in the Bitcoin options market. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? The current activity in the Bitcoin options market provides valuable insights for all market participants. The surge in bearish positioning indicates: Increased hedging activity among institutional players Growing risk awareness following recent price appreciation Sophisticated strategy implementation by experienced traders Potential support and resistance levels for future price action This development in the Bitcoin options market doesn’t necessarily predict a major crash, but it does signal that professional traders are preparing for increased volatility. Key Takeaways from the Bitcoin Options Market Data The current state of the Bitcoin options market reveals several important trends that every crypto investor should understand. The massive put option interest demonstrates how derivatives markets can provide early warning signals about shifting sentiment. Moreover, the prevalence of covered call strategies shows that even bullish investors are adopting more conservative approaches in the current Bitcoin options market environment. This balanced perspective helps create more stable market conditions despite the apparent bearish positioning. Frequently Asked Questions What are put options in the Bitcoin options market? Put options give holders the right to sell Bitcoin at a specific price by a certain date. They’re bearish bets that profit when prices fall below the strike price. Why are traders buying so many put options? Traders are likely hedging against potential price declines or speculating on a market correction after recent price gains. Does high put volume always mean prices will drop? Not necessarily. High put volume can indicate hedging rather than pure bearish speculation, and markets often surprise consensus expectations. What is a covered call strategy? A covered call involves selling call options against Bitcoin you already own to generate additional income while maintaining your position. How reliable are options market signals for price prediction? Options market data provides valuable sentiment indicators but should be combined with other analysis methods for comprehensive market understanding. Should retail investors worry about this options activity? While worth monitoring, retail investors should focus on their own risk tolerance and investment strategy rather than overreacting to derivatives market movements.

OKX, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has just announced the listing of two major privacy-focused cryptocurrencies for perpetual futures trading. This strategic move opens up new trading opportunities for investors seeking exposure to DASH and ZEC with significant leverage capabilities. What Are Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? Perpetual futures represent one of the most popular derivative products in cryptocurrency markets. Unlike traditional futures that have expiration dates, perpetual futures contracts continue indefinitely until traders decide to close their positions. This innovative financial instrument allows traders to speculate on price movements without actually owning the underlying assets. The key advantages of perpetual futures include: No expiration dates to worry about High leverage opportunities Ability to profit from both rising and falling markets 24/7 trading availability When Can You Start Trading These New Perpetual Futures? OKX has scheduled the listings with precise timing to ensure smooth market operations. The DASH/USDT perpetual future goes live first at 3:00 a.m. UTC today, followed by the ZEC/USDT perpetual future just 15 minutes later at 3:15 a.m. UTC. This staggered approach helps manage market volatility and allows traders to prepare adequately for both listings. Both contracts will trade against USDT, providing stability and familiarity for most cryptocurrency traders. The simultaneous introduction of these two privacy-focused coins suggests OKX’s confidence in the growing demand for alternative cryptocurrency exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. How Does 50x Leverage Transform Your Trading Strategy? The availability of 50x leverage represents a significant opportunity for experienced traders. This level of leverage means traders can control positions worth 50 times their initial margin. However, it’s crucial to understand both the potential rewards and risks involved with high-leverage trading. Key considerations for using 50x leverage: Amplified profits from small price movements Increased risk of liquidation during volatility Requires careful risk management strategies Essential to use stop-loss orders effectively What Makes DASH and ZEC Stand Out for Futures Trading? DASH and ZEC bring unique characteristics to the perpetual futures market. DASH, originally known as Darkcoin, focuses on fast transactions and privacy features. ZEC (Zcash) offers advanced privacy protection through zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to shield transaction details while maintaining blockchain security. These privacy-focused coins have established strong communities and consistent trading volumes, making them ideal candidates for perpetual futures products. Their addition to OKX’s derivatives lineup provides traders with more diversified exposure within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. How Will This Impact the Broader Cryptocurrency Market? The introduction of DASH and ZEC perpetual futures signals continued maturation of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. As major exchanges expand their offerings beyond mainstream coins, it demonstrates growing institutional and retail interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. Market analysts suggest this development could: Increase liquidity for DASH and ZEC markets Attract new traders to privacy-focused coins Potentially reduce price volatility through better hedging tools Encourage other exchanges to expand their derivatives offerings What Should Traders Consider Before Jumping In? While the opportunity is exciting, successful trading requires preparation and strategy. New traders should familiarize themselves with OKX’s trading interface, understand margin requirements, and develop clear risk management protocols before engaging with high-leverage perpetual futures. Essential preparation steps include: Testing strategies with small positions initially Understanding funding rate mechanisms Monitoring market conditions and news developments Setting realistic profit targets and risk limits Frequently Asked Questions What are perpetual futures contracts? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that don’t have expiration dates, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they maintain required margin levels. What time do DASH and ZEC perpetual futures start trading? DASH/USDT perpetual futures begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC, followed by ZEC/USDT perpetual futures at 3:15 a.m. UTC on the same day. What is the maximum leverage available? Both DASH and ZEC perpetual futures support up to 50x leverage on the OKX platform. Do I need to own DASH or ZEC to trade these futures? No, perpetual futures allow you to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying cryptocurrencies. What are the risks of trading with 50x leverage? High leverage amplifies both profits and losses, meaning small price movements can result in significant gains or complete liquidation of positions. Are there funding rates for these perpetual futures? Yes, like all perpetual futures, these contracts will have periodic funding rates exchanged between long and short position holders.

According to on-chain investigators, the incident was not publicly disclosed by the firm at the time and only came to light after a detailed blockchain review. DWF Labs: Alleged Attack And Method Reports have disclosed that the attacker drained a wallet tied to DWF Labs and moved the funds through several on-chain steps. The stolen holdings were mostly stablecoins — USDC and USDT — and were then converted into Bitcoin through the Ren bridge before being routed into a mixer called Mixero. The pattern of transfers and the tools used are what led some analysts to suggest a link to the DPRK-associated AppleJeus group. 2/8 On 22nd September 2022, the address 0x3d67fdE4B4F5077f79D3bb8Aaa903BF5e7642751 started being drained. At the same time, withdrawals were made from many exchanges to the same address showing that both private keys and exchange account credentials were likely compromised. pic.twitter.com/7T7ek18SR4 — tanuki42 (@tanuki42_) November 4, 2025 On-Chain Evidence And Reactions Based on reports, the investigation was driven by an analyst known as tanuki42 who flagged the wallet address and traced payments made to and from it before and after the alleged breach. Other sleuths on X, including well-known chain trackers, began to comment and share findings. Some posts pointed to roughly $30 million in Bitcoin-valued pots that have not been touched since the transfers, raising questions about what the attacker intends to do next. DWF Labs has not posted a public incident report or a formal acknowledgement of the claims. What The Movement Looks Like Money moved into centralized exchanges at certain points, which suggests private keys or exchange accounts may have been compromised during the event. After conversion, the flow into a mixer makes it harder to follow the exact trail, but on-chain records show the sequence and timestamps that tie these steps to the September dates. The way funds were handled is similar to other cases tied to state-linked threat actors, according to the analysts studying the chain. Potential Impact And Next Steps If the allegation is confirmed by an independent audit or by the firm itself, the fallout could affect counterparties and projects that relied on DWF Labs for liquidity. Some forensic firms and trackers are poring over the dormant pots of Bitcoin that amount to about $30 million in current value, while exchanges and law-enforcement partners may be asked to help trace or freeze moves if they occur. Investor confidence is part of the discussion now, because public trust depends on clear disclosure and rapid response once a breach is found.

As traders brace for further declines, analysts warn that the meme coin could tumble below the $0.15 threshold if bearish sentiment persists. Related Reading: Valuation Model That Puts XRP Price Above $18,000 Stuns Community Currently trading at around $0.163, Dogecoin fell 5% to $0.16 on Tuesday, breaking below critical support levels amid intensified institutional selling. On-chain data reveals that large holders offloaded more than 1 billion DOGE in the past week, translating to roughly $440 million in outflows. 1 Billion DOGE Sell-Off Intensifies Selling Pressure The recent $1 billion sell-off came after repeated failures to break resistance between $0.18 and $0.19, sparking a steep correction. Trading volume surged 94% above average, hitting 2.05 billion DOGE at the peak of the decline, confirming broad distribution from major wallets. Analysts note that the DOGE price briefly stabilized near $0.155, but the rebound lacked momentum, with lower highs forming a descending pattern, a classic signal of sustained bearish pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at 40.5, indicating moderate bearish momentum, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains negative. A further dip below RSI 40 could trigger stronger downside moves. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Technical Breakdown Confirms Bearish Outlook Dogecoin’s charts now reflect a full breakdown from a multi-week triangle pattern, with price action trapped below all major exponential moving averages (20, 50, 100, and 200-day). The EMAs have flipped into overhead resistance, reinforcing a bearish market structure. Analysts identify $0.15 as the next key support level. Failure to hold this zone could expose DOGE to deeper downside targets near $0.13, while a sustained close below $0.150 would confirm a clean breakdown. On the upside, bulls must reclaim $0.189 and hold above the EMA cluster to signal any meaningful reversal. Dogecoin ETF Momentum Stalls Amid Broader Market Fatigue Adding to the uncertainty, Bitwise and Grayscale are reportedly advancing their Dogecoin ETFs under new rules that allow automatic listing after meeting exchange standards, bypassing direct SEC approval. However, optimism around these products has yet to translate into market strength, as investor enthusiasm appears muted following weeks of price weakness.

There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,410 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it trades below $3,320. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price failed to stay in a positive zone and started a fresh decline below $3,500, like Bitcoin . ETH price declined below $3,450 and $3,350 to enter a bearish zone. The decline gained pace below $3,250. Finally, the bulls appeared near $3,050.

This dramatic shift in interest rates expectations is sending shockwaves through global forex markets , particularly affecting emerging economies across Asia. Why are Asian currencies under pressure from the US dollar surge? The relentless strength of the US dollar has created a perfect storm for Asian currencies . Recent economic data from the United States has forced market participants to reconsider their Federal Reserve policy expectations. The table below shows how major Asian currencies have performed against the dollar: Currency Change vs USD Key Factor Japanese Yen -1.8% Bank of Japan policy divergence Chinese Yuan -1.2% Economic recovery concerns Indian Rupee -0.9% Capital outflows pressure South Korean Won -1.5% Export competitiveness worries How Federal Reserve policy is reshaping global interest rates outlook The Federal Reserve has become the dominant force driving forex markets worldwide. Three key developments are influencing the current situation: Stronger-than-expected US economic data reducing urgency for rate cuts Persistent inflation concerns keeping Fed officials hawkish Global capital flowing back to US assets seeking higher yields What rising interest rates mean for Asian economies Higher interest rates in the United States create significant challenges for Asian currencies and their respective economies. The stronger US dollar increases debt servicing costs for countries with dollar-denominated obligations and makes imports more expensive, potentially fueling inflation in domestic markets. Navigating volatile forex markets in uncertain times For traders and investors in forex markets , the current environment demands careful strategy. The Federal Reserve ‘s stance on interest rates will continue to dictate direction for Asian currencies against the US dollar . Key considerations include monitoring US economic indicators and central bank communications for policy clues. FAQs Which Asian currencies are most vulnerable to US dollar strength? Emerging market currencies with large current account deficits and high external debt levels face the greatest pressure from US dollar appreciation. When might the Federal Reserve consider cutting interest rates? Most analysts now expect the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates until at least mid-2024, pending clearer signs of inflation control. How do central banks in Asia respond to currency weakness? Asian central banks typically use foreign exchange interventions and sometimes interest rates adjustments to support their Asian currencies during US dollar strength periods. The dramatic shift in Federal Reserve policy expectations has fundamentally altered the landscape for Asian currencies , with the US dollar ‘s surge to three-month highs creating significant headwinds. As interest rates remain elevated for longer than anticipated, volatility in forex markets is likely to persist, requiring careful navigation by investors and policymakers alike.

Key Buy Signal Just Triggered,https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-ada-crash-over-key-buy-signal-just-triggered/,"Cardano (ADA) has seen sharp losses over recent weeks, in line with broader weakness across the crypto market. Consequently, the asset is trading around $0.53 at press time, following a 3% drop over the past 24 hours. It has also fallen almost 18% in the past week and is down 37% over the last 30 days. After weeks of selling, new technical developments are drawing attention from market analysts. TD Sequential Indicator Flags Possible Shift Analyst Ali Martinez reported that the TD Sequential indicator has triggered a buy signal for ADA on the 3-day chart. The signal is identified by a red “9” candle, which often appears near the end of a downtrend. Martinez shared the chart and asked, TD Sequential prints a buy signal for Cardano $ADA . Could this mark the reversal? pic.twitter.com/vX7SZxg5N3 — Ali (@ali_charts) November 5, 2025 While the signal does not confirm direction, it may point to a change in trend. ADA has faced selling pressure for most of October but is now attempting to hold support near $0.57. The market will likely need a clear breakout or volume pickup to confirm any move from here. Meanwhile, recent data shows that whales have trimmed their ADA balances over the past few weeks, as CryptoPotato reported . This reduction may have contributed to the ongoing price weakness. Key Support Holds as Analysts Eye $0.50 Level Analyst CryptoPulse posted that ADA has now moved into a known demand zone, where the price has previously found support. The analyst noted , “As long as price stays above $0.50, there’s a good chance we see a retest of the $0.70–$0.80 region.” Traders are watching the $0.50 mark, as it may offer a short-term base. If the level holds, it could support a recovery. If not, the recent trend may continue lower. A separate chart analysis by OceanStaker outlines a Power of Three (PO3) pattern on the ADA/USDT pair. It shows that Cardano may have completed Phase 1 and is now entering Phase 2: accumulation. The level around $0.435 is seen as the potential base. Technical indicators appear to support this structure. The RSI is at 38.06, moving toward oversold territory. The MACD remains negative, with both lines still trending down. If ADA holds support and these indicators shift, it may open the door for a breakout into Phase 3: expansion.

Right now, investors chasing the best 1000x crypto presale to buy are zeroing in on MoonBull, a meme-powered project that’s redefining what early-stage returns can look like. While TON connects with Telegram’s global audience and XLM builds on financial utility, MoonBull is turning simple numbers into staggering growth. Crypto history is written by those who acted early. The few who spotted Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, or Solana before they went parabolic know that timing trumps hype. That same momentum is now centered on MoonBull, where the math shows that even a modest $10 entry could turn into thousands at listing. With a presale already surpassing $550,000 and growing by the day, MoonBull isn’t just another token; it’s shaping up to be the new benchmark for ROI-driven crypto presales. MoonBull’s ROI Shows How $1000 Becomes $73K, Making It the Best 1,000x Crypto Presale to Buy MoonBull’s 23-stage presale operates with precision, rewarding investors who act early while maintaining transparency through visible stage pricing. In the first stage, each token cost just $0.00002500. At that level, a $10 investment bought 400,000 tokens. When the project lists at its planned price of $0.00616, that same $10 would be worth an incredible $2,464 – a gain of 24,540%. Even later entrants benefit handsomely. A $10 purchase in Stage 3 would still reach roughly $1,519 at listing, and those joining in Stage 6, where the token now costs $0.00008388, would still see around $735 in potential value, representing a 7,244 % return. These aren’t wild promises; they’re straight-line calculations that investors can verify themselves. Each presale stage gradually increases the price, providing a clear trajectory for returns. Early-stage participants reap the most significant rewards, while later stages still deliver multi-thousand-dollar potential. That mathematical clarity is why many analysts are calling MoonBull the best 1000x crypto presale to buy , as it lets every investor measure upside with confidence instead of guesswork. TON Expands Through Telegram Integration The Open Network (TON) is transforming accessibility by embedding blockchain directly into Telegram’s ecosystem. The recent update lets users create wallets, manage assets, and send tokens directly in the app. With more than 800 million users, this partnership could catapult TON into one of the most widely adopted blockchain ecosystems worldwide. By merging social connectivity with crypto utility, TON is bridging a gap that few projects have managed to close. It brings blockchain to a global user base without technical barriers, creating a frictionless entry point for everyday users. While MoonBull’s presale offers explosive upside for early investors, TON’s real-world integration demonstrates how blockchain infrastructure can achieve scale through simplicity and reach. Stellar (XLM) Expands Global Payments With Institutional Partnerships Stellar continues to secure its place in the financial sector by improving cross-border remittance systems. Its latest network enhancements, supported by strategic partnerships, are reducing transaction costs and boosting settlement speeds between major financial entities. By focusing on efficient payment solutions, Stellar strengthens its role as a trusted backbone for digital finance. This steady evolution gives XLM a unique advantage; it thrives on reliability rather than hype. While TON pushes accessibility, MoonBull fuels speculation with measurable growth, and Stellar builds bridges connecting blockchain with global financial networks. Together, these three projects reflect how different strategies can lead to sustainable success. Conclusion MoonBull, TON, and Stellar each bring something powerful to the table. TON’s Telegram integration sets the stage for mass adoption. Stellar continues to expand blockchain’s role in banking and remittance systems. But MoonBull stands out for one apparent reason: it quantifies opportunity. With each presale stage, investors can calculate exact returns, proving that even a $1000 investment could multiply into thousands. MoonBull’s structured model, transparent tokenomics, and verified milestones have solidified its reputation as the best 1000x crypto presale to buy right now. The presale window is still open, but each stage’s price increase tightens the entry point. For those seeking a rare mix of math, momentum, and market timing, MoonBull looks like the breakout presale that could define the next crypto wave.

This massive wave of ETH liquidations highlights the intense volatility currently gripping the Ethereum ecosystem and raises important questions about market sentiment. What’s Driving the Massive ETH Liquidations? The recent ETH liquidations tell a compelling story about trader sentiment. Short positions accounted for a staggering 68.4% of all ETH liquidations, indicating that most traders were betting against Ethereum’s price movement. This pattern suggests that many market participants expected downward pressure, but the market moved against their predictions. When we examine the ETH liquidations data more closely, several key patterns emerge: Short dominance : 68.4% of ETH liquidations came from short positions Total volume : $82.42 million in ETH positions were liquidated Market impact : These ETH liquidations significantly affected overall market sentiment How Do ETH Liquidations Compare to Other Cryptocurrencies? While ETH liquidations dominated the market, Bitcoin followed closely with $67.19 million in liquidations. Interestingly, BTC also saw short positions making up 65% of its total liquidations. This parallel trend suggests a broader market pattern where short traders across major cryptocurrencies faced significant challenges. The third-highest cryptocurrency for liquidations was GIGGLE, which experienced $13.79 million in position closures. Similar to the ETH liquidations pattern, 68.19% of GIGGLE’s liquidations were short positions. This consistency across different assets indicates a market-wide phenomenon affecting traders’ strategies. What Do These ETH Liquidations Mean for Traders? The scale of ETH liquidations provides valuable insights for both new and experienced traders. When short positions dominate liquidation events, it often signals that the market moved contrary to popular expectations. This can create opportunities for contrarian traders who recognize these patterns early. Key takeaways from the recent ETH liquidations include: Risk management becomes crucial during high volatility periods Position sizing should account for potential liquidation events Market sentiment can shift rapidly against majority positions Understanding the Impact of Major ETH Liquidations Large-scale ETH liquidations like the $82 million event we just witnessed can create cascading effects throughout the market. As positions get liquidated, they often trigger additional selling pressure or buying opportunities, depending on the direction of the moves. This creates a feedback loop that can amplify price movements in either direction. The concentration of ETH liquidations in short positions suggests that many traders were caught off guard by price movements. This serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets remain highly unpredictable, and even well-researched positions can face liquidation risks during volatile periods. FAQs About ETH Liquidations What causes ETH liquidations? ETH liquidations occur when traders’ positions lose enough value that they can no longer meet margin requirements, forcing exchanges to close their positions automatically. Why were most ETH liquidations short positions? The high percentage of short positions in ETH liquidations indicates that most traders expected price decreases, but the market moved upward instead. How do ETH liquidations affect the overall market? Large ETH liquidations can create increased volatility as forced selling or buying occurs, potentially triggering additional liquidations in a cascade effect. Can traders prevent ETH liquidations? Traders can manage liquidation risk through proper position sizing, using stop-loss orders, and maintaining adequate margin levels. How often do major ETH liquidations occur? Significant ETH liquidations typically happen during periods of high volatility, which can occur during major news events or market shifts. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when prices fall sharply, while short liquidations occur when prices rise rapidly against bearish positions.

Recent data reveals a troubling pattern of net outflows, with BlackRock’s IBIT accelerating withdrawals to $374.44 million. This marks the sixth consecutive day of negative movement, raising questions about institutional sentiment toward cryptocurrency investments. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experiencing Sustained Outflows? The current trend in spot Bitcoin ETFs shows clear division among major players. While BlackRock’s substantial withdrawals drive the overall negative flow, other funds demonstrate continued investor interest. The total net outflows reached $135.94 million on November 5, according to Trader T data, creating concern about short-term market stability. Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Defied the Negative Trend? Despite the overall outflow pattern, five spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded positive movement. The leaders included: Fidelity’s FBTC with $113.30 million inflows Ark Invest’s ARKB with $82.94 million Bitwise’s BITB with $16.97 million Grayscale’s Mini BTC with $21.61 million VanEck’s HODL with $3.68 million This mixed performance suggests that while some investors are pulling back, others see current conditions as buying opportunities. What Does BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Activity Reveal? BlackRock’s IBIT has shown concerning withdrawal patterns over recent months. The current $374.44 million outflow follows earlier withdrawals of $90.48 million on June 29 and $187.84 million on July 3. This consistent pattern indicates potential institutional repositioning rather than temporary market fluctuation. How Should Investors Approach Spot Bitcoin ETFs Now? The divergence among spot Bitcoin ETFs presents both challenges and opportunities. Investors should monitor: Flow patterns across different providers Market sentiment indicators beyond ETF flows Long-term potential versus short-term volatility The current situation with spot Bitcoin ETFs reflects the natural ebb and flow of cryptocurrency markets, where periods of consolidation often follow significant movements. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The future of spot Bitcoin ETFs depends on multiple factors including regulatory developments, market conditions, and institutional adoption patterns. While current outflows raise short-term concerns, the fundamental case for Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles remains strong for many portfolio strategies. The ongoing story of spot Bitcoin ETFs demonstrates the evolving nature of cryptocurrency adoption. As institutional players navigate this space, investors should maintain perspective about both risks and opportunities in this dynamic market segment. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without holding the cryptocurrency directly. Why are spot Bitcoin ETFs experiencing outflows? Outflows can occur due to various factors including profit-taking, market uncertainty, portfolio rebalancing, or changing risk appetite among institutional investors. Should I be concerned about spot Bitcoin ETF outflows? While sustained outflows warrant attention, they represent normal market dynamics. Many investors view price corrections as potential entry points for long-term positions. Which spot Bitcoin ETFs are performing well currently? Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB have shown strong inflow numbers despite the overall negative trend in the spot Bitcoin ETF category. How do spot Bitcoin ETF flows affect Bitcoin prices? Significant flows can impact short-term price movements, but Bitcoin’s long-term value depends on broader adoption, technological developments, and macroeconomic factors. Are spot Bitcoin ETFs a good long-term investment? Like any investment, spot Bitcoin ETFs carry risks and require careful consideration of your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/blackrock-could-change-everything-for-xrp-during-ripple-swell-heres-how/,"In the cryptocurrency community, Ripple’s annual Swell conference is one of the most closely watched events of the year. However, many investors have learned over time that the conference itself rarely influences XRP’s market performance. This sentiment was recently restated by Digital Asset Investor, a well-known commentator who suggested that while Swell may not move the price , an announcement involving a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF would have a significantly different effect. His post reignited discussion about what truly drives XRP’s market movements and whether Swell can ever act as a meaningful price catalyst. Usually XRP price is not affected by Ripple Swell. If there was a BlackRock XRP ETF announcement I'm betting that would change fast. — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) November 3, 2025 The Viewpoint of Digital Asset Investor Digital Asset Investor’s position is clear: Swell is not the type of event that typically triggers immediate reactions in XRP’s valuation. The conference tends to focus on industry collaboration, blockchain integration, and cross-border payment innovation—topics that reinforce long-term fundamentals but do not produce short-term surges. By contrast, he suggested that a formal XRP ETF, especially one supported by a global investment institution like BlackRock , would rapidly change the market landscape. Such an event would represent regulatory recognition and institutional endorsement—two factors that could attract major capital inflows and shift sentiment in favor of XRP. Reactions from the Community The post drew varied reactions from users on X. One user commented that although an improvement might come, the current market trend reflects weakness and consolidation, suggesting that broader declines could overshadow positive developments. They added that retail traders might respond emotionally in the short term, dampening the impact of any good news about an ETF. Another user, XRP_Xtreme, was more direct, noting that Swell is a professional conference and unlikely to feature any ETF announcements, particularly from a firm like BlackRock. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Meanwhile, another user, Life100MPH, expressed curiosity about where BlackRock’s involvement would appear, adding that an ETF announcement at Swell would be an exceptional outcome if it were ever to occur. The broader takeaway is that traders continue to differentiate between symbolic events and substantive financial developments. While Swell remains significant for its institutional partnerships and global presence, it rarely produces market-shifting headlines. The possibility of a BlackRock XRP ETF, on the other hand, would carry far greater implications for liquidity, investor access, and long-term valuation. As Ripple’s Swell 2025 continues in New York, market participants will likely watch for signs of progress on institutional integration. However, expectations for dramatic price reactions remain limited unless an ETF or regulatory milestone is formally announced.

The latest data reveals $112.95 million exited these funds on November 5th alone, raising questions about institutional confidence in Ethereum’s short-term prospects. Why Are US Spot ETH ETF Outflows Accelerating? The consistent outflow pattern from US spot ETH ETF products signals a shift in investor sentiment. Market analysts point to several factors driving this trend, including macroeconomic pressures and shifting risk appetites. However, the concentrated nature of these withdrawals from specific funds suggests more complex dynamics at play. BlackRock’s ETHA fund emerged as the primary contributor to the outflows, shedding a staggering $140.98 million in a single day. This massive movement from one of the world’s largest asset managers carries significant weight in cryptocurrency markets. Which US Spot ETH ETF Funds Defied the Trend? Despite the overall negative flow pattern, some funds managed to attract capital during this turbulent period. The data reveals interesting divergences among different providers: Grayscale’s Mini ETH recorded net inflows of $24.06 million Fidelity’s FETH attracted $3.45 million in new investments These inflows partially offset the massive BlackRock outflows This mixed performance indicates that not all US spot ETH ETF products are experiencing the same level of investor skepticism. The variation suggests investors are becoming more selective about which cryptocurrency funds they trust with their capital. What Do Extended US Spot ETH ETF Outflows Signal? Six consecutive days of outflows from US spot ETH ETF products represent more than just temporary market volatility. This pattern typically indicates deeper concerns about asset performance or broader market conditions. Historical data shows that sustained outflows often precede price corrections or extended consolidation periods. The concentration of outflows in BlackRock’s fund raises particular questions about institutional positioning. As one of the most influential financial institutions globally, BlackRock’s movements often signal broader institutional sentiment shifts toward cryptocurrency assets. How Should Investors Respond to US Spot ETH ETF Movements? Understanding the implications of these US spot ETH ETF outflows requires careful analysis of multiple factors. Investors should consider: Monitor flow patterns for signs of stabilization or reversal Assess broader market conditions affecting all cryptocurrency assets Evaluate fund-specific factors that might explain differential performance Consider long-term fundamentals rather than reacting to short-term flows The current US spot ETH ETF outflow situation highlights the importance of diversified exposure and careful risk management in cryptocurrency investing. What’s Next for US Spot ETH ETF Products? The future trajectory of US spot ETH ETF flows will depend on several key factors. Market sentiment, regulatory developments, and Ethereum network upgrades all play crucial roles in determining whether these outflows represent a temporary correction or the beginning of a longer-term trend. Investors should watch for signs of institutional re-entry and monitor whether the current US spot ETH ETF outflow pattern begins to reverse. Historical data suggests that sustained outflows eventually reach an inflection point, often creating potential entry opportunities for contrarian investors. Conclusion: Navigating the US Spot ETH ETF Landscape The sixth consecutive day of US spot ETH ETF outflows, primarily driven by BlackRock’s substantial withdrawals, presents both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. While the short-term picture appears concerning, the mixed performance across different funds suggests nuanced market dynamics. Investors who maintain perspective and focus on long-term fundamentals may find strategic opportunities amid the current volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the US spot ETH ETF outflows? The outflows resulted from multiple factors including shifting investor sentiment, macroeconomic concerns, and specific institutional repositioning, with BlackRock’s fund leading the withdrawal trend. How long have US spot ETH ETF outflows been occurring? This marks the sixth consecutive day of net outflows from US spot ETH ETF products, indicating a sustained pattern rather than a one-day anomaly. Are all US spot ETH ETF funds experiencing outflows? No, while BlackRock’s ETHA saw significant outflows, Grayscale’s Mini ETH and Fidelity’s FETH actually recorded net inflows during the same period. What does this mean for Ethereum prices? Sustained ETF outflows typically create selling pressure, but Ethereum’s price depends on multiple factors beyond just ETF flows, including network activity and broader market conditions. Should investors be concerned about these outflows? While worth monitoring, experienced investors view such movements as normal market cycles and often use them to identify potential entry points for long-term positions. How can I track US spot ETH ETF flow data? Multiple financial data providers and cryptocurrency analytics platforms offer real-time ETF flow tracking, including the sources referenced in this analysis. Found this analysis helpful?

This case highlights the critical importance of evidence in cryptocurrency disputes, especially when dealing with seized assets. If you’re invested in digital currencies, understanding the legal pitfalls can save you from similar heartbreak. What Led to the Lost Bitcoin Lawsuit? A U.S. court has dismissed a Florida man’s lawsuit seeking $354 million in damages over allegedly lost Bitcoin. The plaintiff, Michael Prime, was arrested in 2019 on counterfeiting and identity theft charges. During the investigation, authorities confiscated his hard drive. Prime repeatedly stated that the drive contained no cryptocurrency, leading investigators to destroy it. After serving his prison sentence, he filed the lost Bitcoin lawsuit, claiming the drive held valuable Bitcoin. However, the court found no basis to support his new testimony, emphasizing the lack of evidence. Why Did the Court Dismiss the Case? The dismissal centered on inconsistencies in Prime’s statements. Initially, he denied any Bitcoin on the hard drive, which influenced the authorities’ decision to destroy it. The court ruled that his later recantation lacked credibility. Key factors in the ruling included: No physical or digital proof of Bitcoin on the drive Prime’s prior consistent denials under investigation Absence of witnesses or documentation to back his claim This lost Bitcoin lawsuit underscores how courts rely on tangible evidence in cryptocurrency cases. Without it, even substantial claims can fail. What Are the Implications for Cryptocurrency Holders? This case serves as a stark reminder for cryptocurrency investors to maintain clear records. If your assets are seized, ambiguous statements can jeopardize your recovery efforts. Always document your holdings and seek legal advice early. The lost Bitcoin lawsuit illustrates that courts may not sympathize with changed stories, especially after assets are destroyed. Therefore, proactive measures are essential to protect your investments. How Can You Avoid Similar Issues? To prevent disputes like this lost Bitcoin lawsuit, follow these actionable steps: Keep secure backups of private keys and wallet information Maintain detailed records of transactions and balances Consult with legal experts if involved in investigations Avoid making false or misleading statements to authorities By taking these precautions, you can strengthen your position in any legal scenario involving digital assets. Conclusion: Key Takeaways from the Dismissed Lawsuit In summary, the dismissed lost Bitcoin lawsuit teaches us that evidence is paramount in cryptocurrency legal battles. Without solid proof, claims of lost assets may not hold up in court. This case reinforces the need for honesty and thorough documentation from the start. As the crypto landscape evolves, learning from such examples can guide better practices for investors and legal professionals alike. Frequently Asked Questions What was the Florida man’s lost Bitcoin lawsuit about? It involved a claim for $354 million in damages after authorities destroyed a hard drive that the plaintiff later alleged contained Bitcoin. Why did the court dismiss the lawsuit? The court found no evidence to support the claim, especially since the plaintiff had previously denied any Bitcoin on the drive. What charges was Michael Prime originally facing? He was arrested on counterfeiting and identity theft charges in 2019. How can cryptocurrency holders protect themselves legally? By keeping accurate records, securing backups, and seeking legal counsel during investigations. Has there been a similar lost Bitcoin lawsuit before? Yes, other cases have arisen where claimants struggled to prove ownership without proper evidence. What happens if I falsely claim lost cryptocurrency? You risk legal penalties, including perjury charges, and dismissal of your case due to lack of credibility.

The Japanese firm announced that the funds will be used to expand its revenue-generating business, repurchase shares, and acquire additional Bitcoin. The Japanese firm currently owns Bitcoin with an enterprise value of US$3.16 billion, a NAV of US$3.17 billion, and an outstanding debt of $24.35 million. MetaPlanet has 30,823 BTC, equivalent to approximately US$3.51 billion (¥540 billion). According to the corporation, the new loan accounts for only 3% of its total Bitcoin holdings. The 3% guarantee ensures that even during a severe market slump, it maintains a secure collateral margin. MetaPlanet’s objective is to increase its exposure to Bitcoin while avoiding undue leverage. MetaPlanet grows Bitcoin income revenue and Treasury Strategy The Japanese firm stated that a portion of the funds will be used for the income business to create and market cash-secured Bitcoin options, generating steady revenue while retaining Bitcoin. The revenues obtained will help the corporation to cover a portion of the risk in the case of a market fall. MetaPlanet’s Bitcoin revenue generation has grown over the previous year. The company’s income business showed a notable increase, with reports of ¥691.58 M in Q4 2024, ¥770.31 M in Q1 2025, ¥1.13 B in Q2 2025, and ¥2.44 B in Q3 2025. In the third quarter of 2025, sales for MetaPlanet are predicted to reach US$18.6 million (2.44 billion yen), a 3.5-fold increase over the same period the previous year US$5.27 million (690 million yen). The Japanese firm stated that the potential to repurchase its own shares, based on market conditions, is linked to its management policy for the share buyback cap. The repurchase guarantee flexibility in shareholder returns, and (75 billion yen) was set at the end of October. MetaPlanet has been following a “Bitcoin Treasury Strategy” since April of this year. The Treasury Strategy is to achieve its long-term objective of obtaining 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. MetaPlanet announces $500 million Bitcoin-backed share buyback On October 28, Metaplanet announced a 75 billion Japanese yen (about $500 million) share repurchase program backed by a Bitcoin-collateralized credit facility. The announcement of the credit facility followed a drop below 1 of its market-based net asset value (mNAV). According to the Tokyo-listed Bitcoin Treasury company, the buyback program’s objectives are to increase its market-based net asset value and rebuild investor confidence. The buyback allows for the repurchase of up to 150 million shares, representing approximately 13% of the total outstanding stock. Repurchases will continue until October 2026, pursuant to a discretionary trading agreement with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Metaplanet confirmed that it had established a Bitcoin-backed credit line with a borrowing capacity of US$500 million to carry out the plan. The establishment of a Bitcoin-backed credit line will enable flexible financing for either share repurchases or additional Bitcoin acquisitions. Additionally, the facility can provide bridging funding for a proposed offering of preferred shares. The treasury company also stated that the loan has no expiration date, meaning the company can repay it at any time. Bitcoin acquisition surged sharply over the course of the year, totalling $53,000 in April, $73,000 in September, $93,000 in January, and $125,000 in June and October. On October 27, ETHZilla announced a $40 million share buyback with its stock trading at a steep discount to NAV. As part of its $250 million buyback program, the business claimed to have already repurchased about 600,000 shares worth $12 million since October 24.

Crypto Exec Says That’s Exactly Why It Will Rise,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/everyones-giving-up-on-bitcoin-crypto-exec-says-thats-exactly-why-it-will-rise/,"The crypto market looks beaten down again, but one veteran investor says that may be the exact signal to stay calm. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Holds — But Signs Of Weakness Are Piling Up: Analyst Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes Bitcoin’s deep sell-off — now dragging prices below $102,000 for the first time since the last five months — is more about panic than fundamentals. Retail Sentiment At ‘Max Desperation’ Hougan told CNBC this week that small traders are hitting a breaking point. “It’s almost a tale of two markets,” he said, describing what he sees as “max desperation” among retail investors after months of heavy losses and leverage blowouts. He called the mood the most depressed he’s ever witnessed in crypto. For him, that level of hopelessness might be the final stage before the market finds its footing again. Institutional Flows Continue To Matter While smaller traders are backing off, larger investors appear to be sticking around. According to reports, financial advisors and institutional funds are still adding to positions through Bitcoin ETFs such as iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The weekly inflows have slowed since the middle of the year, but they remain positive — a sign, Hougan says, that big money hasn’t lost faith. Hougan argues that this split between retail panic and institutional confidence could shape how the market recovers. “When I talk to advisors and institutions,” he said, “they’re still excited to allocate to an asset class that, if you zoom out, is delivering strong returns over the past year.” Solana Staking Interest And ETF Activity The growing influence of crypto funds goes beyond Bitcoin. Hougan said Bitwise’s new Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) pulled in more than $400 million in its first week before dropping nearly 20% since launching on Oct. 28. Even so, he sees strong appetite for professionally managed crypto exposure among investors who prefer structured products over direct trading. Related Reading: ‘Good News’ Finally Arrives For SHIB Army As Team Unveils New Update Not everyone agrees on how fast a rebound might come. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor recently predicted Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by year end — a call Hougan considers bold but not impossible. He said a move toward $125,000 or even $130,000 is achievable if selling pressure keeps fading and demand from institutions grows. For now, the market still feels fragile. Hougan admits there could be more downside before prices turn around, but he thinks the end of the sell-off is close. Retail sentiment may be collapsing, yet institutional optimism is holding firm — and that, he says, could be the fuel for Bitcoin’s next rally.

As one of the most popular trading platforms in the United States, their decision-making process around digital asset management carries significant weight for both investors and the broader crypto ecosystem. What Exactly Is a Crypto Reserve Strategy? A crypto reserve strategy involves holding digital assets as part of a company’s treasury reserves. This approach moves beyond simply facilitating crypto trading to actually maintaining cryptocurrency holdings. Many companies in the space have adopted this strategy to align more closely with the crypto community and potentially benefit from asset appreciation. Shiv Verma, Robinhood’s Vice President of Finance and Strategy, recently disclosed that the company has spent considerable time evaluating this approach. During their third-quarter conference call, Verma acknowledged that adopting a digital asset reserve strategy would bring Robinhood closer to the crypto community they serve. Why Is Robinhood Proceeding With Caution? The company’s hesitation stems from several key considerations that must be carefully weighed. While embracing a crypto reserve strategy offers potential benefits, Robinhood must ensure any move genuinely serves their shareholders’ best interests. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets Volatility concerns in cryptocurrency markets Shareholder value preservation Long-term strategic alignment Verma emphasized that despite the potential community benefits, the company must thoroughly evaluate whether this crypto reserve strategy would deliver real value to their investors. This careful approach reflects Robinhood’s commitment to responsible financial management. What Does This Mean for Crypto Adoption? Robinhood’s cautious stance highlights the ongoing maturation process within the cryptocurrency industry. As major financial players consider deeper integration with digital assets, their decision-making processes become more sophisticated and deliberate. The company’s internal discussions about their crypto reserve strategy demonstrate how traditional financial institutions are approaching digital asset integration. This thoughtful evaluation process, rather than rushed adoption, may ultimately lead to more sustainable crypto integration in mainstream finance. Moreover, Robinhood’s position as a significant player in both stock and crypto trading gives their deliberations added importance. Their eventual decision regarding a crypto reserve strategy could influence how other trading platforms approach digital asset management. The Balancing Act: Community Alignment vs Shareholder Value Robinhood faces a complex challenge in balancing community expectations with fiduciary responsibilities. Adopting a crypto reserve strategy would undoubtedly strengthen their connection with cryptocurrency enthusiasts who value platforms that “practice what they preach.” However, Verma’s comments highlight that community alignment alone cannot justify the strategy. The company must ensure that any move into crypto reserves provides tangible benefits to shareholders while managing the inherent risks of digital asset volatility. This careful evaluation process demonstrates Robinhood’s commitment to responsible growth. Rather than chasing trends, they’re taking the time to develop a well-considered approach to their crypto reserve strategy that serves all stakeholders effectively. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Robinhood’s Crypto Plans? While Robinhood continues its internal evaluation, the crypto community watches closely. The company’s eventual decision regarding their crypto reserve strategy will signal their confidence in digital assets as a long-term store of value. The ongoing discussions within Robinhood about implementing a crypto reserve strategy reflect the broader industry’s evolution. As cryptocurrency becomes more integrated into traditional finance, companies must navigate complex decisions about how deeply to embrace digital assets.

Markets are clawing back losses after solid US data even as a firm dollar caps upside. Bitcoin bounced on Thursday, pushing back above $103,000 as risk appetite returned with stronger US economic data and a global equity rebound. Asia stocks opened firmer, recovering part of Wednesday’s selloff after better-than-expected US economic reports helped steady sentiment across markets still trading near record highs. Yields on US Treasuries held overnight gains and the dollar stayed near a five-month peak, reinforcing a cautious undertone even as risk assets recovered. Traders pared expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut next month, keeping attention on how long policy may stay restrictive. Crypto prices are back on the upswing following a day of FUD from the crowd yesterday. Bitcoin is back to $103.8K, Ethereum has just jumped to $3,440, and several altcoins are surging, notably $HYPE (+10%), $AVAX (+5%), $UNI (+6%), & $WLFI (+7%). pic.twitter.com/mldkO2HL6e — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 5, 2025 Market snapshot Bitcoin : $103,439, up 1.3% Ether : $3,420, up 2.2% XRP : $2.34, down 3.8% Total crypto market cap: $3.53 trillion, up 2% Strong US Data Lifts Markets As Services And Payrolls Beat Expectations Fresh data set the tone. US services activity reached an eight-month high in October as new orders improved, and private payrolls rose by 42,000, beating forecasts. The combination lifted Wall Street and eased worries about stretched tech valuations, while upbeat earnings restored confidence among dip buyers. Derivatives desks reported cleaner positioning after Wednesday’s shakeout, helping crypto track equities higher. With spot back above $103,000, traders pointed to $100,000 as the immediate line to defend and $105,000 to $107,000 as near resistance if risk holds. Markets Stabilize As Rate Expectations Cool And Growth Outlook Firms In regional equity action, Japan’s Nikkei rose about 1.5% after a steep drop the day before, and South Korea’s Kospi jumped more than 2% at the open. The overnight US rally broadened across sectors, with tech and momentum names leading gains. Rate expectations adjusted alongside the data. Pricing for a December Fed cut slipped toward 60% from roughly 70% earlier in the week, a shift that kept yields firm. For crypto, a slower easing path can cap upside through a stronger dollar, but improved growth indicators support selective risk-taking. Flows remained cautious across tokens. Desks described a “buy the dip, sell the rip” bias, characterized by rapid profit-taking in high-beta names and steadier interest in large caps. The pattern fits a market still nursing drawdowns from earlier in the week. Political Gridlock Weighs On Confidence While Traders Watch Key Bitcoin Levels Analysts said the macro backdrop continues to drive crypto day to day. Stronger activity data buoyed equities and helped Bitcoin recover, but the higher-for-longer rate narrative and firm dollar limit follow-through until inflation and policy signals turn clearer. Strategists said political and economic uncertainty remains a drag, and the the government shutdown has made it harder to interpret growth trends as key data releases remain frozen. In that context, private reports carry more weight. “The prolonged US.government shutdown has become a real stress point, not only for investors but for the wider economy, especially as key data releases remain frozen,” said Lukman Otunuga , senior market analyst at FXTM. Risk levels are clear for traders. A decisive hold above $100,000 stabilizes sentiment and keeps the door open to a grind higher if equities extend gains. A break back below would likely trigger another wave of deleveraging into a strong dollar, reviving the bid for cash.

While there is still some optimism among sponsors like Senator Cynthia Lummis, the legislative timeline is increasingly uncertain due to the political gridlock. At the same time, the UK is moving to align its stablecoin regulations with the US, with Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden confirming plans to release a consultation paper on Nov. 10. Crypto Bill Back in Focus? Discussions over the long-awaited US digital asset market structure bill are continuing despite the ongoing government shutdown—which is the longest in the country’s history. The legislation is widely seen as one of the most consequential efforts to define the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, but it is still in limbo as lawmakers juggle competing priorities and political tensions. According to a report from Politico , Senator John Boozman, a Republican member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, is expected to hold talks with White House crypto and AI advisor David Sacks and Democratic Senator Cory Booker to help finalize a discussion draft of the bill. The Agriculture Committee, along with the Senate Banking Committee, plays a key role in shaping the legislation before it can move to a full Senate vote. Report from Politico The bill originally passed by the House of Representatives in July, and was expected to pass the Senate with bipartisan support. However, progress slowed due to disagreements over how decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols should be regulated, coupled with the disruption caused by the government shutdown. Many lawmakers shifted their focus to reopening the government and restoring operations at key financial regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), both of which have been forced to scale back activity due to staff issues. Despite the delay, several senators are still optimistic. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, who is one of the bill’s co-sponsors, told Bloomberg that bipartisan negotiations are ongoing and productive. “We’re working at the staff level every single day to get the votes necessary in committee,” she said, and described the talks as “granular” but “tremendously” progressive. Sen. Cynthia Lummis Still, the timeline seems more and more uncertain. Senator Thom Tillis recently warned that lawmakers have only until early 2026 to pass meaningful crypto legislation before the 2026 midterm election cycle complicates the process. Patrick Witt , the executive director of President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, acknowledged that the shutdown created both challenges and opportunities. While lawmakers have more time to discuss the bill, the absence of agency staff deprived them of critical technical input. With political divisions hardening and the shutdown dragging on, the path forward for the digital asset market structure bill is unclear. UK to Match US on Stablecoin Policy Meanwhile, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said the UK intends to move in lockstep with the United States on stablecoin regulation, due to the importance of alignment between the two nations as they shape rules for the $310 billion sector. At the SALT conference in London on Wednesday, Breeden said the UK will implement its stablecoin regulatory framework “just as quickly as the US,” and countered fears that Britain is falling behind after the US passed its landmark GENIUS Act in July. She added that the Bank of England is in active discussions with the Federal Reserve and other US financial authorities as it prepares to release its own stablecoin consultation paper on Nov. 10. “I’ve been talking to the Federal Reserve,” Breeden said. “The regulators over there and our finance ministries are working together.” Her remarks once again shed some light on the growing transatlantic cooperation on digital asset oversight, which was previously mentioned during a September meeting between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The two officials agreed to deepen collaboration on crypto and stablecoin regulation. Breeden’s comments were made amid mounting pressure from UK crypto advocacy groups that have criticized the government’s cautious stance, and argued that it has hindered innovation and left the country trailing behind global peers. The Bank of England also faced backlash for proposing caps on individual stablecoin holdings between £10,000 and £20,000, which lobby groups claimed would be costly and difficult to enforce. The UK’s renewed focus on stablecoins is also similar to developments in Canada, where the government this week announced plans to regulate fiat-backed issuers, mandating adequate reserves and robust risk management frameworks as part of its modernization of the nation’s payments system. Meanwhile, institutional adoption of stablecoins continues to gain momentum, with major financial players including Western Union, SWIFT, MoneyGram, and Zelle either integrating or exploring stablecoin-based payment systems.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-06 05:30:00

Amid speculations about the end of the bull cycle, trader and market expert Arthur Hayes has identified an event that could reignite the bull run. According to Hayes, everything is tied to the U.S. government ending its shutdown and releasing liquidity into financial markets. How the U.S. Government Funds Its Debt Hayes explained in his article titled “Hallelujah” that if the U.S. government ensures there is ample cash in the financial system, BTC will hit another all-time high (ATH) before this bull cycle ends. The primary reason the government will continually increase its supply of dollars is to maintain its ability to finance borrowing. This is because governments are often inclined to prefer issuing debt over raising taxes to fund their agenda. As the new administration continues to borrow to finance its agenda, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet will keep expanding. This positive trend in dollar liquidity will ultimately drive bitcoin and crypto prices to new highs. The American entrepreneur detailed how different market participants could drive liquidity by purchasing Treasury bills relentlessly. These participants include money market funds, foreign central banks, the Too Big to Fail (TBTF) Banks, commercial banks, and Relative Value Hedge Funds. Invariably, government-issued debt will grow the money supply. Under normal circumstances, the increasing money supply would have trickled down to the crypto market and kept BTC and other assets afloat. However, the ongoing government shutdown has caused a hitch in that process. Extra Liquidity to be Released With the shutdown extending into its second month, the Treasury is borrowing money through its debt auctions but not spending. Hayes revealed that the Treasury General Account is above its $850 billion target by approximately $150 billion. This means that the department is currently maintaining a negative dollar liquidity balance, which will become positive when the shutdown ends and the extra liquidity is released into the markets. Hayes said to expect a choppy market for as long as the government shutdown lasts, as the liquidity drain is one of the primary reasons for the broader decline. The market expert predicted that many traders will dump their bags during this period of market weakness, but insists that it will be a mistake, as the “dollar money market plumbing” is rarely wrong.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binance-announces-support-for-this-altcoins-network-upgrade-and-hard-fork-here-are-the-details-6/,"Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced that it will support the planned network upgrade and hard fork process on the Zilliqa (ZIL) network. Binance to Support Zilliqa (ZIL) Network Upgrade and Hard Fork According to the exchange's announcement, the network upgrade will occur at block height 13,514,400 and this process is expected to begin approximately at around 10:18 AM on 17-11-2025. To protect the user experience during the upgrade and hard fork, Binance will temporarily suspend all token deposits and withdrawals on the Zilliqa (ZIL) network starting November 17, 2025, at 09:18. However, the exchange stated that this will not affect the trading of ZIL tokens. The statement stated that Binance will manage all technical requirements on behalf of users, and once the upgrade is complete and the network is confirmed to be stable and secure, deposits and withdrawals will be reopened. The company also stated that no additional announcements will be made after this process is complete. Zilliqa, a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain, stands out for its scalability and transaction efficiency. This update is expected to enhance network security and optimize transaction speed. Binance's technical support initiative is considered a significant step that will contribute to the development of the Zilliqa ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

The exchanges include Binance Alpha & Futures, Upbit, Bithumb, Bitvavo, BitPanda, KuCoin, Kraken, and Gate. The firm also revealed that developers building on the platform can plug directly into its Arbitrum Orbit Layer-3 (L3) appchain, which settles to Base. Institution, the native chain for Information Finance, listed its native token, TRUST, on a range of leading global cryptocurrency exchanges on Wednesday. The exchanges include Binance Alpha & Futures, Upbit, Bithumb, Bitvavo, BitPanda, KuCoin, Kraken, and Gate. Institution said the multi-exchange debut aims to expand global access to its protocol’s ecosystem. The firm also said the initiative marks the next phase for its public trust layer for the internet and artificial intelligence (AI). Institution’s initiative aims to support developers, users, and AI systems https://twitter.com/0xIntuition/status/1985844422261576046 Billy Luedtke, founder and CEO of Institution, said the listings are about participation. He believes that making TRUST globally available helps the company support and empower developers, users, and AI systems to curate and transact on the world’s knowledge with provenance, incentives, and open access. The firm’s top official added that Institution transforms knowledge itself into an asset class, and that TRUST helps power it. The listings follow the recent launch of the project’s mainnet and the closing of $8.5 million in funding. The initiative included sold-out community sales on CoinList and Legion, and backing from top-tier investors, such as Superscrypt, Schima, F-Prime (Fidelity), ConsenSys, and Polygon. Intitution acknowledged that TRUST serves as the lifeblood of its token-curated knowledge graph, which enables anyone to create, verify, and monetize structured information on-chain. The firm added that the token supports multiple roles in the ecosystem, including gas and transaction fees, data creation and curation, governance via bonded TRUST, and query fees for accessing structured knowledge on the network. “Discover on the internet is collapsing into a few opaque feeds and AI outputs. Institution flips that script on its head by making trust signals and data provenance public, portable, and composable. With these listings, anyone can help shape the open graph that powers a more powerful and transparent internet.” -Billy Luedtke, Founder and CEO of Institution. Luedtke said that through such mechanisms, TRUST underpins what Institution calls Information Finance. The firm argued that Information Finance is an entirely new economic model where verified knowledge, reputation, and context are treated as composable digital assets. Institution confirmed that developers building on the platform can plug directly into its Arbitrum Orbit Layer-3 (L3) appchain, which settles to Base. It is also optimized for high-throughput information operations and token-curated signaling. Institution introduces Atoms and Triples According to Institution, builders can tap into a shared, permissionless graph where data, identity, and trust interoperate across applications and AI agents instead of recreating databases or reputation systems from scratch. Institution also introduced Atoms (canonical identifiers) and Triples (Subject-predicate-object statements) as primitives that allow communities to structure knowledge with clear provenance and incentive alignment. Luedtke said the firm’s goal is to distribute TRUST as broadly as possible and to maintain strong market integrity and developer incentives. He believes that people who build and curate the best data structures will be the ones who benefit the most. Institution’s recent growth shows there’s a strong demand for its solutions. The company revealed that its beta on Base attracted over 244,000 participants, generated more than 5.3 million transactions, and verified over 5.1 million attestations. The firm’s testnet also recently attracted over 990,000 user accounts and over 18 million user transactions.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|ZRX|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-06 05:47:16

While these popular assets have seen mixed results, investor attention is shifting toward projects with clear real-world utility — one of the reasons why Remittix(RTX ), currently priced at $0.1166 per token, is quietly earning comparisons to early-stage Ethereum projects. Its growing adoption in cross-border payments has made it a strong name among analysts tracking upcoming crypto projects. Cardano, Solana, and Shiba Inu: Mixed Performance Across the Board Cardano is currently trading at $0.5462 following a slight gain of about 4% in the last 24 hours with a market capitalization of $19.29 billion on a $1.64 billion trading volume, up 16.44%. Cardano continues to put network efficiency and sustainability first, but its growth has slowed in comparison with newer DeFi projects that are getting faster traction. Meanwhile, Solana is trading at $162.09, up 4.82% with a market capitalization of $87.41 billion and volume at $9.96 billion, up 6.26%. While its speed and scalability have kept it relevant, congestion on the network lately has made traders wary of its potential as a crypto option with low network fees. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is selling at $0.00000901, a significant rise of around 3.95% over the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $5.29 billion and a trading volume of $292.94 million, up 12.14%. The community is very active around the token, though its growth remains largely speculative and only based on market sentiment and news around Shiba Inu. Why Remittix Is Gaining More Attention According to analysts who are comparing blockchain ecosystems, Remittix is very unique because of its real-world application and strong community support. Besides that, the project has secured more than $28 million in private funding, a signal of high demand on its crypto-to-fiat payment network. The Advancements Pushing Remittix Into the Spotlight: CertiK ranked it as the top pre-launch token, guaranteeing investor trust. Allows for direct cryptocurrency-to-bank transfers in more than 30 nations. User Access: iOS Remittix Wallet Beta now open for testing. Strong Backing: Over 684 million RTX tokens sold and a fast-growing holder base. Beyond its progress, Remittix recently announced future listings on BitMart and LBANK, expanding its visibility on major centralized exchanges. The team’s focus on real usability — rather than speculative trading — has earned it recognition as a crypto solving real-world problems, comparable to Ripple’s early innovation phase. Remittix’s Rapid Rise Could Define Ethereum’s Next Generation Unlike meme-based tokens like Shiba Inu Coin, Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi project designed to connect crypto users directly with traditional finance. Community engagement has increased with recent verification by CertiK and the $250,000 giveaway campaign. The ongoing 50% bonus return event before achieving the $30 million mark has also captured interest. The New Benchmark for Performance As Cardano, Solana, and Shiba Inu continue to face uneven results, Ethereum’s new generation of projects like Remittix is setting the pace. Built for everyday use and verified by top-tier auditors, it may well define the future of decentralized payments — and prove that utility-driven innovation still leads the market.

According to on-chain data, the strategic accumulation suggests a strong bullish momentum in Ethereum’s long-term potential, despite current market fluctuations. Source: Lookonchain Whales keep accumulating $ETH — over the past 3 days, many whales have collectively bought 394,682 $ETH ($1.37B). https://t.co/RhDYQM0yl6 pic.twitter.com/3qMSojTSTu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 6, 2025 Per the detailed analysis, the largest buyer was an address that had previously borrowed 66,000 ETH from Aave. The whale has now repurchased 257,543 ETH at approximately $3,480, for a total of $896 million. Besides, Bitmine, 7 Siblings, OTC traders and various new wallets have increased their ETH positions recently during the market correction. Analysts Bullish on ETH’s Long-Term Prospects Analysts are closely watching the recent massive whale accumulation, as they often precede significant market shifts. Analysts believe Ethereum could soon prepare for a strong rebound to new all-time highs, targeting up to $10,000. Ethereum is currently trading at 3,421 at press time, a 3.72% increase over the past 24 hours. On the technical front, the momentum indicators show a bullish uptrend following recent short liquidations and institutional interest signals. According to Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, ETH is eyeing a promising $4,800 target and would soon hit $5K. “Backed by network scalability improvements and rising institutional adoption, Ethereum price prediction models indicate a potential 25-30% upside by late 2025,” the exchange analysts wrote in a blog . Lacie Zhang, Research Analyst at Bitget Wallet told Cryptonews that crypto markets are entering what can best be described as a “cautious calm.”’ “If macro data trends favorably, Ethereum may approach $4,200,” Zhang noted, adding that several factors could shape near-term direction. Institutional Catalysts Have Bullish Impact on ETH With anticipation built for December’s Fusaka upgrade, ETH has also attracted strong institutional interest. For instance, the on-chain data noted that Bitmine has added 40,719 ETH, worth nearly $140 million. Analyst Ted Pillows noted that Bitmine’s ongoing ETH buys, reportedly ranging between $200 million and $300 million weekly, may tighten supply faster. “A few more whales like BitMine, and the market’s tone could change overnight,” he said. According to Zhang, the consolidation period is “constructive.” “It flushes out leverage and speculative excess, creating the foundation for long-term growth and institutional re-entry.” The post Ethereum Whales Snap Nearly 400K ETH in Three Days, Total Purchases Exceed $1.37B appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|ETH|Ethereum|Whale accumulation,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-06 05:52:23

Market participants were also busy factoring in the latest release of Australian trade figures. Gold prices traded around $3,980 per ounce on Thursday, moving within a tight range near a four-week low as investors continued to scale back bets on US rate cuts. South Korea’s current account surplus rose to $13.47 billion in September 2025, the highest in three months, driven by strong semiconductor and automobile exports along with higher dividend income. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.40% to around 50,900 while the broader Topix Index gained 1.1% to 3,304 on Thursday, with Japanese shares recouping losses from earlier in the week. The Japanese yen strengthened past 154 per dollar on Thursday, recovering from the previous session’s losses, as steady wage growth reinforced expectations that the Bank of Japan will stay on its tightening path. The S&P Global Japan Services PMI came in at 53.1 in October 2025, above the flash estimate of 52.4 but slightly below September’s 53.3, signaling a continued expansion in the services sector. Nominal wages rose 1.9% in September, up from a 1.5% gain in August, supported by stable base pay and a modest rise in overtime income. Still, wage growth lagged behind the 3.4% increase in consumer prices, resulting in a 1.4% drop in real wages and marking the ninth consecutive monthly decline. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.82% to around 3,990 while the Shenzhen Component advanced 1.2% to 13,380 on Thursday, marking a second straight session of gains, and the offshore yuan China will remove tariffs on certain US optical fiber imports starting November 10, according to an announcement by the Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday. Meanwhile, China is planning to raise up to USD $4 billion through a two-tranche dollar bond offering, just a week after its trade war truce with Washington, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters. Mainland shares also rose further after Premier Li Qiang said China’s economy is projected to top CNY 170 trillion within five years. Investors also awaited China’s October trade and inflation data due later this week for signals on economic momentum, even as Sino-US trade tensions intensified during the month. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.59% to 26,245 in early Thursday trading, rebounding from a muted close in the prior session amid broad-based sector gains. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.02% hovering around 83,424 after falling in Tuesday’s session, while moving away from a three-week low, as gains in the tech and auto sectors offset declines in banking, financial services, and pharmaceuticals. On the data front, the final India Services PMI was revised slightly higher. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.29% to around 8,850 in early Thursday trade, snapping a two-session losing streak. The Australian dollar steadied around $0.651 on Thursday, holding its recent gain, as stronger-than-expected trade data supported sentiment. Australia’s trade surplus widened sharply to AUD 3.94 billion in September from a revised AUD 1.11 billion in August, beating forecasts of AUD 3.85 billion. Goods exports rose 7.9% mom to AUD 44.58 billion in September 2025, rebounding from an upwardly revised 8.7% decline in August. Goods imports increased 1.1% month-on-month to a fresh record of AUD 40.64 billion in September 2025. In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended higher as buyers stepped in following Tuesday’s pullback and the Supreme Court’s skeptical questioning of the Trump tariff case trimmed near-term tariff risk.

Cardano Is Retesting The Support Level Of A Parallel Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a pattern forming in the daily price of Cardano. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, a type of consolidation channel from technical analysis (TA). Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Social Sentiment Collapses, But XRP Just Sees Disinterest A Parallel Channel forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. If the channel has a positive slope relative to the graph axes, the pattern is called an Ascending Channel. Similarly, the trendlines pointing down create a Descending Channel. In the context of the current discussion, the simplest case of the Parallel Channel is of interest: a channel with a slope exactly equal to zero. This type of pattern corresponds to a phase of true sideways movement in the asset’s price. Just like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper line of this pattern is also likely to be a source of resistance, while lower one that of support. If the price manages to break past one of these bounds, it may experience a continuation of trend in that direction. This means that a breakout above the channel can be a bullish signal, while a fall under it a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-day price of Cardano has been trading inside for the past year: As displayed in the above graph, Cardano has witnessed a plummet toward the Parallel Channel’s lower level situated at $0.52 with the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency sector. Since ADA started trading inside the channel back in November 2024, its price has rebounded at this line several times. Given this pattern, it’s possible that the asset may find support at the mark once more. It only remains to be seen, however, whether the Parallel Channel will continue to hold or if a breakdown is coming next. Related Reading: Altcoin Winter Here? Ethereum, Solana Activity Plunges Speaking of Parallel Channels, Ethereum, the cryptocurrency ranked second by market cap, is also trading inside this type of pattern, as the analyst has pointed out in another X post. Unlike ADA’s channel, this pattern in the 3-day Ethereum price is a long-term one, beginning way back in 2021. ETH found rejection at the resistance of this Parallel Channel earlier in the year and has since been on the way down. “The worst-case scenario: Ethereum $ETH fails to reclaim $4,000, breaks through $3,800 support, and drops to $2,400 or $1,700,” said the analyst. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.547, down over 16% in the last seven days.

54085228,621742,1762408808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54085228.jpeg,Bitcoin Pain Deepens: 57% Of Invested Capital Now Underwater,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-pain-deepens-57-invested-capital-underwater/,"On-chain data shows that a majority of the USD capital invested in Bitcoin has dipped into losses following the latest market crash. Majority Of Bitcoin’s Realized Cap Is Now Underwater As pointed out by on-chain analyst Checkmate in an X thread , Bitcoin’s recent bearish action has put a huge amount of the capital invested into the cryptocurrency in a state of loss. The invested capital here refers to the amount that BTC investors as a whole used to purchase their tokens. This is different from the market cap , which represents the value the holders are carrying in the present. The invested capital, which is popularly known as the Realized Cap , is determined by adding up the last USD transaction price for all coins in circulation. Not all transfers on the network correspond to a change of hands, but this methodology still provides a decent approximation of the capital stored in the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Checkmate that shows how the Bitcoin Realized Cap is distributed across the various price levels: As displayed in the above graph, the majority of the Realized Cap has a break-even level higher than $100,000. This suggests that most of the capital stored in the cryptocurrency today came in after the bull run in late 2024. More specifically, approximately 57% of the asset’s invested capital sits above the post-crash prices. Interestingly, while a huge portion of the Realized Cap is now underwater, the actual degree of unrealized loss held by the investors isn’t too big in relative terms. The total unrealized loss held by the Bitcoin investors stands at $20 billion at the moment, which is equivalent to just 3% of the market cap. For comparison, dips during the last couple of years have seen losses reach 7% to 8% of the market cap, while past major bear markets have usually started with this metric at more than 10%. Checkmate has highlighted a level past which unrealized losses could blow up for Bitcoin: $95,000. Currently, 63% of the capital invested in the asset has a cost basis higher than this mark. “$95k is what I believe is the bulls last stand, because as price falls below that level, unrealised losses will swell significantly,” explained the analyst. It now remains to be seen how the profit-loss distribution among the Bitcoin investors will change in the coming days. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a drop toward $98,000 on Tuesday, but its price has since witnessed a small bounce back to the $101,900 mark.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Loss|Bitcoin Pain|Bitcoin Realized Cap|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 06:00:08

Following public consultation, Reeves proposed EV road charges are expected to take effect from April 2028. By the early 2030s, it could generate 1.8 billion a year for the public purse. Reeves is likely to implement a 3p-per-mile charge for EVs on top of the existing road tax to compensate for revenue loss from fuel tax. Reeves Reeves EV motorists would have to pay an extra $326 annually Reeves is reportedly considering per-mile EV charges in her November 26 Budget to help plug a £20bn–£30bn budget gap . According to sources, the government’s plans would see the average EV driver paying an additional £250 ($326) per year. Currently, the average petrol or diesel car owner pays £600 ($784) in fuel duty. Under the proposals, hybrid drivers would also be charged lower per-mile fees compared with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, vehicles wouldn’t be tracked electronically, though the plans don’t specify whether vans and light commercial vehicles are part of the scheme. The Treasury has, however, declined to comment on any speculation before November 26. Nonetheless, officials insist they are still eager to expand EV ownership in line with the UK’s net-zero ambitions. A government representative, when asked about the possibility of per-mile charges for drivers of EVs, remarked, “Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there’s no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles.” Last year, the Association of Fleet Professionals had cautioned that a pay-as-you-drive charge for electric cars could have unforeseen consequences. Similarly, now, Sir Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, says it would be wrong for Reeves to target commuters and drivers simply to fix a budget gap of her own making. So far, the government has already provided £4 billion in EV support, including grants worth up to £3,750 for each qualifying vehicle. A spokesperson added that while the tax system must fairly fund roads and public services, ministers will continue to explore additional measures to support EV drivers. However, FleetCheck chief executive Peter Golding claimed that the new tax burdens could quickly reverse the progress made by the tax incentives. He pointed out that Budget changes to VED last year increased EV running costs by around £2,500 across five years. Some had suggested that the government cut fuel duty Previous governments have repeatedly held off on fuel duty increases to avoid upsetting motorists. However, the OBR calculates that by 2024, the total cost of that decision, from 2010–11 to 2025–26, had risen to around £100 billion ($130 billion). Earlier, Paul Holland, UK and ANZ Fleet Managing Director at Corpay and its UK subsidiary, Allstar, had previously said Reeves should cut fuel duty to help spur growth. He explained: “Fleets are on the frontline of costs. A penny in duty doesn’t just hit a business or fleet; it feeds straight through into the weekly shop, the cost of a parcel, and the price of a pint of milk. Keeping the freeze is not some political gesture; it is about stopping inflation from creeping into every corner of the economy.” He added that the government should use the Autumn Budget to incentivise a move to cleaner fuels, such as rewarding operators who make sustainable choices and cutting duty to reflect this. Acting Chief Executive of Logistics UK, Kevin Green, also stated that Reeves’ proposal to add costs on the fleets would only further stymie growth and lead to higher inflation rates. The Road Haulage Association has also been calling for an emissions-linked rebate on fuel duty to promote the use of low-carbon alternatives, including hydrotreated vegetable oil, and accelerate the transition to net-zero fleets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-xrp-will-make-ripple-the-most-valued-company-in-the-world-heres-why/,"A recent post from crypto analyst {x} (@unknowDLT) has drawn attention for asserting that the U.S. government built Ripple. The analyst further suggested that this alleged connection underpins XRP’s long-term value, stating that the digital asset will ultimately position Ripple as the most valuable company globally. The claim implies that XRP could serve as a strategic instrument to maintain U.S. dominance in global financial infrastructure. The post aligns with a long-running theory in certain corners of the digital asset community—that Ripple and XRP may be integrated into future U.S. or international payment systems due to their technological framework and regulatory engagement. However, no verifiable evidence has surfaced to confirm that the company was created or funded by the U.S. government. Ripple has consistently presented itself as an independent technology firm focused on cross-border payment solutions . Ripple was not ""chosen"" by the US government, it was built by the US government. And that is why XRP will make Ripple the most valued company in the world. XRP will allow the US to remain the global leader. — {x} (@unknowDLT) November 2, 2025 Reactions from the Community The tweet generated sharp responses from both supporters and skeptics. One user, Jack985LW, questioned the broader implications of such an assertion, referencing potential connections between financial digitization and systems, such as biometric identification, carbon credit taxation, and central bank digital currencies. His comment reflected growing public unease about the intersection of digital identity, surveillance, and financial technology. In contrast, another respondent, CryptoticT, dismissed the claim as misleading and accused the analyst of spreading false information. The commenter warned that speculative narratives could cause financial harm to retail investors who act on unverified claims. This critical reaction highlighted a persistent divide within the cryptocurrency community between those who view XRP as an asset with strategic institutional potential and those who see it as overhyped or misrepresented. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Relevance of XRP While assertions of government origins lack confirmation, the discussion underscores ongoing public interest in the geopolitical dimension of digital currencies. The U.S. government has demonstrated interest in blockchain technology through initiatives in financial innovation, cybersecurity, and regulatory frameworks. However, there is no official record linking it to Ripple . The broader implication of {x}’s claim touches on how blockchain-based assets could influence global financial leadership. XRP’s speed , scalability, and interoperability have positioned it as a candidate for institutional use, but attributing its existence to government involvement remains speculative.

Circuit Judges stated that it would be inequitable to award Prime an equitable remedy, even if the Bitcoin existed, which is a big if. Circuit Judge Hon. Britt Grant noted that Michael Prime was arrested in 2019 for counterfeiting and identity theft. The orange external hard drive, which Prime claimed to contain the BTC loot over four years later, was among the evidence collected by the police. However, Grant also noted a problem: Prime failed to mention Bitcoin at least three times before in his financial disclosure statement. Judge Grant observed that Prime had the chance during his interview with the probation officer, and at his sentencing hearing, Prime had represented that he owned very little Bitcoin. The Judge said the government had relied on these representations and abandoned its search for the Bitcoin. Additionally, the government, consistent with its ordinary practices and after giving notice to Prime, wiped whatever devices it could, including the hard drive in question. Court says it is too late The Appeals Court stated that Prime had denied for years that he had that much Bitcoin at all, adding that Bitcoin was not on the list when Prime sought to collect his assets after his release from prison. The court concluded that it was too late, regardless of whether a hard drive containing the alleged Bitcoin existed or not, because the government had destroyed all evidence. Meanwhile, Circuit Judges Hon. Jill Pryor, Hon. Britt Grant, and Hon. Stanley Marcus agreed and affirmed the district court’s ruling, which, citing Prime’s delays and denials, concluded that laches barred his request for Bitcoin. Prime now claims that the U.S. government owes him at least $345 million in Bitcoin because it destroyed the hard drive containing his Bitcoin key. After his 2019 arrest, Prime admitted to selling counterfeit IDs and credit cards online and accepting Bitcoin as payment. He also explained that he was paid $1,000 per month in Bitcoin to work for a website that sold stolen credit card data. Federal agents then obtained warrants authorizing the seizure of Prime’s crypto, but they came up with nothing after three attempts. One agent reported that no crypto, private keys, or recovery seeds were found, and that no contents were seized or located at any Coinbase account. Agents were also unable to gain access to any crypto wallet in the third attempt. Prime fails to assert his Bitcoin claim The Appeals Court ruled that Prime failed to assert his claim to the Bitcoin for more than three years and, in fact, he repeatedly denied it. The court noted that Prime tries to explain away his previous representations, which the presiding judges said they don’t buy. The Circuit Judges emphasized that Prime’s Bitcoin claim is preposterous, and he needed to disclose the amount of Bitcoin he owned in his previous representations. At sentencing, Prime’s attorney also acknowledged that the evidence did not support his original claim to a significant amount of Bitcoin. In fact, he admitted that the Bitcoin in question was essentially non-existent, other than what Prime had from his mining days in Seattle over a decade ago. A significant portion of the Bitcoin was used to purchase boats and cars, which the government subsequently seized. Meanwhile, the Judges stressed that Prime’s delay was inexcusable. They said Prime should have asked the court to appoint counsel to help him request the return of seized items, including the hard drive that contained Bitcoin. Prime does not justify his previously repeated assertions that he owned very little Bitcoin. Finally, the Judges observed that the delay prejudiced the government. They said they have little difficulty concluding that the government would not have destroyed the hard drive if it had knowledge that it contained hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin. The judges emphasized that forcing the government to now find and hand over 3,443 replacement BTC is prejudicial in anyone’s book.

OKX Launches USDT Margined Perpetual Futures for DASH and ZEC According to the exchange's statement, the DASHUSDT contract will start trading at 11:00 and the ZECUSDT contract at 14:15 simultaneously via the web, mobile application and API. The new products offer users leverage from 0.01x to 50x, and can be traded with USDT collateral. Both contracts will have a tick size of 0.01, and pricing will be based on the USDT equivalent of 1 DASH or 1 ZEC. The funding rate is determined by the average premium index and the interest rate differential, and these rates will be kept within a maximum range of ±1.5%. Under normal circumstances, funding fees will be charged every four hours, but when the rate reaches the threshold values, the system will automatically reduce this interval to one hour. Contracts will be traded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. OKX also noted that details regarding the price index, funding rate calculation, and risk control mechanisms for these products are included in the official product documentation. This move aims to boost institutional and retail investor interest in privacy-focused crypto assets like DASH and ZEC by strengthening OKX’s ever-expanding range of derivatives products. *This is not investment advice.

The market is at a crossroads, with some analysts anticipating a deeper correction, while others see the potential for a renewed recovery. iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF Hits 52-Week Low According to a report from Barron’s, all three cryptocurrencies have attracted attention from major exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and President Trump’s administration, spurring hopes that increased institutional adoption could help stabilize volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Falls Under $100,000: Elliott Wave Analysis Forecasts Decline To $70,000 The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is currently trading more than 20% below its recent 52-week high, which was reached less than a month ago. This peak coincided with the formation of a bearish evening star pattern, and the ETF experienced a notable decline of 3% on October 7. The drop below the $70 mark has added to the bearish sentiment, with the ETF declining in three of the last four weeks, closing within the lower half of its trading range. This week alone has seen an 8% drop, and the ETF recently undercut its 200-day simple moving average, marking a steep 5.5% decline—the largest single-day drop since April 7. For investors to regain confidence, analysts assert that it is crucial for the ETF to hold near current levels and reclaim the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), a key indicator of bullish momentum. Historically, recoveries have taken about six sessions, as seen back in April. Ethereum ETF Faces 17% Weekly Decline Ethereum, represented through the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF, has experienced a more pronounced decline, now down 34% from its annual peak and showing a negative year-to-date performance of 5%. This week alone, the ETF has dropped 17%, roughly double the decline seen in the Bitcoin Trust ETF. However, the sharp pullback follows a significant increase of over 220% from early April to late August, making the current retreat appear both prudent and necessary. Notably, the fund has not yet pierced its 200-day simple moving average, having touched it recently while retesting a breakout above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The behavior of the ETF around this critical moving average in the coming week will be crucial; if stability can be achieved, it may present an attractive buying opportunity. After facing resistance at the $40 level on August 22, recent price action could be forming a double-bottom base, provided that the recent lows hold. Heightened Concerns For Solana Solana’s performance has been the most concerning, with its ETF plummeting 41% from its most recent 52-week high set in September. This heightened volatility may reflect the asset’s relative newness, as it began trading only in April. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Needs To Reclaim This Key Level To Prevent Drop To $1,700 The Solana ETF peaked on September 18 and has since formed a bearish island reversal pattern. Over the past seven weeks, it has fallen in five of those, with three weeks recording double-digit declines. This week alone, the ETF has dropped another 19% through just two trading sessions. On the daily chart, a break below the bearish head-and-shoulders pivot at $19 raises concerns of a potential measured move down to $12. Ultimately, the report suggests that a potential recovery for the trio would imply further inflows into these exchange-traded funds. This would also indicate a new wave of bullish sentiment returning to the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,190, marking a 3% surge over the past 24 hours. During the same time frame, ETH and SOL also recorded gains of 5% and 4%, respectively.

The new framework marks the nation’s first comprehensive approach to stablecoin oversight, emphasizing transparency, reserve protection, and financial stability. According to official budget documents released on November 4, the legislation will mandate that stablecoin issuers maintain full asset reserves, create clear redemption policies, and adopt robust data protection and risk management systems. The plan aims to boost consumer confidence and modernize Canada’s payment ecosystem as digital currencies become more mainstream globally. Bank of Canada to Spend $10 Million on Oversight The Bank of Canada will allocate $10 million over two years, starting in 2026–2027, to implement and supervise the new regulatory framework. Annual costs of approximately $5 million will later be recovered from licensed issuers under the Retail Payment Activities Act (RPAA). This initiative follows Ottawa’s decision in 2024 to shelve its central bank digital currency (CBDC) project, shifting focus to private-sector innovation under strict oversight. Regulators say the framework will ensure stablecoins used for payments meet national security and anti-fraud standards, integrating them into the existing financial infrastructure. Industry figures such as Coinbase Canada CEO Lucas Matheson have welcomed the proposal, calling it a “transformational moment that could redefine how Canadians interact with money and the internet.” Canada Aligns With Global Crypto Standards By mirroring the U.S. GENIUS Act and the EU’s MiCA regulations, Canada seeks to be part of global leaders in responsible crypto adoption. The decision comes as the $314 billion stablecoin market grows rapidly, with projections suggesting it could surpass $2 trillion by 2028. Local players, such as Tetra Digital, backed by Shopify, Wealthsimple, and the National Bank of Canada, are already developing Canadian dollar–backed stablecoins, while global firms, including Western Union, prepare to launch their own Solana-based tokens in 2026. Analysts believe Canada’s new rules could bridge the gap between innovation and trust, ensuring that stablecoins become a secure and regulated part of the nation’s digital finance future.

The comment touches on a recurring theme within the XRP community — the significance of accumulation and the perceived scarcity of holdings relative to global distribution. The post’s underlying message suggests that XRP ownership, even at modest levels, represents early participation in a system that may later gain broad adoption. However, responses to the claim reveal a sharp divide over both the accuracy of such comparisons and the broader question of XRP’s long-term performance against inflation and fiat currencies. If you have 1,000 XRP, you’re already in a better position than 98.37% of the world’s population pic.twitter.com/WOJv2XBzkx — BD (@DiepSanh) November 3, 2025 Critiques Rooted in Historical Context Among the first to challenge BD’s statement was user James Patrick Holman, who highlighted XRP’s 2018 price peak of over $3.50 and compared it to present values after adjusting for inflation. He noted that for XRP to retain the same purchasing power it held nearly eight years ago, it would need to trade at approximately $5.06 today. His comment framed XRP’s stagnation as a decline in real terms, contrasting with the initial optimism that surrounded its market surge during the 2017–2018 bull run. The observation underscores the growing emphasis among long-term holders on inflation-adjusted valuations rather than nominal price recovery. Skepticism Toward Data and Distribution Claims Another user, identified as Miami1, questioned the credibility of the “98.37%” figure referenced by BD. He argued that with a 100 billion XRP supply, ownership of 1,000 tokens represents only a negligible portion, insufficient to claim an advantage over a large global population. His response also reflected a broader sentiment of distrust toward the distribution model, noting that Ripple’s substantial holdings continue to raise concerns about centralization and control. Despite the informal tone of the comment, it echoed a view shared by some investors that XRP’s future price trajectory remains constrained by supply concentration and market perception. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Divergence on Future Expectations A third participant, identified simply as J, dismissed BD’s assessment and contended that owning 1,000 XRP would not yield meaningful financial outcomes in the near or midterm future. His perspective reflected a more aggressive stance on accumulation, implying that substantial holdings would be necessary to achieve “life-changing” returns. The exchange as a whole illustrates a recurring division within the XRP community between those who view small-scale ownership as strategic early positioning and those who believe only large accumulations can generate significant financial benefit. BD’s post has once again brought to the surface differing thoughts within the XRP space — between optimism grounded in adoption potential and realism centered on economic metrics. While the broader market continues to evaluate XRP’s utility and price performance, community dialogue remains divided on what level of ownership truly represents meaningful participation in the asset’s future.

HTX Hot Listings Weekly Recap (Oct 27-Nov 2): Top Gainer DARK Soars 110%, as AI and Privacy Lead Dual Rallies",https://square.htx.com/privacy-sector-reignited-htx-hot-listings-weekly-recap-oct-27-nov-2/,"In the past week (Oct 27 – Nov 2), the crypto market trended lower amidst volatility, even as mainstream funds flowed back into emerging narrative sectors. Concepts such as AI, privacy tokens, and Layer2 saw strong momentum shifts, with several mid- and small-cap tokens delivering impressive performances. Multiple sectors listed on HTX are flourishing simultaneously, driving a sustained increase in trading activity on the platform. Specifically, the AI narrative regained traction amid the x402 protocol boom, while the privacy sector staged a powerful comeback led by veteran assets. Together, AI and privacy emerged as the twin growth engines of this market cycle. AI Narrative Returns: DARK, GAME, and VIRTUAL Take the Lead The AI sector was undoubtedly the focus this week. The rise of the x402 protocol reignited on-chain enthusiasm for AI narratives. Initiated by Coinbase, the protocol aims to allow AI agents to directly access services through on-chain micropayments, laying the groundwork for an “AI self-paying economy”. Its rapid emergence has fueled a market frenzy around a series of projects labeled “AI & x402”. ● DARK (Dark Eclipse): As one of the few projects in the Solana ecosystem that integrates both AI and x402 applications, DARK surged 110% this week, emerging as the top gainer. Due to the recent breakouts of AI-related assets on Solana, DARK’s trading volume has more than tripled, making it a representative asset of the current AI narrative wave. ● GAME (GAME by Virtuals) : GAME, from the Base AI sector, continued its strong momentum with an 80% rally this week. As the AI agent token of the Virtuals Protocol, GAME is built on the Base ecosystem and carries dual “AI” and “x402” tags, combining strong trading activity with substantial conceptual potential. ● VIRTUAL (Virtuals Protocol) : Up 30%, showing steady performance. As the x402 ecosystem matures, VIRTUAL is poised to become a flagship project in the AI + virtual asset space. This Thursday, HTX will launch a limited-time Spot Trading Carnival , distributing 20,000 USDT in airdrops to reward active traders. The campaign covers this week’s hottest AI and x402 ecosystem tokens. By trading popular spot pairs involving GIGGLE, VIRTUAL, KITE, PAYAI, BLUAI, PING, and PALU, users can share 20,000 USDT in airdrops. I Hot Token Listing Winners——10.27-11.2 2025 Privacy Sector Stands Out: DASH and ZEC Stage a Strong Comeback ● DASH (Dash) : Up 77% this week, leading the privacy sector. Known for its “hybrid privacy + instant payment” model, DASH holds distinct advantages in payment network restructuring and on-chain settlements. The recent community-driven DASH Evolution upgrade has rekindled market confidence in the project’s long-term potential. ● ZEC (Zcash) : Up 20% this week, marking a strong rebound for this veteran privacy token. As one of the pioneering privacy tokens, ZEC is built on zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs) technology and continues to provide foundational support for on-chain privacy protection. Layer 2 and Derivatives: ZK and ASTER Advance Steadily ● ZK (ZKsync) : Surged 70% this week, a Layer 2 representative. The ZK ecosystem made progress in Rollups, cross-chain interoperability, and privacy expansion, while infrastructure improvements such as zkEVM and zkBridge drove capital inflows. As Ethereum’s scaling roadmap enters a new phase, investors are re-evaluating the medium- to long-term value of ZK-related assets. ● ASTER (Aster) : Rose 20% this week, a standout performer in decentralized perpetuals (PerpDEX). The PerpDEX sector is largely driven by trading volume and market volatility. As activity in the derivatives market increased, ASTER steadily expanded its user base through its low-fee, high-leverage product mechanism. AI and Privacy Resonate, Intensifying Structural Market Rotation Overall, AI and privacy emerged as the two main forces driving market recovery this week. The former represents the push to expand the boundaries of innovation and efficiency, while the latter signifies both a steadfast commitment to and a revival of the decentralized ethos. From DARK’s explosive rally to the resurgence of DASH and ZEC, the market is witnessing the convergence and resonance of new and traditional narratives.

HTX, a leading global exchange, is addressing this challenge with a major upgrade to its Collateral Swap (formerly Crypto Loans) product with the introduction of the Swap Voucher feature. This enhancement empowers users to better navigate market fluctuations and minimize capital turnover costs. The Swap Voucher automatically offsets borrowing interest. By intelligently combining users’ Prime Membership privileges with these dynamic discounts, HTX achieves dual optimization of loan costs. This provides users with a more efficient financial instrument and strategic flexibility during turbulent markets. Industry-First Dual Discount Further Cuts Funding Costs The Swap Voucher is an all-new benefit-based tool launched by HTX to directly reduce borrowing costs by offsetting the interest on Collateral Swap orders. Unlike traditional discounts, this voucher is designed to be stacked alongside Prime Membership privileges. The system automatically calculates the optimal combination of available discounts, making borrowing more affordable and fund utilization more stable. The process is simple—just three steps to enjoy your discount: View Vouchers: Visit the [HTX Official Website – Rewards Hub] or [HTX App – My Rewards] to find your available Swap Vouchers in your Coupon section. Apply Discount: When placing a Collateral Swap order, the system automatically displays the applicable vouchers. Simply select one to apply the discount. Confirm Savings: Preview your Estimated Savings in the fee details before submitting your order. After placing the order, you can also view voucher usage in the order details. The system automatically applies the best combination of your Prime Membership discount and Swap Voucher to ensure the lowest possible net interest payment. Three Key Scenarios Where Costs Are Instantly Reduced The Swap Voucher applies to all assets and loan terms, effectively addressing the pain points of professional users. 1. Miners’ Capital Turnover: Facing fluctuations in electricity costs and mining revenue, miners can leverage Collateral Swap for rapid liquidity. By stacking the dual discounts, interest expenses are significantly reduced, enabling miners to extend holding periods and capture greater profits. 2. Market Maker Inventory Management: Market makers often need to adjust positions to maintain trading depth. Using the voucher directly lowers borrowing costs, allowing for more efficient inventory turnover while enhancing quoting competitiveness and overall market liquidity. 3. Quantitative Teams’ Hedging Strategy: For quantitative teams that frequently borrow to execute hedging strategies, the dual discount mechanism makes funding costs more predictable and controllable, significantly enhancing strategy performance and capital efficiency. As a global leader in digital asset trading, HTX remains committed to a user-first, efficiency-driven product philosophy. The introduction of the Swap Voucher marks a major step forward—more than a simple feature upgrade, it redefines the cost and efficiency of crypto borrowing. Looking ahead, HTX will deepen its commitment to product innovation, delivering smarter, scenario-based financial tools that empower users to navigate market volatility, capture alpha opportunities, and unlock the full potential of their capital.

Some of the leading contenders in this field include Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), as well as the new kid on the block in the form of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Each of these cryptos is driven by a set of factors that offer distinctly varying gains. However, the true focus of attention is slowly shifting towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi crypto that is already in its sixth presale phase, retailing at a remarkably cheap price of only $0.035. It is deemed to be the next crypto to explode that will skyrocket as over 85% of MUTM is already sold out. Created on a revolutionary lending & liquidity framework, MUTM strives to integrate conventional financial systems with decentralized platforms, thereby providing not only gains but also long-term token economics. As a promising asset, Mutuum Finance is undoubtedly the top crypto to invest in today in the lead-up to the next Bitcoin bull run. XRP Nears Breakout Ripple (XRP) is flashing bullish signals in the monthly timeframe. XRP has recently broken past $2.47 after a long consolidation period. There are 2 key XRP levels to watch now, one is support around the $1.95 zone and resistance around $5.74. As investors look for new asset classes that offer even greater prospects than those of XRP, they are increasingly focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi token that is rapidly making waves in the crypto space as the next crypto to explode and the top crypto leading DeFi innovation in 2025. Solana Prepares for Possible Positive Breakout Solana (SOL), having experienced sharp recovery periods after traversing a noticeable downtrend, depicts visible buying interest in the market during each of these phases. Nevertheless, Solana is presently consolidating near critical support levels, reflecting that the market is in the process of stabilization prior to a new breakout. This time, if the support is maintained and sufficient momentum is gained to move past resistance levels, Solana would enter a new positive phase towards the $200+ range. Although there is a hint of a possible comeback from the consolidation of SOL, various investors are also looking at new DeFi prospects in the sector, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) proving to be a noteworthy entrant that has the opportunity to offer higher gain prospects in the coming crypto cycle. Investors recognize MUTM as the next crypto to explode and consider it the top crypto with 2025’s highest growth potential. Mutuum Finance: At the Forefront of Decentralized Finance Mutuum Finance is quickly positioning itself as one of the most innovative projects in the DeFi space. Its presale has shattered initial projections by having over 17,720 participants contribute over $18.45 million. Essentially, Mutuum Finance brings forth a new era lending/borrowing protocol that is centered around transparency, stability, and fairness. Lenders are able to offer a repayment term to borrowers, in addition to a flexible interest rate that is constantly updated according to market variables. This kind of lending and borrowing solution is instrumental in creating a trustworthy lending environment in the world of decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already succeeded in onboarding more than 17,720 investors, raising a sum of $18.45 million, with Phase 6 over 85% sold out at a token price of $0.035. As Phase 7 is soon to launch with a price hike of 20%, the earlier investors will get one last chance to participate in MUTM before prices skyrocket. Offering a safe, trustworthy DeFi lending solution, constantly varying yield generation capabilities, and a high-demand presales phase, MUTM is the next crypto to explode and the top crypto to buy now for massive gains in the next market cycle. Head over to the Mutuum Finance platform today to participate in one of the most promising DeFi initiatives of 2025.

The firm cited concerns over institutional absorption, leveraged liquidations, and significant distribution by long-term holders. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, revealed that Bitcoin has entered its ‘maturity era’, meaning the market is largely dictated by institutional flows, low volatility, and passive ETF investments, and no longer retail speculations. Thorn noted on X that Bitcoin can maintain the $100,000 level, suggesting that the three-year bull market will remain structurally intact, while acknowledging that future gains may slow down. Galaxy says institutional traders dictate the current crypto market Galaxy Digital revised its forecast following the October 10 market crash , which triggered roughly $20 billion in liquidation across the cryptocurrency market. The Bitcoin price experienced a brief drawdown, trading below $105,000, after reaching highs of $121,000. The total liquidations on October 10 marked the largest in cryptocurrency history to date. i’m lowering my BTC bullish EOY target to $120k (prev $185k) 👀 just sent this note to clients whale distribution, non-BTC investments, treasury company malaise, and other factors contributed to BTC headwinds in 25 (long-term future still bullish, of course) pic.twitter.com/2aj1eoJlno — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) November 5, 2025 According to Galaxy, roughly 470,000 to 400,000 BTC, valued between $50 billion and $43 billion, were offloaded by long-term holders during the recent bearish momentum, creating significant resistance at key price levels. On-chain data indicates a decline in spot demand and ETF outflows, signaling a shift from bullish momentum. For instance, U.S. spot ETFs for BTC and ETH have experienced sustained outflows for five consecutive days, resulting in more than $1 billion being offloaded from the funds. Bitcoin has shed nearly 20% of its value from its October 26 all-time high of $ 69,000, indicating a potential bearish phase. Although some analysts believe that a correction of 20% to 25% is within the normal range, citing that past market corrections have exceeded 30%. Galaxy noted that capital migration is another factor affecting the current price action, with investors shifting funds towards AI and Gold. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, believes that AI infrastructure companies and data centre investment stocks have soared, attracting more capital as Bitcoin loses its speculative appeal. Bitcoin faces short-term bearish pressure as ETF outflows rise Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainties have also triggered a shift of investments towards less-risky assets such as gold, which is traditionally viewed as a hedge against inflation. Thorn noted that in a liquidity-rich environment, attention is finite. He added that the investment focus has favored other high-demand sectors, such as AI, this year over digital assets. According to Galaxy Digital , the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs hasn’t consistently driven price action, but rather the influence of passive flows by institutional and retail ETF holders. The firm believes these holders have created a new layer of market stability and reduced short-term upside volatility. According to CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno, BTC may fall to as low as $72,000 in the short term if the bearish momentum persists. He cited concerns over declining spot demand and ETF outflows that have sustained since the October crash. So far, Bitcoin has recovered more than 5% to trade around $103,322 after a recent dip earlier this week, which saw it fall below $100,000. ETH has recovered by almost 12% to trade at $3,400 levels after dipping below $3,100 on Tuesday. Yet with ETFs bleeding capital, the market remains vulnerable and uncertain towards further retracements. Despite the short-term bearish momentum, Galaxy maintains confidence that Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain intact. Thorn said that market cycles are the defining features of crypto assets and that the current phase of consolidation does not invalidate Bitcoin’s long-term projections.

Meme tokens move faster. And mosquito meme tokens? They move like caffeine-overdosed insects at a summer barbecue. Investors are swarming around La Culex ($CULEX) , calling it the best 1000x crypto today, while Ethereum holders bite their nails amid ETF outflows and Sui quietly builds technical energy for a reversal. Memes, fundamentals, price action, and investor psychology collide here. And while some coins slow down, others buzz right through resistance levels like they do not believe in traffic rules. Before jumping into charts and data, here is the early punchline: Ethereum is slipping, Sui is preparing a bounce, and La Culex is doing what mosquitos always do in bull seasons… multiplying fast and refusing to die. Welcome to today’s crypto swarm zone. Crypto Macro Mood: Risk-Off Markets, Risk-On Memes Volatility is not a visitor anymore. It moved in, unpacked its bags, and started making pancakes in the crypto kitchen. Bitcoin and Ethereum weakness is shaping investor appetite, but smart traders are rotating capital instead of panicking. Institutional flows are cooling toward ETH, but grassroots meme hype is growing. Retail investors are chasing narrative plays again, especially those with token burns, staking yield hooks, and swarm-style referral growth systems. That is exactly the zone where La Culex sits. La Culex: The Mosquito Meme Token Investors Call the Best 1000x Crypto Today Now to the star of this swarm party. La Culex is an Ethereum-based meme token built around mosquito energy. It is funny. It is annoying. It bites. And it uses that meme identity to fuel real token utility through staking, referral growth, and token burns. The community is treating La Culex like that mosquito you swat 9 times, but it keeps coming back stronger and hungrier. Except here, instead of itching, investors want ROI. Crypto memes evolve in each cycle: Dogs. Frogs. Cats. AI-animals. Now? Mosquito season. The La Culex presale is currently in Stage 4, called Hive Signal, with its presale price sitting at $0.00002458. More than $12,000 has been raised so far, over 600 million tokens have been scooped up, and the holder count has crossed 90 buyers. Early swarm joiners are already seeing a 26.2% ROI, while the projected jump from this stage to the planned listing price of $0.007 reflects a mind-stunning 28378.43775% return potential. In meme-coin language, that is mosquito-level persistence paying off. Ethereum Bears Take Control as ETF Outflows Hit Hard Ethereum saw its price slide under $3,500 after ETF outflows intensified. ETH ETFs recorded $136 million in outflows, led by BlackRock and Fidelity products. Retail demand also dropped, with futures open interest sliding from $63 billion in October to $44.72 billion this week. FXStreet analysis shows ETH remains below crucial levels, with RSI near 33 and MACD flashing bearish continuation signals. Traders are currently moving toward stablecoins and tactical altcoin plays, waiting for the market to stabilize. Sui Hovers Near Key Support as Bulls Prepare to Strike While Ethereum bleeds slowly, Sui is doing squats in the gym, preparing for a possible breakout. The token is near $2.20 support and forming a falling wedge structure, which is historically a bullish pattern. Analysts highlight buyer reactions at major trendline zones, suggesting that $2.25 could be the first bounce level, with upside targets between $2.70 and $2.90 if momentum returns. Final Take: Who Wins in Today’s Market Pulse? Ethereum remains a long-term infrastructure giant, but ETF outflows weigh on near-term price. Sui shows technical resilience and may rebound sharply if macro conditions cool. La Culex owns the narrative throne for now, riding meme culture, staking mechanics, and community growth. Today’s market watches carefully. Some coins consolidate. Others quietly prepare. And a mosquito coin loudly buzzes through the noise like it owns the porch light. For now, the crowd says the best 1000x crypto today title belongs to La Culex. Whether it keeps it depends on execution. But momentum? Fully airborne.

Market sentiment currently highlights La Culex due to its early-stage swarm community and presale momentum. Why is Ethereum dropping? ETF outflows and lower futures interest are pressuring price near $3,500. Is Sui bullish long-term? Analysts see strong fundamentals and a bullish wedge pattern near $2.20. Are meme coins still performing? Yes, especially those with referral systems, burns, and strong narratives. Glossary Swarm Economy: Growth model using network participation and referral loops Falling Wedge: Technical chart pattern often signaling bullish reversal ETF Outflows: Capital leaving exchange traded funds Staking: Locking tokens to earn yield MACD: Trading indicator measuring trend direction Support Zone: Price level where buying typically appears Token Burns: Destroying tokens to reduce supply Summary This article analyzes market trends as Ethereum faces ETF-driven selling pressure near $3,500, Sui tests technical support around $2.20 with bullish wedge structure, and La Culex gains momentum as a meme-driven presale token. With over $12,000 raised and more than 90 holders in early stages, La Culex leverages staking, token burns, and viral branding to position as the best 1000x crypto today. Ethereum remains fundamentally strong but pressured by declining institutional interest, while Sui shows breakout potential pending market stabilization. Investors are rotating from large-caps into high-energy, narrative-led early opportunities.

At the same time, more traders are asking a different question: instead of waiting for a slow bounce, what are the best cryptos to buy now while the big players reshuffle their bags? Many analysts are beginning to consider other altcoins like HYPE and growth-backed projects like Remittix (RTX) , a rising DeFi project crypto that is now being called the best new altcoin. DOGE Price After The Whale Dump: Is Dogecoin Magic Fading? Source: TradingView The DOGE price is now $0.164 . On the surface, it looks fine, but the story behind it is worrying. Data from Santiment shows that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE dump one billion DOGE in a few days , this was also reported by Ali Martinez . That move dragged Dogecoin’s market cap down from $55.7 billion on October 28 to $25.1 billion on November 4. This is a huge sell-off that has shaken the meme coin community, and investors doubt that the token can recover. For traders watching the DOGE price, this looks a lot like the last big exit before the coin dropped from $0.26 to $0.12. Support now sits around $0.15, with the psychological $0.10 level below that. Coinglass reports nearly $46 million in outflows in one day, and spot flows still show more coins moving to exchanges. Some analysts even talk about targets at $0.07 or $0.05. That does not fit the wish list of investors hunting for the best crypto to buy now or the next 100x crypto . HYPERLIQUID: Strong Buybacks, But Still A Trader’s Game Hyperliquid’s token HYPE is telling a very different story from the DOGE price. The token trades around $41.2 after retesting support near $36. Analysts say that holding above $39 keeps the chart on track for a move toward $46 and maybe even $53–$55 if volume spikes. On-chain data from CryptoQuant and Lookonchain shows whales have added about 150,000 HYPE (around $6.5 million) over the past 48 hours. Source: The BigBear The project also runs one of the strongest buyback programs in crypto, burning about $3 million in fees every day. Hyperliquid has spent roughly $780 million buying back 34.41 million HYPE, now worth about $1.28 billion, a gain of over 65%. Even so, the price is still in a range. It has not confirmed a clean breakout yet, so HYPE looks more like a short-term trading play than a simple best crypto to buy now choice for long-term holders. Why Remittix Looks Like The Best Crypto To Buy Now Remittix sits in a very different category. Instead of living on memes or pure speculation, the Remittix DeFi project is built as a DeFi project for real payments. So far, Remittix has raised over $28 million by selling more than 684 million RTX tokens at $0.1166 each. Listings on BitMart and LBank are already confirmed, and another major exchange reveal is coming soon. The Remittix Wallet Beta has also been live for a few weeks. On top of that, Remittix has passed a full security audit by CertiK, which boosts trust for anyone who wants a low-gas-fee crypto they can hold without fear. Here’s why Remittix is the best crypto to buy now: CertiK-audited, ranked #1 for verified projects before launch Instant crypto-to-bank transfers completed in seconds Expansion plans for 2026 targeting Africa, Asia, and Latin America A $250,000 community giveaway, daily referral rewards, and future staking and liquidity pools turn RTX into a true next big altcoin 2025 contender Analysts project 40x potential growth before January 2026 Final Take Now that whale wallets have dumped 1 billion DOGE, investors are looking for the best crypto to buy now. HYPE has strong tokenomics and could reward skilled traders, but it still acts like a range-bound trade. Remittix , by contrast, is building tools with actual real-world utility. For many, that makes RTX the best crypto to buy now for anyone who wants real utility and serious upside in the coming cycle.

However, despite this seller-driven downturn, some market analysts believe that the asset’s core upward trend remains unbroken and that it can still reach $5,000 by year-end. Selling Pressure Deepens, but Buyers Stay Hopeful The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap went through some heavy volatility this week, dropping as low as $3,160 before a modest rebound. However, CryptoQuant analyst PelinayPA has pointed out that the Taker Buy-Sell Ratio on Binance has been hovering just below 1.0, confirming that the market is dominated by sellers. She noted that while the dynamic “creates short-term downward pressure,” it does not suggest panic. Instead, she described it as controlled profit-taking within an ongoing uptrend and expects ETH to find strong buyer interest around the $2,955 to $3,000 zone before resuming its climb toward $5,000. “I believe the price will find buyers around this level,” the trader wrote. “The main trend remains upward, and I expect these buyers to potentially push the price toward $5,000 by the end of the year.” Similarly, chart technician Ted Pillows identified $3,500–$3,600 as the key zone to reclaim for any bullish momentum to emerge. According to him, the asset could be pushed back toward the $2,800 support area if it fails to break above that range. Network Activity Slows as Price Consolidates Beyond the charts, Ethereum’s network fundamentals have also weakened, with daily active addresses cratering by 24% since mid-August. In the past, when there was less activity on the blockchain, prices tended to go down as well, because there were fewer transactions and less interest in dApps. Meanwhile, at the market, CoinGecko data shows ETH is down 12.2% in the last seven days and 28% across the month, underperforming Bitcoin’s modest rebound. The ETH/BTC ratio stands at 0.03284 BTC, indicating a shift in capital toward Bitcoin. However, Ethereum is trading above its two-year trendline support, which it has held since 2022. Many observers consider this structure to be the last major defense before a potential bounce. For now, sentiment remains mixed. Liquidity clusters around $2,800–$3,000 are drawing attention as potential accumulation zones, while bulls are looking to reclaim $3,600 to confirm renewed strength. But with both technical and macro pressures in play, including U.S. Federal Reserve tightening and ongoing liquidity outflows, traders appear cautious. Still, as PelinayPA’s analysis suggested, the broader trend remains constructive. If Ethereum can defend its current support and regain key resistance zones, the path toward $5,000 by year-end may still be within reach, albeit a steeper climb than once expected.

Accordingly, Willy Woo criticized the long-term holding (LTH) metric used in his recent Bitcoin (BTC) analysis as outdated and misleading. Woo said that the 'long-term holder' metric (Bitcoins held for more than five months – LTH) is flawed and that the metric based on long-term vs. short-term investor selling is outdated. At this point, Woo said of Bitcoin's recent decline, “it wouldn't be accurate to say that long-term investors are selling and that's why the price is falling.” Woo stated that long-term investors sold, but the sold Bitcoins were immediately transferred to new buyers and institutional investors such as the treasury. “The selling from long-term investors reflects more of a holding rotation. That is, Bitcoins are changing hands to new investors or being transferred to institutional structures such as treasuries.” Bitcoin Could Rise Within Two Weeks! Willy Woo also shared on his X account that the latest Bitcoin liquidity indicator has begun to show signs of recovery. At this point, Woo predicted that Bitcoin's price will start to rise in about two weeks if the liquidity recovery continues. “The latest Bitcoin liquidity indicator (leading signal shown by the dashed line) has started to show signs of recovery. If this liquidity recovery trend continues, Bitcoin's price will enter an uptrend in about two weeks.” Bitcoin, which has risen by 1.5% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at $103,300, according to CoinMarketCap data. *This is not investment advice.

Technical analyst AllinCrypto analyzed the paper and emphasized its reference to XRP payment transactions as part of the technological framework under evaluation. While the ECB continues to research the design and infrastructure behind the digital euro, its inclusion of XRP-related mechanisms suggests that distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) remain under active consideration for wholesale-level financial settlement systems. $XRP payment transactions were mentioned in a European Central Bank research paper exploring the digital euro and technologies for wholesale CBDC settlements. $RLUSD pic.twitter.com/CPYsHOSWVQ — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) November 4, 2025 Operational Process Using XRP Payment Transactions In a detailed video breakdown, the analyst explained how the ECB’s study outlined operational processes involving XRP-based payment transactions. The sequence begins with the creation of an escrow wallet that handles the transfer process between participants. Within this setup, each transaction includes the address of the final receiver, the amount to be charged, and the sum to be transferred to the beneficiary. Once the corresponding cash leg of the transaction is confirmed, operator nodes are notified, prompting the initiation of settlement actions recorded on the XRP Ledger. According to the analysis, operator confirmations ensure the synchronization between cash and asset transfers. The final stage involves releasing assets from the escrow wallet to the investor’s wallet, thereby completing the delivery-versus-payment (DVP) process. The description reflects a system designed for efficiency and accuracy, underscoring XRP’s use case in facilitating instant and traceable settlements within institutional-grade payment infrastructure. Implications for CBDC Development and Integration AllinCrypto noted that while the ECB’s current digital euro framework does not rely directly on distributed ledger technology, its wholesale CBDC research explicitly examines DLT-based settlement solutions. The reference to XRP payment transactions demonstrates the institution’s engagement with existing blockchain networks as potential components of future financial infrastructure. The analyst also highlighted that the research mentions operational structures consistent with those used on the XRP Ledger, including escrow mechanisms and settlement finality features. He further highlighted that this distinction between the retail digital euro and wholesale CBDC experiments may indicate the ECB’s openness to integrating external networks for interbank transactions. Should the digital euro continue on its non-DLT path, wholesale settlement systems might evolve independently, leveraging networks like the XRP Ledger for liquidity movement and settlement assurance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Role and Future Considerations Concluding his assessment, AllinCrypto observed that the broader implications extend beyond the ECB’s research itself. He suggested that Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD , could emerge as part of a new wave of institutional settlement instruments within the European Union. With the ECB projecting the potential issuance of the digital euro by 2029, the analyst argued that central banks risk losing ground to private stablecoin initiatives if adoption delays persist. The study’s acknowledgment of XRP payment transactions, therefore, may represent an early indication of how cross-border settlement technologies could converge with future central bank systems.

XRP is among the top performers from the larger-cap alts, but its 3.6% surge has been dwarfed by ZEC and ICP. BTC Tapped $104K The primary cryptocurrency had a volatile last week when it was stopped at $116,000 and pushed south to around $111,000 before the US Fed cut the interest rates on Wednesday. Surprisingly to some, it dropped after that to under $107,000 but quickly bounced off and returned to $111,000 during the weekend. Then came the Monday and Tuesday market-wide crash . Within a 36-hour period, BTC’s price tumbled hard first to $104,000 before the bears took complete control of the market and drove it south to just under $99,000.

The move expands derivatives liquidity and price discovery for XRP, likely tightening spreads and attracting market makers across pairs. Increased hedging and funding strategies can accelerate alt rotations, boosting on-chain activity across wallets, bridges, and DEX aggregators. As EU XRP perps spur altcoin rotations, Best Wallet Token’s $16.8M presale is a smart purchase now. Gemini just switched on XRP perpetual contracts for EU customers, letting traders go long or short with up to 100x leverage and no monthly expiry. Perps settle in $USDC and live inside Gemini’s regulated EU derivatives stack, and this combo offers access to XRP volatility while keeping operations under an institutional-style framework. The launch adds a fresh venue for XRP price discovery and funding-rate strategies, which tends to attract market makers and bring tighter spreads. Why is this important? Because it adds more derivatives liquidity to one of the largest crypto payment assets and pulls capital into alt rotations. As a result, $XRP has now recovered to above $2.3 in the last day (+3.49%), alongside many of the best altcoins on the market, including Ethereum (1.15%), Solana (+1.33%), and BNB (+0.14%). When a Tier-1 venue lights up a new perp, traders often start hunting catalysts across the rest of the board. And it’s often wallet infrastructure that sees the upside because that’s where users bridge, swap, and stake while moving between trades. That’s the setup that can funnel attention toward top altcoin with direct utility. Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and Best Wallet, a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with an integrated DEX aggregator, a curated ‘Upcoming Tokens’ presale hub, and a planned debit card. $BEST owners get fee reductions, governance, staking boosts, and access to some of the best crypto presales on the market. If XRP perps kick off risk-on rotations, a wallet token that monetizes swaps and presale activity is a clean way to play the flow without guessing single-coin winners. More perp venues usually equal more trading cycles, more bridging, and more on-chain execution. Wallets that compress those steps into one interface capture value at the ‘picks and shovels’ layer, and Best Wallet (alongside $BES) is designed to sit exactly there. ➡️ To learn more about Best Wallet Token, read our guide. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Multi-Chain Wallet With Built-In Presale Access Best Wallet is a non-custodial app built for daily use, not cold storage. It supports six major chains (Solana and Ethereum among them), routes same-chain and cross-chain swaps through an integrated DEX aggregator, and offers vetted ‘Upcoming Tokens’ so you can join early presales from inside the wallet. It also offers multi-wallet asset management, buying and selling within the wallet, on-ramp services, and a continuously-evolving DeFi ecosystem. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) ties it all together with trading fee reductions, governance rights, and boosted staking rewards (a staking aggregator is in the works as we speak). The roadmap shows a browser extension, NFT gallery, richer portfolio views, and a debit card to spend crypto are coming in the future. That mix turns $BEST into a utility token linked to swaps, discovery, and payments. So, when derivatives activity sends users rotating between majors and alts, $BEST’s unified flow helps capture those transactions at the point of execution as the mechanism that returns value to holders. $BEST’s presale has raised over $16.8M, with a token price of $0.025905, with the total raise at $16.85M. The token’s got substantial potential come next year – our $BEST price prediction shows a potential price point of $0.05106175 by the end of 2026 (a 97% increase from today’s price). That’s not the only way to gain from this presale, though. You can stake your $BEST tokens immediately after purchase for a dynamic 78% APY (it will drop as more users stake). ➡️ Here’s how to buy $BEST right now. All in all, Gemini’s move signals bullish times for altcoin rotations, and traders are already making moves. And Best Wallet Token can be one of the smartest investments in this period, especially if price predictions come true. Join the $BEST presale before it ends in 22 days.

The Project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has recovered during the ongoing session. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens fell to multi-month lows earlier this week as bearish sentiment overwhelmed buyers. Husky Inu (HINU) Completes Move To $0.00022248 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price rise of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00022183 to $0.00022248. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. The regular price rises during the pre-launch phase aim to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Husky Inu has generated substantial investor interest during its presale and pre-launch phases. The project’s fledgling community has grown in strength and numbers, thanks to the dedication and enthusiasm of each member. The project’s official launch date, March 27, 2026, is just over six months away. Our goal has always been long-term growth and success, not short-term hype. However, the possibility of an earlier launch is open. The Husky Inu team will conduct a series of strategic meetings to assess market conditions and determine the optimal time to launch the project. The first two reviews were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025. The third review is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Crypto Market Recovers Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has recovered after an unprecedented selloff that saw Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins fall to multi-month lows. BTC slipped below the $100,000 mark on Tuesday, falling to an intraday low of $98,892 before reclaiming $100,000. The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $103,000 on Wednesday but is back in bearish territory during the ongoing session, down 0.50%. Meanwhile, ETH rebounded from a low of $3,277 to reclaim $3,000 and moved to its current level of 3,396. Buyers will look to retain control and push ETH towards the $3,500 mark. Ripple (XRP) has also made a strong recovery, and is up nearly 4%, while Solana (SOL) is down over 1% at $159. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 1% while Cardano (ADA) is up over 1%, trading around $0.538. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also recovered over the past 24 hours.

Tangem Pay will be available for US users by the end of November, while Latin American, Asian, and European users will be able to access the platform in the next phases of the rollout. Meanwhile, self-custodial crypto wallet Best Wallet is close to hitting $17M in its viral token presale, hinting at an explosive launch. Cryptocurrency wallet provider Tangem announces the launch of Tangem Pay, a self-custodial virtual Visa card that allows users to spend USDC anywhere. The product of a collaboration with the US payment infrastructure company Paera, Tangem Pay will be compatible with millions of merchants across the globe and directly connect to Tangem’s hardware wallet. Users can deposit their USDC stablecoins to Tangem Pay via the Polygon network, and use their card anywhere Visa is accepted. It will also support Apple Pay and Google Pay. The project’s initial rollout will begin in late November across the US, followed by Latin America, and countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Tangem has always been committed to delivering a self-custodial experience to users, removing shady third parties and KYC procedures from the picture. And yet, Tangem Pay requires KYC, though the company has been careful to emphasize that stablecoin infrastructure company Rain will handle the compliance and settlement side of Tangem Pay. “If a user is sanctioned or engaged in illegal activity, our regulatory partner — not Tangem — can disconnect the payment card from the payment network. Again, no one has access to the Tangem wallet itself, and Tangem Pay’s KYC has no effect on this,” explains Tangem Pay CEO Marcos Nunes. The announcement has raised eyebrows and turned eyes to Best Wallet as an alternative for those seeking true anonymity. This new mobile crypto wallet promises no KYC, complete self-custody, and comes with a viral token presale, inviting users to share in its growth. Best Wallet is Launching a Crypto Payment Card Best Wallet is a feature-packed, non-custodial wallet that gives holders complete control over their private keys. Secured with Fireblocks’ MPC technology, the project changes the way we understand wallets, offering an intuitive user experience and much more than just storage. This includes reduced transaction fees, cross-chain swaps, and exclusive presale access. But perhaps the most anticipated feature is an everyday crypto shopping card. Similar to Tangem Pay, Best Card will provide a seamless payment experience at merchants worldwide that accept Mastercard. But unlike Tangem Pay, Best Card won’t be limited to stablecoins. It will offer payments in a wide range of cryptocurrencies. That’s because Best Wallet is a multi-chain, multi-wallet. That means users just need this single app to transfer assets across top blockchains between multiple wallets. Built-in cross-chain swaps enable seamless conversions between assets without requiring a third-party intermediary, such as a centralized exchange. It’s also fully No-KYC, appealing to the original Tangem promise. Factoring in these standout features, Best Wallet’s mission to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by 2026 is not inconceivable, and you’re invited to stake a claim in that pie.

Our ZRX price prediction for 2025 is a maximum price of $0.3506. In 2030, we expect the ZRX price to touch $1.97. ZRX is an Ethereum coin used to power the 0x protocol and is one of the more decent digital assets, making it possible to trade ERC-20 tokens such as ETH or ERC-20 across blockchain networks with no need for extra services. It is based on open-source smart contracts, and it supplies hundreds of web3 applications like wallets, DEXs, and tools to monitor investments. 0x plays a major role in DeFi with its record of over $200 billion in overall trading activity. The token’s circulating supply sits near 848M ZRX, and its market cap is approximately $158M, reflecting steady participation and continued market interest. By owning ZRX, users can decide which changes will occur on the protocol and how the protocol’s resources will be managed. In this ZRX price prediction, we look into current price changes and technical readings to estimate the direction of ZRX’s short-term prices in the years 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ZRX Token 0x Protocol Price $0.1890 Market Cap $159.22M Trading Volume (24-hour) $52.61M Circulating Supply 848.39M ZRX All-time High $2.53 Jan 09, 2018 All-time Low $0.104 Aug 16, 2017 ZRX Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.1890 Price Prediction $ 0.2433(28.07%) Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 9.35% (High) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2245 200-Day SMA $ 0.2474 14-Day RSI 46.83 (Neutral) ZRX Price Analysis: ZRX price analysis shows continued bullish trading near $0.1890. The token is up 7.72% in the past 24 hours, with volume rising by over 65%. ZRX short-term resistance is near the $0.19 and $0.20 range, with bulls attempting to maintain momentum. On November 5, 2025, ZRX price analysis shows an improving sentiment as it traded at $0.1890 after gaining 7.72% in the last 24hours. The increase in trading volume, recorded at $52.1 million, signaled growing market participation following weeks of sideways movement. Despite the upward shift, ZRX continued to face selling pressure at the $0.20 resistance level, which remained a key price barrier. ZRX short-term resistance is near the $0.19 and $0.20 range. ZRX Coin price analysis 1-day chart On the 1-day chart, ZRX is trading around $0.189, indicating a moderate recovery after recent sideways movement. The RSI is currently at 43.25, showing a shift toward buying pressure as it trends upward from oversold levels. This suggests that while momentum is improving, ZRX still needs stronger volume support to confirm a sustained bullish move. If buying interest increases, the token could attempt to challenge resistance near the $0.205–$0.21 range. The MACD now shows early signs of bullish momentum, with the MACD line at -0.0093 crossing above the signal line at -0.0108. Both lines remain in negative territory, indicating that overall market sentiment is still cautious. However, the narrowing gap between the lines suggests sellers are losing strength. A continued rise in the MACD histogram may confirm a more defined upward trend soon. ZRXUSDT Chart: TradingView ZRX 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, ZRX is trading around $0.1895, showing a modest recovery after bouncing off the recent local support zone near $0.180. The price movement reflects cautious buying interest, although the candle structure still suggests hesitation around the $0.19 level. The RSI 14 is currently at 52.67, indicating that bullish momentum has strengthened in the short term. This positioning above the midline suggests that buyers have regained control, and the bullish trend may continue if the RSI sustains above 50. However, the RSI is not yet in overbought territory, meaning there is room for further upside if volume increases. ZRXUSDT Chart: TradingView The MACD also supports the short-term bullish signal, with the MACD line at 0.0009 sitting slightly above the signal line at -0.0001. Both lines are positioned near the neutral level, indicating that momentum is still developing. The narrowing spread between the lines and the slight rise in the histogram suggest a slow but building shift toward upward pressure. ZRX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.2041 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.1991 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.1968 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.2024 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.2245 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.2390 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.2474 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.2081 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.2191 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.2320 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.2399 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.2438 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.2488 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.2714 SELL What to expect from the ZRX price analysis next? ZRX is approaching a key resistance zone, and a move higher than $0.205 and $ 0.21 might indicate a short-term bullish continuation. However, failure to break this level may lead to renewed selling pressure, drawing the price back toward the $0.183–$0.18 support range. Is ZRX a Good Investment? ZRX powers the 0x protocol, which facilitates trading of ERC20 tokens across multiple blockchains. It supports over $200 billion in trading volume and is utilized by numerous Web3 applications, making it a widely adopted infrastructure tool. The token also enables governance rights, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury use. Recent 0x Protocol News/Opinions Rubicon has announced a new integration with 0x Protocol, which allows its markets to be integrated into Matcha as well as the Coinbase app. The update also involves the adoption of the 0x Swap API by Rubicon, which will enable users to make swaps on the Rubicon platform. Rubicon 🤝 0x Rubicon is now integrated with @0xProject — bringing our markets to @matchaxyz and the @coinbase app. We’re also now utilizing the 0x API for swaps directly in Rubicon. 🥳 pic.twitter.com/BKR9V0KGSH — Rubicon (@rubicondefi) November 3, 2025 Why is 0x Protocol up today? ZRX is up today because recent bullish price predictions drew renewed retail interest, boosting buying pressure. Technical indicators also signaled a rebound from oversold levels, encouraging traders to enter long positions. Additionally, ongoing integrations in the 0x ecosystem reminded investors of the protocol’s growing multi-chain utility, supporting improved sentiment. Will the 0x Protocol price reach $5? For ZRX to reach $5, it would need to rise more than 2,500% from today’s price of $0.1873. This level is not impossible, but it would require a major expansion in 0x protocol adoption, sustained DeFi growth, and significantly higher trading volume flowing through 0x’s liquidity network. Will 0x Protocol reach $10? 0x would need to gain 4,096.86% to reach $10. According to our 0x prediction algorithm, the price of 0x will not reach $10. The highest expected price our algorithm estimates is $ 2 by 2031. Where Can You Buy 0x Protocol(ZRX)? ZRX is currently available to trade on well over 200 different exchange platforms, but the most popular ones include Coinbase Pro, Binance, CoinW, OKX, Bitrue, and MEXC.

In July 2025, the 0x Protocol price moved sideways between $0.21–$0.25, with low momentum and limited market interest. Throughout August 2025, a brief volume spike pushed 0x Protocol slightly higher, but the rally faded quickly without follow-through. In September 2025, the 0x Protocol price remained range-bound, hovering around $0.20–$0.23 as traders waited for a clearer direction. For October 2025, 0x Protocol saw a mild rebound with increased volatility, though resistance continued to cap upside moves. As of the Start of November 2025, 0x Protocol is trading around $0.19, showing cautious sentiment and still facing resistance near $0.205–$0.234.",Crypto Price Predictions|zrx,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-06 09:16:00

54090544,622436,1762420684,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54090544.jpeg,Bitcoin Finally Recovers — Why Bitcoin Hyper Becomes One of the Best Crypto to Buy,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-50b-market-cap-bitcoin-hyper-best-crypto-to-buy/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin briefly bounced back above $104K last night and has now entered a stabilization phase as the market added $50B to its market cap. Analyst Willy Woo believes we’re two weeks away from a bull rally if Bitcoin retains momentum and starts pushing. Bitcoin Hyper proposes a Bitcoin-settled Layer 2 with SVM speed, canonical bridging, and low-fee smart contracts for payments and DeFi. The tokenomics focus on development, marketing, and rewards; audits are planned prior to TGE, and a phased roadmap targets mainnet, then listings. Bitcoin’s relief rally just injected fresh energy into a choppy market. $BTC briefly reclaimed $104K in a brisk squeeze, reigniting risk appetite after weeks of chop, causing a $50B market pump. Analyst Willy Woo believes that $BTC may be two weeks away from a sustained rally if momentum continues. Not everybody subscribes to this idea, though. Shawn Young, Chief Analyst at MEXC, thinks Bitcoin’s bounce-back is nothing more than a ‘ technically-driven rebound … supported by spot inflows and leveraged short-covering’. Schroders’ lead analyst, Jiehan Chen, believes this isn’t a problem if Bitcoin maintains sufficient fuel in the tank to close the week above $103K . At the same time, Bitcoin’s core pain points — throughput, fees, and programmability — haven’t gone anywhere. A venue that can keep users anchored to $BTC’s trust and brand while enabling low-cost smart contracts is exactly what builders keep asking for. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to do this with a dedicated Layer 2 that uses a Solana-style execution environment for speed, a canonical bridge for secure $BTC transfers, and settlement back to Bitcoin for finality. That’s why the current bounce is more than vibes for $HYPER. Presales tend to price in narratives early, and an L2 that promises fast payments, cheap DeFi, and familiar dev tooling — while staying $BTC-centric — is exactly what the doc ordered. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — A Bitcoin Layer 2 With SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitching a simple trade: keep Bitcoin for settlement, but move execution to a low-latency Layer 2. It integrates the Solana Virtual Machine for high-throughput smart contracts and uses a decentralized canonical bridge to bring $BTC onto the L2 and back out when needed. For you, that means payments, DeFi, gaming, and dApps that feel fast while staying rooted to Bitcoin’s security model. The whitepaper outlines phased milestones, ranging from presale and staking to mainnet, bridge activation, and subsequently, exchange listings and DAO governance. The project roadmap below is useful for tracking delivery and catalysts through 2026. The presale is live with a displayed raise of over $26M and a current token price around $0.013225 at the time of writing. Buyers can use crypto or a card, and the site shows a countdown to the next price step — that’s the sort of transparency that helps you time entries in tiered sales. The project also runs presale staking with an estimated 45% p/a, credited at the protocol level and redeemable after the claim goes live. Staking isn’t a free lunch — rates are dynamic — but it provides a measurable incentive while the mainnet and listings line up. Utility is the bigger hook. If the L2 ships as specced, you’d get SVM-grade performance on a Bitcoin-settled rail. This means builders get Rust/SPL-style tooling and users get low fees for swaps, lending, payments, and gaming. The canonical bridge model makes $BTC the core asset that moves in and out. This addresses a common ask from Bitcoin holders who want to do more than just hold $BTC. Based on these specs, a realistic price prediction for $HYPER gives us a $1.50 price point by 2030, for a five-year ROI of 11,242% if you invest today. Bottom line: in a market that just added momentum back to Bitcoin, a $BTC-native L2 presale with visible traction and a speed-first design could be among the best crypto to buy now , especially with its imminent release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. If you’re interested in investing in Bitcoin infrastructure, visit the presale page and grab your $HYPER stack today. This is not financial advice. Always DYOR before investing.

The partnership aims to accelerate the adoption of tokenised real-world assets, cross-chain payments, and stablecoin verification across Asia. It also signals how traditional financial institutions are preparing to integrate blockchain infrastructure into global markets, as Chainlink expands its institutional reach amid new technology rollouts and tightening liquidity in its native LINK token. Chainlink to power SBI Digital Markets through CCIP SBI Digital Markets (SBIDM), the digital-asset arm of the group, will integrate Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). The system enables secure movement of tokenised assets across both public and private blockchains. Chainlink @chainlink · Follow We’re excited to announce that SBI Digital Markets (SBIDM)—the digital asset arm of Japan’s leading conglomerate SBI Group with ¥10+ trillion AUM—is adopting Chainlink as its exclusive infrastructure solution to power its digital assets platform. sbidm.com/press-releases… Through 7:34 AM · Nov 6, 2025 796 Reply Copy link Read 43 replies CCIP Private Transactions will allow SBIDM to execute compliant, privacy-preserving transactions without exposing confidential data such as transaction amounts or counterparty details. SBIDM is also assessing Chainlink’s Automated Compliance Engine (ACE), a framework designed to enforce policy-based compliance across multiple jurisdictions. Together, CCIP and ACE will underpin SBIDM’s plan to build a full-scale digital-asset ecosystem supporting issuance, settlement, and secondary trading of tokenised securities. This collaboration expands upon prior work between SBI Group and Chainlink, including participation in the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian alongside UBS Asset Management. The initiative successfully demonstrated how blockchain automation could simplify fund management processes and reduce administrative overheads. Chainlink expands enterprise infrastructure The partnership coincides with the launch of two major Chainlink technologies: Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) and Chainlink Confidential Compute (CC). CRE serves as a unifying orchestration layer connecting Chainlink’s existing services, including Oracles, CCIP, Proof of Reserve, and ACE. Meanwhile, Confidential Compute, expected to roll out in 2026, introduces privacy-centric smart contract execution for enterprise clients. The technology will facilitate confidential transactions in sectors such as tokenised funds, private credit markets, and Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlements, areas where institutional adoption is rapidly growing. Chainlink’s growing client base already includes global financial names such as SWIFT, Mastercard, Euroclear, UBS, and ANZ. This reinforces its role as a bridge between blockchain and conventional finance.

LINK has fallen 36.7% over the past month but recently showed signs of stabilisation, trading at $14.89 at press time, up 0.41% in 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap More than 80 million tokens, or about 11% of the circulating supply, were withdrawn this year, suggesting a growing preference for self-custody and long-term holding. Whale accumulation has reached a multi-year high, indicating reduced selling pressure and renewed confidence in LINK’s long-term fundamentals. Experts note that institutional partnerships and shrinking exchange supply could create favourable conditions for price recovery if market demand strengthens. Broader implications for institutional blockchain adoption For SBI Group, the partnership represents a strategic step toward building infrastructure capable of linking traditional markets with blockchain-based finance. It also aligns with Japan’s growing regulatory openness to digital assets, including plans for yen-backed stablecoins and tokenised securities. If executed at scale, SBI’s integration of Chainlink’s technology could mark a turning point for institutional blockchain use in Asia, paving the way for automated compliance, cross-border settlement, and tokenised capital markets. The partnership’s success will depend on how effectively the two firms can turn prototypes into production-grade systems across regulated environments. While market watchers remain cautious, Chainlink’s combination of institutional collaborations, expanding infrastructure, and declining token supply has created conditions for potential momentum. Whether these developments can sustain a long-term rally remains to be seen.

Data from Farside Investors showed that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another $137 million in redemptions on Wednesday, extending their losing streak to six consecutive sessions.

The sharpest single-day pullback came Tuesday, when investors withdrew $566 million, following heavy redemptions of $470 million, $488 million, and $191 million earlier in the week. The current stretch ranks as the second-largest selloff on record, behind only the late-February exodus, when funds lost more than $3.2 billion within a week. That downturn included single-day outflows of $1.11 billion on February 25 and $757.8 million the following day. Ether ETFs Mirror the Downtrend Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs also continued to post redemptions, recording $118.5 million in net outflows on Wednesday. Among issuers, BlackRock’s ETHA product saw the largest withdrawals at $146.6 million, while Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV remained flat. The six-day selloff in Ether ETFs has now totalled nearly $1.2 billion, although cumulative inflows since launch remain above $13.9 billion. The outflows reflect broader investor caution toward crypto-linked assets amid market volatility and a shift in risk appetite. In contrast, Solana (SOL) ETFs continue to attract capital. The products logged $9.7 million in net inflows on Wednesday — their seventh consecutive day of gains. Total inflows since launch now stand at $294 million, signalling continued institutional rotation into Solana-based vehicles. Bitcoin attempts modest rebound Bitcoin prices edged higher on Thursday, recovering some of the week’s sharp losses as traders bought into discounted levels. The cryptocurrency rose 1.7% to $103,744.2 on Thursday, paring back part of its earlier 20% decline from the October 2025 peak near $126,000. The correction earlier in the week had wiped out roughly $560 billion in market capitalisation, triggering one of the largest deleveraging events in Bitcoin’s history. Market sentiment deteriorated sharply, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropping to 24, signalling “Extreme Fear” and halting the bullish momentum built through much of the fourth quarter. Major altcoins tracked Bitcoin’s modest rebound but remained under pressure. Ether (ETH) rose 3.7% to $3,450.09, while Ripple (XRP) gained 5.1% to $2.3596. Solana (SOL) added 3.2%, trading at $162.021, and Cardano (ADA) and BNB climbed between 1.5% and 2%. Among meme tokens, Dogecoin (DOGE) advanced 1.2%, while the politically themed $TRUMP token surged nearly 16% on Wednesday, with no clear catalyst behind the move.

He says that Bitcoin dropping below $100,000 does not worry him because he cares more about its long-term value than its daily price changes. Speaking in an interview, Suarez said he remains unfazed by recent dips, stressing that Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals are far more important than daily price swings. Suarez says he is not worried about the price swings of Bitcoin Mayor Suarez said he started getting his salary when the cost of one Bitcoin was $30,000, so he didn’t care if the price dropped below $100,000. He explained that the growth over time is what he really cares about because his paycheck was once worth over 400% when the price of Bitcoin reached $120,000. The Mayor has a lot of confidence in Bitcoin because it will always have a limited supply , and people can trust its value over time. He explained that the token is very different from money, as governments can always print more or change rules that affect its worth without people noticing. Suarez also noted that Miami can leverage the shift in the financial economy with Bitcoin to strengthen its position and attract more investment. He says this is how cities grow and how their people invest in their future. Under Suarez’s leadership, Miami became one of the most crypto-friendly cities in America. The bankruptcy of the Miami-headquartered FTX crypto exchange in November 2022 has, however, tainted the reputation of the crypto industry in the city. Still, the city is quietly making a comeback to re-emerge as one of the leading crypto hubs in the U.S. Suarez was always pro-Bitcoin during his time as mayor Mayor Suarez became the first U.S. politician to receive a full salary in cryptocurrency back in 2021. He wanted to show that people could own Bitcoin for everyday use, not just as an investment, so he bought his salary when the cost of one coin was $30,000. At the time, it was unusual for a public official to connect income to digital money, as people were not accustomed to it. Bitcoin was also trading at $64,000, so the media remained confused, but the Mayor said he was ready to set an example for the rest of the city. Suarez has been a strong supporter of Bitcoin since 2020, stating that the token will create more opportunities for spending, investing, and saving with digital currency. Suarez said Miami could stand out from other big cities if it integrates BTC into city operations like paying workers and collecting taxes. However, it’s not just Suarez and politicians who accept salaries in Bitcoin; celebrities and professional athletes are in the same boat. NFL star Odell Beckham Jr converted his 2021 salary from the Los Angeles Rams to BTA through a Cash App deal when the price of one coin was at $60,000. Many people questioned his decision, saying the token could crash suddenly, but its value continued to grow over time, and his salary almost doubled when Bitcoin reached $120,000. NFL player Russell Okung also got half of his $13 million salary with the Carolina Panthers in Bitcoin , and Saquon Barkley took $10 million of his endorsement deals in BTC. Increasingly, more people are incorporating Bitcoin into their daily lives, a trend that began when politicians, celebrities, and athletes set a public example for their fans and supporters. Suarez’s optimism aligns with a nationwide trend towards pro-crypto policies. Speaking at 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the first day of the two-day America Business Forum in Miami, Florida, President Donald J. Trump urged the United States to embrace cryptocurrency and sketched an ambitious vision for U.S. leadership. “We are here … to embrace a vital industry here in Miami,” he said. Trump cast his administration as reversing hostility in Washington: “I’ve also signed historic executive orders to end the federal government’s war on crypto. Crypto was under siege.

The price of BTC fell below $100,000, while altcoins also experienced double-digit declines. However, while Bitcoin and altcoins experienced a slight recovery last night, cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment announced the most popular altcoins in the cryptocurrency world in its latest post. Accordingly, Santiment said that investors showed great interest in altcoins named Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple USD (RLUSD), Chainlink (LINK) and NewYorkCoin (NYC). Bitcoin leads the trending cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours, followed surprisingly by NewYorkCoin, RLUSD, ETH, SOL, and LINK. The cryptocurrencies that have attracted the most attention in the crypto industry and the reasons are listed as follows: Bitcoin: BTC's price cycles are trending due to discussions surrounding price predictions, whale selling, and buying. This reflects strong interest in Bitcoin as a long-term investment, its use in cryptocurrency trading, and increased market volatility. NewYorkCoin: It is on the agenda due to the 2025 New York Mayoral elections won by Zohran Mamdani. Ripple USD: Ripple is trending due to its partnerships with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini. RLUSD facilitates credit card transactions and uses XRP for transaction fees through its partnership with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini. This trend highlights RLUSD's role in next-generation fiat payments and its growing importance within the Ripple ecosystem. Ethereum: ETH's recent price drop, ETF outflows of around $219 million, is trending due to comparisons with Bitcoin and other altcoins. Solana: It is trending due to its frequent inclusion in numerous social media posts related to various new tokens and projects on the SOL blockchain. Chainlink: It's been trending lately for its partnerships. Discussions center on its partnerships with major financial institutions like S&P Dow Jones and its involvement in initiatives like the S&P Digital Markets 50 Index. *This is not investment advice.

And Why is $TAP Immune?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/live-crypto-news-today-november-5-why-is-crypto-crashing-again-and-why-is-tap-immune,"Markets are selling first and asking questions later as liquidity rushes for the exits. Unless an altcoin is either generating revenue or solves a real problem, investors are not interested. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $106,000 , and presales have become the last safe haven for investors. BTC investors have clearly flipped defensive, and large vehicles are bleeding outflows. Yet amid all this chaos, Digitap ($TAP) is up 114% since opening its presale and has raised $1.3 million, making it a leading crypto presale in November. Many traders are talking about sub-$100K scenarios in November, and sentiment has slid into the extreme fear zone. All the while, Digitap’s structured pricing arguably makes it the best crypto to buy now for investors who want to avoid volatility. Here is what investors need to know. Crypto News Today: Balancer Exploit & ETF Outflows Balancer’s exploit has swelled to over $116 million in outflows , making investors very nervous. Balancer has operated for years and received dozens of security audits, and this exploit highlights how high the risk premium remains in DeFi. This exploit affects Berachain, and a hard fork is currently in progress to try to thwart hackers stealing any more funds—the situation remains ongoing. Another large source of sell pressure is coming from ETFs, with $360 million in net outflows this week, primarily from US products . Redemptions roll in from institutional investors when Powell made it clear that a December rate cut is “not a foregone conclusion.” The Fear & Greed Index has flipped to fear, and while things might look scary, this is one of the best times to identify the best crypto to buy now, with markets offering discounts and making it obvious where capital is accumulating. Relative strength should always be observed when fear is high, and Digitap, despite being a crypto presale, is witnessing massive inflows, making the native token $TAP easily one of the best cryptos to buy now. Digitap—How this Banking Token Became a Leading Crypto Presale This Year When markets get the jitters, utility tokens become the winners. Investors naturally rotate from speculative vehicles to assets with real adoption and underlying demand. And despite being a crypto presale, Digitap’s omni-banking services are already live with thousands of sign-ups for the Visa card daily. Digitap operates like a rail-agnostic router with a familiar neobank interface. Rail-agnostic just means that Digitap can use multiple rails, including public blockchains and banking rails such as SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, and Faster Payments. Anyone can download the app on iOS and Android and get a Visa card, virtual or physical, today. The big breakthrough with Digitap is that all balances, including crypto, fiat, and stablecoins, reside on a single interface. Thanks to the crypto rails, it can perform cross-border transactions significantly faster than market incumbents like Western Union. This is what the new generation of finance looks like. The presale allows investors to avoid volatility, and judging by the $1.3 million raised, investors are jumping at this opportunity. $TAP could easily become a market leader in the PayFi space, explaining why it continues to rank highly among the best cryptos to buy now. Why Whales Buy During Fear Hawkish guidance from Powell, huge ETF redemptions, and security shocks are all feeding the current fear. But ironically, this could mark the best time to accumulate cryptos. Digitap’s live distribution, rail-agnostic routing, and presale structure are a winning formula, making it immune and arguably the best crypto to buy now, given its huge potential upside as crypto rails start to disrupt global payment corridors. Supply is limited to 2 billion, and 50% of platform revenue will be used for buybacks and burns, creating a powerful deflationary flywheel. Ranked against the best cryptos to buy now, $TAP continues to shine given its low price of $0.0268 today and its final listing price of $0.14, meaning anyone who buys today can potentially net 4X returns by the time it lists. Whales are buying the fear. Investors need to ask themselves if they will do the same.

The RSI around 30 suggests the token is approaching oversold conditions, which could prompt a short-term relief bounce. However, upside potential remains limited unless ACH can reclaim resistance at $0.0124 and then $0.0141. Failure to hold support around $0.0100 risks further decline toward $0.0090. While a minor rebound is possible, overall market structure remains weak, and a broader trend reversal will require stronger volume and sustained buying interest. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView Alchemy Pay (ACH) continues to trade in a downward pattern on the 4-hour chart, consistently forming lower highs and lower lows. The price is trading below the 20-period moving average and near the lower Bollinger Band, signaling persistent selling pressure.

Immediate resistance lies at $0.0112 and stronger resistance at $0.0124. If the current support near $0.0100 fails, ACH may decline toward $0.0092 before any recovery attempt.

Rain’s public Beta is now available. Rain, a decentralized prediction markets protocol, launches its beta platform, introducing the first fully decentralized prediction marketplace where both public and, for the first time ever, private markets can be created and explored at scale. The platform allows anyone to create customized prediction markets for a broad range of global events and niche scenarios, without needing approval from a centralized gatekeeper. As prediction markets become increasingly prevalent, popular centralized models like Polymarket often face limitations in market scope, accessibility, and flexibility. Furthermore, centralized marketplaces suffer from a lack of transparency, trust, and liquidity, as they rely on governance and manual settlement that introduce delays. In many ways, this structure resembles Netflix’s curated model, where participation is controlled and content is filtered, compared to YouTube, which is open and permissionless, allowing anyone to upload content and participate. Rain addresses these challenges with an AI-based oracle engineered for verifying public event outcomes, supported by a dispute mechanism that ensures results are accurate, transparent, and resistant to manipulation. This AI oracle employs a consensus-driven approach using multiple independent AI models that collect and analyze diverse information to automatically determine outcomes. If participants dispute the outcome, an AI “judge” reviews it and issues an initial ruling. If the ruling is challenged, the dispute escalates to decentralized human oracles who deliver a final, binding decision. In private markets, creators are responsible for resolving outcomes, but a similar dispute and escalation process applies. The native $RAIN token supports DAO governance and transparency. While prediction markets run on USDT, holding the token is required to participate in markets and trade options, a design that strengthens the ecosystem’s long-term sustainability. Rain’s tokenomics combine a deflationary buy-and-burn model, allocating 2.5 percent of markets’ trading volume to the burn, with an inflationary issuance that supports growth and rewards contributors, aiming to align incentives while keeping the economics balanced. “Our beta launch is an exciting next step in Rain’s journey to becoming the most accessible decentralized prediction markets protocol available today,” says Muhammad Wasif, CTO of Rain. We’ve built a platform where anyone can create a market for anything. What really sets us apart is the introduction of private markets, unlocking new possibilities for niche and community-specific predictions. About Rain: Rain introduces an innovative protocol that lets anyone create and trade custom options on almost anything. By leveraging blockchain technology, Rain ensures transparency, reduces counterparty risks, and opens global access without geographic restrictions.

However, in today’s time, a new name is slowly making a name in the cryptoverse that is expected to provide the same performance, known as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At a price of only $0.035, this new DeFi giant is predicted to be the best cryptocurrency coin to buy in the upcoming bull run. Mutuum Finance is working on a decentralized network that is able to offer lending services, yield farming, as well as liquidity management in one smooth operation that has not been offered even in the early days of Solana. Today, presale Stage 6 of MUTM is already sold out to the tune of 85% of, showing that many individuals are already keen to invest in the next crypto to hit $1. MUTM is said to be the best cryptocurrency coin to buy, given its innovation and long-term vision for real-world DeFi adoption. Solana (SOL) Sets Sights on Trendline Bounce as Buyers’ Interest Solana (SOL) is in a stage of consolidation post the experience of volatility in recent weeks, as they are presently holding levels of support, as well as suggesting that buyers are conditionally entering the market once again. Technical analysis indicates that a test of the trend line is expected in the near term for SOL, possibly a reversal to levels of $205-$210, a critical point of resistance. Institutional funds entering the Solana network as well as the involvement of developers in the network is one factor that gives a positive outlook as the adoption of the network continues to accelerate. Despite the SOL trend-line indicating a pace that can help investors gain some returns, these investors are already looking towards DeFi cryptos that possess high growth prospects. A new name that has emerged with serious consideration is that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is increasing in prominence in the presale process as the next crypto to hit $1 and the best cryptocurrency coin to buy before the next major bull cycle begins. MUTM Presale Sees Record-Breaking Popularity Mutuum Finance is one of the leading cryptos in the year 2025 as evident from the presales that are happening in phases, which gained the interest of the international community. It is in Phase 6 as of now, where MUTM is priced at $0.035, marking the final phase before increasing by another 20% in Phase 7 to touch $0.04. To make involvement even simpler, the latest innovation brought in by Mutuum Finance is that the investors can purchase MUTM directly through Credit & Debit Cards on the official site of the firm itself. This will bypass any technological problem that had been a limiting factor in the adoption of DeFi in the past. Sepolia Testnet Rollout A crucial development milestone is set to happen in Q4 of 2025 with the launch of the lending/borrowing protocol by Mutuum Finance on the Sepolia testnet. This will be a lending/borrowing protocol supporting ETH & USDT, which will come with the facility of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as the auto-liquidator bot. More assets will be added later. This is a testament to the commitment of Mutuum Finance towards innovation, scalability, as well as ensuring DeFi utility. By implementing a functional blockchain-based liquidity solution, Mutuum Finance comes across as more than a presale token, it demonstrates DeFi utility and continues proving itself as the next crypto to hit $1. Strategic Buybacks & Community Incentives Fuel Growth Token buyback-redistribute system of Mutuum Finance kicks in, as this particular system is expected to increase the value of MUTM over time. This shall involve the use of fees charged by the platforms in implementing a buying of MUTM tokens in the market as well as redistributing them to individuals who hold mtToken stakes. To further encourage people to participate, Mutuum Finance has introduced a leaderboard system where investors will be encouraged based on their daily deposits, valid for a total of 24 hours. This will lapse at 00:00 UTC, where the contributing user of the day shall win a donation of $500 in MUTM. This breeds a form of competition among the community members as well as a key aim of fostering a reward-driven DeFi community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised a total of $18.45M from over 17,720 individuals, with Phase 6 sold out at 85% of the price of $0.035. This is an opportunity for early buyers to purchase the token before the next price hike of 20%. Investors looking for the best cryptocurrency coin to buy and the next crypto to hit $1 should not overlook Mutuum Finance, which is quickly becoming 2025’s standout DeFi success.

Management said instructions issued from the global headquarters were not being followed, so the chipmaker told customers on October 29 that shipments to the facility were halted, according to Bloomberg, a decision that exposed internal conflict inside the chipmaker at a time when the global semiconductor supply chain is already under stress. Nexperia supplies power and control chips used in vehicles made by companies including Volkswagen and BMW. Management said instructions issued from the global headquarters were not being followed. The company said: “We cannot oversee if and when products from our facility in China will be delivered. Given the missing transparency and oversight over the manufacturing processes we cannot guarantee the intellectual property, technology, authenticity and quality standards for products delivered from the Nexperia facility in China as of Oct. 13.” The halt adds pressure to automakers who rely on steady chip supply to avoid production delays. China factory faces allegations Nexperia said the refusal to pay for the wafers was not a one‑time situation. The company reported that corporate seals belonging to the China entities were taken and used without valid approval. According to the company, unauthorized letters with incorrect information were sent to customers, subcontractors, third‑party suppliers and employees. Nexperia also said the China unit established unauthorized bank accounts and directed customers to make payments to these accounts instead of approved corporate channels. This internal conflict is taking place while governments are also involved. The Dutch government assumed veto powers over the company in September. Dutch authorities said there were concerns that parent Wingtech was restricting Nexperia’s operations and threatening the security of chip supplies. Wingtech’s founder, Zhang Xuezheng, was suspended as Nexperia’s chief executive officer by an Amsterdam court on October 7. Wingtech denied the allegations and said it wants Zhang reinstated. In response to the Dutch state’s move, China imposed restrictions on exports of Nexperia products from the company’s Guangdong plant. That factory accounts for about half of Nexperia’s production volumes before the conflict. With exports restricted there, Nexperia had already been under strain. The halt of wafer supply adds another layer of disruption to manufacturing plans. Dutch and Chinese governments trade pressure China’s Ministry of Commerce criticized the Netherlands this week, saying the Dutch government has not taken enough action to resolve the dispute. China said on November 1 it would grant exemptions for exports of Nexperia products but asked the Netherlands to “stop interfering” in the company’s internal affairs and work toward resolving the situation. China said: “The Netherlands continues to act unilaterally without taking concrete steps to resolve the issue, which will inevitably exacerbate the adverse impact on the global semiconductor supply chain.” Nexperia said it appreciates the commitment toward restoring supply flows but said it has not yet received necessary details about how and when export curbs will be lifted. The company said it wants to understand the conditions, criteria and procedures required before operations can return to normal. The tension has already affected carmakers. Volkswagen , Europe’s largest automaker, said it is reviewing other sourcing options to secure chips. The company said production is covered through the current week, but uncertainty remains.

Increased spot market volumes drove the recent recovery above $103,000. BTC is returning to spot trading, with volumes picking up on Binance in November. After a series of liquidations, derivative trading for BTC became more cautious. At the same time, inflows of stablecoins and BTC from new wallets pointed to a return of spot market activity. Following another day of long liquidations and a brief dip to the $100,000 range, BTC recovered once again. On Thursday, the leading coin traded at $103,357, as the market bounced from its lows. Binance marks inflows of spot BTC and stablecoins In October, Binance saw increased inflows of BTC from newly created wallets. Following a temporary low in September, inflows increased for the past month, setting up conditions for a more active spot market. Binance accumulated more spot BTC in October, flowing in from new wallets. The centralized exchange also saw increased spot volumes in early November. | Source: CryptoQuant . Over 25.9K BTC flowed into Binance in October, coming from newly created wallets. In 2025, spot inflows to Binance coincided with more dramatic price moves for BTC. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, spot markets also offered a safer toolset for trading BTC, while the price remained unpredictable. While the month saw activity from older whales, moving funds to Binance often uses intermediary addresses. However, the coins may be coming from older reserves. Binance also carries record reserves of Tether’s USDT. Over $41.7B in stablecoins have been deposited to the exchange, signaling potential preparation for trading or buying. USDC reserves are also near an all-time peak, adding to the available liquidity. Binance traded over 50,000 BTC in early November Binance’s spot markets saw a turnover of 50,500 BTC in early November, the highest activity level since the October 10 crash. This volume is significantly higher than the monthly average, and has been reflected in the market price of BTC. Spot market activity shows traders can still revive BTC based on simple spot trading. The surge in spot volume may signal trader repositioning, potentially returning to new buying. The market has stored liquidity and is still in a wait and see mode. The lack of a strong breakout for now prevents traders and whales from big spot purchases. Based on the spot activity bubble map , orders are growing larger, but the trading action does not suggest a clear bullish direction. The market is still trading at historically neutral levels. On the spot markets, selling pressure is easing, but the taker volume has not returned to buying. In November, taker sell orders were still dominant, revealing the still cautious trading mode and profit-taking as a precaution to a bear market. Sentiment has now shifted and BTC is no longer trading with ‘extreme fear’. The Bitcoin fear and greed index recovered to 27 points following the latest hike to $103,000.

Bitcoin is trading above $103k after dropping below $100k on Tuesday, while Ether is close to the $3,400 region. Ripple’s XRP is also trading above $2.3 after temporarily dropping to the $2 psychological level earlier this week. With market conditions improving, XRP could rally higher in the near term. u,Ripple raises $500m in latest funding round, partners with Mastercard XRP is the best performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, adding nearly 5% to its value in the last 24 hours. The positive performance comes following two crucial news within the Ripple ecosystem. On Tuesday, Ripple announced that it had raised $500 million from major institutional investors, including Fortress Investment and Citadel Securities. This latest development pushed the company’s valuation to $40 billion. The funding round also saw participation from Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace. Ripple has been expanding its offerings in the crypto space in recent months. It has also acquired several companies to enable it to expand its services, most recently the crypto wallet firm Palisade. In a statement, Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, said, We started in 2012 with one use case — payments — and have expanded that success into custody, stablecoins, prime brokerage, and corporate treasury, leveraging digital assets like XRP. Today, Ripple stands as the partner for institutions looking to access crypto and blockchain. In addition to the funding round, Ripple also announced its partnership with Mastercard, WebBank, and crypto exchange Gemini to test using its RLUSD stablecoin to settle fiat credit card transactions over a public blockchain. The partnership is designed to show how regulated stablecoins can streamline traditional financial infrastructure without sacrificing compliance or safety. Ripple added that WebBank, the issuer of the Gemini Credit Card, will explore settling Mastercard transactions using RLUSD on the XRPL. XRP eyes $2.5 as bullish momentum returns The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and inefficient, with the coin rallying to gain efficiency in the near term. The technical indicators are improving after experiencing oversold conditions earlier this week. The RSI of 46 is near the neutral 50, indicating that the bearish momentum is fading. The MACD lines are also close to the bullish crossover, with buyers currently in control of the market. If the recovery continues, XRP could rally towards the first major resistance level at $2.53 over the next few hours or days. An extended rally would allow XRP to reclaim the weekly low of $2.7. However, if the market correction resumes, XRP could retest the Tuesday low of $2.06 over the coming hours or days.

Ripple is not aiming for a listing mainly due to the fact that the company does not need to raise external capital and can fund its growth independently. According to Long, the company is “in a fortunate position” and remains “well capitalised,” allowing it to support both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions without going public. When asked about the company’s recent financial performance, Long did not disclose any revenue figures, but she did say that Ripple’s customer base has doubled quarter‑over‑quarter. She attributed this growth to a surge in appetite for stablecoin‑based payments and the regulatory clarity emerging in the US and abroad, which she said has “really opened up the market” and supported adoption of Ripple’s products, including its RLUSD stablecoin. Long’s comments come just a day after Ripple disclosed it had raised $500 million in a strategic funding round led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities, alongside participation from Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace, pushing its valuation to $40 billion. Ripple’s focus on expanding its suite of products Several major crypto firms have gone public in 2025, and their successful listings have brought renewed attention from Wall Street. Stablecoin issuer Circle pulled off one of the biggest listings of the year, raising over $1.1 billion and soaring to a valuation above $23 billion just days after going public. Meanwhile, firms like Bullish , Gemini , and Figure Technologies have also drawn the attention of institutional investors, helping reopen the IPO window for crypto companies after years of subdued activity. Ripple, however, is focused more on scaling its infrastructure, especially around the RLUSD stablecoin, which it launched last year. Since RLUSD’s debut, Ripple has ramped up its efforts to promote adoption by forging key partnerships across the payments and credit ecosystem. Just recently, Ripple partnered with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini in a pilot program to test RLUSD for credit card settlement. Ripple’s efforts are already bearing fruit, as RLUSD’s circulation has now surpassed a $1 billion market cap, less than a year since launch, making it one of the fastest-growing US dollar stablecoins. Earlier this month, Ripple acquired the digital asset custody provider Palisade, which will allow it to integrate Palisade’s secure multiparty computation, zero trust architecture, and multichain support into its institutional platform to offer end-to-end digital asset storage, payments, and treasury solutions under one unified system.

Australian rapper and entrepreneur Iggy Azalea has joined a new Solana-based memecoin launchpad called Thrust as a creative director and partner. Thrust officially launched on Wednesday as a curated platform for verified creators and public figures who would like to venture into Web3 and digital currencies. Iggy Azalea joins Thrust to help celebrities launch memecoins Azalea, who first launched her MOTHER token in 2024, said her interest in Thrust came along with her desire to create a legitimate and sustainable ecosystem for fans and creators. She also reportedly holds equity in the company. Speaking at the Blockchain Futuristic Conference in Florida on Wednesday, she surmised that “the term token is used loosely,” when celebrities launch digital coins. “It’s not just that I aesthetically decide what things look like for Thrust as a company,” she said in an interview. “I’m a large part of the concepts when we’re white-gloving these celebrities onboard. I guess it’s almost like being a godmother.” According to Thrust co-founder and CEO Jake Antifaev, the platform directly responds to the lack of legitimacy plaguing celebrity-backed crypto projects. “Celebrity memecoins have gotten a bad rap because they were never built on legitimacy or accountability. Culture Tokens is our way of changing that. Every launch on Thrust is vetted, contracted, and transparent, so both creators and fans know exactly what they’re getting into,” he said. The company’s developers insist Thrust will address systemic problems in the memecoin market through the platform’s secure onboarding experience that connects users to specific fandoms through verified creators. Each token launched on Thrust will reportedly undergo a due diligence process to prevent the kind of pump-and-dump schemes that have tarnished the industry’s image, and according to Azalea, celebrities will have zero ownership of the token’s allocation. Azalea joined by a Twitch streamer in crypto business Azalea’s partnership with Thrust also entailed the signing of her friend and fellow online personality streamer Rangesh “N3on” Muthama, who co-owns her digital casino venture, MOTHERLAND. Muthama will become a partner in the platform, helping to develop community engagement strategies and creator onboarding initiatives. Azalea’s MOTHERLAND casino, launched earlier this year, uses the MOTHER token as its gaming and reward system. However, the rapper recently admitted that she had to rethink the project’s direction. “Not long ago, I was leaning into an online casino that’s built around my MOTHER token,” she said. “But I realized it can’t onboard other people into this chaos while creating value to pay for things, throw events, and do stuff.” When asked about how she came to launch her token, the rapper admitted that she was brought into the market by “fire,” and she is mostly assisted by her foster “smart and cool” 24-year-old brother, Mathias. “I’ve been kinda hellbent to see the demise of what I think is essentially rugpulls based on speculation. We see this in a lot of memecoins, sometimes they aren’t real projects. It’s particularly more rampant with celebrity launches … What if somebody delivered something that is what you guys wanted,” she said in the fireside chat, alluding to why she and her token are now part of Thrust. Celebrity crypto involvement to change with Thrust The debut of Thrust comes at a time when the crypto community is signaling high skepticism towards celebrity-backed tokens, many of which have failed or faced allegations of pump-and-dump manipulation. As reported by Cryptopolitan over the past two years, tokens promoted by popular names like Caitlyn Jenner, Jason Derulo, Cardi B, Ye, and Hailey Welch have steeply declined in valuation after hype cycles that barely last a week. Thrust is reportedly preparing another memecoin collaboration with actress Megan Fox, with a release targeted for late November 2025.

Pony.ai tumbled more than 12% and WeRide slid close to 13% right after trading began. This sharp fall came even though both self-driving firms raised serious money; HK$6.71 billion (about $860 million) for Pony.ai, and HK$2.39 billion for WeRide. Both companies are already listed in the U.S., but they chased a dual listing to pull in more capital, expand in Asia, and reduce risk as U.S. regulators tighten their grip on Chinese tech. It didn’t help. Before the Hong Kong debut, shares were already falling in New York. On Wednesday, WeRide dropped 5.2% and Pony.ai fell 2%. That’s not what you want before you open trading in a second market. The damage isn’t just market-related. There’s pressure from all directions. The companies are running behind major players like Baidu’s Apollo Go in China and Waymo in the U.S. Both firms are focused on building Level 4 autonomous driving systems, meaning the vehicle can operate without human input in some areas. That’s where this new cash is supposed to go. Pony.ai and WeRide face pressure from regulators, rivals, and each other James Peng, the CEO of Pony.ai , said the funds will be used to grow infrastructure, including charging and parking systems designed for self-driving vehicles, as well as for pushing more into AI development. Over at WeRide, CEO Tony Xu Han told CNBC they’ll invest in AI capability and data center expansion to support their tech. Both bosses claim that safety is still the top goal, especially as they start operating robotaxis in a few Chinese cities. They aren’t stopping in China either. Both are trying to enter new territories like Singapore, Europe, and parts of the Middle East, but the process is slow. They haven’t gotten full approval to run robotaxis in those places yet. On top of that, there’s a fight brewing between the two rivals. WeRide CFO Li Xuan recently accused Pony.ai of misleading investors by underreporting how many cities WeRide currently operates in. The claim hit right before the IPO and stirred up even more controversy. They’re also eyeing a potential link-up with Uber in the U.S., hoping to run robotaxis on the ride-hailing app once they get the green light from regulators. But that approval may never come. Earlier this year, U.S. officials finalized a rule that blocks Chinese tech from being used in connected vehicles, which includes self-driving cars. That puts both companies at a disadvantage, no matter how polished their tech might be. Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, told CNBC that with global uncertainty and pressure in the U.S., going public in Hong Kong is a way to lower the risks and keep raising cash. He said, “A dual listing is a lot about risk mitigation,” and added that Pony.ai and WeRide need serious capital and support from outside the U.S. to stay in the game. Hong Kong plays a bigger role in funding China’s autonomous future The dual listings also reflect a wider shift among Chinese tech firms. Hong Kong’s stock exchange gave the go-ahead in mid-October, and the move fits a rising pattern. In May, CATL, a major battery firm, pulled off a massive $5.2 billion secondary listing, still the biggest IPO in the world this year. Rolf Bulk, an equity analyst at New Street Research, said dual listings like these help shape Hong Kong as the go-to place for Asia’s tech players. But he also made it clear it won’t help these companies win over Western regulators. “If anything, gaining approval in Western markets may be more challenging with a HK secondary listing,” he said . Still, Le believes Pony.ai and WeRide remain in the global race. He said, “WeRide has diversified their service portfolio a bit more but they both see Uber and the Middle East as two viable partners in their ability to get more pilots launched outside of China.” The issue now is whether they can keep up with the rapid pace of AI evolution, with Le adding, “Investors should pay special attention to how their technology evolves with AI and other new tools becoming more mainstream.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Business|Apollo Go|Baidu|CNY|HKD|Pony AI|USD|Waymo|WeRide,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-06 09:53:39

The billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder argues that the Fed’s shift from balance sheet reduction to expansion represents a classic late-stage debt cycle dynamic that could drive gold and Bitcoin dramatically higher before an inevitable collapse. The Fed announced that it would end quantitative tightening, effective December 1, 2025, transitioning to balance sheet maintenance at $6.5 trillion, while redirecting agency security income into Treasury bills rather than mortgage-backed securities. Dalio views this as more than a “ technical maneuver ,” as officials describe it, particularly as the shift occurs alongside large fiscal deficits and strong private credit creation. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 earnings yield of 4.4% barely exceeds the 10-year Treasury yield of 4%, leaving equity risk premiums at a razor-thin 0.4%. https://t.co/BytVjrzXkL — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) November 5, 2025 Historic Reversal: From Depression Stimulus to Bubble Fuel Dalio emphasizes that previous quantitative easing deployments occurred under fundamentally different conditions, characterized by economic contractions, falling asset valuations, low inflation, and wide credit spreads. Meanwhile, the current environment features the opposite. Stocks are hitting new highs, the economy is growing at a rate of 2% annually, unemployment is at just 4.3%, and inflation is running above the Fed’s 2% target, at over 3%. Source: X/@RayDalio “ This time the easing will be into a bubble rather than into a bust ,” Dalio warned, noting that AI stocks already register as bubble territory according to his proprietary indicators. The combination of massive fiscal deficits, shortened Treasury maturities to compensate for weak long-term bond demand, and central bank balance sheet expansion represents what he describes as “ classic Big Debt Cycle late cycle dynamics. “ Market analysts have shared these concerns. Cristian Chifoi noted that while narratives surrounding QE and QT dominate discussions, actual liquidity began flooding markets between October and December 2022, when the tightening effectively ended, with the Reverse Repo Program serving as the gateway. The FED will end QT in December So everyone prepared for the REAL liquidity injections to start in December right? While we are late in the cycle and everyone thinks the 4y cycle is over But QE or QT were always narratives, liquidity was starting to flood markets since… https://t.co/TQmID4D3vu pic.twitter.com/odHw9vnZ0b — Cristian Chifoi (@ChifoiCristian) October 29, 2025 Ted Pillows also warned that crypto markets, historically sensitive to liquidity conditions, may not bottom until actual quantitative easing begins rather than merely stopping tightening. He cited the 40% decline in altcoins that followed the Fed’s 2019 QT pause before fresh stimulus arrived. Gold Surges as Liquidity Mechanics Shift Gold has responded dramatically to the policy shift, recovering above $4,000 per ounce after initial volatility following the Fed announcement. The World Gold Council reported that global demand in Q3 2025 increased 3% year-over-year to 1,313 tons, with investment demand reaching the highest quarterly total on record as prices achieved 13 new all-time highs during the quarter. Source: World Gold Council Dalio explained the mechanics driving gold’s appeal: with zero yield and gold trading at approximately $4,025 while 10-year Treasuries offer 4%, investors must expect gold price appreciation exceeding 4% annually to prefer the metal over bonds. “ The higher the inflation rate, the more gold will go up because most of inflation is due to the value and buying power of other currencies going down due to their increased supply, while there isn’t much increased supply of gold ,” he wrote. Central bank purchasing has accelerated 10% year-over-year, with Poland announcing expanded programs and Brazil resuming purchases for the first time since July 2021. However, in times of financial uncertainty and crisis, Bitcoin has outperformed Gold and all other risk assets. The Melt-Up Before the Crash Dalio’s most ominous warning centers on predicting that increased Fed balance sheet expansion, combined with interest rate cuts amid large fiscal deficits, would constitute “ classic monetary and fiscal interaction of the Fed and the Treasury to monetize government debt. “ This dynamic should push real interest rates down, compress risk premiums, expand price-to-earnings multiples, and especially boost long-duration assets, such as technology and AI stocks, alongside inflation hedges, including gold and inflation-indexed bonds. “ It would be reasonable to expect that, similar to late 1999 or 2010-2011, there would be a strong liquidity melt-up that will eventually become too risky and will have to be restrained ,” Dalio wrote. “ During that melt-up and just before the tightening that is enough to rein in inflation that will pop the bubble is classically the ideal time to sell ,” he concluded.

The Layer-3 solution provides plug-and-play perps infrastructure with fast execution, deep liquidity, and up to 60× leverage. Ionex uses Orbs to power its MetaPerp module, merging spot and perps markets into one seamless decentralized hub. Ionex exchange, developed by Defizoo, has announced the integration of Perpetual Hub Ultra, a technology stack built by Orbs, to enable perpetual futures trading across the Plasma blockchain. The collaboration allows Orb’s Layer 3 technology to operate as a turnkey solution for decentralized exchanges that seek to deploy high-performing perpetuals with minimal complexity. With the new integration, Ionex users can gain access to a full-featured perpetual trading platform. The platform offers complete deep liquidity, customizable leverage, and rapid execution, and is powered by Orbs’ modular, fully managed perps infrastructure. Orbs’ Perpetual Hub Ultra brings CeFi speed to decentralized trading Perpetual Hub Ultra was built in collaboration with Symm.io using Orb’s L3 architecture to support features such as hedging, liquidations, oracles, and a professional-grade front-end. Ionex revealed that the integration supports a modular architecture that can allow any DEX to add derivatives trading functionality without a wide infrastructure development. Source: Press release; Orbs perpetual hub collaborating with Ionex Ran Hammer, Vice President of Business Development at Orbs, said that the Perpetual Hub Ultra offers ‘full white-label’ functionality for DEX operators. He added that the Orbs team is enabling a new standard for decentralized markets that rival centralized trading in both speed and efficiency. The latest integration is intended to allow institutional-grade derivatives trading within a decentralized framework. The latest integration setup allows liquidity distribution from both on-chain and off-chain sources, such as major centralized exchanges, such as Binance, that eliminate the need for specialized chains or bespoke integrations. The collaboration aligns with the ongoing trend of intent-based trading models in DeFi, which was initially concentrated in spot markets. The integration offers decentralized platforms on the Plasma blockchain to compete with centralized systems in flexibility, performance, and UX. Orbs noted that the L3 implementation allows for more established execution logic than what is possible with standard smart contracts, such as higher performance transaction processing and off-chain order matching. Perpetual Hub Ultra will act as the middleware stack sitting between decentralized applications and the primary blockchains, such as Ethereum and Plasma, platforms that host Ionex operations. Orbs revealed that its system aims to achieve CeFi-level speed and execution from a decentralized architecture. Ionex brings 60x leverage Perps trading to Plasma Ionex has been built on the Plasma blockchain and positioned as a hybrid DEX, liquidity exchange, and liquidity marketplace, offering features for both spot and derivative trading. The exchange architecture includes MetaDEX for spot trades and MetaPerp for perpetual contracts. MetaPerp operates on top of Orbs’ Perpetual Hub Ultra infrastructure, enabling users to trade perpetual futures with leverage of up to 60x and execution times of under 100 milliseconds. Ionex DEX features a tri-token model, comprising $INX, veINX, and oINX, which are utilized for rewards, governance, and other platform-specific functionalities. The platform allows token swaps, user-provided liquidity pools with emission rewards, and DAO-based control of token emission schedules. Ionex also supports zero-fee USDT transfers and solver-based routing, aiming to maximize order execution depth. The integration of Orbs’ perps stack enables Ionex to incorporate the growing market for decentralized derivatives trading without needing to build out its own infrastructure. Orbs promote the model as a way for smaller or newer DEXs to enhance their offerings and compete with established platforms. Perpetual futures, which are derivative contracts without expiry dates, represent one of the largest categories of activity in centralized crypto platforms, led by exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Decentralized perpetual platforms, including dYdX, GMX, and ApolloX, have emerged recently, but the sector remains small, offering more opportunities.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-06 10:00:00

As 2025 enters its final stretch, investors are once again scanning for the best cryptos to buy now before the next rally begins. While major names like Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) remain household favorites, a new contender, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is quickly emerging as one of the top cryptocurrencies with explosive upside potential. Analysts say this new DeFi token could outpace both XRP and DOGE in 2026, supported by real utility, audited contracts, and strong community traction. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP remains one of the oldest and most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. It was built to simplify global money transfers for banks and financial institutions, using its blockchain to move funds faster and cheaper than traditional payment systems. XRP’s efficiency in cross-border transactions has earned it partnerships with major financial companies, keeping it relevant even as newer blockchains emerged. Currently, XRP trades around $2.20, with a market capitalization between $135 and $180 billion based on a circulating supply of about 60 billion tokens. However, it faces strong resistance between $2.70 and $3.00, where sell pressure consistently slows momentum. Analysts say that breaking above these levels could prove difficult without new institutional adoption or major technological upgrades. While XRP’s reputation gives it long-term stability, its massive market cap makes large percentage gains unlikely. Even a small rally to $4 or $5 would require billions in fresh inflows. Many investors still view it as a solid blue-chip asset, but not necessarily a high-growth opportunity compared to smaller tokens with more upside potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains a cultural icon within crypto. Originally created as a meme, it has since grown into one of the most widely recognized tokens in the market. Its popularity, fueled by community support and celebrity mentions, has kept it relevant for over a decade. However, the same characteristics that made DOGE famous are now starting to limit its potential. At the moment, DOGE trades around $0.16, with a market cap between $24 and $30 billion. The token faces significant resistance around $0.24 to $0.25, and support near $0.14 to $0.15. Technical analysts point out that DOGE has struggled to maintain upward momentum in recent months, as each rally meets strong profit-taking. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While XRP and DOGE dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a powerful alternative in the decentralized finance space. Unlike meme-driven or legacy assets, Mutuum Finance focuses on utility, specifically decentralized lending and borrowing markets powered by smart contracts. Mutuum Finance’s system combines two complementary models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to deposit assets into liquidity pools and earn passive yield. In return, they receive mtTokens, which represent both the amount deposited and the interest generated over time. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system lets users create personalized loans with flexible rates and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. For stable assets like ETH or USDT, borrowers can access up to 75% LTV, while riskier assets have tighter limits. The project’s presale has become one of 2025’s standout success stories. Mutuum Finance has already raised $18.45 million, gained over 17,750 holders, and sold around 790 million tokens. From its 4 billion total supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion) is allocated to the presale, making it one of the fairest distributions among new DeFi projects. The presale began at $0.01 in Phase 1 and is now priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, a 250% increase. Could MUTM Outperform XRP and DOGE? Analysts point to three clear reasons why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could outperform both XRP and DOGE in the next market cycle. Market Cap Advantage: XRP and DOGE already have enormous valuations, leaving little room for explosive growth. Mutuum Finance, still in its presale stage, has a fraction of their market cap — giving it more space to appreciate as adoption increases. Utility vs. Hype: Dogecoin thrives on community enthusiasm, and XRP relies on institutional use cases. Mutuum Finance, by contrast, offers real economic utility. Its mtToken yield system and buy-and-distribute mechanism directly tie the token’s value to platform activity. In this model, MUTM purchased on the open market is redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module, creating constant buying pressure and rewarding long-term holders. Growth Stage Timing: Mutuum Finance is still in its early development phase, preparing for its V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. That timing positions it perfectly for investors seeking early exposure potential before listings begin. V1 Launch and Security Confidence Mutuum Finance is finalizing development for its V1 launch, which will include the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot. The platform will support ETH and USDT at launch, ensuring deep liquidity and strong reliability for borrowers and lenders. Security has also been a major priority. The project underwent a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 Token Scan score, a clear indicator of solid smart-contract safety. Additionally, the team runs a $50,000 bug bounty program to identify and resolve any issues before the mainnet goes live. The project also features a 24-hour leaderboard, rewarding the top daily contributor with $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This community-driven incentive keeps investor engagement high and promotes fair participation. Final Thoughts Ripple and Dogecoin both played important roles in crypto’s history, but their growth potential is naturally limited by size and structure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, represents the next stage of DeFi, smaller, smarter, and driven by utility. With its audited contracts, clear revenue model, and rapidly growing presale, it’s not just another altcoin; it’s a functioning ecosystem in the making. As analysts increasingly highlight MUTM’s potential for long-term appreciation, investors are taking notice. With Phase 6 nearly sold out and the testnet launch approaching, Mutuum Finance could be the potential best crypto to buy now for those aiming to capture the next 25x performer before 2027.

54091671,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=849954,1762423212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54091671.jpeg,"Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-eoy-price-target/,"Galaxy Digital has cut its 2025 year-end Bitcoin target to $120,000 from $185,000 in a new research alert circulated on November 5 and shared via screenshots on X by Alex Thorn, the firm’s head of firmwide research. In the note titled “Bitcoin Outlook Update: Lowering 2025 YE Target to $120,000,” Thorn situates the downgrade squarely in the context of a “major, multi-week selloff,” writing that “Bitcoin is trading below $100k for the first time since late June, with other cryptos faring worse.” Thorn stresses that the shift is cyclical rather than existential, stating plainly: “While bitcoin’s structural investment case remains strong, cyclical dynamics have evolved.” The firm frames the current backdrop as a decisive turn in market microstructure: “Bitcoin has entered a new phase – what we call the ‘maturity era’ – in which institutional absorption, passive flows, and lower volatility dominate.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $99,000: Expert Breaks Down Why That regime change helps explain both the tempered year-end target and the altered cadence of price discovery that Galaxy now expects. As Thorn puts it, “If bitcoin can maintain the ~$100k level, we believe the almost three-year bull market will remain structurally intact, though the pace of future gains may be slower.” Short-term optimism is not abandoned: “Still, we think nearing prior all-time highs before year-end is a reasonable target for short-term bulls.” Reasons For The Bitcoin Downgrade The downgrade aggregates several identifiable drags, beginning with distribution patterns across the holder base and the market’s capacity to absorb them. Galaxy writes: “Significant coin transfers from old holders to ETFs and new institutional buyers signal maturity, not weakness, but have presented headwinds.” This redistribution—whales handing supply to passive and institutional channels—may strengthen long-term ownership but has, in Galaxy’s telling, blunted near-term momentum. Positioning and leverage are the second leg of the argument. Thorn flags the “significant leverage wipeout from Oct. 10” and adds that it “continues to dent market liquidity and confidence.” The October flush sits at the center of Galaxy’s cyclical reassessment: forced de-risking weakened order-book depth just as large-holder distribution accelerated, leaving price vulnerable into the latest drawdown. A third component is the rotation of capital and narrative attention into other trades. Galaxy is explicit that “Bitcoin started the year as the hottest investment narrative, but AI, hyperscalers, gold, and the Magnificent 7 have absorbed capital and attention that might otherwise flow into BTC.” That diversion extends into crypto-adjacent plumbing as well: “Rapid stablecoin growth has redirected venture and equity interest into fintech and payments infrastructure.” The net effect, according to the note, has been a drag on incremental demand for direct BTC exposure and a tougher funding environment for pure-play Bitcoin vehicles. Retail participation, which defined prior peaks, is notably absent at sustained scale, and when it surfaces it tends to be flighty. Thorn writes: “Retail never fully returned at scale post-2021; when it did, the memecoin mania fostered short-termism that is not conducive to understanding and adopting bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.” Without sustained retail sponsorship, Galaxy expects ETF and institutional flows to “define BTCUSD behavior,” adding that “Passive Flows Dominate… lowering volatility and moderating cycles.” This, again, is part of the “maturity era” thesis rather than a repudiation of Bitcoin’s core investment case. Related Reading: ‘Bitcoin $100K Break Was Emotional’ – On-Chain Data Shows No Structural Damage Policy timing features as a missing catalyst rather than a negative shock. The note observes that “Despite positive rhetoric, no government bitcoin purchases have been announced. In general, the US government has been very quiet on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR).” Galaxy does not ascribe immediate downside to the absence, but it removes a bullish tail event that some investors had hoped would materialize this year. Corporate treasuries and listed “Bitcoin-as-reserve” plays also receive a recalibration. Galaxy argues that the next iteration will demand business fundamentals rather than balance-sheet optics alone: “BTCTC Phase 2: The next wave of bitcoin treasury companies will mostly need revenue generation and operating businesses beyond reserve accumulation to differentiate themselves and thrive.” The firm also points to “poor performance of BTC treasury companies” as part of the year’s defining headwinds. Taken together, the factors map to a post-$100k market defined less by reflexive retail surges and more by methodical institutional accumulation. Galaxy calls it the “Post-$100k Regime,” in which “Bitcoin’s ascendance above six figures earlier this year marked the transition from early-era speculation to mature, institutionalized markets.” The conclusion threads the needle between structural conviction and cyclical prudence: “As a result of this market performance, and other factors, we are revising our 2025 year-end bullish bitcoin target from $185,000 to $120,000.” At press time, BTC traded at $103,093.

54091677,622317,1762423218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54091677.jpeg,Ripple CEO Drops Truth Bomb On XRP Vs. RLUSD Rumors,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-xrp-vs-rlusd/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse moved to puncture speculation that the company’s new US dollar stablecoin, RLUSD, has displaced XRP at the core of the company’s strategy, telling Crypto in America reporter Eleanor Terrett that XRP remains foundational even as it routes transactions over multiple assets depending on corridor economics and customer needs. Ripple CEO Sets The Record Straight: XRP Vs. RLUSD In a November 5 interview , Terrett pressed Garlinghouse on social media debates over whether the launch of RLUSD and Ripple’s push beyond cross-border payments have diluted XRP’s role. Garlinghouse’s response was unambiguous: “XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does.” He framed the recent discourse as a byproduct of “a lot of misinformation and sometimes disinformation in crypto Twitter,” adding that narratives suggesting Ripple has “given up on XRP” “just don’t make sense.” Garlinghouse situated XRP within a broader, multi-rail payments and treasury stack, pointing GTreasury and Ripple payments. In his telling, the firm’s routing logic is asset-agnostic and driven by corridor specifics—currency pair, liquidity depth, cost, and reliability—rather than ideology. “Some of those go through stablecoins. Some of it goes through XRP,” he said. “We want to deliver the best possible product to a customer at the best price, and sometimes that may be a stablecoin. Sometimes it may not.” In one of the interview’s most striking disclosures, Garlinghouse said that during the “first part of ’23,” Ripple’s institutional payment activity was significant enough that “Ripple was minting 20 percent of all USDC.” He presented that figure as evidence of a pragmatic approach in which Ripple used what worked for specific institutional flows: “We also used USDC. We also used XRP.” The point, he argued, is that customers buy solutions, not tokens, and the firm’s job is to select the “right technologies” for defined problems. “We are not XRP maximalists. There’s going to be different chains for different solutions and different technologies.” Garlinghouse tied XRP’s role to its performance characteristics—“very scalable, very fast and very inexpensive on a per transaction basis”—but he avoided absolutism, acknowledging that those attributes make XRP “good for some things and probably less good for other things.” The presence of RLUSD in Ripple’s toolkit does not negate XRP’s value proposition, he suggested; rather, it expands the company’s ability to optimize routing. In corridors where a fiat-denominated stablecoin provides better pricing or liquidity conditions, flows can shift there; where XRP’s speed-to-finality and low unit costs are decisive, XRP can carry the traffic. Crucially, Garlinghouse framed market share as secondary to total throughput growth across Ripple’s platforms. He said the objective is to scale from “tens of billions of dollars of payment transactions to hundreds of billions… to trillions,” and that XRP’s success tracks the overall pie. “If XRP doesn’t have 100 percent of that pie, but the pie is growing very quickly, like that’s great. I’m happy. That’s a really good place to be.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.32.",XRP|Brad Garlinghouse|ripple|ripple news|RLUSD|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,XRP|USDC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 10:00:18

Notably, this move represents a major leap toward integrating blockchain technology into mainstream financial systems, bridging the gap between digital asset innovation and traditional payment infrastructure. The pilot will launch with the Gemini Credit Card, issued by WebBank, to test RLUSD’s ability to deliver faster, cheaper, and more efficient fiat settlements. By integrating the stablecoin into Mastercard’s vast payment network, the initiative aims to demonstrate how blockchain can enhance transaction speed, transparency, and liquidity across institutional payment systems. A Bridge Between Blockchain and Banking Executives from the participating firms described the initiative as a unified step toward merging traditional finance’s stability with blockchain’s speed and interoperability. Fully backed by U.S. dollar reserves, Ripple’s RLUSD acts as a secure digital settlement layer, delivering instant, compliant cross-network transfers that enhance liquidity and trust across payment systems. Jason Lloyd, President and CEO, WebBank welcomed this development and stated, “Our collaboration with Mastercard, Gemini, and Ripple, allows us to explore how stablecoins like RLUSD can make institutional payments faster and more efficiently while maintaining the security and dependability customers expect from banks.” Enhancing Institutional Payments The XRP Ledger’s architecture enables near-instant settlements, ultra-low fees, and high scalability, making it ideal for testing stablecoin-powered credit card transactions. For Mastercard and WebBank, the collaboration could revolutionize how funds move across banks, merchants, and issuers, eliminating settlement delays and easing liquidity constraints in global payment networks. Furthermore, the integration of RLUSD transforms Gemini’s credit card into a proving ground for next-generation payments, showcasing how blockchain-backed stablecoins can power everyday finance. This advancement paves the way for real-time fiat settlement, cutting counterparty risk and operational costs across the payment ecosystem. The Ripple–Mastercard–WebBank–Gemini partnership could redefine how stablecoins integrate with global payment networks. By merging Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, Mastercard’s worldwide reach, and Gemini’s crypto expertise, the pilot sets a blueprint for real-world financial interoperability. At its core, RLUSD anchors Ripple’s vision to unite traditional finance and blockchain, enabling faster, more transparent, and inclusive transactions across the global economy. Meanwhile, RLUSD is gaining strong institutional interest, recently surpassing a $1 billion market valuation and emerging as one of the fastest-growing stablecoins in the market. Conclusion Ripple’s partnership with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini marks a milestone in digital payments. By integrating RLUSD into Mastercard’s network, the collaboration showcases how blockchain can enhance traditional finance. Therefore, the pilot could enable fiat transactions to settle in seconds, backed by secure, transparent, and compliant infrastructure. More than a technical test, it signals a new era where stablecoins like RLUSD power faster, smarter, and more connected global payments.",News|Crypto|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-06 10:06:14

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-plans-to-retain-25-of-all-xrp/,"Interest has returned to an older corporate reference regarding Ripple Labs’ initial funding model, highlighted by crypto researcher SMQKE. The discussion centers on documentation showing that Ripple Labs planned to retain approximately 25% of the total XRP supply during the early years of the network’s development. SMQKE emphasized that the plan was connected to expectations that demand for network utility would increase over time, thereby influencing the market value of XRP used in transactions. The shared material included a Fortune Magazine excerpt and accompanying corporate text explaining that the retained portion was intended to support operational needs and incentivize network participation. The document suggested that as network usage grew, so should the importance of the currency used to facilitate that activity. This was positioned as part of the system’s long-term outlook rather than a short-term profit model. RIPPLE PLANS TO RETAIN 25% OF ALL XRP IN ANTICIPATION OF RISING XRP PRICE AS NETWORK DEMAND GROWS Documented 2x. pic.twitter.com/euWiUTavxy — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 4, 2025 Contextualizing the 25% Retention In the referenced documents, Ripple Labs outlines a model in which it would maintain ownership of a quarter of the XRP supply to fund development and encourage adoption through network partners such as gateways, market makers, and consumers. It framed this retention as an alignment of incentives between Ripple Labs and participants who want the network to expand in scale and reach. The documentation emphasizes circulation and usage. The explanation made clear that incentives and distribution were designed so that both the company and the network’s user base benefited from broader protocol utilization. This structure has been widely cited in historical overviews of Ripple Labs’ early operations, especially relating to its strategy to build out global payment infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Questions on Regulatory Interpretation In response to SMQKE’s post, another participant, Eric Ball, raised questions regarding how the 25% figure might interact with developing U.S. regulatory frameworks, particularly the pending Clarity Act . He suggested that if current legislative language remains unchanged, ownership above certain thresholds could classify an asset as a security under issuer ownership provisions. He noted that the Act has not yet been signed and that adjustments to either legislation or corporate holdings could alter how the situation is evaluated. A separate respondent, Jack Blinka, offered an alternative interpretation. He referenced what the Clarity Act called an “issuer,” stating that it is about entities that create and distribute tokens. He pointed out that XRP was created at Ledger Genesis by the founders rather than Ripple Labs at a later stage. Under this perspective, if Ripple is not categorized as the issuer, the ownership threshold referenced in the Act may not apply in the same way.

Imagine turning a small investment into life-changing wealth. That’s the dream driving millions to explore PEPE price prediction possibilities. As one of the most volatile meme coins in the cryptocurrency market, PEPE has captured the attention of both seasoned traders and newcomers alike. But can this frog-themed digital asset really reach the elusive 1 cent milestone? Let’s dive deep into the technical analysis and market factors that will shape PEPE’s journey through 2025 and beyond. Understanding PEPE Price Prediction Fundamentals Any serious PEPE price prediction must start with understanding what drives meme coin valuation. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies with complex utility, meme coins like PEPE derive their value primarily from community sentiment, social media trends, and market speculation. The current circulating supply of PEPE tokens creates significant mathematical challenges for reaching higher price points, making our analysis both fascinating and crucial for informed investment decisions. Technical Analysis: PEPE Memecoin Market Position When examining PEPE memecoin through a technical lens, several key patterns emerge: Historical volatility patterns show 300%+ price swings within weeks Trading volume correlation with social media trends remains strong Resistance levels have consistently formed around psychological price points Market cap growth requires exponential increases in investor participation Cryptocurrency Forecast: 2025-2026 Outlook Our cryptocurrency forecast for PEPE suggests cautious optimism for 2025-2026. Several factors could influence this trajectory: Year Conservative Prediction Optimistic Prediction Key Drivers 2025 $0.000008-$0.000012 $0.000015-$0.000025 Market recovery, meme coin cycle 2026 $0.000015-$0.000030 $0.000040-$0.000080 Adoption growth, ecosystem development Meme Coin Analysis: The Path to 1 Cent The central question in our meme coin analysis remains: Can PEPE reach 1 cent? The mathematical reality presents both challenges and opportunities. At current token supply, reaching $0.01 would require a market capitalization exceeding that of several major traditional companies. However, token burns, increased utility, and mass adoption could alter this equation significantly. Key Factors That Could Accelerate Growth Major exchange listings and institutional interest Successful ecosystem expansion beyond pure meme status Strategic token burn mechanisms reducing circulating supply Positive regulatory developments for meme coins Digital Asset Investment Considerations Approaching PEPE as a digital asset investment requires understanding the unique risk-reward profile. Meme coins typically exhibit higher volatility than established cryptocurrencies, making them suitable only for risk-tolerant investors. Proper position sizing and portfolio diversification remain essential strategies when considering exposure to assets like PEPE. Frequently Asked Questions What makes PEPE different from other meme coins? PEPE leverages established internet culture through the Pepe the Frog meme, giving it immediate brand recognition that newer meme coins lack. How does PEPE compare to established cryptocurrencies? Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum , PEPE focuses primarily on community and cultural relevance rather than technological innovation or decentralized finance applications. What companies are involved with PEPE development? PEPE operates as a community-driven project rather than a corporate-backed initiative, similar to the early days of Dogecoin before broader recognition. Can PEPE achieve the market cap needed for 1 cent? Reaching 1 cent would require market conditions similar to Tesla ‘s valuation, representing one of the most ambitious scenarios in cryptocurrency history. The Final Verdict: Realistic Expectations vs. Moon Dreams While the dream of PEPE reaching 1 cent captures the imagination, our comprehensive analysis suggests a more measured approach. The PEPE price prediction landscape shows potential for significant growth, but investors should focus on realistic milestones rather than astronomical price targets. The true power of meme coins lies in their ability to capture cultural moments and community enthusiasm—factors that can’t be fully quantified but remain essential to their valuation.

For crypto futures, a positive basis typically emerges during periods of strong price appreciation and bullish sentiment, while a negative basis often reflects bearish conditions and price declines. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrency operates 24/7 without daily resets. By Mark Pilipczuk and Oliver Andrews The U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in January 2024 and July 2024, respectively, represented a significant development in the cryptocurrency market. These products provide investors with a more regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to digital assets, which has encouraged greater institutional involvement in the sector. The introduction of spot Solana and the potential for XRP ETFs suggest a forthcoming expansion in the scope of basis trading. As shown in the chart below, the front-month SOL and XRP futures contracts saw annualized basis readings spike to 50% in July 2025. Basis Trade: What Is It and Why Is It Important? A basis trade is a strategy that involves taking simultaneous, opposing positions in the spot and futures markets to capture the price difference between them. Basis = Futures Price − Spot Price The strategy aims to establish a delta-neutral position, where the combined exposure is insulated from the underlying asset's directional price movements. Instead, the profit or loss is determined by the ""locked-in"" basis as the two prices converge at the future contract's expiration. Below is a common scenario where the futures price is higher than the spot price, known as contango or a positive basis. Consider a hypothetical trading situation where a spot Bitcoin ETF is trading at $100,000. Simultaneously, the lead-month CME Group Bitcoin futures contract is trading at $101,000. This creates a positive basis of $1,000. To capture this basis, a trader could: Go long the spot asset: Buy the Bitcoin ETF at $100,000. Go short the futures contract: Sell the CME Group Bitcoin futures contract at $101,000. By executing both trades at the same time, the trader has locked in a gross profit of $1,000 per contract, irrespective of bitcoin’s price direction, before accounting for transaction costs. To see how, assume that by the time the futures contract expires, the prices have converged at a new price of $105,000. Spot position: The ETF purchased at $100,000 is now worth $105,000, yielding a profit of $5,000. Futures position: The futures contract shorted at $101,000 must be settled at $105,000, resulting in a loss of $4,000. The net result is a $1,000 profit ($5,000 profit - $4,000 loss), matching the initial basis. Conversely, if the futures price were lower than the spot price (backwardation or a negative basis), the trade would be inverted: the trader would sell the spot asset and buy the futures contract. The efficiency of this trade is enhanced by the alignment of price benchmarks. Several of the largest spot Bitcoin ETFs use CME CF Reference Rates to calculate their daily net asset value (NAV). As CME Group Bitcoin futures also expire to these CME CF Reference Rates, this means both sides of the trade are anchored to an identical price benchmark. This synchronization minimizes tracking errors and ensures a more reliable price convergence, creating a robust foundation for executing basis trades. Basis Trading Rises Post-ETF Launch The ETF structure provided institutions with a regulated and liquid spot leg, making basis trading more scalable. Following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, leveraged funds increased their net short positioning in CME Bitcoin futures (see chart below). This implies the growing use of basis trades, where futures are sold short to hedge long exposure in spot markets, rather than a directional view against bitcoin. Following the spot Ether ETF approvals in July 2024, net short exposure by leveraged funds in CME Ether futures was also evident (see chart below). As shown in the chart below, CME Group Bitcoin futures open interest climbed from roughly 30,000 contracts in early 2024 to 45,000 in November 2024, before easing back to the low-30,000s by May 2025. Expansions in open interest coincided with a widening of the annualized front-month basis. Price momentum reversed in February 2025 and the basis briefly dipped below zero, with CME Group Bitcoin futures open interest falling at the same time. What Makes Crypto Basis Different? Unlike physical commodities, where the basis reflects the cost to deliver the asset at a future date - which includes financing, transport and storage costs - the bitcoin basis is driven by price momentum, market sentiment and financing costs. Several structural features distinguish the crypto basis from that of traditional assets: Increased Retail Participation: Based on recent 13F filings, institutional ownership in the largest spot Bitcoin ETF (28%) is significantly lower than in more traditional products like the S&P 500 ETF (58%), meaning the retail footprint may make market flows more sensitive to sentiment. 24/7 Markets: Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrency operates 24/7 without daily resets. This continuous activity allows further price discrepancies between spot and futures markets to emerge. In early 2026, CME Group Cryptocurrency futures and options will be available to trade 24/7 (pending regulatory review), providing market participants with enhanced trading flexibility. Looking Ahead Digital asset markets have a unique structure, heavily influenced by a high proportion of retail traders and the outsized impact of social media. This environment can amplify price momentum, triggering waves of buying or selling that can lead to significant price dislocations. Traders are, in turn, systematically developing strategies to capture these sentiment shifts, and the introduction of new regulated products is creating fresh opportunities for basis trading. This suggests the sentiment-driven basis in digital asset markets isn't just a temporary anomaly. Instead, it appears to be an enduring, structural feature of the market itself.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Holds — But Signs Of Weakness Are Piling Up: Analyst A crypto expert, Coach JV, told followers that seeing XRP trade under $2 would be a “blessing” for disciplined buyers. Reports have disclosed that XRP gave up the $2.5 level and now faces bears that could push it to new lows below $2. XRP Drops Near Key Support Based on numbers from market trackers, the broader crypto market lost about $350 billion in total value between Nov. 3 and 4. XRP was hit hard in that stretch, falling about 14% to roughly $2.2. Analysts suggested those who missed buying under $2 might get another chance if current weakness continues. Momentum has been driven by Bitcoin’s pullback, and that pressure has been passed down to many altcoins, XRP included. Bitcoin under $100K? XRP at $2? What a blessing. Most see disappointment. The disciplined see accumulation. This is where the patient become wealthy while others chase green candles later, we’ll already be sitting on house money. GOD, family, and protection of your ecosystem… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) November 4, 2025 Market Moves And Historical Context Coach JV pointed out that a drop below $2 would wipe as much as 37% off a position opened at the start of August. For example, a $100,000 stake would be worth about $63,000 in that scenario. Those are headline numbers that grab attention. Yet the message being pushed by some analysts is simple: a downturn can create low-price buying opportunities. After the collapse from $3.30 in January 2018, XRP stayed mostly between $0.3 and $0.7 for seven years, until the rally in November 2024 reopened the market for large gains. Opportunity For The Patient According to JV, patient accumulation during weak patches is what separates winners from those who chase rallies later. He wrote that when others are chasing green candles, early accumulators are often already sitting on gains. #XRP – Micro Wick 1 ($10) & Macro Wick 2 ($50): First of all, imagine waking up after a market bloodbath 😤 and still writing this post with zero fear 😎, because on the higher timeframes, nothing has changed!

According to Santiment Feed’s analysis, the XRP Ledger has witnessed its strongest 48-hour user wallet growth in eight months, with 21,595 new wallets created in the last two days. XRP’s market price climbed 10% over a 24-hour span as investors rushed to buy the dip following a brief correction, according to Coingecko data. 📈 XRP's price has bounced back, and users who bought the dip have enjoyed a nice +12% jump in the past 24 hours.

XRPL activity peaked around November 3, when nearly 1.9 million transactions were processed in a single day. The momentum eased slightly to 1.7 million on Wednesday, when XRP fell to a week’s low of $ 2.09 on Bitstamp. The coin’s market value slid from Monday’s $2.50 to $2.20 on Tuesday, before further pressure took it down to levels below $2.10. By the time US trading opened on Wednesday, the token had found its way back to $2.30. XRP whales let go of holdings during market turmoil Several market analytical platforms have reported that retail participation has helped XRP grow to $2.3, but large-scale holders have been dragging the third-largest coin by market cap downwards. moving in the opposite direction in the last seven days. Market analyst Ali Martinez said on Tuesday that whale addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP coins had cut down their positions by approximately 900,000 tokens in a five-day span. CryptoQuant’s Whale to Exchange Flow (Total) for Binance chart , a measure of large transfers to exchanges, showed a sustained uptick beginning in late 2024. Contributor ArabChain believes this is a bearish indicator because whales are seemingly offloading their positions into strength. The whale to exchange flow peaked near XRP’s all-time highs in early November, with the 100-day simple moving average also reaching record territory, buoyed by a selling spree from early investors and institutions purportedly trying to take profits. Amid the positive price correction, XRP Ledger’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) processed 954,000 transactions in the 24 hours ending Tuesday, the highest ever recorded on the network. XRP short-term analysis: More downward price blows ahead However, despite the increase in network engagement , XRP’s price action is not quite moving in line with the strength of its fundamentals. The token’s recent attempts to breach resistance levels have repeatedly failed, which could mean its upward momentum is more muted in the short term. XRP is facing strong resistance between $2.65 and $2.75, after failing to breach the cap in several trading sessions. The XRPL token’s current price action shows the asset consolidating just below the $2.32 level after bouncing off the support around $2.15. Market watchers are keeping a closer look at the $2.35 resistance level, with bulls hoping that a decisive close above this threshold before Friday’s close triggers a short-term squeeze toward $2.50. If XRP crumbles and fails to maintain its 10% upward price charge, the token risks another retracement to the $2.15 or even $2.00 zone. In other related news, the token’s parent company, Ripple, secured $500 million through a funding round that took its valuation to $40 billion, more than triple its previous $11.3 billion in October.

The recent price moves rely on reallocation, leading to lower potential for growth. Wintermute, one of the most prominent market makers in crypto, has warned that new liquidity is not coming into the market. The current price moves and trading depend on the turnover of remaining funds, instead of new inflows. Crypto is now more capitalized, but the liquidity flows from the past year are slowing down, commented Wintermute . This also means rallies may be short-lived and lead to smaller surges. Liquidity drives crypto cycles, and now, the money has stopped flowing in Stablecoins, ETFs, and DATs have grown from $180B to $560B since early 2024, but momentum has slowed Capital is rotating internally, not entering fresh → rallies die fast and breadth keeps narrowing pic.twitter.com/h9Rp2fJAcE — Wintermute (@wintermute_t) November 6, 2025 At this stage, the crypto market may see shifts between whale owners and internal reallocation. However, a true bull market recovery may be possible only after renewed external inflows. Despite expectations of a growing money supply, inflows to crypto are not automatic. The recent market moves have made investors more cautious, potentially setting up for a bear market. Wintermute has often served the internal transformation of crypto funds. The market maker was also suspected of deliberately boosting BTC sales during the latest market correction. The market maker most often works through Binance, and its effect is felt in some of the more dramatic price moves in recent weeks. The market maker still holds over $549M in crypto reserves, deploying them to centralized markets, DEXs like PancakeSwap, and perpetual futures markets like Aerodrome. Wintermute: Liquidity drives prices more than adoption In the long term, crypto has seen wider adoption, even during bear market periods. The tools for the latest bull market were created during relatively slow times in terms of liquidity and price action. Still, bull markets mostly depend on inflows of new funds, noted Wintermute. In previous cycles, the main source of liquidity was easily tracked – it was tied to the new minting of stablecoins. During the latest market cycle, the main sources of liquidity also included ETFs and treasury companies, both tapping funding from the open market or specialized deals with investors. VC funding is also becoming a factor, but it may also be connected to existing reserves and internal reallocation. Even token sales with external buyers are mostly targeting crypto insiders with funds from previous cycles. The turnover of existing stablecoins may be sufficient to keep the market alive, and even produce record-breaking rallies. Wintermute warns that new hot funds are avoiding crypto, with no signs of direct inflows and smaller demand for ETF and DAT company shares. Increased liquidity returns to equity markets Wintermute reminded that after the latest Fed decision, the world economy still works in conditions of quantitative easing and the potential for more money inflows . The additional liquidity now seeks out opportunities in the stock market, which offers significant growth without crypto’s risky downside. The stocks of crypto mining companies also serve as a proxy for the sector, draining some of the liquidity otherwise allocated to digital assets. The trend for a shift to stocks affected even traditionally strong crypto markets like South Korea, further cutting into new liquidity inflows .

Speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami , Florida, he declared that the federal government would no longer “wage war on crypto.” The announcement signalled a decisive shift in Washington’s policy approach and an intent to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” Strategic reserves and new crypto framework The Trump administration’s digital asset strategy focuses on integrating cryptocurrencies into the national financial system through structured policy and regulation. Among the key initiatives is the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile, designed to diversify national holdings and strengthen financial resilience. In July, Congress passed the GENIUS Act , a comprehensive stablecoin framework that sets clear guidelines for issuers and institutions. The Act aims to ensure that stablecoins remain transparent, well-collateralised, and fully compliant with existing banking and securities regulations. Meanwhile, the CLARITY Act, focused on crypto market structure, is progressing through the Senate. The legislation is expected to establish clear jurisdiction between regulators, define digital asset classifications, and streamline compliance for exchanges and custodians. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks recently confirmed that discussions on the bill were advancing. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Sacks said he had a productive meeting with Senators John Boozman and Cory Booker from the Senate Agriculture Committee to finalise key provisions, describing the talks as encouraging and bipartisan. David Sacks @davidsacks47 · Follow Thank you Chairman @JohnBoozman & Senator @CoryBooker @SenBooker for a constructive discussion today about the crypto market structure legislation before Senate Ag Committee. I am encouraged by the great progress so far, and look forward to a bipartisan draft in the near future. 10:38 AM · Nov 6, 2025 727 Reply Copy link Read 26 replies Regulatory shift under new SEC leadership The policy transformation coincides with a major leadership change at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Former Chair Gary Gensler, who oversaw an aggressive enforcement campaign against major exchanges including Coinbase and Binance, stepped down on 20 January. He was replaced by Paul Atkins, a long-time advocate for regulatory clarity in financial markets and a known supporter of blockchain innovation. His appointment has been widely interpreted as a sign that Washington intends to move from enforcement-heavy oversight to a more innovation-friendly model that promotes growth while maintaining investor protection. This change has been welcomed by institutional investors, with several large funds increasing exposure to Bitcoin ETFs and stablecoins following months of uncertainty. Reducing pressure on the dollar through diversification Trump’s economic advisers have argued that adopting crypto at a national level can relieve long-term strain on the US dollar and strengthen economic competitiveness. By holding Bitcoin and other digital assets in federal reserves, the administration aims to reduce dependence on traditional currency systems and hedge against inflationary pressures. Speaking at the Miami forum, Trump said that embracing digital assets “takes a lot of the pressure off the dollar” and brings multiple financial benefits. His remarks underscore the broader objective of using blockchain technology to enhance economic stability and support innovation in artificial intelligence, fintech, and cybersecurity. The president also acknowledged global competition in the crypto race. He noted that countries such as China are expanding their digital currency ecosystems, urging US policymakers to move swiftly to secure America’s lead in the next generation of finance and technology. Crypto adoption strengthens US position The United States now ranks second globally in crypto adoption, trailing only India, according to Chainalysis data . Regulatory progress, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the institutional embrace of stablecoins under the GENIUS Act, have helped drive the growth. These advancements have also enhanced the country’s role in shaping international standards for digital assets. Despite political challenges following recent elections, analysts say the US is likely to maintain its momentum in blockchain regulation due to bipartisan support and strong industry engagement. The combined effect of legislative progress, leadership changes, and national strategy marks a defining moment for the country’s digital future. With plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and broader institutional adoption underway, Washington’s vision of becoming a Bitcoin superpower reflects a structural commitment to technological and financial leadership in the years ahead.

XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future.

Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts also project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling pressure took hold, bringing the price to $2.31 during the day. The RSI decreased to 40.62 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.72 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the start of the next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $19.35 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that the Canary XRP ETF will launch in November. Asset manager, Canary, has submitted an updated S-1 registration statement to the SEC for its XRP spot ETF, which, according to the news, is set to start trading on November 13, 2025.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October, XRP was trending near the $2.90 mark, and in November, it has fallen to the $2.40 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-06 11:49:12

Despite bearish signals—liquidity tightening, EMA breakdowns, and a strong dollar—there are catalysts for a potential final rally. Shifts in Fed policy, possible liquidity injections, and institutional adoption via ETFs and regulation could support BTC in the short term. The current setup favors a long position above $97,000 with tight risk management, as the coming weeks will be pivotal for BTC. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) broke below $100,000 on Monday, and yes, this is a reason for concern. As I pointed out in my last article , the four-year cycle could be drawing to an end, with US liquidity beginning to falter. But, at the same time, with Bitcoin near support, this could be a good spot to add. While sentiment and price have been bearish…is there room for one last push up? I think so, and this is a bet worth taking now. It’s make-or-break time for Bitcoin. Plenty Of Reasons To Be Bearish Bitcoin has given us no shortage of reasons to be bearish in the last few months. 4 Year Cycle BTC 4 Year Cycle (Crypto Rover) The Bitcoin halving has always had a strong correlation to price. We usually see a price rally after the halving, and then lose steam and enter a bear market as we approach the next one. According to history, Bitcoin should top sometime in Q4 or Q1 of 2026. That means the top is imminent, and could even have happened already. Arguably, halving cycles are getting shorter and shorter, with more people looking to front-run the top and subsequent bear market. The 50 Week EMA Break BTC Chart (Trendspider) If we move onto the weekly chart, the 50 EMA has traditionally been a key level to hold during bull markets. We did see a monetary break back in 2020 before a final top, but generally speaking, this is a level that should hold. Even more damning would be if we got a bearish cross of the 20 and 50 EMA, which occurred back in 2022 and led to a 65% drawdown The Liquidity Issues Lastly, Bitcoin has always been a proxy for liquidity. The recent sell-off could be a warning sign on the liquidity cycle, and it’s not the only one. SOFR/IOBR Spread (New York Fed) We saw a spike in the REPO market, with spreads between SOFR and OPRB expanding to high levels. A contributing factor towards this has also been the build-up of the TGA and the stronger dollar. TGA (FRED) The TGA is now at $1 trillion, but it should begin to move back down once the government shutdown is over. DXY ( TradingView ) Similarly, after months of bearish action, the dollar has been catching a bid, which has been bad for Bitcoin and risk assets. However, we’re now overbought on the daily and could soon see a reversal. Is This Time Different? The question is whether this time is truly different, as many argue. And I’d argue there is some merit to this. The Debasement Trade The overarching theme of the debasement trade, in my opinion, is far from played out. We may be getting a break and reset, but if Gold’s behaviour is any indication, the dollar could have much further to fall. Ultimately, the name of the game now is how to manage the nearly $40 trillion in debt the US has to service and roll over. My guess is you need growth and inflation. A New Fed Policy In this regard, we can’t overlook the fact that there’s been a real shift in Fed policy. It has even been stated by members that the Fed has a third mandate , which is to moderate long-term rates. This can only be achieved through monetary intervention. And we’re already seeing signs that market stability and lower rates are now more important than ever to the US Central Bank. With the first signs of liquidity cracking, Jerome Powell already said that QT would be ending by December 1st. This, at a time when the Fed is also expected to keep cutting rates, with markets already near all-time highs. ETFs and Regulation Lastly, yes, this time is different because of ETFs, institutional adoption, and regulatory clarity provided by the aptly named CLARITY Act, which could be passed by the Senate sometime in early 2026 A Simple Plan Of Action So, in my opinion, there’s enough here to consider another leg up. DXY and TGA could reverse course, at least in the short term Fed could add liquidity sooner than expected Institutional adoption could support the price of Bitcoin All in all, this is not a bad setup to go long, with hopes of at least one more push up. To reduce risk, you can play this with a tight stop at the key support area I’ll outline below. BTC TA (Trendspider) In simple terms, I’m bullish above $97,000 and bearish below. Ideally, I’d like to see us test this level and then rally back up to new all-time highs. This would then allow us to build a final up leg in the year-long bearish divergence we have been building. Final Thoughts The next few weeks will be pivotal for Bitcoin, which will either begin a final rally or break down and initiate a bear market. The setup right now favors going long, in my opinion, but manage risk accordingly.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-06 11:53:29

The situation threatens the stability of their popular lisUSD stablecoin and has caught the attention of major platforms like PancakeSwap. But what exactly is happening, and why should every crypto investor pay attention? What Is the Lista DAO Vault Crisis All About? Lista DAO, the innovative force behind the over-collateralized stablecoin lisUSD, finds itself in a precarious position. The organization recently revealed that collateral assets in vaults managed by MEV Capital and Re7 Labs face serious challenges. Specifically, the sUSDX and USDX assets in MEV Capital’s USDT vault and Re7 Labs’ USD1 vault remain exposed to dangerously high borrowing rates without any repayment activity. This situation creates significant risk for the entire Lista DAO ecosystem. When vaults don’t receive proper repayments, the collateral backing stablecoins becomes unstable. Therefore, the Lista DAO team has taken the crucial step of publicly urging both companies to address these issues immediately. Why Should You Care About Lista DAO’s Concerns? The Lista DAO situation highlights several critical aspects of DeFi risk management: Collateral protection – Stablecoins need reliable backing Borrowing rate risks – Unchecked rates can spiral quickly Third-party management – The dangers of delegated control Protocol oversight – How DAOs monitor their partners Moreover, PancakeSwap’s acknowledgment that they’re monitoring the vaults closely indicates this isn’t an isolated concern. Major platforms recognize the potential ripple effects throughout the DeFi space. What Actions Is Lista DAO Taking? The Lista DAO team isn’t sitting idle. They’ve implemented a multi-pronged approach to resolve the vault repayment issues. First, they’ve made public statements to increase pressure on the involved companies. Second, they’re likely working behind the scenes to negotiate solutions. Third, they’re maintaining transparency with their community about the challenges. This proactive stance from Lista DAO demonstrates their commitment to protocol stability. However, the ultimate resolution depends on cooperation from MEV Capital and Re7 Labs. The crypto community now watches closely to see how these firms respond to Lista DAO’s demands. What Does This Mean for DeFi Investors? For anyone involved in decentralized finance, the Lista DAO situation serves as an important case study. It reveals how even well-established protocols can face challenges with third-party vault management. Investors should consider: Due diligence – Research vault managers thoroughly Risk assessment – Understand borrowing rate exposures Protocol monitoring – Watch for official announcements Diversification – Spread investments across multiple protocols The Lista DAO team’s transparency in this matter actually strengthens their credibility. They’re not hiding the problems but confronting them directly. Final Thoughts: The Future of Lista DAO and DeFi Stability The Lista DAO vault repayment situation represents a critical test for decentralized governance and risk management. How this resolves will set important precedents for how DAOs handle third-party relationships and protect their stablecoin ecosystems. The crypto community awaits MEV Capital and Re7 Labs’ responses with keen interest. Successful resolution could strengthen Lista DAO’s position as a responsible DeFi leader. However, prolonged issues might raise questions about vault management practices across the industry. One thing remains clear: Lista DAO has taken the necessary first step by bringing these concerns into the open. Frequently Asked Questions What is Lista DAO? Lista DAO is a decentralized organization that issues lisUSD, an over-collateralized stablecoin operating on blockchain networks. Which companies is Lista DAO having issues with? Lista DAO is addressing vault repayment concerns with MEV Capital and Re7 Labs regarding their managed vaults. What are the specific problems with the vaults? The collateral assets face continuously high borrowing rates without repayments being made, creating stability risks. Is PancakeSwap involved in this situation? PancakeSwap has acknowledged they’re aware of the vault circumstances and are monitoring them closely, though they’re not directly involved. How might this affect lisUSD stablecoin holders? If vault issues persist, it could potentially impact the collateral backing and stability of lisUSD, though Lista DAO is taking preventive action. What should investors do during this situation? Monitor official Lista DAO announcements, assess personal risk exposure, and consider diversifying investments while the situation resolves. Found this analysis helpful?

It does a lot of good things."" ""We're making the US the #Bitcoin superpower, the crypto capital of the world"". pic.twitter.com/31xK1qCnys — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 5, 2025 The Dollar-Bitcoin Paradox Trump’s endorsement reflects growing momentum behind stablecoins and strategic Bitcoin reserves in Washington, yet economic fundamentals suggest an inherent tension. Bitcoin has historically exhibited an inverse correlation of approximately -0.7 with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), meaning a strengthened dollar typically suppresses Bitcoin prices while dollar weakness tends to boost them. Source: MacroMicro During the Federal Reserve’s 2022 tightening cycle, the DXY surged to 114, while Bitcoin crashed from $47,000 to below $17,000, a textbook demonstration of this inverse relationship. Conversely, the 2020-21 easing period saw dollar weakness coincide with Bitcoin’s rally to then-record highs around $64,000. Market observers note Bitcoin behaves more like a high-beta risk asset than a safe haven, rising with loose financial conditions and falling during liquidity withdrawals. If cryptocurrency genuinely reduces pressure on the dollar by offering alternative transaction and store-of-value mechanisms, a stronger dollar could paradoxically undermine Bitcoin’s appeal. The crypto typically attracts capital when investors seek alternatives to weakening fiat currencies, not when traditional money strengthens. Academic research using wavelet analysis confirms Bitcoin’s out-of-phase dynamics with the dollar, though the relationship remains “more sporadic” than with conventional assets. Strategic Reserve and Stablecoin Push Senator Cynthia Lummis recently called a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve “ the only path “ to meaningfully offset America’s $35 trillion debt burden, praising the Trump administration for embracing the concept. She revealed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House staff are exploring structures beyond simply revaluing gold certificates, though financing details remain unclear. Sen. @CynthiaMLummis says a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only way to offset US debt, praising President Trump and Treasury for backing the plan. #BitcoinReserve #USDebt https://t.co/XG8J23vRnJ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 5, 2025 The administration’s March fact sheet indicated the reserve would start with over 130,000 BTC already held through criminal forfeitures, worth approximately $34 billion, without requiring new taxpayer spending. Similarly, Eric Trump recently told the New York Post that stablecoins could “ save the U.S. dollar ” by channeling “ trillions from around the world ” into U.S. markets through World Liberty Financial’s USD1 token. However, critics, including Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Elizabeth Warren, have warned of what they see as conflicts of interest, noting the GENIUS Act stablecoin framework signed in July contains no provisions preventing the president or family members from profiting. Market Dynamics Reveal Dollar-Bitcoin Tension in Real Time Recent market action demonstrates the paradox between the dollar and Bitcoin. When surprisingly strong U.S. jobs data emerged in late September, initial claims dropped to 218,000, and Q2 GDP was revised upward to 3.8%. The U.S. Dollar Index surged to a three-week high while Bitcoin tumbled below $111,000. The pattern repeated on Thursday when better-than-expected services activity and payroll figures lifted the dollar to a five-month peak, capping Bitcoin’s recovery even as it climbed back above $103,000. Strong jobs report sends dollar soaring while Bitcoin falls below $111,000 as Fed rate cut odds decline to 85.5%. #Bitcoin #Dollar https://t.co/izW8AEttYE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 Current trading reflects this dollar dominance. Despite Bitcoin’s Thursday bounce, traders described a “buy the dip, sell the rip” bias , with rapid profit-taking, as the higher-for-longer rate narrative and firm dollar limit follow-through persisted. Rate expectations for a December Fed cut slipped to 60% from 70% earlier in the week, keeping yields firm and the dollar elevated. Notably, in the early hours of today, Turkey’s lira plunged to a record 42.1 per dollar on November 6, a 97% depreciation since 2010, as persistent inflation drives capital toward the US dollar.

""FBI Found to Be Right!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-us-court-issues-a-major-decision-regarding-bitcoin-btc-fbi-found-to-be-right/,"A US court has issued a significant ruling regarding Bitcoin. The court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a citizen who claimed the FBI erased a hard drive containing 3,443 Bitcoins. A US court has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Florida resident Michael Prem seeking $354 million in damages from the government for the loss of 3,443 Bitcoins, Decrypt reported. In its decision, the court said that the FBI had no negligence in this case and could not be held responsible for deleting a hard drive containing 3,443 BTC. Because the court stated that Perm did not report the existence of the Bitcoins in question while he was in prison. The court ruled that Prem, who was convicted of identity theft, had not previously officially declared that he owned such a large amount of Bitcoin and had not listed his Bitcoins as lost assets during his prison term, so he could not file a lawsuit against the government for the loss of cryptocurrency. What Happened? Michael Prem pleaded guilty to charges of device fraud, identity theft, and illegal firearms possession in 2019 and was sentenced to prison. During the search, the FBI seized a hard drive from his property. The FBI then followed standard protocols for seized electronic evidence and wiped the device. However, after his release from prison in 2022, Prem claimed that the FBI destroyed the drive without proper authorization, blocking access to 3,443 Bitcoins. The court rejected Prem’s claims, citing inconsistencies in his statements and his lateness in claiming ownership of the BTCs in question. In its ruling, the court noted that Prem's financial disclosure to the government in February 2020 revealed that he held only $200 to $1,500 worth of Bitcoin, and that upon his release from prison, he claimed to be a BTC billionaire. Citing contradictions between Prem's statements and the unreasonable passage of time, the court wrote: “Prime's claim of ownership rights came too late, and even if the Bitcoins were available, it would be unfair to return them to him.” Glassnode estimates that, based on data, approximately 7% of Bitcoin's total supply of 21 million has been permanently lost. *This is not investment advice.

Will Shiba Inu, the meme cryptocurrency that captured global attention, achieve the remarkable milestone of $0.00005 by 2030? As investors worldwide watch SHIB’s volatile journey, understanding the factors that could drive this ambitious price target becomes crucial for anyone considering cryptocurrency investment in this popular digital asset. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Current Market Position Shiba Inu currently ranks among the top meme cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The SHIB price analysis reveals several key factors influencing its trajectory: Market sentiment and social media influence Adoption rate across exchanges and platforms Burning mechanisms reducing circulating supply Ecosystem development including Shibarium SHIB Price Analysis: Technical Indicators and Patterns Technical analysis provides valuable insights for our cryptocurrency forecast. Key indicators suggest: Indicator Current Status Future Implication Relative Strength Index Neutral Potential for upward movement Moving Averages Mixed signals Consolidation phase expected Trading Volume Moderate Requires increased activity for breakout Cryptocurrency Forecast: 2025-2030 Projections Our comprehensive cryptocurrency forecast considers multiple scenarios for SHIB’s future value: 2025: Conservative estimate between $0.000015-$0.000025 2026: Moderate growth to $0.000025-$0.000035 2027-2028: Potential acceleration with broader crypto adoption 2029-2030: Critical period for reaching $0.00005 target Meme Coin Investment: Risks and Opportunities Investing in meme coins like Shiba Inu presents unique considerations. While the potential for high returns exists, meme coin investment carries significant volatility. The SHIB future value depends heavily on: Community engagement and development activity Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency markets Competition from emerging meme cryptocurrencies Overall crypto market conditions and Bitcoin dominance SHIB Future Value: Path to $0.00005 Achieving the $0.00005 target requires specific conditions. Our SHIB price analysis indicates this milestone depends on: Requirement Current Status Needed Improvement Market Cap Growth Billions Significant increase required Adoption Rate Growing Mass merchant acceptance needed Supply Reduction Ongoing burns Accelerated burning mechanisms Frequently Asked Questions What is Shiba Inu’s current circulating supply? Shiba Inu has a large circulating supply, though burning mechanisms are gradually reducing this number. How does Shiba Inu compare to Dogecoin ? While both are meme coins, Shiba Inu operates on the Ethereum blockchain and has a different tokenomics structure compared to Elon Musk ‘s frequently mentioned Dogecoin. What role does Binance play in SHIB trading? Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, provides significant liquidity and trading pairs for SHIB, influencing its price discovery. Can Shiba Inu reach $0.01? Given current supply metrics, reaching $0.01 would require unprecedented market capitalization growth that most analysts consider highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. What is Shibarium and how does it affect SHIB price? Shibarium is Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution designed to reduce transaction costs and improve scalability, potentially increasing utility and value. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Shiba Inu The journey to $0.00005 represents an ambitious but theoretically possible target for Shiba Inu. While the path requires favorable market conditions, increased adoption, and sustained community support, the cryptocurrency’s history of surprising rallies suggests nothing should be completely ruled out. Investors should approach SHIB with careful consideration of both its potential rewards and inherent risks in the volatile meme coin space.

Until now, such transformations were delayed by uncertainty. But recent regulatory advances signal that the waiting game may be over. Regulatory Clarity as the Key Obstacle According to a post by Chad Steingraber on X, Mastercard cited a lack of regulation as the principal factor holding them back from deeper collaboration with Ripple and its digital-asset ecosystem. With the legal framework now clarified, Mastercard appears ready to move forward. The shift underscores how even major incumbents awaited the green light of regulatory certainty before fully committing to blockchain-linked initiatives. Mastercard stated that what was holding them back was lack of regulation, but now there is the stablecoin law creating certainty for their business to move forward with Ripple and RLUSD. TOTAL FIRE https://t.co/kDDLLroB6R — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 5, 2025 The Emergence of the Stablecoin Law Recent legislation has formalized the rules around stablecoin issuing, redemption, and backing. That new law is central to Mastercard’s renewed confidence. It establishes standards for reserve assets, audits, and issuer responsibilities. This legal clarity reduces compliance risk for payments giants and opens the door to stablecoin-enabled settlement systems. The Pilot: Mastercard, Ripple, and RLUSD Under the new partnership , Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD will be used in a pilot with Mastercard, Gemini, and WebBank for credit-card settlement via the XRP Ledger. This four-way collaboration represents one of the first instances where a regulated U.S. bank (WebBank) and a global card network settle payments with a regulated stablecoin on a public ledger. The move signals a serious step toward bridging traditional finance and tokenized rails. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Ripple and XRP For Ripple, this represents a strategic validation of its vision. The XRPL becomes not just a crypto ledger, but a payments-rail contender. The pilot complements Ripple’s existing use of its cryptocurrency XRP and institutional-asset infrastructure. It also elevates RLUSD as a compliant settlement coin, backed under a New York trust charter and fully reserved. Industry Significance and Future Trends Mastercard’s pivot offers lessons for the broader payments ecosystem. Technology was never the main barrier—it was regulation. With that barrier receding, other incumbents may accelerate stablecoin integration. Faster settlement, lower costs, and greater transparency are the end-game. For card networks, banks, and merchants, that may soon move from concept to rollout. Mastercard’s announcement is more than a partnership headline. It marks a transition from experimentation to execution in payment rails. As Ripple, RLUSD, and the XRPL take centre stage, the ecosystem shifts from waiting on clarity to acting on it.

Key Takeaways: Franklin Templeton launched Hong Kong’s first tokenized money-market fund investing in short-term U.S. government securities. The fund, initially open to institutional investors, uses blockchain to boost transparency and transaction efficiency. A retail version is planned pending SFC approval, expanding access to tokenized investment products in Hong Kong. The Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund invests in short-term US government securities, with its shares represented as blockchain tokens, according to a report by South China Morning Post . Franklin Templeton Targets Retail Market After Launching Tokenized Fund Initially open to institutional and professional investors with at least HK$8 million (US$1 million) in assets, the fund aims to enhance transparency and efficiency by using distributed ledger technology to process transactions and record ownership. “This launch reflects our commitment to offering innovative investment solutions and expanding access to tokenized products in this dynamic market,” said Tariq Ahmad, head of Asia-Pacific at Franklin Templeton. He added that the company plans to introduce a retail-approved version, pending approval from Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), as part of its effort to democratize digital asset investment. The fund’s debut marks the first initiative under the Fintech 2030 plan, unveiled by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) chief executive Eddie Yue Wai-man earlier this week. The five-year roadmap features more than 40 projects to accelerate the adoption of tokenization, artificial intelligence, and central bank digital currency (CBDC) across Hong Kong’s financial sector. FRANKLIN TEMPLETON ROLLS OUT TOKENISED USD MONEY MARKET FUND IN HONG KONG! pic.twitter.com/IGrnZXLxoV — That Martini Guy ₿ (@MartiniGuyYT) November 6, 2025 Franklin Templeton developed the blockchain platform hosting the new fund and has partnered with HSBC and OSL Group, the operator of Hong Kong’s first licensed virtual asset exchange, through the HKMA’s Project Ensemble. HSBC is exploring the use of tokenized deposits to enable near-instant settlements for fund transactions, a key step toward building a fully integrated digital asset infrastructure. “Hong Kong is emerging as an institutionally trusted hub for digital assets,” said Brian Chen, head of OSL Wealth Management. Franklin Templeton has been building its blockchain capabilities since 2018, launching the world’s first U.S.-registered blockchain-integrated mutual fund in 2021 and several tokenized UCITS products across Luxembourg and Singapore since then. The Hong Kong rollout reinforces its ambition to bridge traditional finance with the fast-growing digital asset ecosystem. Hong Kong Announces New Digital Asset Policy Hong Kong has unveiled its second major policy statement on digital assets, placing stablecoin regulation and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization at the core of its strategy to become a global fintech hub. The new “LEAP” framework focuses on legal clarity, ecosystem growth, real-world adoption, and talent development, with a stablecoin licensing regime set to launch on August 1. The government also plans to regulate tokenized government bonds and ETFs, paving the way for secondary market trading of these products on licensed digital asset platforms. It aims to expand tokenization efforts into sectors like metals and renewable energy, highlighting use cases such as gold and solar panels. As reported, professionals working in the crypto and hedge fund sectors are playing a key role in supporting Hong Kong’s residential rental market , which continues to struggle due to weak traditional demand sources.

If you have the courage of your convictions, is now a good time to buy? Why will the market go up? With market sentiment for crypto in the toilet right now, who would be buying altcoins? That said, if you have the conviction that the market will go up again big time, starting to build positions now is perhaps not a bad idea. Why would the market go up? According to macro analyst Raoul Pal, a global liquidity increase is baked into the cake. With 10 trillion of debt to be rolled over in the next year, plenty of this will enter the crypto market = number go up. $XRP tests strong support Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $XRP reveals that the price is sitting nicely on top of the $2.30 horizontal support level. Some long candle wicks shooting below this level, and the $1.96 horizontal support suggest that this is probably a floor for $XRP buyers. Can the price come back down to that $1.96 support level? Yes, it certainly could. However, the weekly and the 2-week Stochastic RSI indicators are bottoming. There could still be an extended period of uncertainty, but things look very promising for $XRP going into the end of the year. $ADA beaten down to solid support level Source: TradingView The $ADA price is beaten down almost as far as it can go right now. The bulls have been unable to break a descending trend that goes all the way back to the end of August 2021. To top it all, the price is inside a descending triangle, which would usually break to the downside, and it is right against the bottom of the triangle now. While the measured downside move would take $ADA to zero, and it probably isn’t going there, at least not yet, there is the chance that the price could zip down to the $0.30 horizontal support level, just like it did on the 6 October. If this happened, it would be a strong buy. On the other hand, the price is already at strong support. Buying in here with a stop loss just below the support line could pay off well, with an increase to $0.80 to $0.85 at the top of the triangle quite likely. Is a $SUI buy a no-brainer? Source: TradingView Buying into $SUI around the current price level looks like an absolute no-brainer in the weekly chart. This is an extremely strong support/resistance level that goes right back to the beginning of $SUI price history. With the Stochastic RSI indicators right at the bottom, it’s surely only a matter of time before $SUI breaks through its downtrend and rallies strongly to the upside. Besides a stopover at $2.34, the price would be likely to go very quickly to the resistance level at $2.81. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

SUBBD Token Continues to Pump in Today’s Down Market.,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-set-to-rebound-subbd-token-pumps/,"Quick Facts: It’s been a rough month for Cardano as it slipped by 37% in the last 30 days—but a recovery could be right around the corner. A crypto analyst saw a TD sequential pattern, which could potentially signal a rebound for $ADA. If this movement reflects a wider trend in the crypto market, this could also benefit promising projects with a high potential upside, such as the SUBBD Token presale. Cardano ($ADA) is showing signs of stabilizing after a difficult stretch. The token has hovered around $0.535 in the past 24 hours, following a sharp drop below $0.50. With a TD Sequential pattern recently flagged by analysts, many are watching for a potential rebound. A recovery in $ADA could spark renewed optimism across the broader crypto market, particularly among traders hunting for value in overlooked assets. But while large caps like Cardano are searching for momentum, SUBBD ($SUBBD) has been quietly defying market gravity. The AI-powered content creation project has raised over $1.31 million in its presale, with tokens priced at $0.056875, reflecting strong traction even as major coins consolidate. Built on Ethereum, SUBBD merges artificial intelligence and Web3, allowing creators and fans to interact, monetize, and share tokenized content through a decentralized, subscription-based model. $ADA Trading at $0.535—But a Turnaround Could Happen Soon The world’s tenth-largest cryptocurrency, Cardano ($ADA), has been moving sideways around $0.535 over the past several hours after briefly dipping below $0.50 in yesterday’s session. According to analyst Ali Charts on X, a TD Sequential pattern forming on $ADA’s chart could signal that the coin is gearing up for a rebound, a welcome development for holders after a 37% slide over the past month. It’s been a shaky stretch across the market. Even Bitcoin ($BTC) momentarily slipped below the $100K mark, far from its all-time high set just a month earlier. Yet, despite the turbulence, traders remain on the hunt for opportunities, and their attention is shifting toward some of the best crypto presales showing strength against the trend. Presale tokens have the advantage of structured, step-based price appreciation, offering early investors transparent entry points and measurable upside potential. The most promising among them not only weather volatile conditions but often surge once listings go live, giving traders a chance to capture early momentum before the broader market follows suit. SUBBD: Transforming the Content Industry, One Token at a Time In a crowded field of crypto presales, only a select few manage to stand out — and SUBBD ($SUBBD) is one of them.

South Korean retail investors, once the lifeblood of cryptocurrency trading surges, are making a dramatic pivot that’s sending shockwaves through digital asset markets. The numbers tell a compelling story of changing priorities and shifting capital flows. Why Are South Korean Retail Investors Abandoning Crypto? The data reveals a stunning transformation. Average daily trading volume on Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has collapsed to just $1.78 billion in November. This represents an astonishing 80% decrease from the $9 billion peak recorded last December. Moreover, this marks the fourth consecutive month of declining activity, signaling a sustained trend rather than a temporary dip. What’s particularly revealing is the narrowing trading range. During last year’s market turbulence, Upbit’s daily volume swung wildly between $5 billion and $27 billion. This year, however, the exchange has settled into a much tighter band of $2 billion to $4 billion. The pattern repeats on Bithumb, confirming this isn’t an isolated phenomenon affecting just one platform. Where Has All the Crypto Capital Gone? The answer lies in traditional markets. South Korean retail investors have redirected their capital toward stocks, contributing significantly to the KOSPI index’s impressive 72% rise this year. This massive capital migration represents a fundamental shift in risk appetite and investment strategy among one of Asia’s most active retail trading communities. Several factors are driving this transition: Strong performance in traditional equity markets Reduced volatility compared to cryptocurrency assets Changing regulatory environment for digital assets Search for more stable investment returns What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Dynamics? South Korean retail investors have historically played a crucial role in cryptocurrency market cycles. For years, they’ve been known as the final wave of buyers during altcoin seasons, often jumping into parabolic rallies for assets like DOGE, PEPE, LUNA, and XRP. Their absence creates a significant void in market participation. The current situation suggests that cryptocurrency markets may need to wait for one of two catalysts to bring these investors back. Either the current stock market enthusiasm must wane, or a compelling new narrative must emerge in the crypto space to reignite their interest. Until then, the reduced participation from this key demographic could continue to impact trading volumes and market momentum. When Will South Korean Retail Investors Return to Crypto? Market analysts are watching several indicators that could signal a reversal of this trend. The relationship between stock market performance and cryptocurrency interest appears to be inverse – when traditional markets cool, capital often flows back to digital assets. Additionally, the emergence of new technological developments or regulatory clarity could trigger renewed interest. Key factors to monitor include: KOSPI index performance and volatility New cryptocurrency regulations in South Korea Emergence of compelling blockchain narratives Global macroeconomic conditions affecting risk appetite The dramatic shift among South Korean retail investors serves as a powerful reminder of how quickly capital can move between asset classes. While cryptocurrency markets face short-term headwinds from this capital flight, the underlying technology continues to evolve. The question isn’t if these investors will return, but when the right conditions will align to draw them back to digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions How much has crypto trading volume decreased in South Korea? Average daily trading volume on Upbit exchange has fallen 80% from $9 billion in December to $1.78 billion in November, marking four consecutive months of decline. Why are South Korean investors moving to stocks? Investors are attracted by the KOSPI index’s 72% rise this year and seek more stable returns compared to cryptocurrency’s high volatility. Which cryptocurrencies were most popular with South Korean investors? South Korean retail investors typically participated in parabolic rallies of assets like DOGE, PEPE, LUNA, and XRP during altcoin seasons. Will these investors return to cryptocurrency markets? Analysts believe they may return when stock market enthusiasm wanes or when compelling new crypto narratives emerge to attract their attention. How does this affect global cryptocurrency markets? Reduced participation from South Korean investors creates a significant void in market dynamics, potentially impacting trading volumes and momentum during altcoin seasons. What exchanges are most affected by this shift? Both Upbit and Bithumb exchanges show similar patterns of declining volumes and narrowing trading ranges. Found this analysis insightful?

The institutional investment firm cut its 2025 Bitcoin target from $185,000 to $120,000, citing a transition toward what it calls the “maturity era.” This new phase, the firm says, will be defined by lower volatility, slower appreciation, and greater institutional involvement. Galaxy’s research note pointed to the $19 billion liquidation event on October 10, sparked by tariff tensions between the US and China, as a key driver behind the target revision. The sudden deleveraging weakened liquidity and dented investor confidence, dragging Bitcoin briefly below $100,000 for the first time in six months. Meanwhile, competing assets such as gold and AI-linked equities have diverted capital from Bitcoin, while the rise of stablecoins has further reshaped investor attention in the crypto market.

Retail interest, which peaked during the 2021 bull run, remains muted despite brief revivals driven by meme coin speculation. The firm also noted a cooling effect on Bitcoin treasury companies, public firms that once tracked BTC’s price trajectory. As price momentum slows, these companies will need to focus on operational growth rather than speculative valuation gains tied to Bitcoin holdings. Key Market Insights: Bitcoin trading volume: $59 billion (24h) Market capitalization: $2.05 trillion Circulating supply: 19.94 million BTC Probability of $115K before $85K: 64%, according to Myriad predictions Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Holds Near $103K Support From a technical perspective, Bitcoin price is stabilizing around $103,300 following an 8% correction from October highs near $115,900. The two-hour chart shows a descending channel, with resistance near $104,400 and support at $100,400. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC reclaims $106,000, it could climb toward $110,000–$112,000. A drop below $102,000, however, risks testing the $97,600–$95,000 range, key psychological levels for traders. Despite the consolidation, the long-term structure suggests a higher-low formation, hinting at renewed upside once market sentiment improves. As Bitcoin enters its maturity phase, Galaxy remains long-term bullish, expecting the cryptocurrency to gradually regain momentum toward $120,000, a move that could restore investor confidence by year-end. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $25.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013225 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

He previously mentioned that clients want crypto to sit next to their stocks and bonds as Schwab prepares to roll out BTC and ETH trading. Wurster made the reveal at the firm’s annual event for RIAs, where they discussed the need for financial services firms to prioritize convenience. The investment company also discussed the potential for artificial intelligence avatars and the rise in gambling in the U.S., which it says is being mistaken for investing. U.S. regulatory clarity gives way for Charles Schwab’s crypto initiative 🚨JUST IN: $7 trillion Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster says the company plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of 2026. The bullish headlines just keep coming. Higher asset prices… not so much. pic.twitter.com/IWdRiiiZUQ — Tim Warren (@TimWarrenTrades) November 5, 2025 Wurster stated that there are numerous ways for clients to invest in crypto, and Charles Schwab provides insights and education on the industry. The firm’s CEO announced that it will initially focus on trading Bitcoin and Ethereum . He confirmed that it’ll be available on the company’s Thinkorswim platform, followed shortly after on Schwab.com and mobile. The tech executive also disclosed that the fine will not be applied to memecoin trading. He opts to leave that field for other players in the sector. Wurster added that the investment management firm plans to offer direct support to crypto investors. At the time of publication, Charles Schwab currently manages approximately $11 trillion in client assets on its balance sheet. The firm said it aims to leverage its established resources to offer secure and efficient trading services. The Texas brokerage’s initiative follows a friendlier crypto backdrop under the Trump administration. The OCC and FDIC have already confirmed that financial institutions can provide crypto trading, custody, and stablecoin services without requiring special approval, as long as they manage the associated risks. Wurster also acknowledged that, from a regulatory standpoint, nothing is preventing the firm from moving forward with its cryptocurrency initiative. Tyrone V. Toss Jr., a financial consultant with 401 Financial, mentioned that Charles Schwab’s crypto trading launch is on track. Still, there is acknowledged nervousness about ensuring the tech and operations are seamless. Ric Edelman, CEO of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, also agreed that the regulatory landscape for financial institutions is clearing. Edelman, who is advising Schwab on its crypto launch, believes there will be more regulatory clarity to come, expecting legislation in a few months to complete the picture. He argued that it will help every player in the field, including banks, brokerage firms, custodians, asset managers, and wealth advisors, to engage seamlessly. “We want to do it thoughtfully. We want to be able to have our own books and records and things like that. That is a completely new build, and we’ve got a group of technologists working on that.” -Rick Wurster, CEO of Charles Schwab. Wurster also revealed that the firm plans to roll out the crypto trading services in a strategic manner. He wants to have people pilot and test it, and later roll it out to both a small group of clients and a large group of clients. Charles Schwab launches Advisor Services business Charles Schwab’s top official confirmed that the offer will be a strong differentiator because it will allow clients to access crypto directly alongside their existing investments and the bank’s capabilities. Edelman also championed Wurster’s leadership, stating that he has been working closely with his crypto team to help develop their offerings and capabilities. Wurster disclosed that the firm’s Advisor Services business is deepening relationships with the 16,000 RIA companies it serves to build a broader support ecosystem that extends beyond custody. He also acknowledged that the brokerage has expanded its lending support, alternative capabilities, and its institutional, no-transaction-fee mutual fund platform to include funds from nearly 60 managers, offering clients no transaction fees. The asset manager also launched Advisor ProDirect to help breakaway advisers on their path to independence. Wurster added that the firm supported the largest adviser transition in the history of its industry by integrating OpenArc to its platform in September. Get seen where it counts.

Developed within the company’s intelligent sustainability framework, it anchors Preshent’s broader ecosystem by using blockchain technology to connect digital finance, infrastructure development, and environmental accountability. At the center of this model lies the PRSH token, the functional unit within Preshent Finance. Rather than existing as a speculative digital asset, PRSH is designed to circulate capital through projects with tangible results—renewable energy expansion, carbon reduction, and verified community benefits. Its mechanisms for staking, decentralized governance, and incentive distribution are directly linked to measurable data, reinforcing a feedback loop between economic growth and environmental progress. The technological foundation enabling this system is Preshent OS, a digital infrastructure that unifies data, intelligence, and finance. Built on a combination of cloud, blockchain, and energy frameworks, Preshent OS ensures interoperability and transparency across applications. Within this environment, the PRSH token operates as a transactional and governance layer—its movement, staking outcomes, and impact metrics all recorded on verifiable ledgers. This integration allows stakeholders to track sustainability claims in real time, reducing the risk of “greenwashing” and establishing an auditable trail of accountability. One of the most visible applications of the model is in renewable infrastructure partnerships with Tribal Nations across the Rio Grande Valley and Southern Rockies. These community-led projects demonstrate how tokenized finance can merge local empowerment with decentralized energy systems. By embedding PRSH into these programs, Preshent enables communities to access financial mechanisms typically limited to large institutional investors while retaining local governance and benefit distribution. Industry observers recognize PRSH as part of a growing impact-token movement, in which blockchain serves dual roles as a funding instrument and a verification system. Analysts note that this approach could democratize sustainability finance by providing a transparent structure for both contributors and beneficiaries. However, they also emphasize that governance design, interoperability, and accessibility will determine whether such systems achieve scale and resilience. What differentiates PRSH Finance is its integration of verified data rather than symbolic pledges. Each transaction and reward is linked to independently measurable outcomes, recorded within the Preshent OS framework. This alignment between technology and governance represents an early prototype for how financial ecosystems might evolve under increasing demands for ESG accountability. Looking forward, PRSH Finance aims to expand beyond regional projects to support a global network of tokenized sustainability initiatives, potentially interfacing with systems like Tesla Powerwall, Ethereum, and Base for broader interoperability. The ambition is to create an economy where value flows not merely through markets but through verifiable environmental performance. By embedding financial activity within transparent, data-driven architecture, PRSH Finance illustrates how capital can operate as both an economic and ecological engine. While still at a formative stage, it stands as an example of how blockchain, governance, and sustainability can converge to create a measurable, accountable financial ecosystem for the future.

This innovative model leverages the power of blockchain to foster transparency and accountability in environmental projects. Core Features of PRSH Finance Central to PRSH Finance is the PRSH token, which is vital in circulating capital through eco-friendly projects like renewable energy and carbon reduction initiatives. Unlike typical cryptocurrencies, PRSH is deeply entwined with real-world environmental benefits, ensuring that each investment contributes directly to sustainable goals. Technological Backbone: Preshent OS The robustness of PRSH Finance is supported by Preshent OS, a comprehensive digital infrastructure that amalgamates data management, intelligent analytics, and financial operations on a unified blockchain and cloud framework. This system not only enhances the efficiency of financial transactions but ensures that all sustainability claims are verifiable and transparent. Innovative Applications and Partnerships PRSH Finance has already initiated significant projects in collaboration with Tribal Nations in the Rio Grande Valley and Southern Rockies, focusing on renewable energy and local empowerment. By integrating the PRSH token into these initiatives, Preshent enables community-led projects to thrive, ensuring financial and governance autonomy. Market Reception and Future Outlook The introduction of PRSH Finance has not gone unnoticed in the financial technology sector. Industry experts recognize its potential to revolutionize sustainability finance by providing clear, accountable frameworks for investment. Moving forward, PRSH Finance plans to extend its reach globally, potentially integrating with major systems like Tesla Powerwall and Ethereum to enhance its interoperability and scope. Conclusion PRSH Finance by Preshent stands out for its commitment to real, measurable sustainability outcomes, backed by a robust technological framework. It represents a significant step forward in aligning financial mechanisms with environmental goals, paving the way for a sustainable economic future.

This innovative product offers unprecedented opportunities for traders seeking exposure to assets before their official spot market listing. What Are STABLE Pre-Market Perpetual Futures? STABLE pre-market perpetual futures represent a groundbreaking trading instrument that allows investors to gain early exposure to digital assets. These contracts function similarly to traditional perpetual futures but with a crucial distinction – they trade before the underlying asset lists on Binance’s spot market. The platform will support these STABLE pre-market perpetual futures with up to 5x leverage, providing enhanced trading flexibility. Traders can access these instruments starting November 6 at 12:00 p.m. UTC. The timing aligns with market hours when global trading activity typically peaks, ensuring adequate liquidity from launch. How Do STABLE Pre-Market Contracts Work? The mechanics of STABLE pre-market perpetual futures follow a straightforward process. These contracts enable price discovery for assets before their official exchange listing. However, the most innovative feature involves automatic conversion – when Binance lists the asset on its spot market, the pre-market trading ceases immediately. At that point, the STABLE pre-market perpetual futures automatically convert to standard perpetual futures contracts. This seamless transition eliminates manual intervention requirements and ensures continuous trading exposure. The conversion mechanism represents a significant improvement over previous pre-market trading solutions. Why Should Traders Consider STABLE Pre-Market Trading? STABLE pre-market perpetual futures offer several compelling advantages for cryptocurrency enthusiasts: Early Access – Trade assets before official spot market listing Leverage Opportunities – Utilize up to 5x leverage for amplified positions Price Discovery – Participate in establishing initial market prices Automatic Conversion – Seamless transition to standard perpetual contracts Risk Management – Hedge positions before full market availability The 5x leverage feature particularly enhances trading flexibility while maintaining reasonable risk parameters compared to higher leverage options available elsewhere. What Happens During the Conversion Process? The transition from STABLE pre-market perpetual futures to standard contracts occurs automatically upon spot market listing. This process ensures no trading interruptions and maintains position continuity. Traders don’t need to take any action – their exposure automatically converts to the new contract type. This automated approach eliminates potential gaps or settlement complications that could arise from manual processes. The system design reflects Binance’s commitment to providing smooth, professional-grade trading experiences for all users engaging with STABLE pre-market perpetual futures. Are There Any Trading Considerations? While STABLE pre-market perpetual futures offer exciting opportunities, traders should consider several factors. Pre-market trading typically involves different liquidity conditions compared to established markets. Additionally, the 5x leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses, requiring careful position sizing. The automatic conversion feature provides certainty about the contract’s lifecycle, but traders should monitor announcements regarding potential spot listings that could trigger the conversion process for their STABLE pre-market perpetual futures positions. Final Thoughts on Binance’s Latest Innovation Binance’s introduction of STABLE pre-market perpetual futures demonstrates the exchange’s ongoing commitment to product innovation and market leadership. This new instrument bridges the gap between pre-listing anticipation and formal market availability, providing traders with sophisticated tools for early market participation. The combination of pre-market access, reasonable leverage, and automated conversion creates a compelling package for serious cryptocurrency traders. As the November 6 launch approaches, market participants should prepare to explore these new STABLE pre-market perpetual futures opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions What time do STABLE pre-market perpetual futures launch? Trading begins at 12:00 p.m. UTC on November 6, 2023. How much leverage do these contracts support? STABLE pre-market perpetual futures support up to 5x leverage. What happens when the asset lists on Binance spot? Pre-market trading ceases and contracts automatically convert to standard perpetual futures. Are there any trading fees for these contracts? Fee structures typically align with Binance’s standard perpetual futures fees, but check the official announcement for specifics. Can I trade these contracts on mobile? Yes, STABLE pre-market perpetual futures will be available through Binance’s mobile applications. What assets will have pre-market futures? Binance will announce specific assets eligible for STABLE pre-market perpetual futures trading separately. Found this guide to STABLE pre-market perpetual futures helpful?

As Solana becomes a centerpiece of institutional portfolios, questions are mounting over whether its infrastructure can sustain high-frequency activity across ETFs, wallets, and consumer apps. Web3 infrastructure firm Alchemy said to meet this rising demand it has completely re-architected its Solana stack. The overhaul aims to deliver near-zero downtime, faster responses, and greater throughput, ensuring institutional and retail users experience a seamless network even under heavy load. This week Solana appears to have shrugged off broader Fed-induced FUD, with policymakers reiterating that December rate cuts are “not a foregone conclusion” this week. BSOL has opened the floodgates to $417 million in fresh capital for Solana’s ecosystem as a fresh touch point for U.S. investors to gain regulated access to SOL staking yields. What a week for $BSOL , besides the big volume, it led all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows with +$417m ($IBIT had a rare off week, it'll be back). It also ranked it 16th in overall flows for the week. Big time debut. pic.twitter.com/HpKUTdq1J5 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 1, 2025 Built for Scale and Speed Alchemy explains its Solana rebuild was the culmination of two years of collaboration with developers across the ecosystem. Working alongside teams from Bags.fm, Solflare, and Robinhood, the company studied the real bottlenecks developers faced when accessing Solana data and processing transactions. The result is an all-new generation of RPC and Streaming APIs built specifically for Solana. The upgraded infrastructure delivers 20 times faster archive calls, 99.95% uptime, and double the throughput of its previous version. Alchemy’s engineering team has also improved the system to handle large data sets with greater reliability, enabling near-instant responses on transaction-heavy workloads. The result is faster user experiences on exchanges, wallets, and analytics platforms that depend on constant access to on-chain data. Solving the “Chewing Glass” Challenge Solana developers have long referred to the network’s complexity as “chewing glass” — a metaphor for the demanding technical environment they’ve embraced to build next-generation financial products. While Solana’s core protocol has matured, the surrounding tooling and infrastructure often struggled to keep pace. Alchemy’s research found that many developers encountered recurring issues accessing historical data due to limitations in Bigtable-based RPC systems, which caused missing records, throttling, or incomplete data sets. This forced teams to build complex workarounds that slowed iteration and inflated costs. The new Solana architecture eliminates those constraints, dramatically accelerating heavy data methods such as getTransaction and getProgramAccounts while maintaining reliability under scale. Infrastructure for the Institutional Era With ETF adoption accelerating and Western Union preparing to launch a stablecoin on Solana in 2026, the chain is entering an institutional era where uptime and precision matter as much as speed. By rebuilding Solana’s “plumbing” from the ground up, Alchemy has positioned the network to handle sustained institutional traffic and mass-market consumer applications without compromising performance. As Solana’s ecosystem matures, Alchemy’s overhaul signals a crucial inflection point — one where the network evolves from “chewing glass” to powering finance at scale.

Australia uderza w hakerów. Rząd oficjalnie ogłosił sankcje wobec wspomnianych ugrupowań. Do sprawy odniosła się także minister spraw zagranicznych Penny Wong. Poinformowała ona, że decyzja jest odpowiedzią na intensyfikujące się cyberataki, finansujące broń masowego rażenia w Korei Północnej. Minister spraw zagranicznych Penny Wong poinformowała, że decyzja jest odpowiedzią na nasilające się cyberataki finansujące program broni masowego rażenia w Korei Północnej. W oświadczeniu stwierdziła: Australia objęła sankcjami grupy Lazarus , Kimsuky , Andariel i Chosun Expo . Sankcje dotknęły także hakera Park Jin-hyoka , który wcześniej znalazł się już na listach sankcji USA i Korei Południowej. Kradzieże na rekordowym poziomie Raport ONZ Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team wskazał, że północnokoreańscy hakerzy ukradli w 2024 roku kryptowaluty o wartości 1,9 miliarda dolarów australijskich. To tym bardziej niepokojące, że rok wcześniej wartość ta była o połowę mniejsza. Tegoroczne straty z pewnością zapiszą się jako niechlubny rekord. Minister Wong powiedziała, że Australia będzie działać wspólnie z sojusznikami, by ograniczyć finansowanie reżimu w Pjongjangu. Wszyscy wiemy, jak duże zagrożenie stwarza Korea Północna dla regionu. Szukamy sposobów, by odciąć ich od środków finansowych. To ważny element presji na reżim. Dodała także, że: Skala zaangażowania Korei Północnej w złośliwe działania cybernetyczne, w tym kradzieże kryptowalut, fałszywe prace IT i szpiegostwo, jest głęboko niepokojąca. Większą liczbę ataków wymierzonych w rynek kryptowalut dostrzegli także eksperci ds. cyberbezpieczeństwa. Hakerzy nieustannie szukają luk w zabezpieczeniach, a także wykorzystują błędy użytkowników, przejmując ich zasoby.

Walka z cyberprzestępczością wchodzi w nowy etap Światowe rządy przestają tolerować ataki na infrastrukturę finansową. Kolejnym tego sygnałem są australijskie sankcje. To kolejne państwo po Wielkiej Brytanii, Korei Południowej i USA, które podjęły kroki wobec hakerów. Eksperci ostrzegają jednak, że sankcje powinny stanowić zaledwie fragment szerszej strategii w walce z atakami internetowymi. Hakerzy adaptują się bardzo szybko i wykorzystują coraz bardziej zaawansowane techniki, zagłębiając się w możliwości blockchainu. Dlatego coraz więcej inwestorów szuka rozwiązań, które pozwolą im zabezpieczyć środki w sposób niezależny od giełd i pośredników. Aplikacje non-custodial, takie jak Best Wallet, zyskują na znaczeniu. Web 3.0, DeFi i nowe możliwości Rozwój rynku Web 3.0 to również naturalny rozwój Best Wallet. Użytkownicy mają aktualnie dostęp w aplikacji do zdecentralizowanych giełd. Mogą handlować tam tokenami w różnych sieciach blockchain. Dostępna jest także historia transakcji bez konieczności opuszczania portfela. W sekcji „Apps” dostępne są popularne aplikacje DeFi, takie jak Uniswap, PancakeSwap czy DexTools. Są tam także narzędzia analityczne i informacyjne: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap czy Crypto News. Dla osób zastanawiających się, w które kryptowaluty zainwestować , to ogromne ułatwienie. Wszystkie dane rynkowe dostępne są w jednym miejscu. W planach twórców Best Wallet znajduje się też galeria NFT, agregator stakingu i rozszerzenie przeglądarkowe. Dzięki temu aplikacja ma szansę stać się pełnoprawnym centrum zarządzania cyfrowymi aktywami. Nowa rzeczywistość cyfrowych finansów W świecie, w którym cyberatak może w kilka minut pozbawić inwestora wszystkich środków, bezpieczeństwo staje się kluczowym elementem każdego projektu kryptowalutowego. Australia, nakładając sankcje na grupę Lazarus, wysłała jasny sygnał, że era bezkarności dla hakerów się kończy. Rosnąca popularność narzędzi takich jak Best Wallet pokazuje, że społeczność kryptowalutowa ma zupełnie nowe potrzeby. Inwestorzy coraz częściej wybierają rozwiązania, które nie tylko ułatwiają handel, ale też zapewniają realną ochronę. W 2025 roku to właśnie takie aplikacje będą stanowiły nowy standard bezpieczeństwa w świecie cyfrowych aktywów.",Crypto News|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|UNI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 12:18:12

In a research brief highlighted by crypto researcher SMQKE, it frames the listing as a notable development in the institutionalisation of digital asset firms, citing the company’s plan to access public markets at a time when other major crypto players are preparing similar moves. DBS explains Ripple’s IPO plans in the context of a growing interest in crypto companies on the stock market. They point out that several big crypto firms have recently gone public and performed well, especially those connected to stablecoins and crypto exchanges. DBS BANK: RIPPLE PLANS TO IPO IN 2026 Ripple is the only company with a publicly traded native asset (XRP) directly positioned to capture the momentum crypto IPO. pic.twitter.com/2iln1VW5wU — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 4, 2025 DBS’s assessment underscores that Ripple’s approach differs from many peers because its corporate valuation and market strategy are closely connected to the on-chain dynamics of the cryptocurrency XRP. The bank highlights pre-IPO valuations of crypto firms as exceeding the benchmark set by a recent, high-profile IPO, noting that expectations for Ripple’s market capitalization are substantial given its existing exposure to retail and institutional payment corridors. DBS also points to growing regulatory clarity and licence approvals in key jurisdictions as enabling conditions for such IPOs. Market reaction and community perspectives Responses within the crypto community have ranged from cautious to enthusiastic. Commentators on the X platform referenced DBS’s research as credible confirmation rather than a mere rumor, given the bank’s standing in Asian capital markets. Some market participants emphasised that users transacting stablecoins or other tokens on the XRP Ledger contribute indirectly to token dynamics, with implications for supply and demand mechanics ahead of a public listing. Others framed the IPO as a potential watershed event, arguing that public ownership of a company closely linked to a widely traded digital token introduces new considerations for institutional investors and regulators. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry observers have also noted the timing of Ripple’s planned IPO against a backdrop of major exchanges and crypto service firms seeking licenses and preparing their own public filings. DBS’s report situates the listing within that competitive and regulatory landscape, suggesting that the public markets are becoming a more accessible route for well-capitalised crypto businesses seeking broader investor bases. Regulatory Considerations If Ripple proceeds as indicated, regulators may be prompted to refine frameworks that address the interplay between corporate equity and associated token ecosystems. DBS’s publication reinforces the view that such a listing would mark a consequential step in crypto’s integration with conventional capital markets, meriting close attention from investors, exchanges, and policymakers.

Ethereum’s short squeeze could drive major price recovery, boosting overall market sentiment and drive $ETH’s price even higher. PEPENODE introduces a gamified, virtual mining system, allowing users to mine meme coins without physical hardware. PEPENODE aims to become a leader in the meme coin space by blending gaming and mining with tiered rewards and meme coin incentives. In recent weeks, Ethereum (ETH) has witnessed a notable price drop, dipping 13% from its previous highs, down to $3,055. This price correction has created the perfect conditions for a short squeeze. According to experts, Ethereum is on the verge of a $7B short squeeze, which could accelerate its price recovery to as high as $4,100. A short squeeze happens when traders betting against an asset are forced to buy back their positions after a sudden price rise, accelerating the rally even further. That dynamic could soon play out for Ethereum ($ETH), where rising short interest and improving sentiment are setting the stage for a sharp rebound. A major Ethereum rebound wouldn’t just lift $ETH. It could send a wave of renewed confidence through altcoins and DeFi tokens, resetting momentum across the crypto market. According to market analysts, the technical indicators for Ethereum are beginning to look bullish, as short positions accumulate. That environment is already drawing attention to new projects aligned with Ethereum’s ecosystem narrative. One of the most talked-about among them is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a presale project that’s tapping into the excitement with a gamified, virtual mining model designed to merge meme culture, DeFi mechanics, and interactive rewards. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Revolutionizing Crypto Mining with Gamification and Meme Coin Rewards PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) brings an entirely new twist to crypto mining. Instead of relying on costly hardware setups or energy-intensive operations, it introduces a gamified virtual mining system where users can earn rewards by participating in a simulated, play-to-earn environment. Through the purchase of Miner Nodes, participants can build and upgrade virtual server rooms, boosting their mining efficiency and reward potential. This model combines the thrill of traditional mining with the accessibility and creativity of Web3 gaming, no hardware, no high electricity bills, just pure engagement and on-chain participation. The PEPENODE platform reimagines crypto mining through a fully gamified virtual ecosystem that mirrors traditional mining without the cost or complexity. Users can access a Mining Dashboard that tracks real-time hashrate, energy usage, and rewards, creating an immersive, data-driven experience that feels authentic yet effortless. Participants can simulate full-scale mining operations and earn rewards in popular meme coins like PEPE and Fartcoin, all within an intuitive interface that eliminates the need for hardware, setup, or energy expenses. The ongoing PEPENODE presale gives early adopters a distinct advantage. Tokens are currently priced at $0.0011363 per $PEPENODE, with step-based price increases as the sale progresses, rewarding those who secure their positions early as demand accelerates. This presale offers a “Buy and Stake” option, allowing users to earn boosted returns from the outset, even before the official Token Generation Event (TGE). Additionally, early participation is rewarded with higher-powered nodes, which means increased earnings potential once the mining functionality is activated. The platform’s adoption of Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism means that it is energy-efficient, consuming 99.95% less power than traditional Proof of Work models. This environmental advantage makes it more accessible to users who are concerned about the sustainability of cryptocurrency mining. As PEPENODE prepares for its TGE launch, several features catch the eye: Virtual Mining Simulator : After TGE, users can begin assembling and customizing their virtual mining rigs, earn rewards, and compete on a leaderboard for meme coin bonuses. Tiered Node Rewards : Early participants will earn higher rewards through tiered nodes that increase in power and return rates, making it crucial to act early to maximize returns. Meme Coin Rewards : The platform integrates meme coins directly into the mining rewards, providing an additional layer of fun and engagement for users. With a total supply of over 210 billion $PEPENODE tokens, the presale raises are crucial for the project’s ecosystem. The proceeds will help enhance the virtual mining game, expand node types, and build partnerships with top meme coin projects. Additionally, PEPENODE aims to list on major exchanges in Q4 2025/Q1 2026, bringing its innovative gamified mining approach to a broader audience. Based on PEPENODE’s utility and investor appeal, our price prediction for $PEPENODE places the token at $0.0123 or higher by 2030, yielding a 5-year ROI of 982%. Now is the time to participate in the PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) presale before the token price rises further. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before making any investment decisions.

The majority of participants in a recent poll believe in a better future for Bitcoin and the likes, while many of them are reporting losses as a result of the latest downturn. Russian crypto investors keep buying Bitcoin Despite the recent steep decline in prices, many in Russia are optimistic about the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies in terms of investment opportunities. That’s according to a new survey conducted among the subscribers of RBC Crypto, a major source of news in the Russian digital asset space, part of the business information portal RBC. Almost a third of the respondents are currently acquiring coins, while many admit to losing money on their previous purchases, the pollsters found out, highlighting: “Market sentiment survey results showed that 30.09% of participants ‘believe in growth and are buying’.” Over a quarter, a little more than 26%, described the situation as “difficult,” falling into a segment that’s “in the red.” Around 20% of the questioned traders said they had “everything under control” and are adapting to the new market realities. Approximately 17.5% are “watching from the sidelines,” and almost 6.4% agreed with the statement “undecided.” The price of Bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, recently dropped below $100,000 for the first time in four months. That of Ethereum (ETH), the coin with the second-largest capitalization, fell to $3,000. The authors of the study commented: “Such a sharp decline is rare. Almost all altcoins in the top 100 are in the red, and crypto exchanges have liquidated traders’ positions worth billions of dollars in just a few days.” The prices of major cryptocurrencies have recovered slightly since then, with BTC trading above $102,000, at the time of writing, and ETH selling for over $3,300. Many crypto traders remain uncertain Uncertainty is the predominant sentiment among the members of RBC Crypto’s Telegram channel, the report also noted. As many as 40% are wondering whether the current prices are “good for buying.” Around 22% think it’s the right time to enter the market. Some 16% are actually considering buying, while another 22% may wait longer as they expect further decline. Analysts interviewed by RBC Crypto warned at the end of October that “bulls’ strength is waning” and set the bears’ target at $96,500, predicting the market downturn in early November. Bitcoin’s local low on the morning of November 5 was a little higher, with the price briefly bottoming at around $98,900, the Russian crypto news outlet remarked. At the end of last month, the Belarus-registered crypto broker Cifra Markets, which provides services in Russia and the region, predicted that BTC would surpass $130,000 by the end of 2025. Russia is yet to regulate crypto investments Crypto assets are not as readily available in Russia as in other jurisdictions, at least when it comes to legal options to acquire them. Despite its long-standing opposition to legalizing operations with decentralized digital money, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) eventually permitted some crypto investments, mainly through derivatives. However, these are only available to a narrow category of “highly qualified,” high-income investors, and within a special “experimental legal regime” (ELR). The latter also allows Russian firms to make coin payments exclusively in foreign trade. Despite the restrictions and the lack of regulatory recognition, ordinary citizens have been buying Bitcoin. According to a recent estimate, some 20 million Russians already hold at least $40 billion worth of digital assets, as reported by Cryptopolitan. In October, the CBR announced it’s going to authorize Russian banks to work with cryptocurrencies and indicated it expects new legislation comprehensively regulating crypto investments to be adopted by the Russian parliament in 2026.

Accordingly, the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energies (ITER), under the supervision of the Tenerife Island Council, announced that it would sell 97 Bitcoins, which it purchased for $10,000 in 2012 for blockchain research. It is expected to earn approximately $10 million in revenue in exchange for these BTCs. Tenerife innovation consultant Juan José Martínez said in an official statement that they worked with a Spanish financial institution authorized by the Bank of Spain and the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to facilitate the sale of BTC. Martínez stated that the transaction is expected to be completed in the coming months and that the proceeds will be used to finance ITER's own ongoing research projects, including quantum technologies. Stating that the purchase in 2012 was never considered an investment, Martínez stated that the purchase of these BTCs was part of an experimental project to understand the blockchain infrastructure. Given that the current Bitcoin price is around $102,400, ITER's holdings are worth over $10 million. When Bitcoin reached a record high of $126,100 in early October, its holdings were worth over $12 million. *This is not investment advice.

The exchange began when Mr. Intuitive (@BlackberryXRP), a well-known supporter of the digital asset, posted “On XRPL.” Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, replied that “on XRP sounds better, but you get the police coming after you if you say this,” as XRP supporters are often criticized for referring to projects that run on the ledger as running on XRP. However, Garlinghouse joined the conversation, stating , “I agree, on XRP sounds better.” Garlinghouse’s comment reflects his consistent commitment to XRP and its positioning as more than just a token. He has previously stated that XRP is at the core of Ripple’s plans to modernize global payments, and positioning the asset as the face of the ecosystem makes that vision clearer. I agree, on XRP sounds better — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) November 5, 2025 Garlinghouse’s Steadfast Support for XRP Since taking leadership of Ripple, Garlinghouse has remained one of the most vocal advocates for XRP’s utility in cross-border settlement. He has repeatedly emphasized that XRP provides the liquidity and efficiency needed to bridge traditional financial systems with blockchain technology . His statement reinforces his view of XRP as a functional asset at the heart of Ripple’s systems. Garlinghouse’s confidence in XRP has been tested through years of regulatory scrutiny, particularly during the company’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following the resolution of the SEC lawsuit , Ripple has accelerated its global operations. The company expanded its services into regions where regulatory clarity for digital assets is more defined, securing partnerships with major payment providers and financial institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Symbol of Confidence in XRP Garlinghouse’s agreement that “on XRP sounds better” resonates with a community that closely follows every development around the token and its underlying ledger. He has spent over a decade advocating for XRP , and his statement shows that the asset remains central to the company’s innovation and expansion. With regulatory clarity achieved and new partnerships continuing to form, Garlinghouse’s latest comment reinforces the community’s confidence in XRP’s role as a bridge between digital assets and the global financial system.

According to analysts, the tension between these two groups could decide whether BTC continues its rebound or slips back below $100,000. LTHs Distribute as BTC Battles to Stay Above $100K Market watcher JA Maartunn says Bitcoin is entering what he calls a “mid-bull phase,” a period where LTHs begin distributing their coins after months of accumulation. “LTHs build bottoms; STHs build tops,” they explained in a recent thread on X. The data shows that in the last 30 days, around 363,000 BTC have left LTH wallets and shifted to STH hands, signaling a round of profit-taking rather than renewed accumulation. Currently, LTHs hold about 73.6% of the flagship cryptocurrency’s supply, amounting to 14.62 million BTC, which is near record highs. However, BTC that has lain dormant in older wallets is also being revived. Maartunn claims that in the last 12 months, 1.17 million BTC aged between three and five years have been moved, alongside more minor but notable activity from units held for more than seven and even ten years. They also noted that Coin Days Destroyed, a metric that tracks long-term spending, stands at 17.48 million, confirming that veteran investors are gradually distributing their holdings into strength. The timing coincides with heightened volatility in BTC’s price. After a recent slide that pushed it just under $99,000, Bitcoin recovered to about $104,000 on Thursday, only to dip again to $103,000 at the time of this writing. While the current price still represents a 1.2% gain in the last 24 hours, it remains down 6.7% over the week and nearly 17% below its October all-time high, when it went past $126,000. STHs in Focus as Market Awaits Next Move The bigger question now is whether short-term holders will stay firm. According to Maartunn’s data, Bitcoin could drop even more if this group gives up, but if they keep buying and maintain conviction, they might help the price go up. There are a number of signs that this could happen. For one, the Fear and Greed Index has moved into “Extreme Fear” territory, which has historically been a sign of local bottoms and an opportunity for buying. Meanwhile, exchange balances are hovering around a seven-year low of 2.38 million BTC, suggesting limited immediate selling pressure. As such, market technicians are watching the $100,000–$104,000 range closely, saying that this zone matches an earlier area where liquidity was absorbed. The implication is that it could serve as a base for a stronger bounce, with analyst Michaël van de Poppe believing a move above $112,000 would confirm a return to bullish structure.

In this context, USDD has redefined what it means to be a secure and transparent stablecoin. Recent turmoil in the stablecoin market has underscored the importance of clear, verifiable collateral and governance. The failures of several major stablecoins have demonstrated the catastrophic effects of opaque operations and centralized control. In response to these challenges, USDD has emerged as a leader by adopting an entirely decentralized and overcollateralized model, moving away from the precarious practices of its predecessors. An In-Depth Look at USDD's Overcollateralization and Transparency USDD has embraced a model where user trust is earned through an unassailable system of overcollateralization and transparency. This approach is detailed in its shift to USDD 2.0, which abandons reliance on algorithmic mechanisms in favor of robust, verifiable safeguards. USDD's collateral reserves are not only significant but also publicly verifiable. As of early August 2025, the total collateral value exceeded $620 million, as reported by Messari . The rigorous and frequent audits by third-party firms like CertiK and ChainSecurity further bolster confidence in USDD's infrastructure, ensuring that the management of assets and the minting of new tokens are up to high security standards. Ensuring Immutability and User Control in Token Design USDD's commitment to safety extends to its token design. It features a decentralized model where no single authority has the power to alter, pause, or freeze the stablecoin. This is a significant assurance for users concerned about the centralized control typical of other stablecoins. Instances of significant USDT freezes, involving amounts up to $44 million , highlight the dangers of centralized control which USDD aims to avoid. The Evolution from USDDOLD to USDD 2.0 The transition from USDDOLD, an algorithmic stablecoin, to the fully collateralized USDD 2.0 marks a significant evolution. This new version not only enhances security but also gives users direct control over the minting process and on-chain verification of all collateral. The introduction of the Smart Allocator, which has generated substantial revenue independently, exemplifies USDD's commitment to sustainable operations without relying on external funding. The Importance of User-Verified Security in Modern Finance In today's digital finance environment, the ability for users to verify the security and stability of their assets is invaluable. USDD's framework allows users to actively engage with its security features, turning abstract promises into tangible, verifiable facts. Moreover, USDD's transparent practices and solid security measures such as public audits, real-time reserve tracking, and a prohibition on central control, ensure that it stands out as a reliable choice in the stablecoin market. Ultimately, in the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, USDD provides a ""seatbelt"" - a set of reliable and transparent protections that users can trust and verify independently.

54096850,622862,1762436458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54096850.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $26M as Next Crypto to Explode Targets $BTC’s Biggest Weakness,https://bitcoinist.com/next-crypto-to-explode-hits-26m-in-viral-presale/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has raised over $26M in its presale, with $239K flowing in over the past 24 hours alone. 2⃣ The project aims to solve Bitcoin’s long-standing scalability issue by merging Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM) speed. 3⃣ Users can bridge $BTC into the Hyper Layer-2 for sub-second, near-zero-fee transactions, DeFi access, and cross-chain interoperability. 4⃣ $HYPER powers the ecosystem through staking, governance, airdrops, and staking rewards (45%). Bitcoin undoubtedly carries the largest mindshare in crypto. It commands over half of the total industry’s market value with a $2T+ market cap. Yet, beneath that dominance lies an old problem. The network moves at a snail’s pace. It’s capable of processing up to seven transactions per second (TPS). And fees can sometimes skyrocket toward $100. In a world where Solana can process around 65K TPS and Ethereum Layer 2s move in microseconds, Bitcoin feels frozen in 2010. But that’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. The project has already pulled in over $26M in its presale, including $239.2K in just the last 24 hours alone, as investors rally behind its mission to make Bitcoin great again and become the next crypto to explode . By combining Bitcoin’s unparalleled security with the raw processing speed and power of Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper could finally make the mother of crypto usable for payments, dApps, and even DeFi. But to understand why that matters, we need to first explore what’s been holding Bitcoin back, and how Bitcoin Hyper plans to fix it. Bitcoin Can Store Value, But Not Keep Up Bitcoin will likely forever remain the largest crypto asset on the planet. But beneath all its dominance lies an uncomfortable truth: it’s slow. The Bitcoin network is currently processing around 6.5 TPS in real-time, with block times as slow as nine minutes and 20 seconds and finality at a full hour. It may not sound so bad right now, but if we were to compare that with modern blockchains, the difference is alarming. Networks like Solana are able to handle over 750 TPS in real-time , with theoretical peaks of 65K+ TPS. Even Ethereum Layer 2s like Base are able to push well above 100 TPS. Block times and finality are also within a matter of seconds for Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron. On Solana or Base, developers can deploy full DeFi ecosystems, NFT marketplaces, and meme coins in days. On Bitcoin, those same ideas hit a wall of cost and latency that makes it impossible. That’s why the network rarely sees new apps or active users. Bitcoin is secure and battle-tested, sure, but it’s also isolated. The Bitcoin network was never designed for high throughput. It’s a secure settlement layer but not an environment for execution. So, as other chains evolved into high-speed, app-rich ecosystems, Bitcoin has been left behind. That’s the problem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) wants to fix: scaling Bitcoin without sacrificing what makes it Bitcoin. How Bitcoin Hyper Makes Bitcoin Great Again Bitcoin Hyper is built to do what Bitcoin itself could never: scale. It’s not a fork, and it’s not a sidechain. It’s a full Layer-2 ecosystem anchored directly to Bitcoin’s base layer, combining Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s raw speed. Here’s how it works. You send $BTC to a verified address. A smart contract reads the Bitcoin blockchain to confirm your deposit, then mints an equal amount of $BTC on Hyper’s Layer-2. Once there, your transactions move at SVM speed. Think sub-second confirmations and near-zero gas fees. Every batch of transactions is later bundled, verified using zero-knowledge proofs , and committed back to Bitcoin’s Layer-1 for settlement. Your $BTC stays secure while becoming as fast and flexible as any modern token. Because it’s built on the SVM, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t starting from scratch. Developers can easily port existing Solana apps straight onto Hyper, instantly expanding Bitcoin’s ecosystem. That includes DeFi platforms , NFT marketplaces, and cross-chain protocols. All interoperable across Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. For users, that means you can finally do something with $BTC. You can stake Bitcoin, farm yield, or send it globally in seconds without paying dollars in fees. For traders, it opens the door to Bitcoin meme coins. And for builders, you have a new execution layer. Learn everything you need to know in our detailed Bitcoin Hyper review . Presale Demand Shows Massive Confidence in Bitcoin Hyper Investor interest in Bitcoin Hyper has been growing and growing. The project has already raised over $26M, a feat not many presales can claim. In the past 24 hours alone, $HYPER has experienced four big buys totalling $239.2K ( $20.1K + $10.4K + $140.3K + $68.4K ). Tokens are currently available at $0.013225, with the end of each stage of the presale resulting in a price climb. We forecast a Bitcoin Hyper price prediction of $1.50 being possible by 2030 if the team delivers and adoption continues. Inside the ecosystem, $HYPER also acts as the fuel. It powers transactions, staking, governance, and access to new project launches built on the Hyper Layer-2. Holders also get airdrop access and can stake their tokens for up to 45% rewards. Discover how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our comprehensive step-by-step guide. This combination of real utility with meme energy has helped Bitcoin Hyper gain so much attention. It’s positioned as the first credible attempt to make Bitcoin fast, cheap, and programmable. $HYPER is still in presale, and early access remains open. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today and be a part of Bitcoin’s evolution. As always, this article does not constitute financial advice. Presales and crypto in general carry inherent risks.

The change highlights the growing tension between digital payment platforms and constitutional rights in the United States, where financial intermediaries are increasingly pressured to define what counts as “lawful commerce.” The update also underscores the delicate balance between regulatory compliance, political neutrality, and consumer freedom. Crypto firms are facing greater scrutiny over how their platforms interact with constitutional protections like the Second Amendment in the evolving digital payments landscape. Circle’s policy update and its implications On 5 November, Circle announced that it would amend a clause in its Prohibited Transactions policy, removing language that banned using USDC to purchase “weapons of any kind.” The updated policy now allows lawful transactions involving firearms, stating that the company’s ban applies only to weapons purchases that violate applicable laws. In a statement sent to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the company said it has “always held that the use of money should be free for lawful purposes,” including those protected under the Second Amendment. The amendment brings Circle’s policy in line with constitutional guarantees that allow citizens “to keep and bear arms.” The company confirmed that it will continue to prohibit USDC transactions linked to illegal or high-risk activities such as money laundering, unlicensed gambling, and fraudulent investment schemes. However, the updated wording clarifies that firearm purchases are permissible if they comply with US laws. Political and industry reactions Senator Cynthia Lummis publicly praised the decision, noting that Circle’s update “defends constitutional rights” while ensuring that financial systems are not “weaponised against law-abiding gun owners.” Senator Cynthia Lummis @SenLummis · Follow After discussions w/ Circle, I’m glad they now allow legal firearm purchases using its stablecoin. By aligning its terms of service w/ existing legal requirements, Circle defends constitutional rights & ensures financial systems can’t be weaponized against law-abiding gun owners. 10:52 PM · Nov 5, 2025 615 Reply Copy link Read 33 replies Her comments followed weeks of online criticism directed at the company from conservative organisations. The backlash began in October when Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) flagged the original policy’s restrictive language. ATR accused Circle of discriminating against gun owners, referencing political donations made by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire to Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a known supporter of gun control measures. The NSSF also criticised the earlier clause, arguing that such policies undermine constitutionally protected commerce. After the reversal, the group commended Circle’s move, stating that “freedom can’t survive if your payment tools work against you.” NSSF—The Firearm Industry Trade Association @NSSF · Follow Circle reversed its discriminatory crypto policy after pressure from NSSF and others. Freedom can’t survive if your payment tools work against you.Read more: nssf.org/articles/crypt… #NSSF #FinancialFreedom #SecondAmendment 8:14 PM · Nov 4, 2025 2 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply The revised prohibited transactions list Under the new terms, Circle’s clause referring to “weapons of any kind” now includes a key qualifier: “in contravention of applicable laws.” This amendment distinguishes between illegal arms trading and lawful retail sales, making Circle’s policy consistent with US financial regulations and industry standards. Other restricted categories remain unchanged. These include transactions with sanctioned individuals, participation in fraudulent or pyramid schemes, copyright infringement, unlicensed money transmission, or engagement in market manipulation such as insider trading and wash trading. Circle also bans the use of USDC on darknet marketplaces or for purchasing counterfeit goods. The company reiterated that it reserves the right to monitor or block transactions and may suspend or terminate accounts found in violation of its terms. Broader context for digital payments and rights Circle’s move comes amid a wider debate on the role of payment firms in regulating moral or political behaviour through transaction bans. As cryptocurrencies and stablecoins integrate further into mainstream commerce, issuers face increasing scrutiny over what constitutes a “lawful” use of digital money. The controversy also reflects how financial infrastructure intersects with constitutional freedoms. By revising its terms, Circle aims to balance compliance with existing laws while addressing concerns of ideological bias. The decision reinforces that blockchain-based money, while programmable, remains subject to the same legal and political debates that shape traditional finance.

Tokyo-based Metaplanet Inc. has ramped up its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, raising an additional $100 million secured against its existing crypto holdings. The firm is capitalizing on Bitcoin’s temporary weakness — with $BTC trading near $102,000 — to expand its long-term treasury position. The move signals growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a reserve asset, even amid market turbulence. It also sheds light on the next wave of infrastructure-driven projects, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which are attracting significant capital from whales seeking leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s ecosystem without the balance-sheet risk. Metaplanet’s Plan In a recent shareholder notice, Metaplanet detailed its strategy, clarifying that while it’s leveraging existing Bitcoin reserves, the company is doing so within a conservative borrowing framework designed to account for market volatility. The firm reaffirmed its commitment to avoiding excessive leverage and maintaining a disciplined balance between growth and risk exposure. Currently, Metaplanet holds approximately 30,823 BTC, valued at around $3.2B at today’s market prices — a position that solidifies its reputation as one of Asia’s most aggressive corporate adopters of Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s long-term ambition is to accumulate roughly 210K BTC by 2027, representing about 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. If achieved, that would place the firm among the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin worldwide, with significant room for further scale. Often described as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” Metaplanet reflects a broader corporate shift toward digital asset treasuries. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net , more than 200 publicly traded companies now hold crypto on their balance sheets — a figure that continues to grow each quarter. Caution could be warranted. Borrowing against current holdings, with Bitcoin as collateral , leaves Metaplanet open to dramatic downward price moves and could force the liquidation of some of those holdings if Bitcoin’s price falls too far. Bitcoin recently dipped below the $100K mark for the first time since June before rebounding and trading around $103K. That’s roughly 18% below its record high of $126K a few weeks ago. Market stress has had its consequences: some companies are quietly reducing exposure. Sequans, formerly a top-30 Bitcoin Treasury, recently dropped out when it became one of the first $BTC treasuries to sell some of its holdings. Still, investor sentiment isn’t entirely bearish. $BTC has already gone back up 1.5% in the past day, and many expect Bitcoin’s next directional move to climb to $115K rather than drop to $85K. With corporate treasuries, such as Metaplanet’s, stepping up their accumulation, the market may be entering a new phase. One possible catalyst for new growth? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the newest Bitcoin Layer 2 upgrade, and one of the best crypto presales in 2025. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Fast, Dynamic Layer 2 for $BTC Transactions and DeFi Bitcoin Hyper builds a next-gen scaling layer on top of the Bitcoin network, designed to improve transaction speeds, reduce fees, and unlock dApp and complex smart-contract capabilities for $BTC. The Layer-2 works by leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for its Layer-2 execution environment, while anchoring ultimately to Bitcoin’s security. Users can bridge their BTC into the Bitcoin Hyper layer via a canonical trustless bridge, enabling faster transfers, staking, DeFi interactions, and more. The project’s native token, $HYPER, functions as a utility and governance token for the system, used for gas fees, staking rewards, and ecosystem participation. A token that unlocks $BTC’s power and stability with Solana’s DeFi-ready smart contract and fast transaction speeds is sure to draw lots of attention. So far, $HYPER has done just that – the presale is already past $26M. Over $239K of major whale purchases have flowed into the presale in just the past day. Our price prediction indicates that $HYPER could reach $0.20 by the end of next year, up from its current price of $0.013225. That would deliver gains of 1400% to token holders who learn how to buy $HYPER now. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page for the latest. Metaplanet’s $100M leverage-backed Bitcoin acquisition signals conviction, but Bitcoin Hyper ’s rise could be an even stronger indication of future growth. As always, do your own research.

However, some like Internet Computer (ICP) remain unfazed, charting triple-digit gains over the past week. How Much More? ICP currently trades at around $6.12 (according to CoinGecko’s data), representing a 27% increase on a daily basis and a staggering 100% surge in the last seven days. ICP Price, Source: CoinGecko Its renewed upward momentum started at the end of October and intensified at the start of the business week. Back then, DFINITY Foundation (the creator and main contributor behind the Internet Computer blockchain) launched the AI platform called “Caffeine,” which enables users to build applications. The rally has caught the attention of numerous analysts who believe ICP has yet to reach more impressive peaks. X user Captain Faibik argued that the asset has broken a downward trendline with “strong buying volume,” envisioning a pump above $12 in the following months. CryptoBoss thinks the surge above the $6 mark could trigger a further jump to $15, while X user LSD revealed adding ICP to their portfolio, citing several reasons why a full-scale bull run might be on the way: “ICP is in the late phase of its correction after enduring a long, multi-year bear cycle. The structures [are] tightening up classic signs of volatility compression, and the candles are hugging that key EMA zone. A clean weekly reclaim above $6.5+ flips the macro structure bullish and sets the stage for a major trend reversal.” Other, less popular analysts on X predicted that ICP’s valuation could soon exceed $50, which seems quite implausible (at least as of now). After all, it will require the asset’s market cap to surpass $23 billion, which would place it close to the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Currently, ICP is the 46th-biggest digital asset with a capitalization of approximately $3.2 billion. How About a Pullback? It is worth noting that certain factors suggest that ICP’s uptrend may be halted in the short term. Such an element is the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes. It varies from 0 to 100, and ratios above 70 signal that ICP could be in overbought territory, hence poised for a correction. Conversely, readings below 30 are considered buying opportunities. As of press time, the RSI stands at around 73.

The five-year tranche was priced 0.02 percentage points above the US Treasury yield. Notably, China has issued sovereign dollar bonds in the past, including a three-year bond in October 2021 and a five-year bond in October 2020, via multi-tranche deals. Bankers working on the deal highlighted that, for the first time in history, Beijing can borrow at the same interest rate as Washington. This bond sale reflects a trend gaining traction among nations that are capitalizing on low international debt issuance costs. In this light, the companies’ borrowing costs relative to US Treasuries have recently hit some of the lowest levels on record, analysts said. In the past, China’s dollar-denominated debt has carried a premium due to perceived higher risks, such as currency value fluctuations and policy uncertainties. Matching US yields represents a sharp improvement in China’s cost of borrowing, making it cheaper for the government to refinance its debt and fund infrastructure and technology projects. China-US trade tension lessens amid Trump and Xi Jinping’s deal The bond issuance in China follows the easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. This was after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a deal for a one-year trade truce last week. “Markets are filled with cash, and geopolitical tensions have lessened,” stated David Yim, who leads capital markets for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered, one of the firms managing the deal. Another reliable source noted that investors were enthusiastic about Chinese sovereign dollar-denominated debt, which would broaden their investment options. They also stated that the limited number of bonds available prompted high demand exceeding supply. On the other hand, order books, an electronic list that displays all the current buy and sell orders for a specific sovereign bond, disclosed that the five-year bond was subscribed to 30 times, with the central banks, insurance firms, and wealth funds accounting for half the bids. Asia rushes to issue dollar bonds, fueling stiff competition in the market Reports dated September this year mentioned that the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi , issued $2 billion in 10-year bonds, with a spread of 0.18 percentage points above US Treasuries. In October of this year, the South Korean finance ministry issued $1 billion in dollar-denominated bonds, which are set to mature in five years. The dollar bonds featured a spread of 0.17 percentage points. However, China last sold dollar-denominated bonds in 2024, when it issued $2 billion of debt in Saudi Arabia. For this week’s transaction, a group of Chinese, US, and other foreign banks vowed to handle the process. The funds raised will be used for “general government purposes,” as noted in the bond’s term sheet. Additionally, the deal is scheduled to be concluded next Thursday. Meanwhile, although Chinese dollar-denominated debt previously traded at a negative spread compared to similar US debt, it is worth noting that these bonds have consistently had a higher price, despite the decrease in the spread.

This AI startup is challenging the status quo with diffusion models that could revolutionize how developers and businesses approach text and code generation. What Makes Diffusion Models Different? Traditional AI models for text generation use autoregressive approaches, predicting each word sequentially like GPT-5 and Gemini. Inception’s diffusion models take a completely different path, working through iterative refinement that processes information holistically rather than word-by-word. The $50 Million AI Startup Funding That Changes Everything Menlo Ventures led this massive seed round with participation from industry giants including: Mayfield and Innovation Endeavors Nvidia’s NVentures Microsoft’s M12 fund Snowflake Ventures and Databricks Investment Angel investors Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy Why Diffusion Models Excel in Code Generation Stefano Ermon, Stanford professor and Inception’s leader, explains that diffusion-based LLMs achieve remarkable efficiency gains in two critical areas: Metric Diffusion Models Traditional Models Latency Over 1,000 tokens/second Significantly slower Compute Cost Much lower Higher resource demands Parallel Processing Built for simultaneous operations Sequential execution The Technical Advantage in AI Efficiency Where autoregressive models must execute operations one after another, diffusion models can process multiple operations simultaneously. This parallel architecture enables significantly lower latency in complex tasks like analyzing large codebases or generating extensive text documents. Real-World Applications and Integration Inception’s Mercury model has already been integrated into development tools including ProxyAI, Buildglare, and Kilo Code. The company’s approach demonstrates how diffusion models can handle large-scale text processing while managing data constraints more effectively than traditional methods. FAQs About Inception and Diffusion Models What companies are backing Inception? The funding round includes Menlo Ventures , Nvidia ‘s NVentures, Microsoft ‘s M12 fund, and angel investors Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy . Who leads the Inception project? Stefano Ermon , a Stanford professor specializing in diffusion models, leads the initiative. How do diffusion models compare to autoregressive models? Diffusion models use iterative refinement while autoregressive models work sequentially, making diffusion approaches faster and more efficient for certain tasks. What is the Mercury model? Mercury is Inception’s diffusion model specifically designed for software development, already integrated into multiple development tools. Why are diffusion models better for hardware utilization? Their parallel processing capability allows simultaneous operations, unlike the sequential nature of autoregressive models. Inception’s $50 million funding represents a seismic shift in AI development, proving that innovation in fundamental model architectures can deliver dramatic improvements in speed and efficiency. As diffusion models challenge the dominance of autoregressive approaches, we’re witnessing the beginning of a new era in AI capabilities that could transform how businesses and developers interact with artificial intelligence.

Modern digital finance increasingly resembles a high-speed roadway: fast, efficient and constantly expanding. Yet no matter how advanced the vehicles become, trust still depends on the reliability of their safety features. In the stablecoin market, that “seatbelt” is transparent collateral, independent oversight and rules that cannot be altered by any centralized actor. The industry has seen how quickly confidence collapses when reserves are unclear or governance is concentrated. Terra’s UST depegged in 2022 after its algorithmic mechanism failed, costing billions. Later, HUSD suffered a sharp depeg amid concerns about its backing. And in November 2025, XUSD fell 77 percent after a reported 93 million dollar loss, showing how fast uncertainty around reserves can trigger a broader collapse in trust. That shift has effectively set a new benchmark for any project aiming to maintain confidence through volatility, and projects that adapt early often set the tone for the broader market. A good example of this change is USDD , a decentralized stablecoin that has changed its structure to focus on verifiable security. With its move to the 2.0 model, it no longer relies on algorithmic balancing tools. Instead, it uses a layered approach that includes independent audits, public on-chain data and a reserve model that is overcollateralized. Strengthened Collateral and Full Transparency USDD’s strongest safeguard is its overcollateralized design. Since the rollout of USDD 2.0, the stablecoin has consistently held more collateral than the amount of USDD in circulation, with backing that comes from liquid assets such as TRX, sTRX and USDT. Recent figures point in the same direction. The value of the collateral pool grew by 5 percent last quarter, while the supply rose by about 3 percent, showing that the buffer supporting the stablecoin continues to build. In early August 2025, USDD’s total collateral value peaked at more than $620 million. Soruce: Messari Independent reviews also help strengthen confidence in USDD’s design. CertiK and ChainSecurity have completed five separate audits so far, examining everything from the smart contract code to the way collateral is managed and new tokens are minted. Additional reviews from Messari , Stablewatch and CertiK’s Skynet platform, which assigns USDD an AA score of 87.50, give users multiple layers of external validation when comparing stablecoins on security and transparency. All contract balances, collateral assets and reserve ratios are publicly accessible through USDD’s contract addresses or the data page . No special permissions or closed dashboards are required. Immutable and Freeze-Free Token Design The design of USDD's token also puts user control first. No central authority can freeze, pause, or change the asset. With no administrative keys in the system, USDD holders retain complete ownership from the moment the token enters their wallet. For many users, this eliminates one of the most common concerns associated with centralized stablecoins, especially given recent reports of sizable USDT freezes, including a case involving more than $44 million and another involving $12.3 million on the TRON network. For everyday holders, the impact is straightforward. They can verify reserves, track collateral levels, confirm that no centralized party can alter or freeze the token, and rely on an audited, overcollateralized system designed to protect users at all times. A Clear Shift From USDDOLD to USDD 2.0 Understanding the difference between USDDOLD and USDD 2.0 is critical for users. USDDOLD operated as an algorithmic stablecoin under the TRON DAO Reserve. USDD 2.0, by contrast, is fully overcollateralized, on-chain and user-controlled. Anyone can mint USDD directly and verify all collateral on-chain. This shift gives users far more control than before. They can mint USDD themselves and verify the collateral directly, something that was not possible under the earlier design. The updated model is also built to sustain itself over time. The Smart Allocator has already generated more than $5.8 million to date, reducing the system’s reliance on external subsidies and helping it support its operations more independently. USDD’s Smart Allocator prioritizes sustainable, low-risk yield over high-risk speculation. Source: Medium@USDD Smart Allocator adds another layer of protection for users following USDD’s long-term stability. It avoids high-risk tactics, limits exposure with predetermined investment caps, and deploys capital gradually and cautiously across well-audited platforms. Liquidity is managed with caution so that funds are always within reach, and users can follow every movement directly on-chain. Smart Allocator’s activity is reviewed regularly by the USDD and JUST DAO teams, which helps keep returns sustainable and prevents the kind of hidden risks that have troubled other projects. Why User-Verified Security Matters Stablecoins are under closer scrutiny than ever, and the projects that earn trust today are the ones that let users check things for themselves. USDD’s design reflects that shift. Its collateral is fully visible, its audits are public, its token cannot be altered by a central authority and its Smart Allocator is tightly supervised. Security becomes something users can confirm in practice, not something they are asked to take on faith. Users can confirm the collateral behind every token, monitor reserve movements in real time and rely on a model that cannot be altered or frozen by a centralized actor. In practice, USDD turns security into a feature that users interact with directly, not a promise they must accept without visibility. In a fast-moving market that often feels like a high-speed roadway, these verifiable safeguards work much like a seatbelt. For many users, the difference between promises and protections they can verify themselves is what ultimately builds long-term confidence in USDD.

Here’s What Is Happening,https://timestabloid.com/mastercard-is-being-upgraded-to-ripple-heres-what-is-happening/,"A quiet revolution is unfolding in global finance. Legacy systems that once dominated payment processing are being replaced by blockchain-based infrastructures offering faster, cheaper, and borderless settlement. Mastercard, one of the world’s largest payment networks, is now at the center of this transition — with Ripple leading the technological upgrade. Ripple’s Partnership with Mastercard According to a report amplified by SMQKE on X, Ripple announced a pilot partnership with Mastercard , Gemini, and WebBank on November 5, 2025. The collaboration focuses on settling credit card transactions using RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, on the XRP Ledger. The objective is to modernize Mastercard’s backend settlement system, reducing delays and improving transaction efficiency through blockchain. This initiative marks the first time a major card network will test on-ledger stablecoin settlements at scale. It also positions Ripple’s technology as a direct enabler of faster, compliant, and programmable money movement for financial institutions. MASTERCARD IS BEING UPGRADED TO RIPPLE Listen closely. https://t.co/c8RPRGHZuw pic.twitter.com/RhuAeLx1AZ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 5, 2025 Why RLUSD Matters Ripple launched RLUSD in December 2024 as a fully regulated stablecoin backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar. The asset was designed for institutional use, offering stability, transparency, and regulatory assurance. Using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger allows Mastercard and its partners to achieve near-instant settlement while maintaining compliance with U.S. financial laws. By reducing reliance on multiple intermediaries, RLUSD transactions cut operational costs and eliminate traditional reconciliation delays. This provides significant benefits for banks, merchants, and consumers alike. Horowitz on the Digitization of Finance During a presentation highlighted in the same post, Andreessen Horowitz explained the structural shift underway in global finance. “We are taking things like SWIFT or Visa or Mastercard,” he said, “and we’re upgrading them into digital equivalents which have names like Ripple or Yellowcard.” Horowitz emphasized that digital custodians and tokenized systems now form the new infrastructure for global commerce. “We need infrastructure to allow for the digitalization of finance and commerce,” he noted, citing Anchorage, Fireblocks, and Ripple as leading innovators in this space.

The Broader Market Implications This partnership signals Mastercard’s readiness to embrace blockchain settlement as a complement to its traditional network. It also reflects growing confidence in Ripple’s regulatory positioning and its capacity to provide enterprise-grade financial infrastructure. Horowitz further pointed out that tokenization extends beyond payments, referencing BlackRock’s interest in digital assets. “We can take a money market fund from BlackRock,” he explained, “tokenize that, and make it available anywhere in the world 24×7.” That same principle now applies to Mastercard’s card settlements, which can soon operate continuously on blockchain rails through RLUSD. In conclusion, Mastercard’s pilot with Ripple represents a historic milestone for the digital asset industry. It unites the stability of a global financial leader with the innovation of blockchain technology. As Horowitz succinctly observed, traditional systems are being “upgraded into digital equivalents.” Ripple’s collaboration with Mastercard is a tangible example of that evolution—one that redefines how value moves across the world.

The bank’s latest outlook argues that the recent correction, which saw Bitcoin fall nearly 20 percent from its recent peak, was accompanied by a meaningful reset in leverage across derivatives markets. JPMorgan analysts pointed to the liquidation wave on October 10, describing it as the largest on record for Bitcoin perpetual futures. A second round of forced unwinding followed on November 3, coming shortly after the more than $120 million exploit of the Balancer protocol. The back-to-back events, they said, shook investor confidence but also cleared out leveraged positions that had been building through early October. In the report, the team wrote that: “Overall, we believe that perpetual futures are the most important instruments to watch in the current juncture, and the message from the recent stabilization is that deleveraging in perpetual futures is likely behind us.” They added that the ratio of open interest in Bitcoin perpetuals to market capitalization has now retreated to levels consistent with longer-term averages. JPMorgan predicting bitcoin at $170k in next 6-12mo, says perp deleveraging is behind us and that's it undervalued vs gold historically, which implies ""significant upside next 6-12mo"" pic.twitter.com/CaVVWH6L42 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2025 Ethereum is showing similar patterns says banking giant The analysts noted that Ethereum markets show similar patterns, although they observed that “in CME futures, the opposite is true; there have been more liquidations in Ethereum than Bitcoin futures.” Meanwhile, recent redemptions in crypto exchange traded funds were described as modest when compared with inflows recorded earlier in October. JPMorgan’s upside framework centers on Bitcoin’s relative volatility to gold. The report notes that Bitcoin’s volatility ratio versus gold has slipped below 2.0, indicating that Bitcoin currently requires around 1.8 times more risk capital. Based on historical allocation behavior across private gold holdings, the analysts wrote that Bitcoin’s market capitalization would need to rise by approximately 67% to align with gold’s private investment footprint. As they put it, this “implies a theoretical bitcoin price of close to $170,000.” The post JPMorgan makes ultra-bullish Bitcoin price prediction appeared first on Finbold .",Banking news|Cryptocurrency news|Finance news|Bitcoin|BTC|cryptocurrency|JPMorgan,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2025-11-06 15:16:05

The validator, built on bare-metal servers, minted the first Solana block ever produced in the UAE, signaling Solmate’s commitment to high-performance blockchain validation. Investors and users can now stake their SOL tokens with the validator at zero commission. Solmate’s Infrastructure Flywheel™ Vision According to the press release , Solmate is advancing beyond traditional staking by integrating a performance-driven infrastructure model called the Infrastructure Flywheel™. This strategy aligns its validator operations with planned RPC and colocation services, allowing the company to capture multiple layers of value across the Solana network. The approach aims to transform staking capital into a self-reinforcing ecosystem that increases both yield and network performance. The firm’s model revolves around expanding its SOL holdings , which directly improve the efficiency of its RPC and colocation nodes. As more SOL is staked, the validator’s throughput rises, generating higher service fees that fund further accumulation of SOL. This cyclical process enhances treasury growth and strengthens infrastructure performance. Hence, Solmate’s treasury strategy integrates capital market activity with validator and RPC scalability to achieve sustainable returns. Technical and Strategic Foundation According to Marco Santori, CEO of Solmate Infrastructure, “The ability to offer validation, RPC and colocation services is only the first phase of the benefits to flow from running a bare-metal validator.” Santori added that the team evaluated data centers and telecom providers across the UAE to select optimal partners for latency and uptime performance. Consequently, the company expects its infrastructure to support future DeFi applications seeking reliable and geographically strategic validation. Additionally, Solmate’s partnership with infrastructure firm RockawayX will help optimize its network and accelerate deployment of new RPC nodes. The company envisions a future where decentralized finance operates entirely on-chain, with transactions processed in microseconds across global financial hubs. Solana Market Overview Source: X At press time, Solana (SOL) trades at $158.06 with a 24-hour volume exceeding $5.6 billion. The token has seen a slight daily gain of 0.06% but remains 15.56% lower on the week.

Namely, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author warned his followers on X that the U.S. political climate is becoming increasingly more Marxist, a trend he sees most recently embodied by Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral campaign on November 4. Weighing in on the situation, Kiyosaki commented on the issues of rent stability and loss of private property, that is, on the erosion of the capitalist system. “Sadly America is losing its freedom, Democracy, Capitalism….and becoming Marxist, communist country,” wrote the author. The antidote? Kiyosaki said precious metals such as gold and silver as well as cryptocurrencies, in particular the flagship ones, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), which he dubbed ‘the People’s money.’ “Please take care. Protect your self with real financial education and real money, gold and silver….God’s money….and Bitcoin and Ethereum…the People’s money,” he added. OMG: Marxist Momdami Mayor of NYC?

The financial guru believes that relying solely on salaries and traditional investments like bonds may no longer ensure financial security. Instead, he advocates for self-education, asset ownership, and exposure to decentralized technologies while dismissing bank safety as one of the ‘BIGGEST LIVES EVER TOLD.’ BIGGEST LIES EVER TOLD: 1: “They lived happily ever after.” 2: “Bonds are safe.” 3: “Safe as money in the bank.” 4: “I have job security.” 5: “ A college degree is the key to financial success.” — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 2, 2025 In his view, cryptocurrencies have the advantage of preserving purchasing power while granting individuals financial autonomy beyond government control.

Two people who have been briefed say the discussions have been ongoing for weeks, and the pair are now close to an agreement to buy more than 80% of the company. KKR is reportedly spearheading the transaction, although both companies are acting together. Singtel and KKR’s move signals a shift in AI from novelty to utility ST Telemedia , which is the current majority owner, is itself tied to Temasek, reflecting the extent to which Singapore’s state capital has been wrapped into this sector. According to Reuters, the two firms already have a foot in the door, and KRR is said to hold about 14% and Singtel around 4%, from an earlier investment the two companies made last year. This latest move reportedly reflects a strong belief that this could be the right moment for the companies to go all-in on server estates, and also shows how sharply the economics of hard infrastructure have shifted as AI moves from novelty to a near-daily utility. This is not just about phone companies and social media anymore, but generative AI needs land, power, and racks, and these are the firms that lease them out. Should the deal cross the line, it would fall among the largest data centre buyouts in the Asian region. That size alone underlines the scale of the sector’s shift. Investors once chased mobile networks or fibre. Now they want the buildings behind the cloud. Data centre operators have become landlords to the modern internet, and some funds believe this is the most reliable cash flow in the digital world. No one involved is willing to talk about it in public, KKR, ST Telemedia, and the data centre firm declined to speak and Singtel did not answer questions. The two people who shared details asked for privacy because the talks are not done, and the outline could yet be adjusted before the parties sign anything. Still, one source believes the goal is to wrap things up before the end of this year. ST Telemedia Global Data Centres began life in 2014, its website paints a picture of a company that has raced into new regions faster than many peers. The company operates over 100 facilities across more than 20 markets, including Singapore, India, Japan, and a branch into Europe through the Virtus brand in the UK, Germany, and Italy. ST Telemedia also claims that more than 2 gigawatts of IT load is already installed, and this figure would have been unimaginable a decade ago, and reflects how much compute the world consumes. For KKR, this is another link in a strategy it has built across the Asia Pacific since 2019, and analysts who track the fund say it has about $13 billion in infrastructure assets in the region. Singapore has become a hub for these server estates because it offers political stability, strong power links, and reliability. KKR and Singtel have decided to bet that the next decade will need even more megawatts than the last as demand for AI continues to increase. For tech firms in China, they may enjoy some relief as the Chinese government offers up to 50% discounts on energy for data centers that use Chinese-made processors under its new energy policy.

MEXC의 수석 애널리스트 숀 영은 비트코인의 반등이 ‘현물 유입과 레버리지 숏 커버링에 힘입은 기술적 반등 ‘에 불과하다고 본다. 슈로더스의 수석 애널리스트 지에한 첸은 비트코인이 주간 마감 시 10만3000달러 이상 을 유지할 충분한 동력을 보유한다면 이는 문제가 되지 않는다고 보고 있다. 동시에 비트코인의 핵심 문제점인 처리량, 수수료, 프로그래밍 가능성은 여전히 해결되지 않은 상태다. $BTC의 신뢰성과 브랜드 가치를 유지하면서 저비용 스마트 계약을 가능하게 하는 플랫폼이야말로 개발자들이 지속적으로 요구하는 바다. 비트코인 하이퍼($HYPER) 는 속도를 위한 솔라나 스타일 실행 환경, 안전한 $BTC 전송을 위한 표준 브리지, 그리고 최종성을 위한 비트코인으로의 정산을 활용하는 전용 레이어 2를 통해 이를 구현하고자 한다. 이러한 이유로 현재 $HYPER의 반등은 단순한 분위기 이상의 의미를 갖는다. 사전 판매는 내러티브를 조기에 반영하는 경향이 있으며, 빠른 결제와 저렴한 디파이, 친숙한 개발 도구를 약속하면서도 $BTC 중심성을 유지하는 L2는 시장이 요구하는 바로 그 솔루션이다. 비트코인 하이퍼 ($HYPER) — SVM 속도를 갖춘 비트코인 레이어 2 비트코인 하이퍼($HYPER) 는 간단한 거래 방식을 제안한다. 결제는 비트코인으로 유지하되 실행은 저지연 레이어 2로 이동하는 것이다. 이 프로젝트는 고처리량 스마트 계약을 위해 솔라나 가상머신 을 통합하고, 분산형 캐노니컬 브리지 를 사용해 $BTC를 L2로 가져오고 필요시 다시 내보낸다. 이는 결제, 디파이, 게임, 그리고 비트코인의 보안 모델에 기반하면서도 빠른 속도를 제공하는 디앱을 의미한다. 백서는 프리세일과 스테이킹부터 메인넷, 브리지 활성화, 이후 거래소 상장과 DAO 거버넌스에 이르는 단계별 목표를 제시하고 있다. 아래 프로젝트 로드맵은 2026년까지의 전달 과정과 촉진 요인을 추적하는 데 유용하다. 사전 판매가 현재 진행 중이며 2,600만 달러 이상의 자금 조달 현황을 보이고 있고, 토큰 가격은 약 0.013225달러 수준이다. 구매자들은 암호화폐나 카드를 사용할 수 있으며, 사이트에서는 다음 가격 단계까지의 카운트다운을 표시한다. 이는 단계별 판매에서 진입 시점을 파악하는 데 도움이 되는 투명성을 제공한다. 이 프로젝트는 또한 연 45% 추정 수익률로 사전 판매 스테이킹을 운영하고 있으며, 프로토콜 수준에서 적립되어 청구가 활성화된 후 상환 가능하다. 스테이킹은 공짜가 아니며 수익률이 유동적이지만, 메인넷과 상장이 준비되는 동안 측정 가능한 인센티브를 제공한다. 실용성이 더 큰 매력이다. L2가 사양대로 출시된다면 비트코인 기반 레일에서 SVM급 성능을 얻게 된다. 이는 개발자들이 Rust/SPL 스타일 도구를 활용할 수 있고, 사용자들은 스왑, 대출, 결제, 게임에서 낮은 수수료를 누릴 수 있음을 의미한다. 표준 브리지 모델은 BTC를 핵심 자산으로 삼아 자금이 유입되고 유출되는 구조를 갖는다. 이는 단순히 비트코인을 보유하는 것 이상의 활용을 원하는 비트코인 보유자들의 요구를 해결하는 방식이다. 이러한 사양을 바탕으로 한 $HYPER의 현실적인 가격 예측 에 따르면, 2030년까지 1.50달러 가격대에 도달할 것으로 전망되며, 현재 투자할 경우 5년간 11,242%의 투자수익률을 기록할 것으로 분석된다. 결론적으로, 비트코인에 다시 모멘텀이 더해진 시장에서 가시적인 견인력과 속도 우선 설계를 갖춘 BTC 네이티브 L2 프리세일은 현재 구매할 수 있는 최고의 암호화폐 중 하나가 될 수 있으며, 특히 2025년 4분기와 2026년 1분기 사이의 임박한 출시 일정을 고려할 때 더욱 그렇다. 비트코인 인프라 투자에 관심이 있는 투자자들은 사전 판매 페이지를 통해 $HYPER 토큰 을 확보할 수 있다. 이는 투자 조언이 아니며, 투자 전 항상 개인적인 조사가 필요하다는 점을 유의해야 한다.",Altcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 15:31:00

This boost could be pivotal for its market performance. Is SOL on the brink of a rally back to its previous highs? This article delves into the potential of Solana and other cryptocurrencies that might be poised for a surge. Solana Price Struggles but Hints at Future Growth Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently fluctuating between around $176 and $202. The coin has faced a tough period, with its value dropping over 18% in the past week. Its resistance level is hovering at $217, while a solid support level sits at $164. Looking forward, if Solana can break past the $217 mark, it might climb further towards the next resistance of $243. Such a rise would represent a potential growth of around 20%. Despite recent dips, Solana shows some promise if it can break through current challenges. However, its performance needs close watching as the broader crypto market keeps evolving. Conclusion The collaboration with Hollywood and pop culture could significantly enhance the appeal of SOL. This association might attract more mainstream attention and new investors to the platform. If this trend continues, it has the potential to boost SOL's price and market position. Reaching the $150 mark again may become feasible with increased adoption and partnerships. The combination of entertainment and tech innovation may offer a unique edge, making SOL a compelling option for many. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to JPMorgan’s top strategist, Bitcoin currently appears significantly Bitcoin undervalued compared to traditional safe havens like gold. This revelation comes with a bold price prediction that could reshape your investment portfolio. Why Is Bitcoin Undervalued Against Gold? JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s current valuation. His analysis shows that when adjusted for volatility, Bitcoin undervalued becomes evident in direct comparison to gold. The market has reached a crucial turning point where leverage has normalized, reducing speculative risks significantly. This normalization creates a healthier trading environment. Therefore, the potential for sudden sell-offs has diminished substantially. The strategist’s volatility-adjusted approach provides a fresh perspective on cryptocurrency valuation that many investors might have overlooked. How High Could Bitcoin Actually Go? The $170,000 price target isn’t just a random number. Panigirtzoglou calculates this figure based on Bitcoin matching gold’s private investment value. This represents an impressive 66% increase from current levels. The analysis suggests that Bitcoin undervalued presents a substantial opportunity for growth-oriented investors. Key factors supporting this prediction include: Reduced market leverage preventing overheating Decreased speculative trading activity Improved market stability and maturity Growing institutional acceptance What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? Recognizing that Bitcoin undervalued situations exist can transform your approach to digital assets. The JPMorgan analysis indicates that current market conditions favor long-term investors rather than short-term speculators. Moreover, the comparison to gold provides a familiar framework for traditional investors to understand Bitcoin’s potential. The volatility-adjusted methodology offers a more nuanced view than simple price comparisons. This approach helps investors see beyond daily price fluctuations and focus on fundamental value. Consequently, the Bitcoin undervalued assessment becomes more credible and actionable. Is Now the Right Time to Consider Bitcoin? With leverage returning to normal levels, the market appears more stable than during previous crypto cycles. The reduced risk of market overheating makes this an interesting entry point for cautious investors. The Bitcoin undervalued analysis suggests potential upside that outweighs current risks. However, remember that cryptocurrency investments always carry inherent volatility. While the JPMorgan analysis points to significant potential, market conditions can change rapidly. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. Final Thoughts on Bitcoin’s Undervalued Status The JPMorgan analysis provides a sophisticated framework for understanding Bitcoin’s true value proposition. The Bitcoin undervalued assessment compared to gold offers a compelling narrative for both crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors. The $170,000 price target represents not just a number, but a fundamental shift in how we perceive digital asset valuation. As the market continues to mature and institutional acceptance grows, these types of sophisticated analyses will become increasingly important for making informed investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘Bitcoin undervalued’ actually mean? It means Bitcoin’s current price doesn’t reflect its true value when compared to traditional assets like gold, especially after adjusting for volatility differences. How did JPMorgan calculate the $170,000 price target? They compared Bitcoin’s market value to gold’s private investment value and adjusted for volatility, determining Bitcoin needs to rise 66% to match gold’s investment footprint. Is Bitcoin really less risky now? According to the analysis, reduced leverage and less speculation have decreased short-term sell-off risks, making the market more stable. Should I invest based on this prediction? While the analysis is compelling, always consider your financial goals and risk tolerance. Diversification and personal research remain crucial. How does volatility adjustment work? It compares assets by accounting for their price fluctuation patterns, giving a clearer picture of true value beyond simple price comparisons. What time frame does this prediction cover? The analysis doesn’t specify an exact timeline, focusing instead on the fundamental valuation gap that needs to close. Found this analysis insightful?

According to data from blockchain analytics company CryptoQuant, a dramatic shift has occurred in holding patterns among large BTC investors. The number of addresses under Bitcoin accumulators has increased significantly to 262,000. This represents a 101% growth from the 130,000 addresses that were registered only a few weeks prior. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost monitored this movement for two months. Source: CryptoQuant Record Accumulation Activity Signals Strong Conviction The surge in accumulator addresses comes alongside unprecedented buying activity. These addresses bought more than 375,000 BTC within the last 30 days. The metric has reached an all-time high according to CryptoQuant's tracking systems. The 5th of November saw particularly intense activity. Large Bitcoin accounts deposited over 50,000 BTC within a day. This buying pressure emerged in an environment where the markets were overall weak and retail demand was low. Accumulator addresses have certain features that differentiate them from other types of wallets. Such addresses should have had at least one transaction in the last seven years. The classification does not include known exchange wallets and mining addresses. Smart contract addresses are not included in this category either. The behavior of holding is a characteristic of these wallets. Accumulator buyers always buy Bitcoin and do not sell it. Such a trend aligns with long-term holding strategies and non-trading approaches. Bitcoin recently experienced price volatility around the $102,000 to $104,000 range. Large addresses continued their buying campaigns throughout these fluctuations. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $103,407.15, representing a 0.35% increase over the last 24 hours. BTC Price, Source: CoinMarketCap ETF Impact and Market Dynamics Create Mixed Signals Part of this trend could be being fuelled by exchange-traded funds. Darkfost proposed that the growth of ETFs may be increasing accumulation trends amongst institutional investors. However, recent ETF flows paint a more complex picture. The net outflows of Bitcoin ETFs are reported to have been recorded at $186.5 million on November 4. This withdrawal coincided with Bitcoin's decline to around $104,000. The data on outflow contradicts the high on-chain accumulation indicators of large addresses. Since October 10, short-term holders have dominated the sell-side. This group has been the primary source of supply for hitting exchanges, as indicated by CryptoQuant data .",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-06 15:35:58

BTC briefly fell below $100,000 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level and reclaimed $100,000, reaching $104,526 before dropping to its current level. BTC is up over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $103,200. ETH also followed a similar trajectory, falling to a low of $3,099 before recovering and moving past $3,400. The altcoin rose over 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $3,407. XRP is up nearly 4% while Solana (SOL) is up 2%, trading around $159. Dogecoin (DOGE) is marginally up, and Cardano (ADA) is up 1.29%, trading around $0.536. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable recoveries over the past 24 hours. Robinhood Not Venturing Into Crypto Treasuries Anytime Soon Robinhood executive Shiv Verma says the trading platform is still undecided about buying and holding crypto, even if doing so aligns it with the larger crypto community. Verma stated that Robinhood had spent a lot of time thinking about such a move, adding, “We spent a lot of time thinking about this. We like alignment with the community. We are a big player in crypto. We want to keep doing it. We like that our customers are engaged in it. What we always try to figure out is: Is it the right thing for shareholders as well?” Crypto treasury companies have become all the rage on Wall Street this year, generating billions in investment and boosting the share value of companies that have adopted the business model. However, some analysts have warned that crypto treasury companies could struggle as competition grows. Analysts believe these companies may need to take bigger risks or acquire smaller treasury companies to stay afloat as competition heats up. Verma concluded, “It has the positives that you’re aligned with the community, but it does take up capital. Is it the best use of our capital? There’s a lot of different things you’re doing, from new products, for growth, [and] investing in engineering.” Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) ETFs Shed $2.6B Over The Past Week Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have registered combined outflows of $2.6 billion over the past week as markets registered a substantial decline. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $1.9 billion in outflows while Ethereum ETFs saw $718.9 million in outflows, putting significant selling pressure on the two largest cryptocurrencies. BTC fell below $100,000 for the first time since May on Tuesday, while ETH slipped below $3,100 as selling pressure peaked on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors have avoided crypto and other risk assets since October amid concerns about the US-China trade war, the ongoing government shutdown, low liquidity, and uncertainty around a third rate cut before the end of the year. Despite the administration’s pro-crypto stance, BTC and other cryptocurrencies have registered substantial declines thanks to macroeconomic uncertainties. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered their longest outflow streak in February, when investors pulled over $2.2 billion in a little over a week. Robinhood Q3 Revenue Rallies Trading platform Robinhood has reported a 300% surge in its third-quarter revenue compared to the same period a year ago. The jump in revenue helps the company beat Wall Street expectations. The company announced on Wednesday that its Q3 transaction-based revenue surged 129% from the same period last year to $730 million. The company attributed the gains to its $268 million in crypto revenue, which rose 300% compared to the previous year. Robinhood’s total revenues for the quarter doubled year-over-year to $1.27 billion, beating market expectations of $1.2 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the red after a brief recovery on Wednesday, down nearly 1% at $103,054. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 3.60% on Monday and briefly fell below $100,000 on Tuesday to an intraday low of $98,892 before reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $101,468. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% to $103,869. However, it is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the recovery stalling around $104,500. Meanwhile, Galaxy has revised its 2025 BTC price forecast from $180,000 to $120,000, citing several macroeconomic headwinds and price volatility due to passive investment flows into Bitcoin ETFs and financial institutions. According to Alex Thorn, Galaxy’s head of research, Bitcoin whales dumping large quantities of BTC onto the market in October, and capital rotation into other assets like gold, stablecoin, and AI, have dampened the positive sentiment around BTC. Thorn stated in a post on X, “Bitcoin has entered a new phase, what we call the ‘maturity era,’ in which institutional absorption, passive flows, and lower volatility dominate. “If bitcoin can maintain the $100,000 level, we believe the almost three-year bull market will remain structurally intact, though the pace of future gains may be slower.” According to Thorn, the flash crash on October 10, which triggered over $20 billion in liquidations in 24 hours, has “materially damaged the bull trend.” However, Thorn remains bullish about BTC’s long-term prospects. BTC’s recovery stuttered to a halt around the $103,500 mark, with the flagship cryptocurrency facing a major sell wall around $105,000 as well. Bitcoin bulls have been facing an uphill struggle, with exchange data confirming sell pressure. “Pretty clear price has been capped with the cluster of asks (sell orders) above $105,000. Often this tactic is used to drive price lower during Asian hours.” BTC started the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising 0.84% on Friday and 0.56% on Saturday to settle at $111,666. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose nearly 3% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,548. BTC reached an intraday high of $116,410 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $114,087, ultimately dropping 0.40%. Selling pressure and volatility persisted on Tuesday as the price fell 1.03% to $112,906. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell 2.55% and settled at $110.032.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) failed to reclaim $3,500 as its recovery stalled after reaching an intraday high of $3,479. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $3,358. ETH plunged 8.80% on Tuesday, falling to a low of $3,058 before settling at $3,286. ETH’s modest recovery fizzled out on Tuesday as bearish sentiment continued to linger. However, the altcoin is still marginally up over the past 24 hours. While the price has reported a 12% drop in November, analysts have pointed out that major ETH holders are buying the dip. ETH holders have pumped in $1.37 billion in three days to buy large quantities of the asset. According to a report by BeInCrypto, ETH fell to a four-month low earlier this week. However, large holders saw this as an opportunity to buy rather than panic. On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reported substantial accumulation by ETH whales during the recent market downturn. According to the available data, eight major entities collectively purchased 394,682 ETH, valued at around $1.37 billion, at an average price of $3,462 per token. Lookonchain identified an “AAVE whale” who purchased 257,543 ETH valued at $896 million. The second-largest buyer was BitMine Immersion Technologies, ETH’s largest corporate holder. The Tom Lee-led firm purchased 40,719 ETH for approximately $139.6 million. BitMine first purchased 20,205 ETH from Coinbase and FalconX, before adding 20,514 ETH. ETH started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising over 2% on Friday and settling at $3,935. The price rose 0.45% on Saturday, rallying 5% on Sunday to cross $4,000, settling at $4,157.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is down 1% during the ongoing session as selling pressure returned after a brief recovery on Wednesday. The altcoin plunged to an intraday low of $145 on Tuesday before reclaiming $150 and settling at $155. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 5% and settling at $162 before dropping to $160 during the ongoing session. SOL has faced substantial selling pressure this week, with price action hinting at a short-term bearish setup. Despite SOL’s price struggles, investors have pumped over $280 million into the newly launched Solana ETFs. Analysts have predicted the ETFs could register as much as $5 billion in inflows over the next year. However, some figures in the cryptocurrency market have raised doubts about whether Solana’s infrastructure can handle high-frequency activity across ETFs, wallets, and consumer apps. Web3 infrastructure firm Alchemy has completely re-architected its Solana stack, with the overhaul aiming to deliver near-zero downtime, faster responses, and greater throughput. Bitwise’s BSOL has attracted over $417 million in fresh capital for the Solana ecosystem. Solana (SOL) rose 1.18% on Friday (October 24) and settled at $193. Price action remained positive over the weekend as SOL registered a marginal increase on Saturday before rallying over 3% on Sunday to reclaim $200.

The collaboration will integrate Concordium’s ‘1-Click Verify & Pay’ technology into the Bitcoin.com wallet, creating a compliant, privacy-preserving payment solution designed to support regulatory demands without compromising user anonymity. Currently under development, the integration is set to launch soon. It allows users to confirm specific identity attributes, such as age or jurisdiction, without exposing personal data or engaging in complex identity verification processes. All verifications are conducted off-chain by trusted third-party providers, and no personal information is stored on the blockchain. Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology ensures that each transaction remains private while adhering to regulatory standards. “At Bitcoin.com, our focus has always been on empowering people to take control of their finances through self-custody,” said Corbin Fraser, CEO of Bitcoin.com. “As the regulatory landscape evolves, partnerships like this one with Concordium help bridge the gap between privacy and compliance. By enabling age-verified payments that preserve user anonymity, we’re supporting a maturing crypto industry, one where individuals maintain sovereignty over their data while giving regulators the confidence they need for Bitcoin and crypto to achieve global adoption.” Concordium CEO Boris Bohrer-Bilowitzki added, “Partnering with Bitcoin.com brings our vision to life: secure, verified, reliable, and cheap payments that work for everyone, from individuals to institutions. By combining anonymous verification and payment into one easy step, we are reducing friction for users and merchants alike, enabling a new era of Smart Money worldwide.” The solution arrives amid heightened scrutiny around digital identity systems and state-backed data collection. Instead of centralised ID frameworks, Concordium’s approach offers a decentralized, privacy-first method for verifying eligibility, particularly for products or services that are legally restricted by age. Merchants will be able to verify access and accept stablecoin payments for items such as alcohol, gambling, or adult content, while avoiding the overhead of traditional compliance processes. This development also addresses a longstanding challenge in blockchain payments: regulatory acceptance of stablecoins in real-world commerce. Although the stablecoin market has grown to over $308 billion, the vast majority of transactions remain confined to crypto trading platforms. The absence of built-in verification mechanisms has hindered their use in everyday purchases and services. Meanwhile, jurisdictions such as the UK, France, and various US states are enforcing stricter age-verification laws for digital services. In the UK alone, the introduction of the Online Safety Act has led to over 5 million age checks per day as users seek access to restricted websites. Concordium and Bitcoin.com aim to offer a crypto-native solution that aligns with these emerging requirements, without compromising user privacy. The partnership underscores a broader industry trend toward compliance-ready blockchain solutions. By integrating verified payments into the Bitcoin.com ecosystem, the companies hope to catalyze broader adoption of stablecoins beyond trading, into practical, real-world payments that meet both regulatory expectations and user demands for privacy.

Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. (an outplacement firm) says companies’ job cuts are almost three times more than a year ago. Industries are increasing layoffs because of AI Most of these job cuts come from the tech, warehousing, and shipping industries because they are now automating their processes to complete work faster. These companies hired many workers during the pandemic, when demand was high, as almost everyone was shopping online and spending more time at home. However, now that demand has dropped, companies realize that AI tools are cheaper, so they no longer need as many staff. A similar situation occurred in 2003, when companies had to reorganize their teams due to the emergence of mobile phones and new digital tools. It’s the same change, but this time, AI is growing and spreading faster than mobile phones did, and can impact many different jobs simultaneously. Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said companies are also laying off workers because the global economy is falling. People and businesses are spending way less than they used to, and the costs of running a business have become so expensive that companies are doing whatever it takes to save costs. According to Andy, these layoffs create a cycle that makes it difficult for the global economy to recover quickly. People who lose their jobs struggle to find new ones, so they must compete for the limited job openings. In return, companies take too long to hire new workers because there are too many applicants, so they want to be extra careful. When job seekers spend too much time unemployed, they reduce their spending, which in turn affects the wider economy by slowing down growth. Experts say workers must learn new skills to transition into careers that require human judgment, as AI can’t fully replace these roles. The labor market is straining as seasonal hiring slows down As job cuts have reached record-breaking highs this year, the hiring rates for companies are at their lowest since 2011. The holiday shopping season, which typically runs from October to December, usually has higher employment rates due to strong demand; however, companies expect people to spend less this year. Some businesses say they might hire seasonal workers if demand increases, but experts believe the rates will be too low this year or early next year. People who lost their jobs this year will remain unemployed or be forced to accept jobs that offer less pay and fewer hours. Big tech companies aren’t left behind by this trend, as layoffs at Amazon, Meta, Target, and Paramount Skydance are also at an all-time high . Retail companies expect less shopping, while tech companies continue to add more AI systems. Entertainment firms are also in the mix because advertising and production spending remain uncertain. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once said the job market is cooling only “very gradually,” but the actual situation proves something entirely different. The national statistics appear steady on paper, but it’s the workers experiencing these effects firsthand who feel the slowdown is anything but gentle. Hiring is still occurring, as evidenced by the latest payroll report, which shows that the economy added 42,000 jobs in October; however, the rate of employment is slower than before. Families have less money to spend, and businesses lose confidence in the economy; as a result, the cycle continues to affect the labor market until the situation changes.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood just revised her Bitcoin price target downward, sparking discussions among investors. She now predicts Bitcoin could hit $1.2 million by 2030, a change from her earlier $1.5 million forecast. This adjustment reflects evolving market dynamics, especially the rise of stablecoins. Let’s dive into what this means for your crypto strategy. Why Did Cathie Wood Adjust Her Bitcoin Price Target? Cathie Wood explained her decision in a CNBC interview, pointing to stablecoins as a key factor. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are gaining traction in emerging markets. They offer a reliable payment method, potentially reducing Bitcoin’s dominance in those areas. Therefore, this shift impacts the overall Bitcoin price target projection. Wood believes that while Bitcoin remains a store of value, its payment utility faces new challenges. How Do Stablecoins Affect Bitcoin’s Use Cases? Stablecoins provide stability that volatile assets like Bitcoin cannot match for daily transactions. In countries with high inflation, people use stablecoins to preserve purchasing power. This trend erodes some of Bitcoin’s original use cases as a medium of exchange. However, Bitcoin still excels as a long-term investment. Key points include: Stablecoins enable fast, low-cost payments without price fluctuations They are increasingly adopted in regions like Latin America and Africa Bitcoin’s role may shift more towards digital gold rather than everyday currency What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? Investors should see this revised Bitcoin price target as a reminder to diversify. While Wood’s forecast is still optimistic, it highlights the importance of monitoring market trends. The growing use of stablecoins doesn’t make Bitcoin obsolete; it refines its position in the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, regulatory developments and institutional adoption will continue to influence Bitcoin’s path. Stay informed and consider both opportunities and risks. Can Bitcoin Still Reach New Highs? Absolutely. A Bitcoin price target of $1.2 million by 2030 implies significant growth from current levels. Factors like limited supply and increasing global acceptance support this outlook. Challenges such as competition from other cryptocurrencies exist, but Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage is strong. Therefore, long-term holders might find comfort in Wood’s adjusted prediction, which remains bullish despite the reduction. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape Cathie Wood’s updated Bitcoin price target underscores how dynamic the cryptocurrency world is. While stablecoins present new competition, Bitcoin’s core value propositions endure. By understanding these shifts, you can make smarter investment decisions and adapt to changes. Keep an eye on emerging trends to stay ahead in the crypto game. Frequently Asked Questions What is Cathie Wood’s new Bitcoin price target for 2030? She lowered it from $1.5 million to $1.2 million, citing increased stablecoin usage in emerging markets. Why did Cathie Wood reduce her Bitcoin forecast? Due to stablecoins becoming a primary payment method, which could limit Bitcoin’s adoption for everyday transactions. Is Bitcoin still a good investment despite this change? Yes, as it remains a prominent store of value with potential for substantial long-term growth. How do stablecoins impact Bitcoin? They compete with Bitcoin as a payment tool but don’t eliminate its role as a digital asset for wealth preservation. What should investors do in response to this news? Diversify their portfolio and stay updated on crypto market developments to mitigate risks. Could Bitcoin exceed Wood’s $1.2 million target? Possibly, if adoption accelerates or new use cases emerge, driving demand beyond current expectations. Found this analysis helpful?

The company aims to create a remarkable product ecosystem by offering a Star Points rewards program alongside a savings system that it claims will allow users to earn returns of up to 14% APY. Startale USD is defined as a digital currency that tracks the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. The project was designed with a transparent collateral structure and a clear goal of price stability. With USDSC, users benefit from low transaction fees and fully sponsored gas within the Startale App. Related News: Ripple President Monica Long Reveals What Lies Ahead for XRP According to claims on its official website, the company is also launching a new rewards system called Star Points. Users earn one point per day for every $100, and the longer they hold their assets, the higher the multiplier they earn. Users who hold for over 150 days can earn points twice as fast. These points can be redeemed for additional benefits and rewards in the future. However, let us remind you that the price of many stablecoins has suddenly dropped to zero in the past, and we should add that projects promising high returns should be approached with caution.

Several digital assets continue to show strong potential for growth. Discover which four coins are currently poised for significant gains and could lead the way in the next market rally. Dive in to stay ahead of the curve. Uniswap (UNI) Shows Modest Growth Potential Amid Price Dip Source: tradingview Uniswap is now trading between $5.37 and $6.61, hovering around a key support level of $4.88. Recent weeks haven't been kind to UNI, with a drop of over one-third in just a month. This could mean it's oversold, as the Relative Strength Index is near 46, hinting at a possible rebound. If buying interest picks up, UNI might challenge its nearest resistance at $7.36, which would mark a bounce of 25% from the lower end of its current range. Further gains could push the price up to $8.60, a potential rise of 60%. With indicators pointing toward overselling, a positive shift may be on the horizon for this cryptocurrency. JasmyCoin Hovering, Eyeing Potential Gains Amidst Market Struggles Source: tradingview JasmyCoin currently trades between just under one and just over one cent. The cryptocurrency faces resistance slightly above this level, around $0.0115, while finding support below one cent. Over the past week, the coin has dipped by over 13%, and by nearly a third in the past month. However, JasmyCoin has potential as it approaches resistance levels. If it breaks past $0.0115, it could aim for the next target at around $0.0128, a rise of over 18%. Despite recent downturns, JasmyCoin could see growth if market conditions improve, helping it rebound from a six-month slump of just over 50%. Raydium's RAY Sees Sharp Decline, Eyes Potential Recovery Source: tradingview Raydium's RAY is currently trading between $1.50 and $1.88. Recent weeks have been tough for RAY, with its price dropping over 26% in just one week and more than half over the past month. Despite this, there's room for optimism. The nearest resistance sits at $2.11, offering a potential rise of nearly 15%. If RAY can break through, $2.50 is the next target, marking a potential increase of over 30% from its current upper range. Support holds at $1.34, but with a low RSI, there's hope for a rebound if buying interest sparks. Sonic Faces Tough Road Ahead Amid Price Slump Source: tradingview Currently, Sonic is trading between twelve and seventeen cents. This marks a dramatic fall over the past month, with a drop of more than fifty percent. In six months, it has tumbled almost eighty percent. Despite this, there's a glimmer of hope. The next target could be the twenty-cent mark, a rise of more than fifteen percent from its upper range. If it breaks through, reaching twenty-five cents is possible, which means a jump of nearly fifty percent from the current top price. For now, with RSI under fifty and other indicators pointing to a bearish trend, Sonic faces an uphill battle. However, a subtle shift could offer growth potential. Conclusion UNI, JASMY, RAY, and S remain strong contenders for future gains. Each has unique features and solid potential. UNI continues to innovate within its sector. JASMY offers promising technology advancements. RAY benefits from strong partnerships. S shows resilience and steady growth. These coins are well-positioned for those looking to capitalize on the next phase of market movements. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Will the Decline Continue in November?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/latest-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-and-solana-sol-price-predictions-released-will-the-decline-continue-in-november/,"The cryptocurrency market experienced sharp declines this week following the prolonged US government shutdown, diminishing expectations for a Fed interest rate cut, and hawkish statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Following the sharp and sudden declines in Bitcoin and altcoins, investors' expectations of further declines have increased. The declines experienced at this point also significantly changed the expectations on the prediction market Polymarket. Investors believe that downside movements will continue in the short term, especially in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). According to Polymarket data, November expectations for BTC, ETH and SOL prices were as follows. 1.Bitcoin (BTC): In the predictions titled “What Price Will Bitcoin Reach in November?”, bearish expectations for BTC seem to dominate. A drop below $95,000 stands out as the most likely scenario, with a 39% probability. This is followed by a 36% probability that Bitcoin will rise above $115,000 in November. Finally, the probability of Bitcoin falling below $90,000 is around 20%, while the probability of it rising above $120,000 is around 17%. 2.Ethereum (ETH): The predictions titled “What Will Ethereum's Price Be in November?” also feature bearish predictions for Ethereum. At this point, the majority of market participants believe ETH will continue its decline in November. The most dominant scenario is pricing in a 47% probability of a price below $3,000. A rise above $4,000,000 is priced in with a 34% probability. These are followed by the third most prominent prediction, with a 27% probability of ETH falling below $2,800. The probability of Ethereum rising above $5,000 in November was limited to only 3%. 3. Left: The expectation of a decline is also clearly evident in the predictions titled “What Will Solana's Price Be in November?” The strongest scenario is below $140, which has a 51% probability. A break above $190 was the second-largest prediction at 41%. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Latest Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) Price Predictions Released!

This has revived hopes of a recovery. But fresh data suggest that the crypto asset went below critical trendlines, and analysts say multiple weekly closes under its 50-week moving average confirm the cycle top. Vanishing Demand Year-to-date, both gold and the S&P 500 have now outperformed Bitcoin, despite the dozens of seemingly bullish catalysts that the market has been leaning on into year-end. These include rate cuts, regulation, stablecoins, tokenization, liquidity, major trade agreements, strong GDP prints, Big Tech earnings, the “Big Beautiful Bill,” and the expectation of pro-crypto policy under US President Donald Trump. Michael Nadeau, the founder of ‘The DeFi Report,’ says the bull case still looks “good on paper,” but crypto market participants appear to be stuck in a zone between “hope and disbelief” as sentiment weakens and fundamentals deteriorate. Momentum data shows BTC, ETH, and SOL have all lost their 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs. The most critical line that the analysts are watching is $102,000, which happens to be Bitcoin’s 50-week moving average. In previous cycles, once BTC posted multiple weekly closes below its 50-week MA, the cycle top was already in. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s longer 200-week moving average stands at $54,700. Nadeau expects the asset’s price to eventually converge toward that 200-week MA (which is still rising) at the bottom of the bear market, if it is indeed heading into one. BTC, ETH, and SOL are now nearing oversold RSI levels (below 30) while longer tail altcoins are already oversold, which is normally a bull-market “buy the dip” signal. But the flow situation is flashing a warning. Bitcoin ETFs have been one of the most successful financial products in history from a net flows and AUM perspective, but since October 10, these vehicles have posted $1.4 billion in net outflows. ‘Hopium’ In The Market According to the report, the issue is not the size of outflows, but the absence of inflows, which points to demand depletion. Strategy currently holds more than 641,000 BTC. From October 2023 through July 2025, the firm purchased 476,000 BTC, equal to 1.19x the total BTC mined in that period. But in the last three months, the firm bought only 12,200 BTC. It currently holds 12x more BTC than the second-largest corporate treasury, and represents roughly 65% of the BTC Treasury market. With ETF demand fading and the largest buyer pausing , the report turns to on-chain cohorts. Long-term holders are selling more, indicating the third distribution wave of this cycle. The report says price expansions historically begin only after long-term holders move from distribution back to steady accumulation. In previous cycle peaks (2017 and 2021), it took 9.5-10 months for the price to bottom after long-term holders resumed net accumulation. Those coins are now being transferred to short-term holders, who often end up capitulating later at lower levels. This is when long-term holders return. As far as the sentiment is concerned, Nadeau said that it is still anchored to “buy the dip” because that strategy worked for almost two years straight. Nadeau also pointed to a recent essay from macro investor Jordi Visser wherein the latter described that Bitcoin is in a “silent IPO” phase and added that the market’s reaction to bullish “therapy-style” narratives shows that there is still a huge amount of “hopium” left in the system.

The announcement was made on Thursday, and it’s part of a much bigger push by Google to claw its way into the top tier of AI infrastructure providers, according to reporting from CNBC. The chip was originally launched in April for testing and private deployments, but now it’s going live, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Built entirely in-house, Ironwood is designed to power everything from training massive AI models to running real-time chatbots and agents. Google says each pod can connect up to 9,216 TPUs, removing what it calls “data bottlenecks for the most demanding models.” The company claims Ironwood gives customers “the ability to run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.” Google upgrades cloud tech to go after Amazon and Microsoft This launch isn’t happening in a vacuum. Google is locked in a three-way slugfest with Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta for control of the AI hardware space. Nvidia’s GPUs have powered most large language models so far, but Google’s TPUs fall under custom silicon, which the company says brings better pricing, better performance, and better energy efficiency. Ironwood is the latest product of a ten-year investment in TPU development. Google says it’s four times faster than the last TPU version, and customers are already jumping in. AI startup Anthropic plans to use up to 1 million of the new TPUs to run its Claude model, putting serious weight behind Google’s tech. At the same time, Google is overhauling its cloud platform to stay competitive. It’s rolling out updates that aim to make its cloud services cheaper, faster, and more adaptable, especially as it continues to lag behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. While Google’s latest earnings report showed $15.15 billion in Q3 cloud revenue, up 34% from a year ago, Azure jumped 40% and AWS came in with 20% growth. Google said it has already signed more billion-dollar cloud contracts in 2025 than it did in the last two years combined. To keep up with the rising demand for AI infrastructure, Google increased its capital spending target for the year from $85 billion to $93 billion. CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company’s earnings call, “We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions. It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year, and I think on a going-forward basis, we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that.” Nvidia CEO backs off after warning on U.S. AI position As Google moves in, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang finds himself under pressure. On Wednesday, Jensen told the Financial Times that “China is going to win the AI race,” blaming lower energy costs and weaker regulations in the country. He made the comments at the Future of AI Summit, sounding an alarm that the U.S. could lose its lead in AI tech. But hours after that quote made headlines, Nvidia posted a new statement from Jensen on his official X account. “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,” he wrote. Jensen has stuck with the argument that the U.S. can only stay ahead in the AI race if developers stay tied to Nvidia’s chips. That same logic has shaped how he talks to U.S. officials about keeping exports open, especially to China. Nvidia’s position in the market depends on developers staying dependent on its silicon, and Google’s Ironwood is now threatening that grip. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

According to him, the market sentiment at the moment is at its most depressive level, which signals a bottom rather than the end of the cycle. JUST IN: $12 billion Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan on CNBC: “I am optimistic that we are going to rally at the end of the year.” pic.twitter.com/QsEOKaeKBS — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 5, 2025 “ The crypto market is shifting to an institutionally driven market, and interestingly, that’s a bullish element. I am optimistic that we rally into year-end and Q1 2026,” he said. Bitwise CIO Says Retail Capitulation Signals Bitcoin Bottom He added that “The market needs to finish the flush out of retail leverage-driven sentiment, and we’re close to the bottom before a bullish reversal.” Hougan’s projection aligns closely with recent remarks shared by Fundstrat Capital CIO Tom Lee, who recently discussed Bitcoin’s state following the October 10 liquidation . In a separate CNBC interview, Lee noted Bitcoin’s struggle to stay above $103,000, explaining “Since October 10, that liquidation was like a miniature rupture, almost like a tsunami. The market is still consolidating from that effect.” Tom Lee tells CNBC that he still sees Bitcoin rallying into year end and being able to hit $150K-$200K pic.twitter.com/UEhWJ152lC — Rhino Bitcoin App (@RhinoBitcoin) November 3, 2025 Despite the short-term weakness, Lee argued that fundamentals remain strong, citing record stablecoin volumes and surging application revenues across Ethereum and Solana. “Fundamentals are leading price right now,” he said. “Eventually, we consolidate and rally into year-end, I still think Bitcoin can reach between $150,000 and $200,000.” BTC/Gold Ratio Bottom Shows Bitcoin Rally Coming Before Year-end Professional crypto trader and Kraken-backed prop firm co-founder Trader Mayne also weighed in on the current state of the market. Mayne believes the current Bitcoin structure remains consistent with the historic four-year cycle . “The current price action looks like a four-year cycle, acts like a four-year cycle — chances are, it is one,” he wrote, projecting a cycle top in Q4 2025 or early Q1 2026 . He further highlighted the BTC/Gold ratio , noting that gold typically leads Bitcoin breakouts by 60–90 days and that the ratio appears to have bottomed. Source: X/ Joao Wedson “Since Bitcoin hasn’t had its blow-off top yet, while gold, tech stocks, and even some crypto firms have seen parabolic rallies, I still believe Bitcoin’s explosive phase is ahead,” he added. Mayne also pointed out that Bitcoin’s next weekly cycle low is either in or imminent, which could precede a push to new all-time highs. My thesis for remaining bullish going into the end of the year has been built on a few things that I've covered repeatedly over the last 1 month+ on YouTube and here. Summarizing my thoughts below. 4 year cycle, I've been a staunch 4 year cycle believer, it looks like a 4 year… — Mayne (@Tradermayne) November 5, 2025 “ The chart structure suggests a cycle low that leads to a new ATH ,” he said, adding that he thinks Trump has a few tricks left up his sleeve to try to pump the markets going into 2026. However, he cautioned that while everyone is expecting a rally into year-end, if the current rally fails to establish a new high, the market could enter a prolonged distribution phase. Bitcoin Year-end Rally Points to 2026 Bear Market Incoming While the odds that Bitcoin’s top came in October around $126,000 are “ relatively low ,” Mayne noted that “ anything remains possible .” If the four-year cycle holds, he expects 2026 to be largely bearish, though not as severe as past drawdowns. “I don’t expect an 80% crash, but we could see significantly lower prices. 2026 might also mark a strong year for the U.S. dollar,” he concluded. Crypto investor since 2017, Credibull, also shared that Bitcoin on the high timeframes remains unequivocally bullish, and the current correction is considered normal and healthy in the high-timeframe context. Source: X/ CredibleCrypto According to him, the current correction should either hold above the lows at $98K (what’s called a “ running flat “) or potentially wick below them (what’s called an “ expanded flat “). In either case, there is no change in high-timeframe structure.

Still down around 5% this week and trading at $101,970 at the time of writing, the “digital gold” briefly slipped below $100,000 on November 5 for the first time since June, following the broader crypto market, which recorded nearly $1 trillion in monthly losses on the same day. BTC weekly price. Source: Finbold The fall beneath such an important psychological threshold further emphasized the stark reversal from the early “Uptober” euphoria, when Bitcoin soared to a record $126,251 amid heavy leveraged buying. As a result, traders are left wondering whether the flagship currency might crash again in the next few days, their anxiety fueled by a number of bearish developments, such as Galaxy Digital’s reduction of its year-end Bitcoin target to $120,000 from $185,000. Bitcoin warning signs The $102,000 level has served as a key support line since early 2023, and the failure to reclaim it could lead to a much larger correction. Bitcoin has also failed to reclaim its 20-, 50-, and 100-day exponential moving averages ( EMAs ), ranging between $108,000 and $112,000, while the 200-day EMA at $108,705 remains a firm ceiling. Momentum indicators are also bearish. The relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 37.85, showing oversold conditions and no bullish divergence, while the moving average convergence divergence ( MACD ) histogram at -660 confirms downward pressure. Accordingly, a sustained close below $98,000 could trigger further liquidations toward $92,000, lows not seen since the spring.

This year, there is an abundance of new projects entering the market, yet one of them has great foundations and an increasing number of investors showing interest in it, namely Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It has a price of only $0.035 and is already being described as one of the potential best crypto investments to make before 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Many believe Mutuum Finance is currently one of the most successful presales of 2025. The project has already raised a mark of $18.45 million, accumulated more than 17,750 holders, as well as sold approximately 790 million tokens. Out of 4 billion total supply of tokens, 45.5 percent (1.82 billion) of the tokens belong to the presale. The early buyers increased their token value by 250%, and currently, the token is at $0.035 in Phase 6 compared to the initial price which was $0.01 in Phase 1. Phase 6 has already been more than 83% allocated, and in recent days whales have gotten involved, some of whom have entered in excess of $100,000 at once. This sudden demand signifies the increased confidence in the project basics and its prospects in the long term in the DeFi sector. What is This Protocol About? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is intended to ensure that the digital asset markets become safer and more effective. The platform will allow borrowers to borrow against collateral and lend their crypto to earn interest without the help of intermediaries. The heart of the system is the mtTokens, which are yield-generating tokens provided by the users when they are depositing the assets. These tokens have an automatic appreciation with time and they depend on the interests gained through lending operations. This is a passive income-generating model that allows depositors to earn passive income in the on-chain environment. Another of its largest long-term strengths is the project has a buy-and-distribute model. Some of the revenue of the protocol is obtained to purchase MUTM in the open market and MUTM bought on the open market is returned to its users who stake the mtTokens in the safety module. This generates sustained purchasing pressure and benefits long term owners, bringing the project and its investors into agreement. Another major concentration point is on security. Mutuum Finance has been able to pass a CertiK audit, with a score of 90/100 on the Token Scan. Such verification would allow investors to trust in the quality and reliability of the code used in the project, a requirement of any DeFi platform desiring to enter the lending market. Stablecoin and Oracles Mutuum Finance is not only lending, they are also venturing to new finance infrastructure. The project is planning to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin, which will be minted on command and burned on command. Mutuum Finance is also planning on using Chainlink oracles to ensure the accuracy of prices, and the safety of the platform. These are necessary oracles to handle liquidations and collateral values, avoid manipulations, and maintain a balance in the lending markets. Thanks to these innovations, the growth potential of MUTM is now being compared to the early-stage projects such as Aave and Compound, two DeFi tokens that have gone viral following their launch. MUTM’s presale price of $0.035 and launch price of $0.06 suggest that the market analysts think that the token will reach a range of $0.25 to $0.30 by the year 2026, which is a 600-750% improvement once its ecosystem is live. V1 Launch and Why Phase 6 Is Important The V1 protocol launch is the next significant achievement that Mutuum Finance has, and that the team assured during Q4 of 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet. This release will also support the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token and the Liquidator Bot, the key workers of its decentralized lending system. At launch the testnet will support lending, collateralization, and USDT as well as ETH. The assets have been selected due to their liquidity and stability in the market and would be the best to launch smoothly. After the protocol is live, features can be tested and refurbishments made to the protocol before the mainnet is launched. It is one of the first milestones wherein Mutuum Finance has become a working product and not a presale concept, which is a very important milestone that not many projects are able to deter in the initial stages of their existence. It also provides groundwork into the future listings, partnerships, and the broader institutional usage. Time is relevant to the launch of V1. Attendance at Phase 6 is almost full, and the spirit of the investor is on the rise. The entry of whales is viewed as a bullish market indicator, where bigger investors are aware that there could be higher returns with the early entry. At the same time, smaller investors enjoy the accessibility of the project, as to them MUTM can still be bought directly by card and without any purchase limits, which was recently implemented to simplify the participation process in any part of the world. Final Thoughts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as one of the most successful new cryptocurrencies in 2025 at only 0.035. Its DeFi lending system, mtToken yield framework, and buy-and-distribute tokenomics build very good grounds of sustainable expansion. It has all the features of a high-potential early investment, and paired with certified security audit, stablecoin plans and a well-timed launch, it will satisfy all criteria. As the presale approaches the final stage with more whales coming onboard, many regard MUTM among the potential best crypto investments in 2026. Mutuum Finance could be arguably the best opportunity that would characterize the next phase of DeFi development, and it could appeal to all prospective low-cost token users who want to have a tangible utility and the potential to achieve a higher value over time.

Related Reading: Everyone’s Giving Up On Bitcoin? Crypto Exec Says That’s Exactly Why It Will Rise According to on-chain data, about 45,000 ETH — worth roughly $154.5 million at the time — was shifted from the lending protocol Aave into the Lido Finance staking pool. The transfer was public and traceable on the blockchain. It drew quick attention because of its scale and timing. Sun’s Public Wallets Grow The funds had been sitting on Aave before the move. They were then deposited into Lido, which issues staked-ETH tokens that let holders keep a form of liquidity while their ETH is staked. Based on reports, Sun’s public wallets now show around $534 million in ETH holdings. That figure has reportedly surpassed his holdings in TRON’s native token, TRX, which are estimated near $519 million. Market watchers say the swap signals a shift in how some big holders are allocating capital.

Some see the action as a vote of confidence in ETH’s yield options and protocol security. Others raised the point that large sums routed into single liquid-staking providers can add to centralization risks on the network. Price remains unpredictable. Also, staking carries its own risks — smart contract bugs, validator downtime, and slashing events are possibilities that investors must weigh. Market Context And Price Action Based on reports, ETH was trading near $3,389 when this movement was noted. The token had slipped about 12% in the previous week, which makes big staking flows more visible because large buys or internal transfers stand out against falling prices.

54099952,622377,1762444845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54099952.jpeg,Bitcoin Sentiment Flatline: Bull Score Crashes To 0 – What This Means For The Market,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sentiment-flatline/,"Despite a bounce in the price of Bitcoin back to the $104,000 mark, bearish pressure still lingers heavily around the flagship crypto asset. BTC’s recent market turbulence and strong pullback have triggered a surprising shift in its market dynamics, as evidenced by a sharp decrease in the BTC Bull Score Index. Bullish Momentum Vanishes As Bitcoin Traders Step Back While Bitcoin’s price has showcased robust bearish and downward action, several key metrics that measure market performance are starting to flip into a negative territory. The most recent metric that has turned negative is the Bitcoin Bull Score Index , which may imply that market optimism is seeing a hard reset. In a quick-take post on the CryptoQuant platform, a market expert and author with the nickname IT Tech, disclosed that the Bitcoin bull score index has fallen to level 0. The Bull Score Index is a crucial metric that monitors investor momentum, accumulation strength, and confidence across significant cohorts, and a decline to 0 is uncommon for the indicator. It is worth noting that the last time the index dropped to this level was in January 2020. A drop to this level often signals that all short-term mood indicators have completely lost their bullish conviction. Although it does not necessarily prove a complete trend reversal, the level indicates that enthusiasm has cooled down to its lowest possible reading. Even though the metric has fallen to level 0, the expert highlighted that the market is not in an early-bear capitulation like 2022. With BTC’s price remaining in the six-figure range, this reset follows a protracted bull market. Historically, a Bull Score of 0 indicated either late-cycle distribution before a trend reversal or macro bottoms as seen in 2020 and 2022. Given the current levels, the structure appears similar to a late-bull to early-bear transition than a deep capitulation. Presently, all 10 on-chain components are below trend, including the MVRV , ETF flows, stablecoin liquidity, demand growth, and trader margins. Meanwhile, Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and corporate inflows slowed, long-term holders continue to distribute, and stablecoin liquidity remains contracted. IT Tech noted that market strength is based on constrained supply rather than fresh demand, and momentum has completely cooled. However, IT Tech claims that ETF inflows, liquidity growth, and long-term holder re-accumulation must swiftly return in order for the market to regain strength. Otherwise, Bitcoin enters into a prolonged consolidation phase. A Change In BTC Market Pattern After examining the Bitcoin Realized Cap , Mignolet, a market expert, has outlined a shift in the current market structure. Although the pattern has changed, market interest in BTC is still strong. This pattern is one of the shifts that followed the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs. Before ETFs, Mignolet highlighted that most of the attention was drawn by ratio-based data. However, this pattern changed after the BTC Spot ETFs were greenlighted. A look beyond ratios shows that the market is not overheated, but this was not the case, as investor interest was obviously high.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Bull Score Index|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Realized Cap|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|ETF|exchange-traded fund|IT Tech|Mignolet|MVRV,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 16:00:45

For holders of XRP, this isn’t just another nugget to digest—it may mark a turning point in how the company engages with institutional finance. According to market analyst Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders, “they raised $500 million at a $40 billion company valuation” in a move that he says “signals… they want to deepen ties with institutional financial partners.” What exactly did Ripple announce? In its recent funding round, Ripple secured approximately $500 million in external capital, positioning the company at an implied valuation near $40 billion. This financing was backed by heavyweight institutional investors and is being directed toward building out infrastructure tailored for large-scale, regulated finance. Sources confirm that the firm intends to allocate these funds toward stablecoin development, custody services, prime brokerage, and corporate treasury solutions. What Ripple Just did is SHOCKING! $XRP holders listen up! Comment “knowledge” to learn more! Like & repost to raise awareness pic.twitter.com/1wWAOGYX7M — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 5, 2025 Why this matters for institutional adoption Ripple’s shift from a payments-network operator to a full-fledged institutional infrastructure provider is significant. As Rietveld puts it, “they want to accelerate growth in areas like stablecoins, custody… prime brokerage and corporate treasury solutions.” That statement underscores an explicit move away from retail-oriented narratives toward large-scale finance engagement. With regulated institutions entering crypto ecosystems ever more frequently, this strategy places XRP and the Ripple network in a position to benefit indirectly from institutional flows—even if token-linkage remains complex. How this could impact XRP’s token dynamics While funding the corporate arm does not translate automatically to token price, the backdrop is noteworthy. Enhanced institutional infrastructure tends to raise utility and credibility. If Ripple successfully deepens its relationships with banks and asset managers, XRP usage could increase in treasury, custody, or transfer-settlement roles. Over time, that might shift market sentiment. Rietveld suggests these are precisely the catalysts that could help XRP climb, though he cautions: investors must remain grounded in facts and road maps, not hype alone. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What holders should monitor now XRP holders should focus on three key signals: Institutional partnerships: Announcements of banks or asset managers integrating Ripple’s infrastructure or using the XRP ledger for treasury operations. Token-economy mechanics: Updates on how XRP usage ties into these new infrastructure functions—are tokens being held, burned, used in settlement? Regulatory and custodial clearance: Success in offering custody services and regulated stablecoins will reduce friction for institutional entry. Any slip-ups or delays here could dampen enthusiasm. In conclusion, Ripple’s $500 million raise and its pivot toward institutional finance mark a major corporate milestone. As Levi Rietveld wrote, “the craziest part is most of you guys are completely sleeping on this.” For XRP holders, this means that the narrative is shifting. The opportunity lies not just in price speculation, but in recognizing that the company behind XRP is repositioning for a larger role in regulated financial markets. Staying alert, reading disclosures, and watching real-world integrations will be wiser than chasing headlines.

This sudden market move has traders scrambling as volatility reaches extreme levels. If you’re active in crypto trading, understanding what triggered this massive liquidation event could help protect your portfolio from similar shocks. What Exactly Are Futures Liquidated? When we talk about futures liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged positions. Traders using leverage borrow funds to amplify their trading size. However, when prices move against their positions, exchanges automatically close these trades to prevent further losses. The past hour witnessed an astonishing $101 million in futures liquidated , creating a cascade effect across the market. Why Did This Massive Liquidation Occur? Several factors typically contribute to such significant liquidation events. First, extreme price volatility triggers stop-loss orders and margin calls. Second, high leverage positions become vulnerable when markets move rapidly. The futures liquidated in this case likely involved: Over-leveraged traders caught in sudden price swings Cascading liquidations amplifying market moves Stop-loss hunting by large players Market sentiment shifting rapidly How Does This Compare to Recent Market Activity? The scale of this event becomes clearer when we examine the broader context. While $101 million in futures liquidated in one hour is substantial, the 24-hour total reaches $397 million. This suggests the market has been experiencing sustained pressure rather than a single isolated event. The pattern of futures liquidated throughout the day indicates ongoing volatility that traders should monitor closely. What Can Traders Learn From This Liquidation Event? Experienced traders understand that periods of high futures liquidated activity present both risks and opportunities. The key lessons from today’s event include: Always use proper risk management with leverage Monitor market conditions during high volatility periods Diversify across different time frames and strategies Keep sufficient margin to avoid forced liquidations How to Protect Your Portfolio During Liquidation Storms When markets experience massive futures liquidated events, several protective measures can help safeguard your capital. Consider reducing leverage during uncertain market conditions. Additionally, setting wider stop-loss levels can prevent being caught in liquidation cascades. Remember that the $101 million in futures liquidated today serves as a stark reminder that risk management should always come first. What’s Next for Crypto Markets After This Liquidation? Following such significant futures liquidated activity, markets often experience a period of consolidation or continued volatility. Traders should watch for: Potential buying opportunities after the sell-off Changes in open interest and funding rates Market sentiment shifts on social media and news Institutional reactions to the volatility The dramatic hour that saw $101 million in futures liquidated underscores the inherent risks and opportunities in cryptocurrency trading.
