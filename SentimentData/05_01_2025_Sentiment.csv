The latest report by blockchain security company CertiK recorded a total of approximately $28.6 million in losses – the lowest monthly figure in 2024. December Crypto Losses Are 2024’s Lowest Exploits dominated the financial impact, accounting for $26.7 million, while flash loan attacks and exit scams contributed $1.7 million and $200,000, respectively. Among the flash loan attacks, the most notable incidents included CloberDex, which suffered $501,279 in losses, followed by Clipper DEX with $450,811 and MoonMaker with $319,320. The largest single exploit in December targeted Gempad, with damages totaling a staggering $2.14 million. Other significant exploits included FBD, which lost $1.07 million, and Vesta DAO, $401,428. CertiK’s infographic revealed that December marks a sharp decline in overall losses, a stark contrast to peak months earlier in the year, where losses reached tens of millions monthly. The report also highlighted the growing threat of phishing, with the top victim (address 0x751e) losing $7.87 million, making it one of the costliest phishing incidents of the year. Other phishing incidents ranged between $1.4 million and $2.8 million in individual losses. Phishing Scams Persists Earlier last month, a cryptocurrency user revealed they lost $300,000 in a phishing scam after clicking a malicious KakaoTalk meeting link shared via direct message on X. The link, which was suspected of installing malware, compromised multiple wallets, including Ethereum and Solana addresses. The attacker allegedly transferred the funds to a wallet tied to the BingX exchange. More recently, Animoca Brands’ co-founder Yat Siu’s X account was hacked despite two-factor authentication (2FA). The attackers resorted to promoting a fraudulent token named “MOCA.” The phishing scheme, tied to Pump.fun, targeted over 15 crypto-focused accounts, stealing nearly $500,000. Blockchain security firm SlowMist also uncovered a phishing campaign using fake Zoom meeting links to steal cryptocurrency. The scheme mimicked Zoom’s interface, which prompted many victims to download malware disguised as a meeting installation package. The malware then harvested sensitive data, including cryptocurrency wallet details, leading to losses of more than $1 million. Hackers who were found to be potentially linked to Russian-speaking operatives reportedly laundered stolen funds across exchanges like Binance and Gate.io.

With Republicans in control and new leadership at the SEC expected, the crypto industry anticipates a fresh start. Garlinghouse stresses the need for the U.S. to act decisively to maintain its global edge in cryptocurrency. As Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claims, the 119th Congress is now the most pro-crypto U.S. Congress in history, with Republicans taking control again after six long years. Pro-crypto congress brings optimism After all, this moment marked not only the victory of Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House again but also Donald Trump’s return to the White House, and the crypto community feels that their interests are going to be protected this time around. This could be a good time for an industry that has faced many challenges under the Biden administration and the SEC. Ripple is actually in a four-year lawsuit with the SEC. The SEC believes that the XRP token, issued by Ripple, is a security. Ripple claims it may alter its situation with the new Congress. Garlinghouse also explains how things are getting tough for crypto projects. On top of this, he talks about enforcement actions that are going to make so many businesses leave the United States. The cryptocurrency industry has made a massive investment in the 2024 elections, sponsoring more than 200 pro-crypto lawmakers through lobbies such as Stand With Crypto. Congress now includes many members who support innovation and investor protection, with one outspoken advocate, Representative French Hill. He has already announced that in the new session, he would pay attention to laws like the FIT21 Act and rules for stablecoins to ensure the industry is governed clearly. Garlinghouse pushes for clear U.S. crypto policies Garlinghouse noticed that both sides support cryptocurrency, but he pointed out that the rules from the Biden administration had made many people in the industry feel unwelcome. He criticized actions like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” which made banks less willing to work with crypto companies, creating more challenges for businesses in the United States. Still, he expressed hope that the new Congress will offer the industry a fresh start and a better place to grow. The new Congress will arrive at a time when China is going to spread its technology to developing markets, which increases the chances of entering those markets for them. According to Garlinghouse, the U.S. needs to move fast but smartly, not to engage in a battle. He says there needs to be clear policies that can make it easier for the U.S. to stay on top of the crypto and blockchain movement. This is the outset of a new age in cryptocurrency. With a new Congress and with expected staff changes at the SEC, many are expecting America to once again take the lead on crypto innovation. It is one of those moments in time that affords someone like Garlinghouse, as well as others of his contemporaries, a singular opportunity to drive for clarity in regulations, greater innovation, and for America to continue to be at the forefront.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 21:37:00

Here Are the 5 Best Tokens to Do It By March 2025,https://timestabloid.com/want-to-grow-your-500-portfolio-20x-here-are-the-5-best-tokens/,"Becoming twenty times richer through investments in three months may sound impossible. However, anything is possible—loss or gain—in the crypto market. For investors looking to make $10,000 by March 2025 from $500, we will discuss the five best tokens to make this dream achievable. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance uses an innovative approach to finance management to solve problems in traditional finance. These problems include high cost, illiquidity, lack of transparency, and global inaccessibility. Rexas Finance uses asset tokenization to turn real-world assets into tokens, solving these issues. Rexas Finance began its presale in September 2024 and has since gained significant attention. The project is currently in the eleventh stage of its presale and has raised over $34 million. The quick sales of the RXS tokens show that investors are confident in the project. Currently, each token is being sold for $0.175. Rexas Finance offers various tools, including the Rexas Token Builder for creating custom tokens, Rexas Estate for real estate tokenization, and Rexas GenAI for generating AI-driven NFTs. The project has undergone a CertiK Audit to prove its security. It is also listed on websites like CoinGecko and CoinmarketCap, where traders can get real-time updates about the token. Additionally, RXS will launch on major exchanges, increasing its reach and further boosting its price growth. With its remarkable presale success, innovative features, and clear vision, Rexas Finance is set to lead the asset tokenization space. RXS started at $0.03 and is now worth over 480% more. However, experts say this is only the beginning of its growth. RXS is poised to witness a 20X increase post-launch until March. Thus, it is an exciting option for investors who aim for substantial growth by March 2025. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera has collaborated with top companies like Nvidia, Intel, and ChainLink, which has resulted in significant coin growth and positioned it at the forefront of AI integration and decentralized finance (DeFi). RedSwan CRE’s tokenization of real estate assets and the introduction of a physically backed Hedera HBAR Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) in Europe further bolster the token’s adoption. While short-term market challenges have impacted HBAR, the formation of a bullish flag pattern and positive market sentiment suggest a potential rally. Analysts speculate that HBAR could reach $1 and higher by 2025, with factors like institutional adoption and regulatory advantages causing it to grow. Dogecoin (DOGE) Trader Tardigrade predicts DOGE could surpass $4 by January 2025, replicating the explosive gains during its 2021 bull run. Historical price movements show Dogecoin consolidating before sharp breakouts, and current charts suggest a similar setup is underway.Meanwhile, crypto analyst Javon Marks foresees a 570% surge, potentially reaching $2.28, if DOGE continues to align with its cyclical patterns. The coin’s history of exponential fourth-year gains bolsters this optimism, with some experts projecting a staggering 12,000% rally in 2025 that could push DOGE beyond $40. Despite recent struggles below its 50 EMA, Dogecoin’s resilience remains promising. Key support levels near $0.28 could provide a springboard for recovery. With momentum building and historical trends in its favor, DOGE presents a compelling case for exponential portfolio growth. Binance Coin (BNB) Based on technical indices, Binance Coin will likely retest its all-time high of $793.86. BNB recently witnessed a 5.21% price surge and a 29.39% increase in trading volume to $1.6 billion, reflecting growing market enthusiasm. On-chain data also shows that many investors are interested in the coin. Currently, BNB faces a key resistance at $705.06, which could temporarily limit gains. However, if this level is cleared, the asset may continue its upward trajectory, supported by robust market sentiment and strong buying interest. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $696. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 has skyrocketed nearly 13,000% this year, capturing attention with its goal to challenge traditional financial indices like the S&P 500. With a playful slogan that “6900 is greater than 500,” SPX has positioned itself as more than a meme—it’s a movement. A significant catalyst for SPX6900’s growth was its Kraken listing on December 11, which amplified its visibility and trading activity. Adding to its momentum, Binance introduced a SPXUSDT Perpetual Contract with up to 75x leverage, signaling strong confidence in its potential. This high-leverage feature, combined with a maximum financing rate of ±2.00%, has attracted a surge in trading volume and liquidity. Whales have also taken notice, swapping millions from other meme coins like BONK and WIF to accumulate SPX. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, SPX is well-positioned for sustained growth as retail and institutional interest builds. As meme coins gain mainstream traction, SPX6900 could outpace competitors like Shiba Inu, making it a promising candidate to multiply your portfolio by March 2025. Conclusion These five tokens are the top tokens to add to your portfolio if you want to multiply your investment by 20 times in March 2025. Rexas Finance is a new entry into the crypto market with the potential to skyrocket after its launch. You also have the chance to win $50,000 in its giveaway offer if you are lucky!

Despite the stablecoin’s young age, it has printed a sustained growth track to beat Paypal’s PYUSD and Circle’s EURC tokens. This milestone comes despite Ripple USD showcasing a much smaller market capitalization than the duo. RLUSD Stablecoin and the Performance Metrics Per data from CoinMarketCap, the Ripple stablecoin boasts a self-reported market cap of $53.1 million. Atop this, the stablecoin saw its trading volume jump by 1,566% in 24 hours to $607.58 million. This unexpected boost contrasts sharply with Paypal’s PYUSD with a $491.72 million capitalization and a 24 hour volume of $19.74 million. Also, Circle’s EURC, a MiCA-compliant token with market cap of $82.38 million and $10.55 million volume. While it remains unclear the reasons for the RLUSD stablecoin growth, uptickthe current outlook positions it as the 3rd most traded token after Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. A related growth is seen across the board for Ripple coin per data insights from XPMarkets. At the moment, the token has a total user of 7,600, up from the 1000 it recorded 24 hours after Ripple launched the stablecoin in December, 2024. With the RLUSD stablecoin’s growth trend, it is now the 13th largest asset on the XRP Ledger by market capitalization. The token’s growth also hinges on its expansion on top trading platforms globally. As reported earlier by Coingape, it launched on Bullish on Christmas Eve after it made its global debut on Uphold and Bitso. These listings helped boost its liquidity and accessibility by users. Ripple, XRP Ledger and RWA Agenda Beyond its direct role in facilitating payments, Ripple Labs has a bigger plan for the RLUSD stablecoin. The firm is making ambitious move in the Real World Tokenization (RWA) world through its partnership with Archax. Ultimately, the firm hopes to integrate the stablecoin as a primary liquidity layer in driving this use case. The firm recently launched its first tokenized money market fund on XRP Ledger lately, establishing its foothold in this industry. Ripple executives have reiterated how the stablecoin, XRP Ledger and XRP will form a complementary bond across its product suite. The liquidity boost of the stablecoin might account for the latest rally in the price of XRP as reported earlier by Coingape. As of writing, the coin was changing hands for $2.432, up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. In an earlier XRP price analysis , the coin is projected to hit Should the broad Ripple plans work out, analysts are projecting a potential push to $3.5.

In 2027, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $10,120 and $13,127, with an average expected price of $11,886. In 2031, ETH could trade between $23,172 and $26,740, with an average price of $25,166. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,333 Market Cap $401.64B Trading Volume $18.58B Circulating Supply 120.46M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,419 24 Low $3,340 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.96% (High) 50-day SMA $ 3,508.91 200-day SMA $ 3,046 Sentiment BULLISH Fear and Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-Day price chart On December 4, the 1-day Ethereum chart currently shows a price of $3,638.8, with resistance near the upper Bollinger Band at $3,848.2 and support at the lower band around $3,108.2. The middle band at $3,478.2 acts as a pivotal level, currently breached to the upside. RSI is at 56.72, signaling increasing bullish momentum but still below overbought levels. The price is increasing after consolidating near the lower Bollinger Band in December. A breakout above $3,848.2 could signal further upward momentum toward the $4,000 region, while a rejection near current levels might lead to a retest of $3,478.2 as support. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour Ethereum chart shows a current price of $3,642.8. The upper Bollinger Band at $3,700 acts as immediate resistance, and the lower band at $3,316.4 serves as support. The middle band at $3,508.2 represents a pivotal level for further price action. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.96 indicates strong bullish momentum, supported by the MACD, which displays a widening bullish crossover with the MACD line at 65.1 above the signal line at 52.8. If ETH breaches $3,700, it could continue toward $3,800. A rejection may see it testing $3,508.2 for support before further moves.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour Ethereum charts, ETH shows bullish potential with the price climbing to $3,642.8. On the daily chart, RSI at 56.72 signals positive momentum, with the next resistance at $3,848.2. The 4-hour chart complements this with a bullish MACD crossover and strong Balance of Power (0.96), suggesting continued upward pressure. A break above $3,700 could lead ETH to test $3,848.2 and potentially $4,000. However, consolidation or rejection at resistance may result in a pullback to the 4-hour middle Bollinger Band at $3,508.2 or the daily support near $3,478.2 before resuming its trend. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Despite rising in the last quarter of the year, Shiba Inu has been struggling to break through key levels and maintain investor interest. This price resistance is stifling upward momentum, pushing investors to seek greener pastures. Enter RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin with a game-changing feature: real-world asset (RWA) integration. With this feature, RCOF is bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto, garnering a lot of attention from SHIB investors who are looking to move away from speculative assets like Shiba Inu. What’s Causing The Shiba Inu Price Resistance While Shiba Inu captured investor interest with its impressive 2021 surge, this recent price action shows it’s facing significant resistance that is slowing down upward movements. These are some of the reasons for the headwinds facing the Shiba Inu price. One of the biggest factors affecting the Shiba Inu price is the token’s limited real-world utility. While the Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded with projects like ShibaSwap and Shibarium, their adoption is slow and hasn’t generated significant real-world use cases. This limited utility means Shiba Inu still has to rely on speculative interest to drive price action. This overreliance on speculative hype leaves the Shiba Inu price susceptible to swaying market sentences, resulting in this slowed progress. Another factor affecting Shiba Inu is market saturation and the stiff competition it faces because the memecoin market has become saturated. This competition is reducing Shiba Inu’s market share, making it harder to attract new investors or maintain existing ones. As these memecoins draw speculative capital away from SHIB, the Shiba Inu price fails to grow. From a technical analysis perspective, Shiba Inu has encountered resistance at several key price levels, notably at approximately $0.000026 and $0.000033. These levels have historically acted as barriers to upward movement, suggesting that significant buying pressure is required to break through them. Now trading at around $0.00002072, the Shiba Inu price is well below these resistance levels, showing a strong lack of momentum. RCO Finance: The AI Altcoin With RWA Integration Drawing Investor Attention While the Shiba Inu price continues to struggle, investors are shifting to RCO Finance because of its game-changing features that blend utility and innovation. RCOF is an AI altcoin that is revolutionizing how investors interact with traditional and digital assets. By integrating AI and RWA tokenization, RCOF seeks to create a more accessible and transparent financial ecosystem. RCOF offers access to over 120,000 tradable assets, including RWAs like ETFs, commodities, FX, stocks and more. By tokenizing these assets, this AI altcoin is democratizing access to them and making it easier for users to buy fractionalized shares of these assets. RCOF also allows users to buy RWAs directly using crypto instead of first converting it to fiat currency. By connecting RWAs to the blockchain, RCOF opens up new investment opportunities for financial inclusion and portfolio diversification all from one platform. RWA integration positions RCOF as a trailblazer in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance, attracting institutional interest and boosting mainstream appeal. Another stand-out feature of this AI altcoin is the robo-advisor. This AI-powered tool serves as your trading assistant, customizing its support to fit your preferences. For instance, it offers personalized investment plans tailored to your goals and risk tolerance. It analyzes vast amounts of data to provide actionable insights that help you make smarter choices. With these insights, you can avoid emotional trading and remain rational, especially during extreme market volatility. The robo-advisor also offers automated trading and portfolio management. This feature allows it to execute trades and adjust your portfolio autonomously. This allows you to capitalize on new opportunities and mitigate risks as they rise. This AI altcoin relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning to carry out its operations. As such, security is a top priority. To ensure its smart contracts and codebase are up to standard, RCOF has undergone a thorough SolidProof audit, which shows that the platform is secure and reliable. Make the Smart Shift to RCOF The Shiba Inu price resistance has signaled a need for investors to explore alternatives with stronger fundamentals and real-world applications. With its AI capabilities and RWA integration, RCO Finance stands out as a strong contender. Bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance, this AI altcoin is set to become a market leader. The RCOF presale is underway, offering savvy investors the chance to get in early and secure their stake while prices are still low.

In the case of Solana, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has hit the bullish nail with his recent prediction that Solana could see a staggering 1,800% price surge and reach $4,000 very soon. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Daily Downtrend – Analyst Expects New ATH Soon In a post on social media platform X, Martinez highlighted a developing “cup and handle” chart pattern, which he claims is signaling a massive bullish breakout for Solana. He backed his analysis with insights from charting expert Thomas N. Bulkowski. Solana’s Road To $4,000 Martinez’s take on Solana is based on the monthly timeframe for the cryptocurrency’s price action. As he pointed out, Solana’s price action over the past few years most likely looks like that of a cup and handle pattern. This formation cuts across the 2022 bear market, the 2023 consolidation plus recovery, and the 2024 bull market. In terms of formation period, the cup part of the pattern was formed throughout 2022, 2023, and early 2024, when Solana broke above the resistance trendline for the first time. The handle formation was formed by Solana’s up-and-down movement around the $200 price level for most of 2024, which eventually culminated in a breakout to a new all-time high of $263 in November. As shown in the chart below, the cup and handle formation seems to have been completed already, and the only thing left is to wait and see how much Solana surges to the upside. In terms of a price target, Martinez made use of the Fibonacci extension indicator, projecting it from the 2022 bear market low of $9.96. The target is around the 2.00 Fib extension level, which puts the projected target around $4,000. Understanding The Cup And Handle: A Proven Bullish Formation The cup-and-handle pattern is a classic technical indicator often associated with bullish market behavior. It consists of a rounded “cup” that represents a period of consolidation and recovery, followed by a smaller “handle,” indicating a brief consolidation before a breakout. According to Thomas N. Bulkowski, who Martinez also highlighted in his analysis, the cup-and-handle ranks as the third most effective bullish pattern, with a 61% likelihood of achieving its projected target. Considering the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies, the odds this pattern presents is quite notable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $215 and is up by 3% and 16% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This price increase comes alongside a surge in activity, with Solana witnessing a 16% trading volume increase in the past 24 hours. If Solana were to reach $4,000, it would translate to a return of about 1,800% from the current price.

This AI altcoin is projected to gain 30,000%, a jaw-breaking surge that will change the story for many crypto investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Outpace The Dogecoin Price Surge With 30,000% Returns The Dogecoin price has seen fair ups in 2024. Compared to its 2023 price, the Dogecoin price saw a general increase of over 250%. However, experts predict that the Dogecoin price will do far better in 2025, rising from its current price of $0.31 to a massive $5. These predictions are partly based on the Dogecoin price history of hitting a surge at the end of every cycle. The Dogecoin price saw massive increases in 2017 and 2021, and now, another cycle will end in 2025. Driven by these past trends and the anticipated bullish crypto market, experts say the Dogecoin price could hit $5 next year. However, this is not the biggest surge to expect in the crypto market. Analysts speak of a cheap AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), that will do better than the Dogecoin price. This AI altcoin is currently priced at $0.0420 only, but experts predict a 30,000% rally next year. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents groundbreaking opportunities, such as allowing investors to trade over 1500 cryptocurrencies directly on the platform. Such impressive features have generated rapid adoption of the AI altcoin, as is evident from the presale results.

The current stage launched recently, yet close to 300,000 tokens have been bought, generating over $11,000. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has a definite supply of 1 billion tokens, which is well allocated to support a 30,000% rally. Experts predict that this AI altcoin will take over the $700 billion crypto wallet and AI market, effortlessly generating $5 million in monthly revenue. Therefore, investors should not sleep on this opportunity. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is offering gains that will exceed the Dogecoin price and other major players.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin’s rally nears $100k, the crypto market turns bullish, making now the perfect time to explore top altcoins like XRP, DOGE, SUI, and rising stars like Rollblock (RBLK). Bitcoin is on its way back up to $100k again, and the crypto market is turning bullish in response. Traditionally, where Bitcoin leads, altcoins follow, but what are the best altcoins to buy now? In this article, we’ll look at four different alts, from legacy crypto XRP to meme coin DOGE and see how they will perform as older altcoins. We’ll also take a look at newer cryptos, such as Rollblock (RBLK) , whose presale has caught the attention of the crypto market at large. Looking at the SUI price, it could be that this relatively new crypto is enjoying its first bull market, too. Read on to examine the potential of these four altcoins. As the 2025 Bull market gathers pace, is Rollblock one of the altcoins to buy now? With the 2025 bull market starting up, savvy investors are seeking the best altcoins to buy now, and Rollblock’s successful and ongoing presale has captured their attention. This GambleFi platform combines cutting-edge features like Revenue Sharing and deflationary tokenomics, with everything you’d expect from an online gambling platform. Its presale has already raised $8 million, and with the token price soaring over 340%, it signals confidence in Rollblock’s potential to tap into the $500 billion online gambling industry. Investors aren’t merely attracted to price speculation but to the real-world utility of its token. RBLK token holders benefit from passive income through revenue sharing, and with a 30% APY for staking, it’s using the best of DeFi to attract long term investment. DOGE corrects heavy after Q4 exponential rise DOGE has faced a significant correction after its impressive Q4 rally. Despite this pullback of the DOGE price, the broader crypto bull market is gaining momentum, which is where meme coins like DOGE often thrive. As the expected 2025 bull market gains pace, DOGE could emerge as one of the best altcoins to buy now. SUI price reaches ATH before slight correction SUI recently reached a new all-time high (ATH), and although a slight correction followed, the SUI price remains robust as sentiment among crypto investors grows bullish. SUI’s performance indicates a solid foundation, and analysts speculate the SUI price could continue its upward trajectory in 2025, especially given that it is SUI‘s first cycle. Up 5X in November, what is next for XRP? XRP surged an impressive 5x in November after strong links with the Trump administration. With the bull market of 2025 approaching, and of course, Trump taking office this month, analysts believe XRP could reach a new ATH, which would only be a 50% increase in the XRP price. Of course, nothing is clear from Trump, even though he seems to be pro crypto, XRP’s strong performance suggests that of all the legacy cryptos, it’s one of the best altcoins to buy now. So what are the best altcoins to buy now? With a new pro-crypto US government, this year is expected to be extremely bullish, so which altcoins to buy now? XRP ran wildly in November and looks well positioned with the government. The SUI price also looks primed to take off, and you should never write off DOGE in a bull market. But it’s the newest cryptos that bring in the biggest gains, and if Rollblock’s presale success is a signal, then 2025 could belong to RBLK.

This marks a significant expansion beyond cryptocurrency. This new feature lets crypto exchange users buy, sell, and transfer stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) via the Crypto.com App. Zero-commission Trades and Bonus Offering These services are now available to users in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Washington, and Arizona. Soon, the exchange plans to roll out these services nationwide. For now, the selected US users are entitled to zero-commission trades and a 3% bonus when they utilize the Crypto.com App for securities transfers. Noteworthy, the 3% bonus, which will only last for a while, is to promote the new service. After the promotional period, the bonus could be reduced or eliminated. Crypto.com users in the regions mentioned above can also gain access to fractional shares, further providing investors flexibility. The exchange is keen on integrating the Traditional Finance (TradFi) ecosystem and the crypto sector. Crypto.com introduced a few other services besides these new stock and ETF trading options in the last few months. Before the Christmas holiday, it introduced a pioneering sports prediction trading platform for US customers. Users are presented with simple yes/no decisions on sports events with potential $100 rewards per correct prediction. This new product focuses on enabling users to predict the outcome of a sports event, including basketball and the Super Bowl. Recall that Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League in August. Unlike the latest milestone available to only a few US states, the sports events trading is designed to be accessible to all states in America. Crypto.com’s launch of this service also redirected new utilities to Cronos (CRO), a Layer-1 project focused on democratizing smart contracts. Crypto.com Withdraws Lawsuit Against SEC In October, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over claims that some of its business dealings are investment contracts. In the exchange’s opinion, the SEC has adopted a regulation-by-enforcement campaign instead of providing clear regulatory guidelines. Shortly after a meeting between Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek and President-elect Donald Trump, the company suddenly decided to drop the suit . The incoming dispensation in the US is planning to implement crypto-friendly policies, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve.

38543769,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=637766,1736029563,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38543769.jpeg,Polymarket: 40% Chance Trump Creates U.S. Bitcoin Reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-40-chance-trump-creates-u-s/,"A recent Polymarket poll shows 40% believe President-elect Trump might create a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, stirring debates on its role in national finances. With nearly 200,000 Bitcoins already held by the government, this move could boost the U.S.’s position in the global crypto market. The concept of a Bitcoin reserve in the United States has pulled the discussion out of the cryptocurrency community and into wider circles, mainly fueled by the latest news and speculation. Polymarket Poll of U.S. Bitcoin Reserve A recent Polymarket poll discovered that 40% of respondents believed President-elect Donald Trump is going to create a national Bitcoin reserve-that alone may be the impetus for a change in the United States toward digital assets. Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market. There, users can make guesses about real-world events by buying and selling shares. Current odds on the platform indicate that many people think the Trump administration might back Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This guess is consistent with what Trump said about Bitcoin before and also has support in a positive attitude towards crypto within his administration. Proponents claim that the U.S. can gain a stronger position in the global cryptocurrency market and increase its financial plans by holding onto Bitcoin as a reserve asset. U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump Right now, the U.S. government has nearly 200,000 Bitcoins, worth billions, taken from various legal cases. Industry experts, like Alistair Milne from Altana Digital Currency Fund, suggest that even if Trump does not add more Bitcoin, he could create a “de facto” reserve just by not selling these assets. If the government keeps these Bitcoins, it will influence how much Bitcoin is available and help make its price more stable. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently proposed a bill that enables the government to purchase one million Bitcoins within five years. According to her, the reserve may help in paying off the country’s $36 trillion debt and making the U.S. dollar stronger. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve brings along very massive challenges. Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, had rejected this proposal and said the current law prohibits the Federal Reserve from owning Bitcoins. Such decisions should be taken by Congress, which would not agree with it because of the risks involved in price fluctuations and security with Bitcoins. For all the risks taken on by taxpayers, critics say there are far too many of them to entrust Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Sure, Bitcoin has spiked in value this year, but its recent history of big price changes leaves much to be desired when it comes to how dependable it may be as a long-term reserve. To top it all off, hackers will certainly break into government-issued crypto wallets. This concept of a bitcoin reserve is not something coming from America only. Bhutan and El Salvador have already placed Bitcoin in their national financial plans but on a much smaller scale. Precisely for this reason, since the U.S. holds a lot of Bitcoin and is economically very powerful, it can set a trend which other countries may adopt later on. There are many cryptocurrency supporters in Trump’s administration, which may help to create a Bitcoin reserve. This will be a huge step for Bitcoin if the plan goes through to become more of a financial tool. According to the Polymarket poll, more people are interested in knowing how digital assets influence national money policies. It is still unclear whether the U.S. accepts a Bitcoin reserve, but the discussions point out that if kept and grown by the U.S., Bitcoin is becoming very important. If Trump keeps and grows the U.S.’ Bitcoin reserves, then the cryptocurrency could be facing drastic change in status and purpose globally.

It’s got the highs, the lows, and everything in between. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned over the years, it’s this: the best opportunities often come during chaotic times. Remember the 1973 economic collapse? The markets were in tatters, but the smart folks who bought the dips back then? They set themselves up for life. Fast forward to today, meme coins are rewriting the playbook. Among the top contenders, BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its killer presale performance, a thriving community, and real utility. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Apu Apustaja are the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. Meme coins have exploded in popularity, starting with Dogecoin and branching into innovative projects that combine fun, utility, and massive ROI potential. But BTFD Coin is set to outshine them all. With its P2E game, referral program, BIG50 bonus, staking rewards and a community-powered roadmap, it’s got everything to redefine what meme coins can achieve. Let’s compare it to Neiro and Apu Apustaja to see why it’s stealing the spotlight. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin That Means Business Let’s kick things off with BTFD Coin. It’s not just another meme coin riding the wave—it’s creating its own tidal surge. The presale has been nothing short of epic, raking in over $4.9 million within its first month. Starting at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 13 at $0.000142. That’s a jaw-dropping ROI for early investors. And when the presale wraps up, BTFD will hit the market at $0.0006. Think about it—investors who got in early are looking at insane gains. Here’s how it works: you can snag BTFD Coins at a 50% bonus using the BIG50 bonus code. It’s easy as pie. Head to the presale page, connect your wallet, apply the BIG50 code, and you’re golden. But it’s not just the numbers. BTFD Coin is building a decentralised ecosystem with staking rewards , a play-to-earn game that’s got gamers hyped, and a referral program to sweeten the pot. And let’s not forget the community power. With over 7,600 holders and counting, it’s clear this project isn’t going anywhere but up. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in this weekend , this is it. Neiro: The AI-Driven Meme Coin Next up, we’ve got Neiro. While BTFD Coin rides on community and utility, Neiro brings artificial intelligence to the meme coin space. It’s positioning itself as a tech-heavy contender, claiming to use AI algorithms to predict market trends and optimise investment strategies for its holders. Sounds fancy, right? But does it hold water? Neiro’s presale numbers are decent, but they pale in comparison to BTFD Coin’s meteoric rise. The project’s AI angle is intriguing, but it’s also untested. How much of it is buzz versus real tech? That’s the million-dollar question. Investors are cautious, and rightly so. AI-driven tools are only as good as the data they’re fed. If the algorithms can’t handle the volatile nature of meme coins, it could be a recipe for disaster. Still, Neiro has its fans. The project’s presale has seen a steady influx of investors, and its focus on tech sets it apart in the meme coin world. But it lacks the same grassroots enthusiasm that’s propelling BTFD Coin. Without a strong community, it risks becoming just another tech-heavy project that fails to connect with the average investor. For Gen Z and Millennials in Australasia, who crave relatability and engagement, Neiro might feel a bit too corporate. If you’re looking for innovation, Neiro could be worth a punt. But if you want the full package—utility, community, and ROI—BTFD Coin is still the better bet. After all, AI can’t buy loyalty, and in the world of meme coins, loyalty is everything. Apu Apustaja: The Meme That Keeps on Giving Last but not least, let’s talk about Apu Apustaja. This meme coin takes its name from the infamous internet frog meme, blending nostalgia with humour to create a unique brand identity. If you’ve been around the internet for a while, you’ve probably encountered Apu’s sad-but-endearing face. But does nostalgia translate into a viable investment? Apu Apustaja relies heavily on its meme appeal. The project is big on community-driven initiatives, and its Discord and Reddit groups are buzzing. However, it lacks the utility that BTFD Coin brings to the table. There’s no play-to-earn game, no staking rewards, and no referral program. It’s fun, sure, but is it functional? That’s where it falls short. Financially, Apu Apustaja’s presale is moving along, but it’s not breaking records. Investors are drawn to the meme, but the project’s roadmap is vague, and there’s little to suggest it has the staying power of BTFD Coin. When the hype dies down, what’s left? Not much. That said, Apu Apustaja is undeniably entertaining. If you’re looking for a laugh and a small punt, it could be worth a look. But for serious investors aiming to maximise their returns, BTFD Coin remains the king of the hill. It’s got the numbers, the utility, and the community to back it up. And let’s be real—in crypto, those are the only metrics that matter. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to get in on the action? Here’s how you can join the BTFD Coin presale and secure your bonused price: Go to the presale page at BTFD.io . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or similar). Enter the bonus code BIG50 in the designated field and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to purchase and review the price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. It’s as simple as that. With the BIG50 bonus code, you’re not just buying coins—you’re buying into a community-driven revolution. Conclusion: Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the ultimate choice for investors this weekend. While Neiro offers innovation and Apu Apustaja brings meme nostalgia, neither can match the utility, community power, and ROI potential of BTFD Coin . With over $4.9 million raised and 62 billion coins sold, it’s clear that this project has captured the imagination of the crypto world. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing presale. Visit presale website today , use the BIG50 bonus code, and secure your 50% bonus coins.

That’s exactly what Altura ($ALU) represents. Just as ChatGPT transformed how we interact with AI in daily life, Altura is set to redefine gaming by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain. With its cutting-edge tech and potential to change the gaming landscape, $ALU could be on the brink of a meteoric rise to $1. Here’s why Altura is attracting so much attention and why it could be your next big opportunity. What is Altura ($ALU)? Altura is like a ""ChatGPT for gaming"" because it brings smart, adaptive technology to the forefront. It’s a blockchain-based platform that enables game developers to create, distribute, and trade smart NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Unlike regular NFTs, smart NFTs can evolve based on game progress or specific conditions, making them ideal for video games. Imagine a virtual sword that becomes more powerful as your character levels up—that’s the kind of innovation Altura is bringing to gaming.The $ALU token powers this ecosystem, facilitating transactions, governance, and staking. Altura’s mission is to seamlessly blend blockchain technology with gaming, offering developers and players tools that revolutionize their experience. Why Altura is Bullish There are several compelling reasons why Altura has massive growth potential: 1. AI Integration Altura leverages artificial intelligence to create smarter, more dynamic in-game assets. This integration allows for more immersive and engaging gameplay. As AI continues to advance and become more integral to gaming, Altura’s capabilities will likely drive significant demand for the $ALU token. 2. Low Market Cap Currently, Altura has a relatively small market cap compared to other blockchain and gaming projects. This gives it substantial room for growth. Low-cap projects often experience higher returns when they gain traction, making Altura a high-potential investment. 3. Not Listed on Major Exchanges Yet Altura’s potential is further amplified by the fact that it’s not yet listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. These platforms boast a combined user base of over 300 million. Once $ALU gets listed, the increased visibility and trading accessibility could result in a significant price surge. Price Predictions for Altura Here are the key price targets for Altura based on market performance and project growth: - Base Target: With a market cap of $1.5 billion, Altura could reach approximately $1.52 per ALU. This is the lowest expected target and could be achieved even in a challenging market environment, thanks to Altura’s strong foundation and ongoing innovation. - Bullish Target: A $3 billion market cap would push $ALU to around $3.03 per token. This target is realistic given the growing excitement around AI, gaming, and blockchain, as well as favorable market conditions. Altura’s position in these thriving sectors makes it well-suited to achieve this milestone, especially during an altcoin rally. - Ultimate Ambition Target: During a cryptocurrency super cycle, Altura could hit a market cap of $5 billion to $10 billion, translating to $5.05 to $10.10 per $ALU. This would likely coincide with a broader market boom, where Bitcoin exceeds $240,000 and Ethereum surpasses $15,000. Altura’s innovative role in the AI and gaming sectors could drive unprecedented growth in such conditions. Final Thoughts Altura’s combination of AI-powered smart NFTs, a low market cap, and the potential for major exchange listings positions it as a promising project. While all investments carry risks, $ALU has the hallmarks of a game-changing opportunity in the gaming and blockchain space. If you’re looking for a high-potential project, Altura could be your next big move in crypto. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

In a press release, the DOJ says that throughout the course of a decade, it has disbursed more than $4.3 billion to 40,930 victims of a fraud scheme led by Bernard L. Madoff. Madoff is known for running a Ponzi scheme for about 17 years that defrauded investors from 127 countries out of approximately $65 billion. The perpetrator convinced people to invest in his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, by promising decent returns while maintaining a trustworthy persona. The scheme collapsed at the height of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) when investors panicked and withdrew their funds en masse only to find out that their money was being used to pay other investors. In June 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for “running the largest fraudulent scheme in history.” He died in a prison hospital in April of 2021 at 82 years old. The DOJ says it recovered about $2.6 billion through several civil forfeiture actions against Madoff, his brother Peter B. Madoff, his co-conspirators and his clients who benefitted from the scheme including investors Carl Shapiro and Jeffry Picower. The agency also collected $1.7 billion after banking titan JPMorgan Chase settled accusations that the firm failed “to carry out its legal obligations” while serving as Madoff’s primary bank. Says Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York, “This office has never stopped at pursuing justice for victims of history’s largest Ponzi scheme… We have succeeded in compensating 40,930 victims with close to 94% of their losses. As this extraordinary effort demonstrates, this office and MLARS (Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section) are committed to protecting and assisting victims of crime, no matter how long it takes and no matter how complicated the endeavor.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Investors and market participants are preparing for the biggest period of growth and innovation yet. This excitement is fueled by changes in leadership and possibly a favorable regulatory framework on the horizon. This expected new shift in the U.S. has sparked fresh interest among crypto community members. Ripple CEO’s Vision for the Crypto In 2025 In a recent X post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse captured the moment, saying, “The journey is just beginning.” His post comes as the crypto industry celebrates major wins. Garlinghouse’s optimism reflects an industry eager for change, especially with the expected exit of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Also, the arrival of expert leaders in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and crypto sectors is fueling the excitement. These shifts suggest a more favorable regulatory environment that could bring the clarity the crypto world seeks. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which focused on whether its native token XRP is a security, has highlighted the need for clear digital asset regulations. Due to a tough regulatory framework, many crypto leaders have accused the agency of stifling innovations and growth. As the case continues, many hope the SEC’s new leadership will resolve the issue in a way that supports innovation. With Gensler’s departure, there is hope for a new approach at the SEC. A favorable outcome for Ripple could set a positive example for future regulation, helping businesses and investors. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer recently outlined six key guidelines for the SEC , urging clearer regulation of digital assets. These recommendations are part of Ripple’s ongoing effort to address the regulatory uncertainties around crypto. For Ripple, a win would solidify its crypto space leadership and encourage wider XRP adoption. The Pro-Crypto Congress and Market Momentum The arrival of the 119th Congress has been celebrated across the crypto ecosystem. This legislative body, described as the most crypto-friendly in history, represents a pivotal shift. Lawmakers with a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and digital assets will likely support policies encouraging growth and innovation. The impact of this change is already showing in market trends. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading crypto asset, has surged past $98,000, marking a strong start to the year. XRP has also seen a 15% increase since January 1. These price movements highlight the growing confidence in the market as investors expect new rules that could lead to more growth. A Call to Action for the Crypto Community Garlinghouse’s final words in his post, “Let’s get to work,” resonate as a call to action. The crypto industry is on the edge of a new era focused on teamwork, innovation, and opportunity. With a supportive Congress and clearer rules ahead, the stage is set for major progress.

With the crypto market moving in a new direction, investors have expressed confidence in predictions on the future prices of these cryptocurrencies. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Promising Contender In The Crypto-AI Market With Strong Growth Potential Prominent crypto analysts have predicted that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will touch $5 in the coming weeks due to its fast-growing presale and rapid growth potential. WalllitIQ (WLTQ) has gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts through its AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that promote financial literacy and decentralization. As a decentralized crypto wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) empowers users to have complete control over their digital assets. Confident in the platform’s potential, investors are positioning themselves for substantial returns, driven by the growing demand for its efficient and secure crypto wallet solutions. With its integration into the booming billion-dollar crypto-AI market, many analysts predict that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will reach $5 before Dogecoin and Shiba Inu achieve new all-time highs. Investors are flocking to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale in order to secure their positions in its projected $10 million revenue. In addition, early investors are entitled to several benefits, including governance participation, premium features, and early gains of up to 200% due to token price appreciation in the following presale stage. WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides its users with 24/7 access to blockchain-based activities such as yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that yield rewards of up to 180% annually.

Recently, the Dogecoin price reached a new high on the weekly chart, breaking through a critical resistance level at $0.32. This breakout serves as a strong technical indicator of sustained bullish momentum, suggesting further price gains may be on the horizon. A popular trader known as Trader Tardigrade declared on X (formerly Twitter) that the Dogecoin price had completed its final retest of the critical support level at $0.31. The analyst presented a chart predicting the Dogecoin price trajectory based on recurrent historical trends. Shiba Inu Projected Price Surge Amidst Market Volatility Although the Shiba Inu price has experienced volatility during this year, crypto analysts are projecting that the Shiba Inu price will touch $0.006 in the coming weeks. In the beginning of 2024, the Shiba Inu price was trading at approximately $0.000008. By December 30, 2024, the Shiba Inu price had risen to around $0.00002112, reflecting a substantial increase over the year. The above upward movement can be attributed to factors such as increased adoption, technological advancements, and broader market trends. However, SHIB’s price has shown both gains and corrections. As of the time of this writing, Shiba Inu is trading at a price of $0.00002112. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is still in its presale stage, offering investors a gateway to generational wealth with its native token (WLTQ) selling for a low price of $0.0420 .

Meanwhile, XRP has displayed considerable potential following an excellent year in 2024. With successes in regulatory areas and predictions of high prices, its community is looking forward to what 2025 will bring. On the other hand, Cardano is making a recovery, with experts suggesting it is ready for another upward trend after recent declines in price. Find out why these cryptos are the ones to watch in the coming year. Web3Bay Leads Decentralized E-Commerce Evolution Web3Bay is at the forefront of changing e-commerce by creating a transparent and decentralized market. This platform allows buyers and sellers to interact directly, which lowers fees and gives them complete control over their funds and personal data. Its versatile payment system accepts both cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods like PayPal, broadening its appeal to crypto enthusiasts and regular consumers alike. For merchants, particularly in areas with limited access to banks, Web3Bay provides an entry into worldwide markets without the need for traditional financial services. Now in presale stage 2 priced at $0.00345, Web3Bay has amassed over $280,000, selling upwards of 77 million 3BAY coins. Planned across 28 stages with a price increase of 15% per stage, it offers a projected ROI exceeding 6000%. This platform’s combination of secure smart contracts and low transaction fees is set to revolutionize online shopping. XRP Surges with Regulatory Approvals XRP closed 2024 on a strong note, breaking past $2, marking a 370% increase over the year. Projections for 2025 suggest it could reach as high as $6.4, $13, or even $27, propelled by positive market trends and clear regulatory standings. The XRP community has reasons to be hopeful, especially after Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD was endorsed by the New York Department of Financial Services. This endorsement cements Ripple’s role in central bank digital currencies and enhances its payment system, positioning XRP for broader acceptance. However, some analysts, like pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton, express uncertainty about XRP’s future prices, stating, “I have no idea.” Yet, the possibility for growth is substantial. Cardano (ADA) Price Trends Signal Upcoming Rally Cardano has experienced volatile price movements, including a 40% decline after a 300% surge from its lows in November. Analysts such as Michaël van de Poppe believe this correction might soon conclude, setting the stage for new gains. This recent downturn is seen as a normal market adjustment, hinting at potential long-term upward trends. ADA’s entry into a new price range between $0.96 and $1.25 suggests room for growth, with targets between $2.50 and $3.00 under the right conditions. While many are hopeful about ADA’s prospects in 2025, it’s wise to stay cautious, balancing optimistic forecasts with potential challenges. Top Crypto Projects to Consider in 2025 As we enter another significant year in crypto, Web3Bay, XRP, and Cardano are distinguished by their potential to transform their respective areas. Web3Bay’s innovative marketplace could redefine global commerce, XRP looks to brighter prospects with regulatory advancements, and Cardano’s pricing dynamics suggest a strong rebound. These projects provide diverse opportunities, from facilitating global trade to ensuring secure payments and creating decentralized environments. Strategic timing and thoughtful planning are essential—make sure you’re ready to capitalize on the next major wave in crypto .

While Dogecoin retains its place as a popular meme coin, the trader’s endorsement of PropiChain stems from its robust utility, AI-driven features, and potential to disrupt the $300 trillion real estate market. With forecasts predicting a massive 53,039% rally, this altcoin is quickly becoming the focal point for investors looking for exponential returns in the coming bull market. Dogecoin: A Veteran Meme Coin Dogecoin has remained a favorite in the crypto space since its inception in 2013. It gained traction because of its loyal community and endorsements from influencers Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed during the 2021 bull run, offering life-changing returns to early adopters. However, the coin’s speculative nature and limited utility have raised concerns about its long-term sustainability. While the Dogecoin price may rally during the next market upswing, analysts believe PropiChain offers far greater upside for serious investors. What Makes PropiChain the AI Altcoin to Watch? PropiChain is a project that combines blockchain, AI, and real estate tokenization to solve age-old problems in the property investment market. The real estate market is filled with challenges, including high capital barriers, lack of transparency, and inefficiency. PropiChain addresses these issues through: Fractional Ownership : Investors can buy tokens representing fractional shares of high-value properties, making real estate accessible to anyone. AI Integration : Advanced AI tools provide data-driven insights, automated property valuations, and tailored investment recommendations. Metaverse Integration : PropiChain uses virtual reality to offer immersive property tours and facilitate global investor networking. These features position PropiChain as a practical and profitable investment, unlike speculative coins like Dogecoin. PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap and its BlockAudit security review further enhance its credibility, reassuring investors about the project’s legitimacy. The Power of AI in PropiChain What sets PropiChain apart from other altcoins is its cutting-edge AI integration. Data-Driven Decisions : The platform’s AI tools analyze market trends, identify high-growth areas, and offer real-time property valuations. Risk Mitigation : By using predictive analytics, investors can minimize risks and maximize returns. Streamlined Investment Process : Automated filtering and valuation tools simplify the process, making property investments faster and more accessible. For example, an investor using PropiChain’s AI tools could identify an undervalued property in a high-growth market and gain significant returns without the need for extensive research. Presale Stage: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. The price will increase to $0.023 in Stage 3, making now the ideal time to invest. Investing in the presale offers the chance to acquire tokens at a steep discount before they hit major exchanges. With projections of a 53,039% rally, even a modest investment could yield life-changing returns. Practically, a $500 investment during the presale could grow to over $265,000 if the forecastforecast is true. The Future of PropiChain The roadmap for PropiChain includes partnerships with global real estate firms, further development of its AI and metaverse features, and eventual expansion into other asset classes like art and collectibles. This forward-thinking approach positions PropiChain as a long-term player in the cryptocurrency space, with the potential to outshine established projects like Dogecoin. Conclusion While Dogecoin may see another rally in the coming years, PropiChain’s utility-driven model offers unmatched growth potential. Backed by AI innovation and the booming real estate market, PropiChain is set to redefine property investments and deliver exponential returns to its investors. With its presale price at just $0.011, now’s the best time to invest in PropiChain. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to turn a modest investment into life-changing wealth. Secure your tokens today and be part of a revolution in real estate investments.

Users on the Polygon-based platform have been betting on the projects launching their airdrops in Q1 2025 since the beginning of the year. The platform requires users to bid yes or no, depending on their choice of vote. The platform also ascertains the level of votes on a project, tilting the average odds towards the preferred options. Polymarket shot to fame during the United States election, where it predicted President-elect Donald Trump as the eventual winner even before the announcement was made. The platform currently has a list of projects that may likely launch in the first quarter of 2025, with users allowed to choose the side they want to bet on. Aside from Berachain and Linea airdrops, the platform has provided users with options to bet on Jumper, Pump.fun, and Aleo airdrops among others. Polymarket odds for Berachain airdrop rise Berachain has risen to prominence in the crypto industry, becoming one of the fastest-growing projects. It has also received significant funding, raising $43 million in 2023, before raising $69 million in a funding round in March 2024. According to sources familiar with the matter, the funding round was led by Brevan Howard Digital and Framework Ventures, pushing its value above $1 billion. Berachain is a layer-1 network, housing a handful of DeFi-related applications in its ecosystem. Its native exchange BEX is also looking to rival Uniswap, allowing users to swap tokens, while its lending protocol BEND, allows users to borrow and lend tokens, just like Aave. According to on-chain data , Berachain has handled more than 500 million transactions since inception, with about 57 million taking place in the last 14 days. Berachain has also witnessed a surge in active addresses on its platform, rising from 945,000 on Dec 15 to about 3 million presently. The odds of Berachain launching an airdrop, according to Polymarket is at 90%, a figure up by 40% since the market was created. Users can bet on the ‘Yes’ option at $0.89, with the ‘No’ option currently at $0.10. The total volume of bets on the market is presently at $64,471. Linea ecosystem witness growth ahead of its airdrop Linea, on the other hand, is a layer-2 network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to supercharge the Ethereum network. It provides tough competition to other layer-2 rivals like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. According to on-chain data , Linea has handled about 241 million transactions, with around 241,000 coming in the last 14 days. Linea has a total value locked ( TVL ) of $383 million, with popular players like Mendi, ZeroLend, and Lynex in its ecosystem. Linea’s popularity can be attributed to its establishment by the popular crypto firm Consensys. Consensys raised about $450 million via firms like Softbank, ParaFi, and Third Point. The Linea airdrop will be monitored by its foundation, an organization that was created in November 2024. According to Polymarket, the odds of Berachain launching an airdrop in the first quarter of 2025 is around 88%, up 38% since the market was created. Users can bet on the ‘Yes’ option at $0.90, while they can also bet on the ‘No’ option at $0.13. The total volume of bets on the market is presently around $16,561. Notably, the increase in odds does not necessarily mean the projects will launch the airdrops in the first quarter of 2025. It means that users have seen signs that have pointed to these projects launching the airdrop, seeing that it is the bettors that shift the momentum with their picks. Meanwhile, other projects like Wormhole, Hamster Kombat, LayerZero, and Eigenlayer have launched their airdrops with mixed success. Eigenlayer, for example, has dropped 30% from its listing figure, while Wormhole dropped a disappointing 82%.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 23:03:00

This market recovery has gained massive attention from crypto enthusiasts, resulting in significant accumulation of ADA tokens. ADA Whales Accumulate 40M Tokens Recently, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that whales have accumulated over 40 million ADA tokens from exchanges in the past 48 hours. This substantial accumulation indicates that whales began accumulating after the altcoin breached the trendline and broke out from a consolidation zone on the daily timeframe. Whales bought over 40 million #Cardano $ADA in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/YMc1dxQzjd — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 The expert’s report reveals how whales are accumulating ADA and highlights an ideal buying opportunity for retail investors. It has also been observed that the asset witnessed an impressive 16% upside momentum following this purchase. Why ADA Appears Struggling? The notable upside momentum, coupled with current rumors about a healthcare crisis in China, might be the reason behind today’s price decline and ongoing correction. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $1.07 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.1% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has also been impacted, registering a drop of over 50%. This indicates lower participation and further reflects fear among traders and investors. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Despite all this activity at the international level, ADA appears bullish and poised to continue its upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, the altcoin has already surged by an impressive 32% in the past three days and currently seems to be correcting itself for further gains. Source: Trading View ADA Price Prediction However, there is also a possibility that the market may extend ADA’s price correction for a few more days. Despite this, if the altcoin holds above the $1 mark, there is a strong chance it could soar by 25% to reach the $1.32 level in the coming days.

These incidents show the urgent need for better security, stricter rules, and more trust in digital assets. 2024 was a year for cryptocurrency, big security issues and scam projects have shown that the system needs improvement. According to SlowMist Hacked, there have been 410 security incidents reported in 2024, where huge losses account for $2.013 billion. According to SlowMist report , 2024’s losses, however, stand at 19.02% lower than in 2023, where a total of 464 incidents took place and left a loss of $2.486 billion. Major Security attack incidents of 2024 DeFi was the most vulnerable area with 82.68% of breaches. There were 339 DeFi cases, which resulted in a huge loss of $1.029 billion. This is 33.12% more than the 2023 version, which was $773 million. It shows how attractive decentralized finance has become for hackers due to weak security and flaws in smart contracts. The greatest loss was seen for Ethereum with $465 million loss. Binance Smart Chain, or BSC, followed second with the loss of $87.35 million. On May 31, some of the worst hacks occurred at the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin. There, hackers deceived users into helping them steal 4,502.9 BTC from the exchange’s official wallet by causing about $330 million in losses. It is the seventh largest hack in the history of cryptocurrencies and the largest since 2022. According to the FBI, United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, and the Japanese National Police Agency, North Korean hackers did this as part of an attack that came to be known as the Trader Traitor campaign. Another big hack involved the Indian exchange WazirX. There, a problem in the checks on multisig wallets meant more than $230 million lost. In February, hackers stole the private key of the PLA token smart contract on the PlayDapp blockchain gaming platform. With this move, they managed to mint 1.79 billion tokens with the attacker’s permission. After negotiations and an offer of a $1 million reward for white-hat hackers, the attackers were still free to create more tokens. The exchanges froze the tokens so they could not be sold in large quantities. It was a phishing email posing as a legitimate request from a partnership exchange. Around the same time, Turkey’s BtcTurk lost $90 million when hackers gained unauthorized access to its hot wallets in June, and Binance froze $5.3 million in stolen assets. Some of the biggest incidents were that of Singapore-based exchange BingX, which had reportedly suffered loss through unauthorized access to almost $45 million in September. Another was Radiant Capital in October with an estimated loss of about $50 million. Hedgey Finance is also in the list, losing about $44.7 million, and it’s because of input validation issues. Penpie lost almost $27.35 million from malicious smart contracts and flash loan attacks in the liquidity rewards. For this reason, there has to be an improvement in the security aspect for platforms. Rug pulls are where rogue teams advertise projects for cash and run off with it. Major Rug Pulls In 2024, fifty-eight cases of rug pulls happened, leading to a loss of $106 million. The largest rug pull in the zkSync system was $36.95 million. The most rug pulls occurred in the BSC system, at 28 in total. The most popular one was SHARPEI. It used images of Shar Pei dogs and celebrities to drive its price to $54 million. It was sold after this for $3.4 million, with a loss of 96% for the token. The nature of such incidents calls for proper regulation and necessary security measures over the fast-growing industry of cryptocurrency. Some proposals are for compulsory auditing of smart contracts, tightening control over KYC and AML, and also the provision of insurance pools from which an account can be withdrawn in the case of breach. Another tendency has been noted where countries begin taking collective steps to combat cyber threats at international levels. The SEC will probably play a pretty big role in the Trump administration because it’s an advocate for cryptocurrencies. As Congress is largely controlled by Republicans, it would probably focus on clear rules encouraging new ideas but at the same time protecting investors. Although there are so many problems, it is also ready to build a safer and stronger system. With the help of cryptocurrency support from the Trump administration to make security better with clearer rules, it could enter a new time of creativity in trust in digital assets. It all depends on how regulators and developers work with the community to solve problems that may arise in 2025.

This upward momentum has captured the attention of traders and investors, with many eyeing the possibility of a breakout that could propel SUI to fresh highs. The rally showcases strong bullish sentiment, driven by increasing demand and favorable technical setups. A decisive move beyond $4.98 might signal the beginning of a larger trend, positioning the token for further gains and strengthening its presence in the cryptocurrency market. As the price consolidates near this pivotal level, the focus shifts to whether the bulls can maintain their grip and push SUI into uncharted territory. With momentum on their side, the stage is set for what could be a defining moment in SUI’s price action. Analyzing SUI Path To $4.98 Milestone SUI’s rapid climb toward the $4.98 resistance level has captured the attention of traders, sparking anticipation for a potential breakthrough. The cryptocurrency has been riding a wave of bullish strength, with increasing demand and positive sentiment pushing the price higher. As it nears this critical level, the focus shifts to whether SUI can sustain its upward trajectory and break through the $4.98 barrier.

A successful break above $4.98 may unlock significant upside potential, with the possibility of reaching new all-time highs. Technical indicators like rising volume and momentum oscillators suggest that the rally may have more room to run. However, the path to $4.98 is not without its hurdles. Resistance at this price point could trigger a pullback or consolidation, leading to a test of support levels before another attempt to break through. Potential Scenarios: Breakout Or Consolidation? As SUI approaches the pivotal $4.98 resistance level, a successful breakout above this point might open the door to substantial upside potential. Breaking through this key level may lead to new highs and signify that the bullish momentum is strong enough to drive the price higher.

Such a move would reinforce market confidence, signaling continued strength in the trend and possibly attracting more buying pressure from traders and investors looking to capitalize on the upward movement. On the other hand, a failure to break through this key level might result in a consolidation phase, where SUI moves within a defined range as traders reassess the market conditions. During consolidation, the price may pull back to test lower support levels like the $4 mark before making another upside attempt.

He hinted at the numerous upgrades planned out for the Cardano-based light wallet platform this year. The Potential Lace Wallet Upgrades In his X post, Hoskinson suggested that Lace would make a debut on multiple platforms. This is in addition to the other new and exciting features that the wallet would welcome. Only a few days ago, the Cardano Founder voiced his optimism on the possibility for Lace Wallet to become a “powerhouse” this year. This was around the time when the wallet announced that its migration of users from Nami to Lace, was in “full swing. ” Apart from Lace, the Cardano ecosystem is also working on enhancing other solutions within the ecosystem. In November, Hoskinson engaged Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz in a technical discussion around Midnight and XRP . As a privacy-focused blockchain project, Midnight is designed to enhance secure data handling while also maintaining regulatory compliance. Hoskinson is very positive about Midnight’s potential to drive the evolution of privacy-centric Decentralized Applications (dApps) and further blockchain development. Their discussion suggests that there may be an impending collaboration between Cardano and Ripple in the near future. In the case of Voltaire, the Chang Hard Fork upgrade, which ushers this decentralized governance era launched in September. This launch put Cardano’s future in the hands of the community to govern. Consequently, Hoskinson confirmed that his last duty for the ecosystem “is to remove any roadblock for this transition.” He promised to prevent any bottleneck that will derail the plans this year. The Cardano Bitcoin DeFi Plans In addition to the different solutions designed by developers in its ecosystem, Cardano has plans to explore Bitcoin DeFi . There is currently a growing clamor for utility around the flagship cryptocurrency and recent partnerships between Cardano and BitcoinOS to create a bridge for both ecosystems. So far, the Cardano team has been saddled with the responsibility of coming up with a meaningful Bitcoin roadmap demo by May 2025. To achieve its set goals, Charles Hoskinson stated that Cardano will collaborate with Fair Gate Labs, a Multi Party Computational protocol. Notably, Cardano price is up 3.4% in 24 hours to $1.07 as investors remain hyped by its upgrades and ecosystem plans.

In a recent analysis, Marks suggested that the token could exceed $20 during the ongoing bull market cycle, a projection that represents a substantial leap from his earlier forecast of $2.28. $DOGE (Dogecoin)'s bull cycle performances, looking over the previous two, have consecutively become larger, and prices look to be well in the process of delivering yet another monumental bull showcase! Another, larger run bull this cycle could result in a more than $20 DOGE. pic.twitter.com/uNruqmBIBt — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 28, 2024 Marks attributes his prediction to historical trends, noting that the token’s performance during previous bull markets has demonstrated significant growth. In the 2017 market rally, DOGE’s value increased by 90 times, followed by an even more remarkable 306-fold increase in 2021. Based on this historical data and applying the Fibonacci expansion tool, Marks anticipates that the current rally, which began in late 2024, could see the token breaking past the $20 threshold. Skepticism Surrounding the $20 Target While Marks’ forecast has gained attention within the crypto community, it has also faced considerable skepticism. Critics highlight that for DOGE to reach $20, the cryptocurrency must achieve a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, given its current circulating supply of 147.44 billion coins. This valuation would surpass the combined market caps of leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, raising doubts about the feasibility of such a target. The digital asset currently holds a market capitalization of $47.8 billion, a far cry from the $3 trillion required to support the $20 price point. Detractors argue that the projection may not account for the practical and market-driven limitations that could hinder such an exponential rise in value. Data-Driven Optimism from Marks Despite these challenges, Marks has defended his forecast, maintaining that the historical data strongly supports his claim. He emphasizes that the token’s price movements in past bull cycles consistently surpassed the 1.618 Fibonacci level, and he expects this pattern to continue. According to Marks, dismissing the $20 target ignores the clear trend of growth seen in previous rallies.

For investors, Marks’s analysis underscores the speculative nature of meme coins like DOGE, which can experience extreme price fluctuations driven by market sentiment and historical trends. While the $20 projection remains highly contested, it reflects the optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s potential as the crypto market grows.

This Low-Cap Altcoin Could Rise 18,000x",https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-price-to-fall-below-60k-in-january-this-low-cap-altcoin-could-rise-18000x/,"The Bitcoin price has dropped 1.94% in the last 24 hours, reaching an intraday low of $93,592. This marks a 2.27% decline over the past two weeks, with Bitcoin’s market cap now at $1.85 trillion. Analysts warn that Bitcoin price may slump below $60,000 by January 20, during Donald Trump’s inauguration. On-chain data shows over 33,000 BTC, worth $3.23 billion, moved to exchanges, signaling bearish sentiment. Amid this uncertainty, a rising low-cap altcoin is gaining attention for its potential 18,000x growth signaling high ROI. Failure to Hold $95k Could Trigger a Steeper Bitcoin Price Decline Experts warn that Bitcoin price could face a major correction if it fails to hold the critical $95,000 support level. Market commentator Tone Vays suggests a drop below $95,000 could lead to a sharp decline, potentially reaching $73,000. Veteran trader Peter Brandt raised concerns that Bitcoin price might break down from a “broadening triangle,” a bearish signal that could potentially push it to $70,000. Analysts like Mark Newton and Benjamin Cohen also forecast that Bitcoin price could fall below $60,000 in the short term. Emerging Low Cap Altcoin Offers 18,000x Upside Amid Bitcoin Price Volatility PropiChain’s token presale is approaching $2 million, as this altcoin draws attention from investors who are eyeing a potential 18,000x surge. The key to this altcoin’s rising popularity lies in its AI-powered tools, designed to make real estate investment accessible to all, regardless of financial standing. PropiChain’s AI analytics analyzes vast datasets, including market trends and price shifts, to predict future real estate trends. By identifying upcoming opportunities, such as suburban areas seeing a surge in demand due to planned infrastructure projects, the altcoin empowers investors to purchase properties before prices soar. Using the AI automated valuation models (AVMs), this altcoin ensures precise property valuations based on historical sales data, market conditions, and property characteristics. These advanced tools help investors avoid overpaying or missing valuable opportunities. Moreover, this altcoin offers AI property filtering, allowing users to search for real estate based on ROI potential, market growth, and neighbourhood trends instead of just price and location. This feature caters to each investor’s specific financial goals, whether they seek consistent rental income or long-term capital appreciation. PropiChain has demonstrated its commitment to security and transparency by successfully passing a BlockAudit security audit, building investor confidence in the project’s integrity. PropiChain is also listed on CoinMarketCap , increasing its credibility and visibility within cryptocurrency. In the face of Bitcoin price volatility, this altcoin’s innovative AI solutions offer a promising alternative for those seeking reliable and scalable real estate investment opportunities backed by blockchain technology. PropiChain Token Presale Soars to New Heights As the Bitcoin price faces bearish signals, PropiChain’s token presale is gaining significant traction. Phase one raised over $1.2 million, and phase two has already exceeded $400,000. Early investors have capitalized on phase one, locking in profits. Phase two continues, offering tokens at a bargain price of $0.011, one of the lowest rates you will ever find. The price is set to rise to $0.032 by the end of the presale. With a limited supply and high demand, this altcoin is quickly becoming a sought-after asset. A $2,000 investment today could turn into over $36 million in profits by the end of the presale based on the 18,000x surge. It could continue to grow once the token officially launches. Investors can also take advantage of rewards through referrals and giveaways. This is an opportunity to tap into the future of real estate and avoid FOMO as the new year begins.

Ethereum Classic Set for a Rise & Dogecoin Could Reach $5,https://thecoinrise.com/inter-milan-partnership-boost-blockdags-push-to-600m-goal-ethereum-classic-set-for-a-rise-dogecoin-could-reach-5/,"As Bitcoin’s price climbs, the cryptocurrency market becomes optimistic, stirring excitement. Among the hot topics is the Dogecoin price prediction, hinting at a possible peak nearing $5. Discussions around the Ethereum Classic price also suggest a potential 8.53% rise by the end of 2024. In this buoyant market atmosphere, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction as a leading contender for the top crypto coins of 2025. The project is in the spotlight with its ongoing collaboration with Inter Milan, its current mainnet audit, and the widespread popularity of its X1 app miner. Its active community and strategic progress are driving it towards an ambitious $600 million presale target. Dogecoin Price Prediction Hints Surge Toward $5 Dogecoin’s recent market activities have garnered considerable interest in the crypto community. Following a consolidation period from November to mid-December, DOGE is now experiencing price movements that historically precede a significant distribution phase, potentially elevating the Dogecoin price to a new all-time high (ATH). This current trend draws strong comparisons to DOGE’s 2021 bull run. Looking ahead, predictions for 2025 suggest a robust bull market, possibly ushering in an altseason. According to Dogecoin price prediction, DOGE might climb past the $1 mark, potentially reaching between $4.5 and $5, reinforcing its status among the top crypto coins. Ethereum Classic Price Insights Ethereum Classic has faced challenges recently, with a 9.83% drop in its price last month. Despite these difficulties, the coin’s medium- and long-term outlooks are positive. It has appreciated by 30.07% over the past three months and shows a year-over-year increase of 30.17%. With the current market sentiment being somewhat bearish, the coin has proven its resilience by achieving 13 green days in the last 30 days and demonstrating a monthly volatility of 10.35%. These metrics emphasize Ethereum Classic’s potential for momentum, even in challenging market conditions. Analysts believe that the Ethereum Classic price might increase by 8.53%, reaching $30.55 by the end of December. BlockDAG’s Progress Toward a $600M Milestone with Inter Milan and X1 App BlockDAG is rapidly advancing towards its impressive $600 million presale goal, having already raised over $175.5 million and distributed 17.6 billion coins. Its standout performance is supported by key strategies including a partnership with Inter Milan , the nearing completion of its mainnet audit, and the X1 Mobile Miner app, which now boasts over 300,000 users. These developments have not only enhanced BDAG’s appeal but also positioned it as one of the top crypto coins of 2025. The presale, now at its 26th batch, has seen an exceptional 2240% ROI for early participants, with prices rising from $0.001 in the first batch to $0.0234 currently. A significant boost for BDAG’s global recognition comes from its collaboration with the prestigious Inter Milan soccer club. This partnership focuses on enhancing fan engagement through exclusive content, digital collectibles, and blockchain-based transactions, broadening BDAG’s reach to include both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s mainnet audit is approaching completion, preparing the project to offer secure, efficient, and scalable solutions. The X1 Mobile Miner app , facilitating the mining of up to 20 BDAG coins daily with minimal user effort, contributes to the project’s momentum. As the community grows and unique features continue to roll out, BlockDAG is on a clear path to achieving its $600 million target. For newcomers, the 26th batch offers BDAG at $0.0234, with an upcoming price increase to $0.0248 in the next batch. The Bottom Line With the cryptocurrency market buoyed by a stronger Bitcoin, optimism is palpable. Central topics include the Dogecoin price prediction, suggesting a potential high of $5, and the anticipated 8.53% rise in the Ethereum Classic price by year-end 2024. However, BlockDAG is capturing the most attention as it nears its $600 million crypto presale target. Its association with Inter Milan has greatly enhanced its worldwide profile, while its mainnet, currently in the final audit stage, is set to transform blockchain technology. Additionally, the widespread success of its X1 Mobile Miner app underscores the project’s accelerating progress. Clearly, BDAG is not just another crypto project; it’s a burgeoning movement poised to redefine the blockchain industry.

While traditional assets maintain their place, the dynamic crypto sector offers remarkable new prospects. Here we explore three hidden gems every investor should consider: DTX Exchange (DTX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogecoin (DOGE). The tokens stand out for their potential to deliver strong returns in crypto trading and for the innovation and utility they offer. Whether you want fairness in new crypto launches, meme coin momentum, or sustained bullish trends, these tokens are worth your consideration. Which one will dominate the 2025 crypto trading market? DTX Exchange: Where Fairness Meets Innovation for Huge Growth in Crypto Trading Imagine a token launch where fairness is not just a buzzword – it is the foundation! DTX Exchange , a new crypto project, is breaking the model of traditional token launches and ownerships that favor Venture Capital whales. Instead, its fair launch mechanism ensures everyone is on equal footing. Whether you are an experienced trader or a new investor, you are offered the same chance to participate in the presale. With incremental pricing, early investors are rewarded while avoiding the challenges of dilution or massive sell-offs in crypto trading. However, DTX Exchange is more than a fair launch mechanism. It is a technological powerhouse. Offering smooth access to stocks, forex, ETFs, and over 100,000 currency pairs, it is your all-in-one trading platform.

With live products like the VulcanX Testnet and Phoenix Wallet, DTX has already raised $11.4 million and attracted 300,000 users.

Pudgy Penguins Rallies as DTX Exchange Brings Real Utility to the Market Pudgy Penguins’ token gained 12% on January 2, 2025, hitting $0.40 before settling at $0.37. The PENGU rally aligns with a general bullish trend among Solana meme coins as the market rebounds. Market experts say PENGU could rally further to its all-time high of $0.55, marking a possible 50% gain. The market trading volume increased by 60% to $1.39 billion, supporting bullish momentum. Furthermore, PENGU’s open interest surged 20% to $222 million. Technical indicators, including the Awesome Oscillator, also indicate a continued upward momentum. DTX Exchange stands out with its fair launch mechanism, empowering all investors equally while offering an advanced platform with 100,000 TPS, 1000x leverage, and a profit-sharing rebate program. Unlike PENGU’s meme coin rally, DTX provides real utility and community governance. PENGU was valued at $0.0365 on January 3, up 2.42% in the past week. Dogecoin Breaks Out 7.9%: DTX Exchange Delivers Real Value Beyond Speculation Dogecoin gained 7.9% on January 2, 2025, to trade at $0.342 after breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. This technical formation indicates potential bullish momentum. The breakout, accompanied by a high trading volume of $2.99 billion on the same day, suggested the resolution of accumulated market pressure. Analysts forecast that DOGE might target the crucial $0.10 resistance level, with a successful break paving the way for new local highs. The price action indicates there is a clear uptrend, dominated by higher highs, hinting at sustained bullish sentiment in the market. DTX Exchange offers fairness through its unique launch mechanism, providing equal opportunities for all investors. Unlike Dogecoin’s speculative rally, DTX delivers a cutting-edge platform with 100,000 TPS, 1000x leverage, and strong community governance, ensuring long-term growth and real value. DOGE was valued at $0.341 on January 3, up 8.26% in the past week. Explore New Crypto Opportunities: DTX Exchange Outpaces PENGU and DOGE As 2025 unfolds, DTX Exchange (DTX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogecoin (DOGE) offer exciting opportunities for investors seeking high potential in the crypto trading market. Whether it’s DTX’s fair launch model and innovative platform, PENGU’s meme coin momentum, or DOGE’s sustained bullish sentiment, these assets offer unique advantages. Exploring these hidden gems now could lead to significant rewards in the cryptocurrency space. Nonetheless, DTX Exchange is the best investment due to its massive growth potential. At just $0.14 during Stage 7 of the public presale, DTX tokens are a great opportunity, with a listing price set at $0.20, a 42.86% profit.

Stellar, valued at $0.43, has analysts predicting a surge to $1.29 by 2025, driven by its role in cross-border payments and blockchain efficiency. Meanwhile, Litecoin has crossed the $100 threshold, bolstered by its capped supply and faster transaction times. However, amidst these established players, Web3Bay is quietly reshaping the decentralized e-commerce sector. Its 3BAY token, currently in presale, offers users governance rights and discounts, carving a distinct niche and providing an intriguing alternative in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Stellar (XLM): Price Predictions for 2025 and 2030 Stellar (XLM), valued at around $0.43, shows potential for significant growth. Specifically, analysts forecast a rise to $0.72 by early 2025, marking a 68% increase. Furthermore, by the end of 2025, XLM could reach $1.29 if market conditions remain favorable. Meanwhile, projections for 2030 predict a peak price of $6.19, with an average hovering near $4.60. These estimates are informed by a combination of technical indicators, market sentiment, and Stellar’s expanding use cases in cross-border payments and blockchain technology. In terms of technical analysis, current data reveals a 50-day moving average of $0.38 and a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 58.22, suggesting bullish momentum. Moreover, Stellar’s ecosystem continues to attract attention due to its efficiency and scalability, supporting its long-term growth potential. However, while optimism surrounds these predictions, the speculative nature of cryptocurrency markets necessitates a cautious approach, as external factors and market volatility could significantly influence XLM’s trajectory. Litecoin Surpasses $100 as Crypto Markets Regain Momentum Litecoin (LTC) has surged past $100, reflecting renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency market. More specifically, trading at $101.96, the asset has gained 1.28% in the past 24 hours, with a significant 22.73% rise in trading volume to $465.51 million. Additionally, its market capitalization now stands at $7.68 billion, emphasizing its continued market relevance. Often called “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin has maintained a pivotal role due to its faster transaction times and capped supply of 84 million coins. Currently, 75.36 million LTC are in circulation, enhancing its scarcity and appeal. Furthermore, its consistent performance through market cycles underscores its resilience and reliability as an investment. On the technological front, advancements have strengthened Litecoin’s scalability and privacy features, furthering its adoption. As a result, this renewed momentum is drawing investor attention as the cryptocurrency market shows signs of recovery. Thus, Litecoin’s consistent liquidity and robust performance highlight its enduring presence in the evolving digital asset ecosystem. Web3Bay Presale: Token Utility, Future Expansion, and Benefits for Early Adopters The Web3Bay presale introduces the 3BAY token, designed to redefine decentralized e-commerce. Notably, holding 3BAY tokens provides users with exclusive benefits, including transaction discounts, platform perks, and governance rights. Furthermore, token holders gain a voice in crucial decisions about the platform’s future, ensuring a community-driven ecosystem. Consequently, these utilities enhance user engagement and incentivize long-term participation, making 3BAY a unique asset in the crypto space. Looking ahead, Web3Bay’s ambitious roadmap promises transformative features aimed at reshaping online commerce. Specifically, future integrations include an NFT marketplace, enabling users to trade digital assets seamlessly. Additionally, plans for decentralized finance (DeFi) options will introduce staking and yield farming, providing additional earning opportunities. Moreover, Web3Bay aims to achieve cross-chain interoperability, connecting with major blockchain networks to ensure seamless transactions and scalability. Collectively, these innovations position Web3Bay as a forward-thinking project in the decentralized commerce domain. Currently, the presale is in stage 3, with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.0039675. Having raised over $300,000, the presale demonstrates strong investor confidence and interest in the platform’s potential. Furthermore, each subsequent stage includes a 15% price increase, offering early investors a chance to maximize returns before the token’s price escalates further. Therefore, joining at this stage secures a position in a pioneering project combining e-commerce with blockchain technology, while also capitalizing on the potential for substantial financial growth. Web3Bay offers a rare opportunity to participate in shaping the future of decentralized shopping. Final Call Stellar and Litecoin continue to demonstrate their potential as reliable assets, with promising price predictions fueled by solid use cases and market confidence. However, as these established cryptocurrencies aim to maintain their momentum, Web3Bay stands out by addressing a distinct sector: decentralized e-commerce. With its presale gaining traction and a roadmap rich in features like NFTs and DeFi integration, Web3Bay not only complements the broader crypto space but also introduces practical utility for users.

The crypto industry backs Deaton, citing stifled innovation and unfair treatment. Deaton emphasizes transparency and fair regulations for U.S. crypto growth. Attorney John Deaton, an ardent XRP holders’ advocate and a lawyer who was in direct confrontation with the SEC, presented a petition seeking a federal investigation into Operation ChokePoint 2.0, which has been reported to target cryptocurrency activity throughout the United States. John Deaton’s Fight Against Operation ChokePoint 2.0 He is willing to conduct the probe for free because, he claims, the people of America are entitled to more scrutiny and openness amid the rising intrusion of the government in the financial world. A discovery order revealed a massive coordinated effort to restrict cryptocurrency-related services. Coinbase was able to successfully gain unredacted documents from the FDIC. The exchange claims that between 2022 and 2023, the FDIC sent at least 25 letters to different banks, demanding that they either stop or scale back their services related to Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions, blockchain settlement networks, and tokenized deposit products. According to an industry expert, Nic Carter, the measures have suppressed financial innovation, thus locking out the emergence of products like Bitcoin-reward debit cards and loans collateralized by Bitcoin. He continued by saying that the actions by the FDIC were anti-consumer and anti-innovation as they halted the United States from gaining any ground in financial technology. Deaton contributes his voice in the discussion by claiming that he is afraid that Operation ChokePoint 2.0 will be very destructive. He argues that this is not just a matter of cryptocurrency but an outright attack on the free market system in America. This kind of move creates a very bad precedent as it limits financial infrastructure for legitimate businesses. Deaton further argued that unelected bureaucrats should not have the authority to determine who wins and who loses in the marketplace. He said such policies truly undermine America’s ability to remain a leading world power in innovation and economics. Custodia Bank was among the worst-hit institutions. They could not access the infrastructures of banking. However, the Custodia case was only a part of the bigger issues related to businesses that were seeking innovation in the crypto space. Calls for Accountability and Crypto-Friendly Regulations As Deaton notes, the effects of Operation ChokePoint 2.0 go far beyond immediate impacts on companies and ripple into their ability to succeed and innovate overall within the industry. He described these actions as a direct assault on the foundational principles of free market capitalism and transparency. The crypto industry has welcomed Deaton’s call for an investigation with open arms. In his appeals to Congress, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, urged earnestly that hearings be held regarding the actions of the FDIC. Nic Carter praised Coinbase’s choice to unveil the documents and advocated for prompt measures to tear down the systematic barriers that have been erected against the industry. The change in administration now to be manned by President-elect Donald Trump has also brought about a better regulatory environment. There is also a new “Crypto Czar” David Sacks who promised to take on the ChokePoint agenda, as well as Rep. French Hill who endorses reforms on fair and balanced crypto regulations. Many citizens have voiced optimism for future industry prospects, yet the sector still faces significant challenges. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has clearly stated that the Fed plans to make no investment in Bitcoin or similar initiatives. In addition, critics claim one needs to attain regulatory clarity while making sure that fair treatment of digital assets is ensured before additional barriers inhibit innovation. After all, Deaton himself recalled in a speech a call for accountability in investing which encouraged a balanced approach between innovation and investor protection. As they await the response from the new administration, the efforts of Deaton shine bright light on what is urgently needed concerning Operation ChokePoint 2.0. This interested industry people that one who took significant steps toward a long-held aspiration: a steadfast movement toward a fair and transparent system that would promote growth and innovation in the realm of digital assets. Based on the analysis of the FDIC documents and the response from the industry, it is clear that it is necessary to address these issues in a manner that the United States remains ahead of the rest of the world in the financial sphere.

Lenders are now witnessing a 14-year high in credit card defaults, reports the Financial Times. The bad credit forced lenders to collectively write off a whopping $46 billion in loans that are considered seriously delinquent in the first nine months of 2024. Based on data compiled from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the US banking industry information platform BankRegData, the figure represents a 50% year-over-year increase. According to BankRegData, Capital One customers are facing the highest credit card delinquencies, with a total delinquent amount of $7.68 billion, representing 5.36% of their credit card loans. Next is Citibank with $4.79 billion (2.93%) in delinquencies, followed by Synchrony Bank at $4.50 billion (5.02%), JPMorgan Chase at $4.10 billion (2.16%), Discover Bank at $3.9 billion (3.93%) and Bank of America at $2.56 billion (2.54%). The rapid rise in credit card loan defaults is a sign of strained consumer finances after years of high inflation and the subsequent rise in interest rates. Mark Zandi, head of Moody’s Analytics, tells FT that consumer spending power has clearly diminished in most households. “High-income households are fine, but the bottom third of US consumers are tapped out. Their savings rate right now is zero.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 00:26:00

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 107,500 followers on the social media platform X that if the Ethereum ( ETH ) rival continues following the same pattern it did last cycle, it could surge by a staggering 266%. “ADA is shaping up like it did last cycle, making me think a big move is near. A push to $4 might happen within a few weeks! Source: Ali Martinez/X ADA is trading for $1.09 at time of writing, a 13.5% gain during the last 24 hours. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Martinez identifies how Bitcoin ( BTC ) could confirm its next breakout. “BTC remains at a critical point. This might just be a retest of the 50-day MA (moving average) before a potential move lower. A sustained close above the 50-day MA is essential to signal the end of the correction and confirm bullish momentum.” Source: Ali Martinez/X The flagship digital asset is trading for $98,625 at time of writing, a 1.7% increase on the day. Concluding his analysis by using the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential indicator – which is used by traders to identify potential points of reversal for an asset’s price – Martinez says the technical analysis tool is presenting a bullish signal for the privacy-focused project Worldcoin ( WLD ) and the modular blockchain Celestia ( TIA ).

According to an analyst, Litecoin’s current technical setup points to strong potential for a parabolic breakout, with the $130 price mark emerging as a critical resistance zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details Narrow Bollinger Bands To Trigger Litecoin Breakout Prominent crypto analyst Tony Severino shared a price chart on X (formerly Twitter) showing Litecoin’s price action on a bi-monthly time frame, applying Bollinger Bands as a technical indicator to measure a cryptocurrency’s price volatility. The Bollinger Bands examine market volatility by plotting an upper and lower band around a Moving Average (MA), which acts as a basis line. In Litecoin’s case, Severino has indicated that the cryptocurrency’s 2M Bollinger Band width is extremely narrow, underscoring a lack of or significantly decreased volatility. Historically, Bollinger Bands are known to expand during periods of high volatility and tighten at low volatility. Severino’s Litecoin chart displays the upper Bollinger Band marked by the red line, the basis line by a blue line, and the lower band highlighted in the green area. The analyst disclosed that Litecoin’s candlesticks are currently positioned above the basis line at $83.3, indicating potential for bullish momentum. If the price of Litecoin continues upwards and crosses the upper Bollinger band at approximately $130, Severino predicts that it could trigger heightened volatility and an explosive price breakout. Based on historical trends, an extremely narrow Bollinger Band often indicates a potential for a bullish trend reversal after a period of consolidation. Severino’s analysis has pinpointed the upper BB at $130 as a crucial resistance area for Litecoin. A sustained break above this level on a high timeframe could pave the way for more gains, potentially pushing Litecoin significantly above its current market value of around $111.5. According to CoinMarketCap, Litecoin has recorded modest gains, increasing by 6.14% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the prominent cryptocurrency has also experienced a higher increase of about 11.7% to its current level. To reach the critical resistance area at $130, Litecoin is required to rise by approximately 18% from its market price. Litecoin Rally Predicted, Targets 38% Upside According to crypto analyst Mike on X, Litecoin is preparing for a significant breakout to a new price high. He forecasts that the cryptocurrency will record a 38% price rally from the breakout point at $106 to reach a fresh bullish target of $146.67. Looking at the analyst’s price chart, Litecoin appears to have broken the $102 resistance level and is approaching its next significant resistance at $122.77. The chart also highlights horizontal lines indicating critical resistance areas for Litecoin.

One name making waves in the crypto world is PropiChain , a project that promises a massive 12,000% return. Offering a blend of real-world utility and innovation, PropiChain is quickly becoming the go-to choice for traders looking to diversify and maximize gains. Let’s dive into why it is stealing the spotlight and leaving meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in its wake. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Losing Their Spark? For years, Dogecoin was the poster child for community-driven cryptocurrencies, powered by memes and viral trends. But even with its cult-like following, the coin is starting to show cracks. The Dogecoin price has seen sharp declines recently, highlighting its inherent volatility and limited clear use cases. While some loyalists remain hopeful, others are growing impatient with its inability to break free from its meme status. Similarly, Shiba Inu , touted as a “Dogecoin killer,” has tried to prove its worth through initiatives like Shibarium and token burns. While these efforts have created buzz, they haven’t resolved the coin’s primary issues: an oversaturated token supply and limited real-world applications. Despite its innovative moves, Shiba Inu continues to struggle with attracting long-term investors. This has left traders wondering if meme coins are really worth their time or if they should shift their focus to projects like PropiChain , which combine innovation and practicality. PropiChain: A Fresh Alternative to Meme Coins Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PropiChain is not built on hype alone. It’s designed to offer tangible value through cutting-edge features that redefine how people interact with cryptocurrency and investments. Here’s what makes PropiChain stand out: Fractional Ownership One of PropiChain’s standout features is its approach to real estate investment. Instead of needing enormous capital to purchase properties, investors can buy fractional ownership of high-value assets. This model democratizes access to the real estate market, opening the doors for small-scale investors to earn from a market previously restricted to the elite. AI-Powered Insights PropiChain’s AI tools are here to help with navigating real estate investments. From property appraisals to market trend analysis, these tools empower investors to make smarter decisions. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rely on social media buzz to drive value, PropiChain offers real utility, making it a more attractive option for serious investors. Metaverse Real Estate The metaverse might just be the future of how we live, work, and play. PropiChain taps into this space by enabling users to invest in virtual properties. Think of it as owning a piece of the next big digital world. As the metaverse grows, so will the value of PropiChain’s ecosystem, making it a unique blend of physical and digital investment opportunities. With features like these, PropiChain is quickly gaining traction as a crypto with real potential. What’s the Opportunity for Investors? PropiChain is in its second presale stage with tokens currently priced at just $0.011. This presents the perfect entry point as prices are set to increase in the next stages. Let’s put it into perspective: an investment of $500 today could potentially grow to $60,000 if PropiChain delivers on its projected 12,000% return. And with nearly $2M already raised, it’s clear that investors are taking notice. The platform’s successful listing on CoinMarketCap and completion of a rigorous security audit only add to its credibility. PropiChain is a well-structured, secure project that’s ready to make waves in the market. Conclusion The days of relying solely on meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu for quick profits may be numbered. While they’ve brought excitement and fun to the crypto world, their limited utility is becoming increasingly evident. PropiChain , on the other hand, offers a refreshing alternative; combining innovation, security, and real-world applications. For investors looking for a project with both short-term and long-term potential, PropiChain stands out as a clear choice. With the presale heating up and tokens selling fast, now is the time to act. Don’t just watch from the sidelines; get involved in a project that’s redefining what crypto can achieve.
