The latest report by blockchain security company CertiK recorded a total of approximately $28.6 million in losses – the lowest monthly figure in 2024. December Crypto Losses Are 2024’s Lowest Exploits dominated the financial impact, accounting for $26.7 million, while flash loan attacks and exit scams contributed $1.7 million and $200,000, respectively. Among the flash loan attacks, the most notable incidents included CloberDex, which suffered $501,279 in losses, followed by Clipper DEX with $450,811 and MoonMaker with $319,320. The largest single exploit in December targeted Gempad, with damages totaling a staggering $2.14 million. Other significant exploits included FBD, which lost $1.07 million, and Vesta DAO, $401,428. CertiK’s infographic revealed that December marks a sharp decline in overall losses, a stark contrast to peak months earlier in the year, where losses reached tens of millions monthly. The report also highlighted the growing threat of phishing, with the top victim (address 0x751e) losing $7.87 million, making it one of the costliest phishing incidents of the year. Other phishing incidents ranged between $1.4 million and $2.8 million in individual losses. Phishing Scams Persists Earlier last month, a cryptocurrency user revealed they lost $300,000 in a phishing scam after clicking a malicious KakaoTalk meeting link shared via direct message on X. The link, which was suspected of installing malware, compromised multiple wallets, including Ethereum and Solana addresses. The attacker allegedly transferred the funds to a wallet tied to the BingX exchange. More recently, Animoca Brands’ co-founder Yat Siu’s X account was hacked despite two-factor authentication (2FA). The attackers resorted to promoting a fraudulent token named “MOCA.” The phishing scheme, tied to Pump.fun, targeted over 15 crypto-focused accounts, stealing nearly $500,000. Blockchain security firm SlowMist also uncovered a phishing campaign using fake Zoom meeting links to steal cryptocurrency. The scheme mimicked Zoom’s interface, which prompted many victims to download malware disguised as a meeting installation package. The malware then harvested sensitive data, including cryptocurrency wallet details, leading to losses of more than $1 million. Hackers who were found to be potentially linked to Russian-speaking operatives reportedly laundered stolen funds across exchanges like Binance and Gate.io.

With Republicans in control and new leadership at the SEC expected, the crypto industry anticipates a fresh start. Garlinghouse stresses the need for the U.S. to act decisively to maintain its global edge in cryptocurrency. As Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claims, the 119th Congress is now the most pro-crypto U.S. Congress in history, with Republicans taking control again after six long years. Pro-crypto congress brings optimism After all, this moment marked not only the victory of Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House again but also Donald Trump’s return to the White House, and the crypto community feels that their interests are going to be protected this time around. This could be a good time for an industry that has faced many challenges under the Biden administration and the SEC. Ripple is actually in a four-year lawsuit with the SEC. The SEC believes that the XRP token, issued by Ripple, is a security. Ripple claims it may alter its situation with the new Congress. Garlinghouse also explains how things are getting tough for crypto projects. On top of this, he talks about enforcement actions that are going to make so many businesses leave the United States. The cryptocurrency industry has made a massive investment in the 2024 elections, sponsoring more than 200 pro-crypto lawmakers through lobbies such as Stand With Crypto. Congress now includes many members who support innovation and investor protection, with one outspoken advocate, Representative French Hill. He has already announced that in the new session, he would pay attention to laws like the FIT21 Act and rules for stablecoins to ensure the industry is governed clearly. Garlinghouse pushes for clear U.S. crypto policies Garlinghouse noticed that both sides support cryptocurrency, but he pointed out that the rules from the Biden administration had made many people in the industry feel unwelcome. He criticized actions like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” which made banks less willing to work with crypto companies, creating more challenges for businesses in the United States. Still, he expressed hope that the new Congress will offer the industry a fresh start and a better place to grow. The new Congress will arrive at a time when China is going to spread its technology to developing markets, which increases the chances of entering those markets for them. According to Garlinghouse, the U.S. needs to move fast but smartly, not to engage in a battle. He says there needs to be clear policies that can make it easier for the U.S. to stay on top of the crypto and blockchain movement. This is the outset of a new age in cryptocurrency. With a new Congress and with expected staff changes at the SEC, many are expecting America to once again take the lead on crypto innovation. It is one of those moments in time that affords someone like Garlinghouse, as well as others of his contemporaries, a singular opportunity to drive for clarity in regulations, greater innovation, and for America to continue to be at the forefront.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 21:37:00

Here Are the 5 Best Tokens to Do It By March 2025,https://timestabloid.com/want-to-grow-your-500-portfolio-20x-here-are-the-5-best-tokens/,"Becoming twenty times richer through investments in three months may sound impossible. However, anything is possible—loss or gain—in the crypto market. For investors looking to make $10,000 by March 2025 from $500, we will discuss the five best tokens to make this dream achievable. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance uses an innovative approach to finance management to solve problems in traditional finance. These problems include high cost, illiquidity, lack of transparency, and global inaccessibility. Rexas Finance uses asset tokenization to turn real-world assets into tokens, solving these issues. Rexas Finance began its presale in September 2024 and has since gained significant attention. The project is currently in the eleventh stage of its presale and has raised over $34 million. The quick sales of the RXS tokens show that investors are confident in the project. Currently, each token is being sold for $0.175. Rexas Finance offers various tools, including the Rexas Token Builder for creating custom tokens, Rexas Estate for real estate tokenization, and Rexas GenAI for generating AI-driven NFTs. The project has undergone a CertiK Audit to prove its security. It is also listed on websites like CoinGecko and CoinmarketCap, where traders can get real-time updates about the token. Additionally, RXS will launch on major exchanges, increasing its reach and further boosting its price growth. With its remarkable presale success, innovative features, and clear vision, Rexas Finance is set to lead the asset tokenization space. RXS started at $0.03 and is now worth over 480% more. However, experts say this is only the beginning of its growth. RXS is poised to witness a 20X increase post-launch until March. Thus, it is an exciting option for investors who aim for substantial growth by March 2025. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera has collaborated with top companies like Nvidia, Intel, and ChainLink, which has resulted in significant coin growth and positioned it at the forefront of AI integration and decentralized finance (DeFi). RedSwan CRE’s tokenization of real estate assets and the introduction of a physically backed Hedera HBAR Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) in Europe further bolster the token’s adoption. While short-term market challenges have impacted HBAR, the formation of a bullish flag pattern and positive market sentiment suggest a potential rally. Analysts speculate that HBAR could reach $1 and higher by 2025, with factors like institutional adoption and regulatory advantages causing it to grow. Dogecoin (DOGE) Trader Tardigrade predicts DOGE could surpass $4 by January 2025, replicating the explosive gains during its 2021 bull run. Historical price movements show Dogecoin consolidating before sharp breakouts, and current charts suggest a similar setup is underway.Meanwhile, crypto analyst Javon Marks foresees a 570% surge, potentially reaching $2.28, if DOGE continues to align with its cyclical patterns. The coin’s history of exponential fourth-year gains bolsters this optimism, with some experts projecting a staggering 12,000% rally in 2025 that could push DOGE beyond $40. Despite recent struggles below its 50 EMA, Dogecoin’s resilience remains promising. Key support levels near $0.28 could provide a springboard for recovery. With momentum building and historical trends in its favor, DOGE presents a compelling case for exponential portfolio growth. Binance Coin (BNB) Based on technical indices, Binance Coin will likely retest its all-time high of $793.86. BNB recently witnessed a 5.21% price surge and a 29.39% increase in trading volume to $1.6 billion, reflecting growing market enthusiasm. On-chain data also shows that many investors are interested in the coin. Currently, BNB faces a key resistance at $705.06, which could temporarily limit gains. However, if this level is cleared, the asset may continue its upward trajectory, supported by robust market sentiment and strong buying interest. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $696. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 has skyrocketed nearly 13,000% this year, capturing attention with its goal to challenge traditional financial indices like the S&P 500. With a playful slogan that “6900 is greater than 500,” SPX has positioned itself as more than a meme—it’s a movement. A significant catalyst for SPX6900’s growth was its Kraken listing on December 11, which amplified its visibility and trading activity. Adding to its momentum, Binance introduced a SPXUSDT Perpetual Contract with up to 75x leverage, signaling strong confidence in its potential. This high-leverage feature, combined with a maximum financing rate of ±2.00%, has attracted a surge in trading volume and liquidity. Whales have also taken notice, swapping millions from other meme coins like BONK and WIF to accumulate SPX. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, SPX is well-positioned for sustained growth as retail and institutional interest builds. As meme coins gain mainstream traction, SPX6900 could outpace competitors like Shiba Inu, making it a promising candidate to multiply your portfolio by March 2025. Conclusion These five tokens are the top tokens to add to your portfolio if you want to multiply your investment by 20 times in March 2025. Rexas Finance is a new entry into the crypto market with the potential to skyrocket after its launch. You also have the chance to win $50,000 in its giveaway offer if you are lucky!

Despite the stablecoin’s young age, it has printed a sustained growth track to beat Paypal’s PYUSD and Circle’s EURC tokens. This milestone comes despite Ripple USD showcasing a much smaller market capitalization than the duo. RLUSD Stablecoin and the Performance Metrics Per data from CoinMarketCap, the Ripple stablecoin boasts a self-reported market cap of $53.1 million. Atop this, the stablecoin saw its trading volume jump by 1,566% in 24 hours to $607.58 million. This unexpected boost contrasts sharply with Paypal’s PYUSD with a $491.72 million capitalization and a 24 hour volume of $19.74 million. Also, Circle’s EURC, a MiCA-compliant token with market cap of $82.38 million and $10.55 million volume. While it remains unclear the reasons for the RLUSD stablecoin growth, uptickthe current outlook positions it as the 3rd most traded token after Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. A related growth is seen across the board for Ripple coin per data insights from XPMarkets. At the moment, the token has a total user of 7,600, up from the 1000 it recorded 24 hours after Ripple launched the stablecoin in December, 2024. With the RLUSD stablecoin’s growth trend, it is now the 13th largest asset on the XRP Ledger by market capitalization. The token’s growth also hinges on its expansion on top trading platforms globally. As reported earlier by Coingape, it launched on Bullish on Christmas Eve after it made its global debut on Uphold and Bitso. These listings helped boost its liquidity and accessibility by users. Ripple, XRP Ledger and RWA Agenda Beyond its direct role in facilitating payments, Ripple Labs has a bigger plan for the RLUSD stablecoin. The firm is making ambitious move in the Real World Tokenization (RWA) world through its partnership with Archax. Ultimately, the firm hopes to integrate the stablecoin as a primary liquidity layer in driving this use case. The firm recently launched its first tokenized money market fund on XRP Ledger lately, establishing its foothold in this industry. Ripple executives have reiterated how the stablecoin, XRP Ledger and XRP will form a complementary bond across its product suite. The liquidity boost of the stablecoin might account for the latest rally in the price of XRP as reported earlier by Coingape. As of writing, the coin was changing hands for $2.432, up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. In an earlier XRP price analysis , the coin is projected to hit Should the broad Ripple plans work out, analysts are projecting a potential push to $3.5.

In 2027, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $10,120 and $13,127, with an average expected price of $11,886. In 2031, ETH could trade between $23,172 and $26,740, with an average price of $25,166. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,333 Market Cap $401.64B Trading Volume $18.58B Circulating Supply 120.46M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,419 24 Low $3,340 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.96% (High) 50-day SMA $ 3,508.91 200-day SMA $ 3,046 Sentiment BULLISH Fear and Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-Day price chart On December 4, the 1-day Ethereum chart currently shows a price of $3,638.8, with resistance near the upper Bollinger Band at $3,848.2 and support at the lower band around $3,108.2. The middle band at $3,478.2 acts as a pivotal level, currently breached to the upside. RSI is at 56.72, signaling increasing bullish momentum but still below overbought levels. The price is increasing after consolidating near the lower Bollinger Band in December. A breakout above $3,848.2 could signal further upward momentum toward the $4,000 region, while a rejection near current levels might lead to a retest of $3,478.2 as support. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour Ethereum chart shows a current price of $3,642.8. The upper Bollinger Band at $3,700 acts as immediate resistance, and the lower band at $3,316.4 serves as support. The middle band at $3,508.2 represents a pivotal level for further price action. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.96 indicates strong bullish momentum, supported by the MACD, which displays a widening bullish crossover with the MACD line at 65.1 above the signal line at 52.8. If ETH breaches $3,700, it could continue toward $3,800. A rejection may see it testing $3,508.2 for support before further moves.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour Ethereum charts, ETH shows bullish potential with the price climbing to $3,642.8. On the daily chart, RSI at 56.72 signals positive momentum, with the next resistance at $3,848.2. The 4-hour chart complements this with a bullish MACD crossover and strong Balance of Power (0.96), suggesting continued upward pressure. A break above $3,700 could lead ETH to test $3,848.2 and potentially $4,000. However, consolidation or rejection at resistance may result in a pullback to the 4-hour middle Bollinger Band at $3,508.2 or the daily support near $3,478.2 before resuming its trend. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Despite rising in the last quarter of the year, Shiba Inu has been struggling to break through key levels and maintain investor interest. This price resistance is stifling upward momentum, pushing investors to seek greener pastures. Enter RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin with a game-changing feature: real-world asset (RWA) integration. With this feature, RCOF is bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto, garnering a lot of attention from SHIB investors who are looking to move away from speculative assets like Shiba Inu. What’s Causing The Shiba Inu Price Resistance While Shiba Inu captured investor interest with its impressive 2021 surge, this recent price action shows it’s facing significant resistance that is slowing down upward movements. These are some of the reasons for the headwinds facing the Shiba Inu price. One of the biggest factors affecting the Shiba Inu price is the token’s limited real-world utility. While the Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded with projects like ShibaSwap and Shibarium, their adoption is slow and hasn’t generated significant real-world use cases. This limited utility means Shiba Inu still has to rely on speculative interest to drive price action. This overreliance on speculative hype leaves the Shiba Inu price susceptible to swaying market sentences, resulting in this slowed progress. Another factor affecting Shiba Inu is market saturation and the stiff competition it faces because the memecoin market has become saturated. This competition is reducing Shiba Inu’s market share, making it harder to attract new investors or maintain existing ones. As these memecoins draw speculative capital away from SHIB, the Shiba Inu price fails to grow. From a technical analysis perspective, Shiba Inu has encountered resistance at several key price levels, notably at approximately $0.000026 and $0.000033. These levels have historically acted as barriers to upward movement, suggesting that significant buying pressure is required to break through them. Now trading at around $0.00002072, the Shiba Inu price is well below these resistance levels, showing a strong lack of momentum. RCO Finance: The AI Altcoin With RWA Integration Drawing Investor Attention While the Shiba Inu price continues to struggle, investors are shifting to RCO Finance because of its game-changing features that blend utility and innovation. RCOF is an AI altcoin that is revolutionizing how investors interact with traditional and digital assets. By integrating AI and RWA tokenization, RCOF seeks to create a more accessible and transparent financial ecosystem. RCOF offers access to over 120,000 tradable assets, including RWAs like ETFs, commodities, FX, stocks and more. By tokenizing these assets, this AI altcoin is democratizing access to them and making it easier for users to buy fractionalized shares of these assets. RCOF also allows users to buy RWAs directly using crypto instead of first converting it to fiat currency. By connecting RWAs to the blockchain, RCOF opens up new investment opportunities for financial inclusion and portfolio diversification all from one platform. RWA integration positions RCOF as a trailblazer in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance, attracting institutional interest and boosting mainstream appeal. Another stand-out feature of this AI altcoin is the robo-advisor. This AI-powered tool serves as your trading assistant, customizing its support to fit your preferences. For instance, it offers personalized investment plans tailored to your goals and risk tolerance. It analyzes vast amounts of data to provide actionable insights that help you make smarter choices. With these insights, you can avoid emotional trading and remain rational, especially during extreme market volatility. The robo-advisor also offers automated trading and portfolio management. This feature allows it to execute trades and adjust your portfolio autonomously. This allows you to capitalize on new opportunities and mitigate risks as they rise. This AI altcoin relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning to carry out its operations. As such, security is a top priority. To ensure its smart contracts and codebase are up to standard, RCOF has undergone a thorough SolidProof audit, which shows that the platform is secure and reliable. Make the Smart Shift to RCOF The Shiba Inu price resistance has signaled a need for investors to explore alternatives with stronger fundamentals and real-world applications. With its AI capabilities and RWA integration, RCO Finance stands out as a strong contender. Bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance, this AI altcoin is set to become a market leader. The RCOF presale is underway, offering savvy investors the chance to get in early and secure their stake while prices are still low.

In the case of Solana, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has hit the bullish nail with his recent prediction that Solana could see a staggering 1,800% price surge and reach $4,000 very soon. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Daily Downtrend – Analyst Expects New ATH Soon In a post on social media platform X, Martinez highlighted a developing “cup and handle” chart pattern, which he claims is signaling a massive bullish breakout for Solana. He backed his analysis with insights from charting expert Thomas N. Bulkowski. Solana’s Road To $4,000 Martinez’s take on Solana is based on the monthly timeframe for the cryptocurrency’s price action. As he pointed out, Solana’s price action over the past few years most likely looks like that of a cup and handle pattern. This formation cuts across the 2022 bear market, the 2023 consolidation plus recovery, and the 2024 bull market. In terms of formation period, the cup part of the pattern was formed throughout 2022, 2023, and early 2024, when Solana broke above the resistance trendline for the first time. The handle formation was formed by Solana’s up-and-down movement around the $200 price level for most of 2024, which eventually culminated in a breakout to a new all-time high of $263 in November. As shown in the chart below, the cup and handle formation seems to have been completed already, and the only thing left is to wait and see how much Solana surges to the upside. In terms of a price target, Martinez made use of the Fibonacci extension indicator, projecting it from the 2022 bear market low of $9.96. The target is around the 2.00 Fib extension level, which puts the projected target around $4,000. Understanding The Cup And Handle: A Proven Bullish Formation The cup-and-handle pattern is a classic technical indicator often associated with bullish market behavior. It consists of a rounded “cup” that represents a period of consolidation and recovery, followed by a smaller “handle,” indicating a brief consolidation before a breakout. According to Thomas N. Bulkowski, who Martinez also highlighted in his analysis, the cup-and-handle ranks as the third most effective bullish pattern, with a 61% likelihood of achieving its projected target. Considering the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies, the odds this pattern presents is quite notable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $215 and is up by 3% and 16% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This price increase comes alongside a surge in activity, with Solana witnessing a 16% trading volume increase in the past 24 hours. If Solana were to reach $4,000, it would translate to a return of about 1,800% from the current price.

This AI altcoin is projected to gain 30,000%, a jaw-breaking surge that will change the story for many crypto investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Outpace The Dogecoin Price Surge With 30,000% Returns The Dogecoin price has seen fair ups in 2024. Compared to its 2023 price, the Dogecoin price saw a general increase of over 250%. However, experts predict that the Dogecoin price will do far better in 2025, rising from its current price of $0.31 to a massive $5. These predictions are partly based on the Dogecoin price history of hitting a surge at the end of every cycle. The Dogecoin price saw massive increases in 2017 and 2021, and now, another cycle will end in 2025. Driven by these past trends and the anticipated bullish crypto market, experts say the Dogecoin price could hit $5 next year. However, this is not the biggest surge to expect in the crypto market. Analysts speak of a cheap AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), that will do better than the Dogecoin price. This AI altcoin is currently priced at $0.0420 only, but experts predict a 30,000% rally next year. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents groundbreaking opportunities, such as allowing investors to trade over 1500 cryptocurrencies directly on the platform. Such impressive features have generated rapid adoption of the AI altcoin, as is evident from the presale results.

The current stage launched recently, yet close to 300,000 tokens have been bought, generating over $11,000. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has a definite supply of 1 billion tokens, which is well allocated to support a 30,000% rally. Experts predict that this AI altcoin will take over the $700 billion crypto wallet and AI market, effortlessly generating $5 million in monthly revenue. Therefore, investors should not sleep on this opportunity. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is offering gains that will exceed the Dogecoin price and other major players.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin’s rally nears $100k, the crypto market turns bullish, making now the perfect time to explore top altcoins like XRP, DOGE, SUI, and rising stars like Rollblock (RBLK). Bitcoin is on its way back up to $100k again, and the crypto market is turning bullish in response. Traditionally, where Bitcoin leads, altcoins follow, but what are the best altcoins to buy now? In this article, we’ll look at four different alts, from legacy crypto XRP to meme coin DOGE and see how they will perform as older altcoins. We’ll also take a look at newer cryptos, such as Rollblock (RBLK) , whose presale has caught the attention of the crypto market at large. Looking at the SUI price, it could be that this relatively new crypto is enjoying its first bull market, too. Read on to examine the potential of these four altcoins. As the 2025 Bull market gathers pace, is Rollblock one of the altcoins to buy now? With the 2025 bull market starting up, savvy investors are seeking the best altcoins to buy now, and Rollblock’s successful and ongoing presale has captured their attention. This GambleFi platform combines cutting-edge features like Revenue Sharing and deflationary tokenomics, with everything you’d expect from an online gambling platform. Its presale has already raised $8 million, and with the token price soaring over 340%, it signals confidence in Rollblock’s potential to tap into the $500 billion online gambling industry. Investors aren’t merely attracted to price speculation but to the real-world utility of its token. RBLK token holders benefit from passive income through revenue sharing, and with a 30% APY for staking, it’s using the best of DeFi to attract long term investment. DOGE corrects heavy after Q4 exponential rise DOGE has faced a significant correction after its impressive Q4 rally. Despite this pullback of the DOGE price, the broader crypto bull market is gaining momentum, which is where meme coins like DOGE often thrive. As the expected 2025 bull market gains pace, DOGE could emerge as one of the best altcoins to buy now. SUI price reaches ATH before slight correction SUI recently reached a new all-time high (ATH), and although a slight correction followed, the SUI price remains robust as sentiment among crypto investors grows bullish. SUI’s performance indicates a solid foundation, and analysts speculate the SUI price could continue its upward trajectory in 2025, especially given that it is SUI‘s first cycle. Up 5X in November, what is next for XRP? XRP surged an impressive 5x in November after strong links with the Trump administration. With the bull market of 2025 approaching, and of course, Trump taking office this month, analysts believe XRP could reach a new ATH, which would only be a 50% increase in the XRP price. Of course, nothing is clear from Trump, even though he seems to be pro crypto, XRP’s strong performance suggests that of all the legacy cryptos, it’s one of the best altcoins to buy now. So what are the best altcoins to buy now? With a new pro-crypto US government, this year is expected to be extremely bullish, so which altcoins to buy now? XRP ran wildly in November and looks well positioned with the government. The SUI price also looks primed to take off, and you should never write off DOGE in a bull market. But it’s the newest cryptos that bring in the biggest gains, and if Rollblock’s presale success is a signal, then 2025 could belong to RBLK.

This marks a significant expansion beyond cryptocurrency. This new feature lets crypto exchange users buy, sell, and transfer stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) via the Crypto.com App. Zero-commission Trades and Bonus Offering These services are now available to users in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Washington, and Arizona. Soon, the exchange plans to roll out these services nationwide. For now, the selected US users are entitled to zero-commission trades and a 3% bonus when they utilize the Crypto.com App for securities transfers. Noteworthy, the 3% bonus, which will only last for a while, is to promote the new service. After the promotional period, the bonus could be reduced or eliminated. Crypto.com users in the regions mentioned above can also gain access to fractional shares, further providing investors flexibility. The exchange is keen on integrating the Traditional Finance (TradFi) ecosystem and the crypto sector. Crypto.com introduced a few other services besides these new stock and ETF trading options in the last few months. Before the Christmas holiday, it introduced a pioneering sports prediction trading platform for US customers. Users are presented with simple yes/no decisions on sports events with potential $100 rewards per correct prediction. This new product focuses on enabling users to predict the outcome of a sports event, including basketball and the Super Bowl. Recall that Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League in August. Unlike the latest milestone available to only a few US states, the sports events trading is designed to be accessible to all states in America. Crypto.com’s launch of this service also redirected new utilities to Cronos (CRO), a Layer-1 project focused on democratizing smart contracts. Crypto.com Withdraws Lawsuit Against SEC In October, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over claims that some of its business dealings are investment contracts. In the exchange’s opinion, the SEC has adopted a regulation-by-enforcement campaign instead of providing clear regulatory guidelines. Shortly after a meeting between Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek and President-elect Donald Trump, the company suddenly decided to drop the suit . The incoming dispensation in the US is planning to implement crypto-friendly policies, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve.

38543769,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=637766,1736029563,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38543769.jpeg,Polymarket: 40% Chance Trump Creates U.S. Bitcoin Reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-40-chance-trump-creates-u-s/,"A recent Polymarket poll shows 40% believe President-elect Trump might create a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, stirring debates on its role in national finances. With nearly 200,000 Bitcoins already held by the government, this move could boost the U.S.’s position in the global crypto market. The concept of a Bitcoin reserve in the United States has pulled the discussion out of the cryptocurrency community and into wider circles, mainly fueled by the latest news and speculation. Polymarket Poll of U.S. Bitcoin Reserve A recent Polymarket poll discovered that 40% of respondents believed President-elect Donald Trump is going to create a national Bitcoin reserve-that alone may be the impetus for a change in the United States toward digital assets. Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market. There, users can make guesses about real-world events by buying and selling shares. Current odds on the platform indicate that many people think the Trump administration might back Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This guess is consistent with what Trump said about Bitcoin before and also has support in a positive attitude towards crypto within his administration. Proponents claim that the U.S. can gain a stronger position in the global cryptocurrency market and increase its financial plans by holding onto Bitcoin as a reserve asset. U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump Right now, the U.S. government has nearly 200,000 Bitcoins, worth billions, taken from various legal cases. Industry experts, like Alistair Milne from Altana Digital Currency Fund, suggest that even if Trump does not add more Bitcoin, he could create a “de facto” reserve just by not selling these assets. If the government keeps these Bitcoins, it will influence how much Bitcoin is available and help make its price more stable. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently proposed a bill that enables the government to purchase one million Bitcoins within five years. According to her, the reserve may help in paying off the country’s $36 trillion debt and making the U.S. dollar stronger. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve brings along very massive challenges. Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, had rejected this proposal and said the current law prohibits the Federal Reserve from owning Bitcoins. Such decisions should be taken by Congress, which would not agree with it because of the risks involved in price fluctuations and security with Bitcoins. For all the risks taken on by taxpayers, critics say there are far too many of them to entrust Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Sure, Bitcoin has spiked in value this year, but its recent history of big price changes leaves much to be desired when it comes to how dependable it may be as a long-term reserve. To top it all off, hackers will certainly break into government-issued crypto wallets. This concept of a bitcoin reserve is not something coming from America only. Bhutan and El Salvador have already placed Bitcoin in their national financial plans but on a much smaller scale. Precisely for this reason, since the U.S. holds a lot of Bitcoin and is economically very powerful, it can set a trend which other countries may adopt later on. There are many cryptocurrency supporters in Trump’s administration, which may help to create a Bitcoin reserve. This will be a huge step for Bitcoin if the plan goes through to become more of a financial tool. According to the Polymarket poll, more people are interested in knowing how digital assets influence national money policies. It is still unclear whether the U.S. accepts a Bitcoin reserve, but the discussions point out that if kept and grown by the U.S., Bitcoin is becoming very important. If Trump keeps and grows the U.S.’ Bitcoin reserves, then the cryptocurrency could be facing drastic change in status and purpose globally.

It’s got the highs, the lows, and everything in between. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned over the years, it’s this: the best opportunities often come during chaotic times. Remember the 1973 economic collapse? The markets were in tatters, but the smart folks who bought the dips back then? They set themselves up for life. Fast forward to today, meme coins are rewriting the playbook. Among the top contenders, BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its killer presale performance, a thriving community, and real utility. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Apu Apustaja are the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. Meme coins have exploded in popularity, starting with Dogecoin and branching into innovative projects that combine fun, utility, and massive ROI potential. But BTFD Coin is set to outshine them all. With its P2E game, referral program, BIG50 bonus, staking rewards and a community-powered roadmap, it’s got everything to redefine what meme coins can achieve. Let’s compare it to Neiro and Apu Apustaja to see why it’s stealing the spotlight. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin That Means Business Let’s kick things off with BTFD Coin. It’s not just another meme coin riding the wave—it’s creating its own tidal surge. The presale has been nothing short of epic, raking in over $4.9 million within its first month. Starting at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 13 at $0.000142. That’s a jaw-dropping ROI for early investors. And when the presale wraps up, BTFD will hit the market at $0.0006. Think about it—investors who got in early are looking at insane gains. Here’s how it works: you can snag BTFD Coins at a 50% bonus using the BIG50 bonus code. It’s easy as pie. Head to the presale page, connect your wallet, apply the BIG50 code, and you’re golden. But it’s not just the numbers. BTFD Coin is building a decentralised ecosystem with staking rewards , a play-to-earn game that’s got gamers hyped, and a referral program to sweeten the pot. And let’s not forget the community power. With over 7,600 holders and counting, it’s clear this project isn’t going anywhere but up. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in this weekend , this is it. Neiro: The AI-Driven Meme Coin Next up, we’ve got Neiro. While BTFD Coin rides on community and utility, Neiro brings artificial intelligence to the meme coin space. It’s positioning itself as a tech-heavy contender, claiming to use AI algorithms to predict market trends and optimise investment strategies for its holders. Sounds fancy, right? But does it hold water? Neiro’s presale numbers are decent, but they pale in comparison to BTFD Coin’s meteoric rise. The project’s AI angle is intriguing, but it’s also untested. How much of it is buzz versus real tech? That’s the million-dollar question. Investors are cautious, and rightly so. AI-driven tools are only as good as the data they’re fed. If the algorithms can’t handle the volatile nature of meme coins, it could be a recipe for disaster. Still, Neiro has its fans. The project’s presale has seen a steady influx of investors, and its focus on tech sets it apart in the meme coin world. But it lacks the same grassroots enthusiasm that’s propelling BTFD Coin. Without a strong community, it risks becoming just another tech-heavy project that fails to connect with the average investor. For Gen Z and Millennials in Australasia, who crave relatability and engagement, Neiro might feel a bit too corporate. If you’re looking for innovation, Neiro could be worth a punt. But if you want the full package—utility, community, and ROI—BTFD Coin is still the better bet. After all, AI can’t buy loyalty, and in the world of meme coins, loyalty is everything. Apu Apustaja: The Meme That Keeps on Giving Last but not least, let’s talk about Apu Apustaja. This meme coin takes its name from the infamous internet frog meme, blending nostalgia with humour to create a unique brand identity. If you’ve been around the internet for a while, you’ve probably encountered Apu’s sad-but-endearing face. But does nostalgia translate into a viable investment? Apu Apustaja relies heavily on its meme appeal. The project is big on community-driven initiatives, and its Discord and Reddit groups are buzzing. However, it lacks the utility that BTFD Coin brings to the table. There’s no play-to-earn game, no staking rewards, and no referral program. It’s fun, sure, but is it functional? That’s where it falls short. Financially, Apu Apustaja’s presale is moving along, but it’s not breaking records. Investors are drawn to the meme, but the project’s roadmap is vague, and there’s little to suggest it has the staying power of BTFD Coin. When the hype dies down, what’s left? Not much. That said, Apu Apustaja is undeniably entertaining. If you’re looking for a laugh and a small punt, it could be worth a look. But for serious investors aiming to maximise their returns, BTFD Coin remains the king of the hill. It’s got the numbers, the utility, and the community to back it up. And let’s be real—in crypto, those are the only metrics that matter. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to get in on the action? Here’s how you can join the BTFD Coin presale and secure your bonused price: Go to the presale page at BTFD.io . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or similar). Enter the bonus code BIG50 in the designated field and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to purchase and review the price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. It’s as simple as that. With the BIG50 bonus code, you’re not just buying coins—you’re buying into a community-driven revolution. Conclusion: Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the ultimate choice for investors this weekend. While Neiro offers innovation and Apu Apustaja brings meme nostalgia, neither can match the utility, community power, and ROI potential of BTFD Coin . With over $4.9 million raised and 62 billion coins sold, it’s clear that this project has captured the imagination of the crypto world. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing presale. Visit presale website today , use the BIG50 bonus code, and secure your 50% bonus coins.

That’s exactly what Altura ($ALU) represents. Just as ChatGPT transformed how we interact with AI in daily life, Altura is set to redefine gaming by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain. With its cutting-edge tech and potential to change the gaming landscape, $ALU could be on the brink of a meteoric rise to $1. Here’s why Altura is attracting so much attention and why it could be your next big opportunity. What is Altura ($ALU)? Altura is like a ""ChatGPT for gaming"" because it brings smart, adaptive technology to the forefront. It’s a blockchain-based platform that enables game developers to create, distribute, and trade smart NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Unlike regular NFTs, smart NFTs can evolve based on game progress or specific conditions, making them ideal for video games. Imagine a virtual sword that becomes more powerful as your character levels up—that’s the kind of innovation Altura is bringing to gaming.The $ALU token powers this ecosystem, facilitating transactions, governance, and staking. Altura’s mission is to seamlessly blend blockchain technology with gaming, offering developers and players tools that revolutionize their experience. Why Altura is Bullish There are several compelling reasons why Altura has massive growth potential: 1. AI Integration Altura leverages artificial intelligence to create smarter, more dynamic in-game assets. This integration allows for more immersive and engaging gameplay. As AI continues to advance and become more integral to gaming, Altura’s capabilities will likely drive significant demand for the $ALU token. 2. Low Market Cap Currently, Altura has a relatively small market cap compared to other blockchain and gaming projects. This gives it substantial room for growth. Low-cap projects often experience higher returns when they gain traction, making Altura a high-potential investment. 3. Not Listed on Major Exchanges Yet Altura’s potential is further amplified by the fact that it’s not yet listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. These platforms boast a combined user base of over 300 million. Once $ALU gets listed, the increased visibility and trading accessibility could result in a significant price surge. Price Predictions for Altura Here are the key price targets for Altura based on market performance and project growth: - Base Target: With a market cap of $1.5 billion, Altura could reach approximately $1.52 per ALU. This is the lowest expected target and could be achieved even in a challenging market environment, thanks to Altura’s strong foundation and ongoing innovation. - Bullish Target: A $3 billion market cap would push $ALU to around $3.03 per token. This target is realistic given the growing excitement around AI, gaming, and blockchain, as well as favorable market conditions. Altura’s position in these thriving sectors makes it well-suited to achieve this milestone, especially during an altcoin rally. - Ultimate Ambition Target: During a cryptocurrency super cycle, Altura could hit a market cap of $5 billion to $10 billion, translating to $5.05 to $10.10 per $ALU. This would likely coincide with a broader market boom, where Bitcoin exceeds $240,000 and Ethereum surpasses $15,000. Altura’s innovative role in the AI and gaming sectors could drive unprecedented growth in such conditions. Final Thoughts Altura’s combination of AI-powered smart NFTs, a low market cap, and the potential for major exchange listings positions it as a promising project. While all investments carry risks, $ALU has the hallmarks of a game-changing opportunity in the gaming and blockchain space. If you’re looking for a high-potential project, Altura could be your next big move in crypto. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

In a press release, the DOJ says that throughout the course of a decade, it has disbursed more than $4.3 billion to 40,930 victims of a fraud scheme led by Bernard L. Madoff. Madoff is known for running a Ponzi scheme for about 17 years that defrauded investors from 127 countries out of approximately $65 billion. The perpetrator convinced people to invest in his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, by promising decent returns while maintaining a trustworthy persona. The scheme collapsed at the height of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) when investors panicked and withdrew their funds en masse only to find out that their money was being used to pay other investors. In June 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for “running the largest fraudulent scheme in history.” He died in a prison hospital in April of 2021 at 82 years old. The DOJ says it recovered about $2.6 billion through several civil forfeiture actions against Madoff, his brother Peter B. Madoff, his co-conspirators and his clients who benefitted from the scheme including investors Carl Shapiro and Jeffry Picower. The agency also collected $1.7 billion after banking titan JPMorgan Chase settled accusations that the firm failed “to carry out its legal obligations” while serving as Madoff’s primary bank. Says Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York, “This office has never stopped at pursuing justice for victims of history’s largest Ponzi scheme… We have succeeded in compensating 40,930 victims with close to 94% of their losses. As this extraordinary effort demonstrates, this office and MLARS (Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section) are committed to protecting and assisting victims of crime, no matter how long it takes and no matter how complicated the endeavor.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Investors and market participants are preparing for the biggest period of growth and innovation yet. This excitement is fueled by changes in leadership and possibly a favorable regulatory framework on the horizon. This expected new shift in the U.S. has sparked fresh interest among crypto community members. Ripple CEO’s Vision for the Crypto In 2025 In a recent X post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse captured the moment, saying, “The journey is just beginning.” His post comes as the crypto industry celebrates major wins. Garlinghouse’s optimism reflects an industry eager for change, especially with the expected exit of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Also, the arrival of expert leaders in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and crypto sectors is fueling the excitement. These shifts suggest a more favorable regulatory environment that could bring the clarity the crypto world seeks. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which focused on whether its native token XRP is a security, has highlighted the need for clear digital asset regulations. Due to a tough regulatory framework, many crypto leaders have accused the agency of stifling innovations and growth. As the case continues, many hope the SEC’s new leadership will resolve the issue in a way that supports innovation. With Gensler’s departure, there is hope for a new approach at the SEC. A favorable outcome for Ripple could set a positive example for future regulation, helping businesses and investors. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer recently outlined six key guidelines for the SEC , urging clearer regulation of digital assets. These recommendations are part of Ripple’s ongoing effort to address the regulatory uncertainties around crypto. For Ripple, a win would solidify its crypto space leadership and encourage wider XRP adoption. The Pro-Crypto Congress and Market Momentum The arrival of the 119th Congress has been celebrated across the crypto ecosystem. This legislative body, described as the most crypto-friendly in history, represents a pivotal shift. Lawmakers with a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and digital assets will likely support policies encouraging growth and innovation. The impact of this change is already showing in market trends. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading crypto asset, has surged past $98,000, marking a strong start to the year. XRP has also seen a 15% increase since January 1. These price movements highlight the growing confidence in the market as investors expect new rules that could lead to more growth. A Call to Action for the Crypto Community Garlinghouse’s final words in his post, “Let’s get to work,” resonate as a call to action. The crypto industry is on the edge of a new era focused on teamwork, innovation, and opportunity. With a supportive Congress and clearer rules ahead, the stage is set for major progress.

With the crypto market moving in a new direction, investors have expressed confidence in predictions on the future prices of these cryptocurrencies. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Promising Contender In The Crypto-AI Market With Strong Growth Potential Prominent crypto analysts have predicted that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will touch $5 in the coming weeks due to its fast-growing presale and rapid growth potential. WalllitIQ (WLTQ) has gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts through its AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that promote financial literacy and decentralization. As a decentralized crypto wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) empowers users to have complete control over their digital assets. Confident in the platform’s potential, investors are positioning themselves for substantial returns, driven by the growing demand for its efficient and secure crypto wallet solutions. With its integration into the booming billion-dollar crypto-AI market, many analysts predict that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will reach $5 before Dogecoin and Shiba Inu achieve new all-time highs. Investors are flocking to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale in order to secure their positions in its projected $10 million revenue. In addition, early investors are entitled to several benefits, including governance participation, premium features, and early gains of up to 200% due to token price appreciation in the following presale stage. WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides its users with 24/7 access to blockchain-based activities such as yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that yield rewards of up to 180% annually.

Recently, the Dogecoin price reached a new high on the weekly chart, breaking through a critical resistance level at $0.32. This breakout serves as a strong technical indicator of sustained bullish momentum, suggesting further price gains may be on the horizon. A popular trader known as Trader Tardigrade declared on X (formerly Twitter) that the Dogecoin price had completed its final retest of the critical support level at $0.31. The analyst presented a chart predicting the Dogecoin price trajectory based on recurrent historical trends. Shiba Inu Projected Price Surge Amidst Market Volatility Although the Shiba Inu price has experienced volatility during this year, crypto analysts are projecting that the Shiba Inu price will touch $0.006 in the coming weeks. In the beginning of 2024, the Shiba Inu price was trading at approximately $0.000008. By December 30, 2024, the Shiba Inu price had risen to around $0.00002112, reflecting a substantial increase over the year. The above upward movement can be attributed to factors such as increased adoption, technological advancements, and broader market trends. However, SHIB’s price has shown both gains and corrections. As of the time of this writing, Shiba Inu is trading at a price of $0.00002112. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is still in its presale stage, offering investors a gateway to generational wealth with its native token (WLTQ) selling for a low price of $0.0420 .

Meanwhile, XRP has displayed considerable potential following an excellent year in 2024. With successes in regulatory areas and predictions of high prices, its community is looking forward to what 2025 will bring. On the other hand, Cardano is making a recovery, with experts suggesting it is ready for another upward trend after recent declines in price. Find out why these cryptos are the ones to watch in the coming year. Web3Bay Leads Decentralized E-Commerce Evolution Web3Bay is at the forefront of changing e-commerce by creating a transparent and decentralized market. This platform allows buyers and sellers to interact directly, which lowers fees and gives them complete control over their funds and personal data. Its versatile payment system accepts both cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods like PayPal, broadening its appeal to crypto enthusiasts and regular consumers alike. For merchants, particularly in areas with limited access to banks, Web3Bay provides an entry into worldwide markets without the need for traditional financial services. Now in presale stage 2 priced at $0.00345, Web3Bay has amassed over $280,000, selling upwards of 77 million 3BAY coins. Planned across 28 stages with a price increase of 15% per stage, it offers a projected ROI exceeding 6000%. This platform’s combination of secure smart contracts and low transaction fees is set to revolutionize online shopping. XRP Surges with Regulatory Approvals XRP closed 2024 on a strong note, breaking past $2, marking a 370% increase over the year. Projections for 2025 suggest it could reach as high as $6.4, $13, or even $27, propelled by positive market trends and clear regulatory standings. The XRP community has reasons to be hopeful, especially after Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD was endorsed by the New York Department of Financial Services. This endorsement cements Ripple’s role in central bank digital currencies and enhances its payment system, positioning XRP for broader acceptance. However, some analysts, like pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton, express uncertainty about XRP’s future prices, stating, “I have no idea.” Yet, the possibility for growth is substantial. Cardano (ADA) Price Trends Signal Upcoming Rally Cardano has experienced volatile price movements, including a 40% decline after a 300% surge from its lows in November. Analysts such as Michaël van de Poppe believe this correction might soon conclude, setting the stage for new gains. This recent downturn is seen as a normal market adjustment, hinting at potential long-term upward trends. ADA’s entry into a new price range between $0.96 and $1.25 suggests room for growth, with targets between $2.50 and $3.00 under the right conditions. While many are hopeful about ADA’s prospects in 2025, it’s wise to stay cautious, balancing optimistic forecasts with potential challenges. Top Crypto Projects to Consider in 2025 As we enter another significant year in crypto, Web3Bay, XRP, and Cardano are distinguished by their potential to transform their respective areas. Web3Bay’s innovative marketplace could redefine global commerce, XRP looks to brighter prospects with regulatory advancements, and Cardano’s pricing dynamics suggest a strong rebound. These projects provide diverse opportunities, from facilitating global trade to ensuring secure payments and creating decentralized environments. Strategic timing and thoughtful planning are essential—make sure you’re ready to capitalize on the next major wave in crypto .

While Dogecoin retains its place as a popular meme coin, the trader’s endorsement of PropiChain stems from its robust utility, AI-driven features, and potential to disrupt the $300 trillion real estate market. With forecasts predicting a massive 53,039% rally, this altcoin is quickly becoming the focal point for investors looking for exponential returns in the coming bull market. Dogecoin: A Veteran Meme Coin Dogecoin has remained a favorite in the crypto space since its inception in 2013. It gained traction because of its loyal community and endorsements from influencers Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed during the 2021 bull run, offering life-changing returns to early adopters. However, the coin’s speculative nature and limited utility have raised concerns about its long-term sustainability. While the Dogecoin price may rally during the next market upswing, analysts believe PropiChain offers far greater upside for serious investors. What Makes PropiChain the AI Altcoin to Watch? PropiChain is a project that combines blockchain, AI, and real estate tokenization to solve age-old problems in the property investment market. The real estate market is filled with challenges, including high capital barriers, lack of transparency, and inefficiency. PropiChain addresses these issues through: Fractional Ownership : Investors can buy tokens representing fractional shares of high-value properties, making real estate accessible to anyone. AI Integration : Advanced AI tools provide data-driven insights, automated property valuations, and tailored investment recommendations. Metaverse Integration : PropiChain uses virtual reality to offer immersive property tours and facilitate global investor networking. These features position PropiChain as a practical and profitable investment, unlike speculative coins like Dogecoin. PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap and its BlockAudit security review further enhance its credibility, reassuring investors about the project’s legitimacy. The Power of AI in PropiChain What sets PropiChain apart from other altcoins is its cutting-edge AI integration. Data-Driven Decisions : The platform’s AI tools analyze market trends, identify high-growth areas, and offer real-time property valuations. Risk Mitigation : By using predictive analytics, investors can minimize risks and maximize returns. Streamlined Investment Process : Automated filtering and valuation tools simplify the process, making property investments faster and more accessible. For example, an investor using PropiChain’s AI tools could identify an undervalued property in a high-growth market and gain significant returns without the need for extensive research. Presale Stage: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. The price will increase to $0.023 in Stage 3, making now the ideal time to invest. Investing in the presale offers the chance to acquire tokens at a steep discount before they hit major exchanges. With projections of a 53,039% rally, even a modest investment could yield life-changing returns. Practically, a $500 investment during the presale could grow to over $265,000 if the forecastforecast is true. The Future of PropiChain The roadmap for PropiChain includes partnerships with global real estate firms, further development of its AI and metaverse features, and eventual expansion into other asset classes like art and collectibles. This forward-thinking approach positions PropiChain as a long-term player in the cryptocurrency space, with the potential to outshine established projects like Dogecoin. Conclusion While Dogecoin may see another rally in the coming years, PropiChain’s utility-driven model offers unmatched growth potential. Backed by AI innovation and the booming real estate market, PropiChain is set to redefine property investments and deliver exponential returns to its investors. With its presale price at just $0.011, now’s the best time to invest in PropiChain. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to turn a modest investment into life-changing wealth. Secure your tokens today and be part of a revolution in real estate investments.

Users on the Polygon-based platform have been betting on the projects launching their airdrops in Q1 2025 since the beginning of the year. The platform requires users to bid yes or no, depending on their choice of vote. The platform also ascertains the level of votes on a project, tilting the average odds towards the preferred options. Polymarket shot to fame during the United States election, where it predicted President-elect Donald Trump as the eventual winner even before the announcement was made. The platform currently has a list of projects that may likely launch in the first quarter of 2025, with users allowed to choose the side they want to bet on. Aside from Berachain and Linea airdrops, the platform has provided users with options to bet on Jumper, Pump.fun, and Aleo airdrops among others. Polymarket odds for Berachain airdrop rise Berachain has risen to prominence in the crypto industry, becoming one of the fastest-growing projects. It has also received significant funding, raising $43 million in 2023, before raising $69 million in a funding round in March 2024. According to sources familiar with the matter, the funding round was led by Brevan Howard Digital and Framework Ventures, pushing its value above $1 billion. Berachain is a layer-1 network, housing a handful of DeFi-related applications in its ecosystem. Its native exchange BEX is also looking to rival Uniswap, allowing users to swap tokens, while its lending protocol BEND, allows users to borrow and lend tokens, just like Aave. According to on-chain data , Berachain has handled more than 500 million transactions since inception, with about 57 million taking place in the last 14 days. Berachain has also witnessed a surge in active addresses on its platform, rising from 945,000 on Dec 15 to about 3 million presently. The odds of Berachain launching an airdrop, according to Polymarket is at 90%, a figure up by 40% since the market was created. Users can bet on the ‘Yes’ option at $0.89, with the ‘No’ option currently at $0.10. The total volume of bets on the market is presently at $64,471. Linea ecosystem witness growth ahead of its airdrop Linea, on the other hand, is a layer-2 network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to supercharge the Ethereum network. It provides tough competition to other layer-2 rivals like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. According to on-chain data , Linea has handled about 241 million transactions, with around 241,000 coming in the last 14 days. Linea has a total value locked ( TVL ) of $383 million, with popular players like Mendi, ZeroLend, and Lynex in its ecosystem. Linea’s popularity can be attributed to its establishment by the popular crypto firm Consensys. Consensys raised about $450 million via firms like Softbank, ParaFi, and Third Point. The Linea airdrop will be monitored by its foundation, an organization that was created in November 2024. According to Polymarket, the odds of Berachain launching an airdrop in the first quarter of 2025 is around 88%, up 38% since the market was created. Users can bet on the ‘Yes’ option at $0.90, while they can also bet on the ‘No’ option at $0.13. The total volume of bets on the market is presently around $16,561. Notably, the increase in odds does not necessarily mean the projects will launch the airdrops in the first quarter of 2025. It means that users have seen signs that have pointed to these projects launching the airdrop, seeing that it is the bettors that shift the momentum with their picks. Meanwhile, other projects like Wormhole, Hamster Kombat, LayerZero, and Eigenlayer have launched their airdrops with mixed success. Eigenlayer, for example, has dropped 30% from its listing figure, while Wormhole dropped a disappointing 82%.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 23:03:00

This market recovery has gained massive attention from crypto enthusiasts, resulting in significant accumulation of ADA tokens. ADA Whales Accumulate 40M Tokens Recently, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that whales have accumulated over 40 million ADA tokens from exchanges in the past 48 hours. This substantial accumulation indicates that whales began accumulating after the altcoin breached the trendline and broke out from a consolidation zone on the daily timeframe. Whales bought over 40 million #Cardano $ADA in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/YMc1dxQzjd — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 The expert’s report reveals how whales are accumulating ADA and highlights an ideal buying opportunity for retail investors. It has also been observed that the asset witnessed an impressive 16% upside momentum following this purchase. Why ADA Appears Struggling? The notable upside momentum, coupled with current rumors about a healthcare crisis in China, might be the reason behind today’s price decline and ongoing correction. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $1.07 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.1% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has also been impacted, registering a drop of over 50%. This indicates lower participation and further reflects fear among traders and investors. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Despite all this activity at the international level, ADA appears bullish and poised to continue its upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, the altcoin has already surged by an impressive 32% in the past three days and currently seems to be correcting itself for further gains. Source: Trading View ADA Price Prediction However, there is also a possibility that the market may extend ADA’s price correction for a few more days. Despite this, if the altcoin holds above the $1 mark, there is a strong chance it could soar by 25% to reach the $1.32 level in the coming days.

These incidents show the urgent need for better security, stricter rules, and more trust in digital assets. 2024 was a year for cryptocurrency, big security issues and scam projects have shown that the system needs improvement. According to SlowMist Hacked, there have been 410 security incidents reported in 2024, where huge losses account for $2.013 billion. According to SlowMist report , 2024’s losses, however, stand at 19.02% lower than in 2023, where a total of 464 incidents took place and left a loss of $2.486 billion. Major Security attack incidents of 2024 DeFi was the most vulnerable area with 82.68% of breaches. There were 339 DeFi cases, which resulted in a huge loss of $1.029 billion. This is 33.12% more than the 2023 version, which was $773 million. It shows how attractive decentralized finance has become for hackers due to weak security and flaws in smart contracts. The greatest loss was seen for Ethereum with $465 million loss. Binance Smart Chain, or BSC, followed second with the loss of $87.35 million. On May 31, some of the worst hacks occurred at the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin. There, hackers deceived users into helping them steal 4,502.9 BTC from the exchange’s official wallet by causing about $330 million in losses. It is the seventh largest hack in the history of cryptocurrencies and the largest since 2022. According to the FBI, United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, and the Japanese National Police Agency, North Korean hackers did this as part of an attack that came to be known as the Trader Traitor campaign. Another big hack involved the Indian exchange WazirX. There, a problem in the checks on multisig wallets meant more than $230 million lost. In February, hackers stole the private key of the PLA token smart contract on the PlayDapp blockchain gaming platform. With this move, they managed to mint 1.79 billion tokens with the attacker’s permission. After negotiations and an offer of a $1 million reward for white-hat hackers, the attackers were still free to create more tokens. The exchanges froze the tokens so they could not be sold in large quantities. It was a phishing email posing as a legitimate request from a partnership exchange. Around the same time, Turkey’s BtcTurk lost $90 million when hackers gained unauthorized access to its hot wallets in June, and Binance froze $5.3 million in stolen assets. Some of the biggest incidents were that of Singapore-based exchange BingX, which had reportedly suffered loss through unauthorized access to almost $45 million in September. Another was Radiant Capital in October with an estimated loss of about $50 million. Hedgey Finance is also in the list, losing about $44.7 million, and it’s because of input validation issues. Penpie lost almost $27.35 million from malicious smart contracts and flash loan attacks in the liquidity rewards. For this reason, there has to be an improvement in the security aspect for platforms. Rug pulls are where rogue teams advertise projects for cash and run off with it. Major Rug Pulls In 2024, fifty-eight cases of rug pulls happened, leading to a loss of $106 million. The largest rug pull in the zkSync system was $36.95 million. The most rug pulls occurred in the BSC system, at 28 in total. The most popular one was SHARPEI. It used images of Shar Pei dogs and celebrities to drive its price to $54 million. It was sold after this for $3.4 million, with a loss of 96% for the token. The nature of such incidents calls for proper regulation and necessary security measures over the fast-growing industry of cryptocurrency. Some proposals are for compulsory auditing of smart contracts, tightening control over KYC and AML, and also the provision of insurance pools from which an account can be withdrawn in the case of breach. Another tendency has been noted where countries begin taking collective steps to combat cyber threats at international levels. The SEC will probably play a pretty big role in the Trump administration because it’s an advocate for cryptocurrencies. As Congress is largely controlled by Republicans, it would probably focus on clear rules encouraging new ideas but at the same time protecting investors. Although there are so many problems, it is also ready to build a safer and stronger system. With the help of cryptocurrency support from the Trump administration to make security better with clearer rules, it could enter a new time of creativity in trust in digital assets. It all depends on how regulators and developers work with the community to solve problems that may arise in 2025.

This upward momentum has captured the attention of traders and investors, with many eyeing the possibility of a breakout that could propel SUI to fresh highs. The rally showcases strong bullish sentiment, driven by increasing demand and favorable technical setups. A decisive move beyond $4.98 might signal the beginning of a larger trend, positioning the token for further gains and strengthening its presence in the cryptocurrency market. As the price consolidates near this pivotal level, the focus shifts to whether the bulls can maintain their grip and push SUI into uncharted territory. With momentum on their side, the stage is set for what could be a defining moment in SUI’s price action. Analyzing SUI Path To $4.98 Milestone SUI’s rapid climb toward the $4.98 resistance level has captured the attention of traders, sparking anticipation for a potential breakthrough. The cryptocurrency has been riding a wave of bullish strength, with increasing demand and positive sentiment pushing the price higher. As it nears this critical level, the focus shifts to whether SUI can sustain its upward trajectory and break through the $4.98 barrier.

A successful break above $4.98 may unlock significant upside potential, with the possibility of reaching new all-time highs. Technical indicators like rising volume and momentum oscillators suggest that the rally may have more room to run. However, the path to $4.98 is not without its hurdles. Resistance at this price point could trigger a pullback or consolidation, leading to a test of support levels before another attempt to break through. Potential Scenarios: Breakout Or Consolidation? As SUI approaches the pivotal $4.98 resistance level, a successful breakout above this point might open the door to substantial upside potential. Breaking through this key level may lead to new highs and signify that the bullish momentum is strong enough to drive the price higher.

On the other hand, a failure to break through this key level might result in a consolidation phase, where SUI moves within a defined range as traders reassess the market conditions. During consolidation, the price may pull back to test lower support levels like the $4 mark before making another upside attempt.

He hinted at the numerous upgrades planned out for the Cardano-based light wallet platform this year. The Potential Lace Wallet Upgrades In his X post, Hoskinson suggested that Lace would make a debut on multiple platforms. This is in addition to the other new and exciting features that the wallet would welcome. Only a few days ago, the Cardano Founder voiced his optimism on the possibility for Lace Wallet to become a “powerhouse” this year. This was around the time when the wallet announced that its migration of users from Nami to Lace, was in “full swing. ” Apart from Lace, the Cardano ecosystem is also working on enhancing other solutions within the ecosystem. In November, Hoskinson engaged Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz in a technical discussion around Midnight and XRP . As a privacy-focused blockchain project, Midnight is designed to enhance secure data handling while also maintaining regulatory compliance. Hoskinson is very positive about Midnight’s potential to drive the evolution of privacy-centric Decentralized Applications (dApps) and further blockchain development. Their discussion suggests that there may be an impending collaboration between Cardano and Ripple in the near future. In the case of Voltaire, the Chang Hard Fork upgrade, which ushers this decentralized governance era launched in September. This launch put Cardano’s future in the hands of the community to govern. Consequently, Hoskinson confirmed that his last duty for the ecosystem “is to remove any roadblock for this transition.” He promised to prevent any bottleneck that will derail the plans this year. The Cardano Bitcoin DeFi Plans In addition to the different solutions designed by developers in its ecosystem, Cardano has plans to explore Bitcoin DeFi . There is currently a growing clamor for utility around the flagship cryptocurrency and recent partnerships between Cardano and BitcoinOS to create a bridge for both ecosystems. So far, the Cardano team has been saddled with the responsibility of coming up with a meaningful Bitcoin roadmap demo by May 2025. To achieve its set goals, Charles Hoskinson stated that Cardano will collaborate with Fair Gate Labs, a Multi Party Computational protocol. Notably, Cardano price is up 3.4% in 24 hours to $1.07 as investors remain hyped by its upgrades and ecosystem plans.

In a recent analysis, Marks suggested that the token could exceed $20 during the ongoing bull market cycle, a projection that represents a substantial leap from his earlier forecast of $2.28. $DOGE (Dogecoin)'s bull cycle performances, looking over the previous two, have consecutively become larger, and prices look to be well in the process of delivering yet another monumental bull showcase! Another, larger run bull this cycle could result in a more than $20 DOGE. pic.twitter.com/uNruqmBIBt — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 28, 2024 Marks attributes his prediction to historical trends, noting that the token’s performance during previous bull markets has demonstrated significant growth. In the 2017 market rally, DOGE’s value increased by 90 times, followed by an even more remarkable 306-fold increase in 2021. Based on this historical data and applying the Fibonacci expansion tool, Marks anticipates that the current rally, which began in late 2024, could see the token breaking past the $20 threshold. Skepticism Surrounding the $20 Target While Marks’ forecast has gained attention within the crypto community, it has also faced considerable skepticism. Critics highlight that for DOGE to reach $20, the cryptocurrency must achieve a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, given its current circulating supply of 147.44 billion coins. This valuation would surpass the combined market caps of leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, raising doubts about the feasibility of such a target. The digital asset currently holds a market capitalization of $47.8 billion, a far cry from the $3 trillion required to support the $20 price point. Detractors argue that the projection may not account for the practical and market-driven limitations that could hinder such an exponential rise in value. Data-Driven Optimism from Marks Despite these challenges, Marks has defended his forecast, maintaining that the historical data strongly supports his claim. He emphasizes that the token’s price movements in past bull cycles consistently surpassed the 1.618 Fibonacci level, and he expects this pattern to continue. According to Marks, dismissing the $20 target ignores the clear trend of growth seen in previous rallies.

For investors, Marks’s analysis underscores the speculative nature of meme coins like DOGE, which can experience extreme price fluctuations driven by market sentiment and historical trends. While the $20 projection remains highly contested, it reflects the optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s potential as the crypto market grows.

This Low-Cap Altcoin Could Rise 18,000x",https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-price-to-fall-below-60k-in-january-this-low-cap-altcoin-could-rise-18000x/,"The Bitcoin price has dropped 1.94% in the last 24 hours, reaching an intraday low of $93,592. This marks a 2.27% decline over the past two weeks, with Bitcoin’s market cap now at $1.85 trillion. Analysts warn that Bitcoin price may slump below $60,000 by January 20, during Donald Trump’s inauguration. On-chain data shows over 33,000 BTC, worth $3.23 billion, moved to exchanges, signaling bearish sentiment. Amid this uncertainty, a rising low-cap altcoin is gaining attention for its potential 18,000x growth signaling high ROI. Failure to Hold $95k Could Trigger a Steeper Bitcoin Price Decline Experts warn that Bitcoin price could face a major correction if it fails to hold the critical $95,000 support level. Market commentator Tone Vays suggests a drop below $95,000 could lead to a sharp decline, potentially reaching $73,000. Veteran trader Peter Brandt raised concerns that Bitcoin price might break down from a “broadening triangle,” a bearish signal that could potentially push it to $70,000. Analysts like Mark Newton and Benjamin Cohen also forecast that Bitcoin price could fall below $60,000 in the short term. Emerging Low Cap Altcoin Offers 18,000x Upside Amid Bitcoin Price Volatility PropiChain’s token presale is approaching $2 million, as this altcoin draws attention from investors who are eyeing a potential 18,000x surge. The key to this altcoin’s rising popularity lies in its AI-powered tools, designed to make real estate investment accessible to all, regardless of financial standing. PropiChain’s AI analytics analyzes vast datasets, including market trends and price shifts, to predict future real estate trends. By identifying upcoming opportunities, such as suburban areas seeing a surge in demand due to planned infrastructure projects, the altcoin empowers investors to purchase properties before prices soar. Using the AI automated valuation models (AVMs), this altcoin ensures precise property valuations based on historical sales data, market conditions, and property characteristics. These advanced tools help investors avoid overpaying or missing valuable opportunities. Moreover, this altcoin offers AI property filtering, allowing users to search for real estate based on ROI potential, market growth, and neighbourhood trends instead of just price and location. This feature caters to each investor’s specific financial goals, whether they seek consistent rental income or long-term capital appreciation. PropiChain has demonstrated its commitment to security and transparency by successfully passing a BlockAudit security audit, building investor confidence in the project’s integrity. PropiChain is also listed on CoinMarketCap , increasing its credibility and visibility within cryptocurrency. In the face of Bitcoin price volatility, this altcoin’s innovative AI solutions offer a promising alternative for those seeking reliable and scalable real estate investment opportunities backed by blockchain technology. PropiChain Token Presale Soars to New Heights As the Bitcoin price faces bearish signals, PropiChain’s token presale is gaining significant traction. Phase one raised over $1.2 million, and phase two has already exceeded $400,000. Early investors have capitalized on phase one, locking in profits. Phase two continues, offering tokens at a bargain price of $0.011, one of the lowest rates you will ever find. The price is set to rise to $0.032 by the end of the presale. With a limited supply and high demand, this altcoin is quickly becoming a sought-after asset. A $2,000 investment today could turn into over $36 million in profits by the end of the presale based on the 18,000x surge. It could continue to grow once the token officially launches. Investors can also take advantage of rewards through referrals and giveaways. This is an opportunity to tap into the future of real estate and avoid FOMO as the new year begins.

Ethereum Classic Set for a Rise & Dogecoin Could Reach $5,https://thecoinrise.com/inter-milan-partnership-boost-blockdags-push-to-600m-goal-ethereum-classic-set-for-a-rise-dogecoin-could-reach-5/,"As Bitcoin’s price climbs, the cryptocurrency market becomes optimistic, stirring excitement. Among the hot topics is the Dogecoin price prediction, hinting at a possible peak nearing $5. Discussions around the Ethereum Classic price also suggest a potential 8.53% rise by the end of 2024. In this buoyant market atmosphere, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction as a leading contender for the top crypto coins of 2025. The project is in the spotlight with its ongoing collaboration with Inter Milan, its current mainnet audit, and the widespread popularity of its X1 app miner. Its active community and strategic progress are driving it towards an ambitious $600 million presale target. Dogecoin Price Prediction Hints Surge Toward $5 Dogecoin’s recent market activities have garnered considerable interest in the crypto community. Following a consolidation period from November to mid-December, DOGE is now experiencing price movements that historically precede a significant distribution phase, potentially elevating the Dogecoin price to a new all-time high (ATH). This current trend draws strong comparisons to DOGE’s 2021 bull run. Looking ahead, predictions for 2025 suggest a robust bull market, possibly ushering in an altseason. According to Dogecoin price prediction, DOGE might climb past the $1 mark, potentially reaching between $4.5 and $5, reinforcing its status among the top crypto coins. Ethereum Classic Price Insights Ethereum Classic has faced challenges recently, with a 9.83% drop in its price last month. Despite these difficulties, the coin’s medium- and long-term outlooks are positive. It has appreciated by 30.07% over the past three months and shows a year-over-year increase of 30.17%. With the current market sentiment being somewhat bearish, the coin has proven its resilience by achieving 13 green days in the last 30 days and demonstrating a monthly volatility of 10.35%. These metrics emphasize Ethereum Classic’s potential for momentum, even in challenging market conditions. Analysts believe that the Ethereum Classic price might increase by 8.53%, reaching $30.55 by the end of December. BlockDAG’s Progress Toward a $600M Milestone with Inter Milan and X1 App BlockDAG is rapidly advancing towards its impressive $600 million presale goal, having already raised over $175.5 million and distributed 17.6 billion coins. Its standout performance is supported by key strategies including a partnership with Inter Milan , the nearing completion of its mainnet audit, and the X1 Mobile Miner app, which now boasts over 300,000 users. These developments have not only enhanced BDAG’s appeal but also positioned it as one of the top crypto coins of 2025. The presale, now at its 26th batch, has seen an exceptional 2240% ROI for early participants, with prices rising from $0.001 in the first batch to $0.0234 currently. A significant boost for BDAG’s global recognition comes from its collaboration with the prestigious Inter Milan soccer club. This partnership focuses on enhancing fan engagement through exclusive content, digital collectibles, and blockchain-based transactions, broadening BDAG’s reach to include both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s mainnet audit is approaching completion, preparing the project to offer secure, efficient, and scalable solutions. The X1 Mobile Miner app , facilitating the mining of up to 20 BDAG coins daily with minimal user effort, contributes to the project’s momentum. As the community grows and unique features continue to roll out, BlockDAG is on a clear path to achieving its $600 million target. For newcomers, the 26th batch offers BDAG at $0.0234, with an upcoming price increase to $0.0248 in the next batch. The Bottom Line With the cryptocurrency market buoyed by a stronger Bitcoin, optimism is palpable. Central topics include the Dogecoin price prediction, suggesting a potential high of $5, and the anticipated 8.53% rise in the Ethereum Classic price by year-end 2024. However, BlockDAG is capturing the most attention as it nears its $600 million crypto presale target. Its association with Inter Milan has greatly enhanced its worldwide profile, while its mainnet, currently in the final audit stage, is set to transform blockchain technology. Additionally, the widespread success of its X1 Mobile Miner app underscores the project’s accelerating progress. Clearly, BDAG is not just another crypto project; it’s a burgeoning movement poised to redefine the blockchain industry.

While traditional assets maintain their place, the dynamic crypto sector offers remarkable new prospects. Here we explore three hidden gems every investor should consider: DTX Exchange (DTX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogecoin (DOGE). The tokens stand out for their potential to deliver strong returns in crypto trading and for the innovation and utility they offer. Whether you want fairness in new crypto launches, meme coin momentum, or sustained bullish trends, these tokens are worth your consideration. Which one will dominate the 2025 crypto trading market? DTX Exchange: Where Fairness Meets Innovation for Huge Growth in Crypto Trading Imagine a token launch where fairness is not just a buzzword – it is the foundation! DTX Exchange , a new crypto project, is breaking the model of traditional token launches and ownerships that favor Venture Capital whales. Instead, its fair launch mechanism ensures everyone is on equal footing. Whether you are an experienced trader or a new investor, you are offered the same chance to participate in the presale. With incremental pricing, early investors are rewarded while avoiding the challenges of dilution or massive sell-offs in crypto trading. However, DTX Exchange is more than a fair launch mechanism. It is a technological powerhouse. Offering smooth access to stocks, forex, ETFs, and over 100,000 currency pairs, it is your all-in-one trading platform.

With live products like the VulcanX Testnet and Phoenix Wallet, DTX has already raised $11.4 million and attracted 300,000 users.

Pudgy Penguins Rallies as DTX Exchange Brings Real Utility to the Market Pudgy Penguins’ token gained 12% on January 2, 2025, hitting $0.40 before settling at $0.37. The PENGU rally aligns with a general bullish trend among Solana meme coins as the market rebounds. Market experts say PENGU could rally further to its all-time high of $0.55, marking a possible 50% gain. The market trading volume increased by 60% to $1.39 billion, supporting bullish momentum. Furthermore, PENGU’s open interest surged 20% to $222 million. Technical indicators, including the Awesome Oscillator, also indicate a continued upward momentum. DTX Exchange stands out with its fair launch mechanism, empowering all investors equally while offering an advanced platform with 100,000 TPS, 1000x leverage, and a profit-sharing rebate program. Unlike PENGU’s meme coin rally, DTX provides real utility and community governance. PENGU was valued at $0.0365 on January 3, up 2.42% in the past week. Dogecoin Breaks Out 7.9%: DTX Exchange Delivers Real Value Beyond Speculation Dogecoin gained 7.9% on January 2, 2025, to trade at $0.342 after breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. This technical formation indicates potential bullish momentum. The breakout, accompanied by a high trading volume of $2.99 billion on the same day, suggested the resolution of accumulated market pressure. Analysts forecast that DOGE might target the crucial $0.10 resistance level, with a successful break paving the way for new local highs. The price action indicates there is a clear uptrend, dominated by higher highs, hinting at sustained bullish sentiment in the market. DTX Exchange offers fairness through its unique launch mechanism, providing equal opportunities for all investors. Unlike Dogecoin’s speculative rally, DTX delivers a cutting-edge platform with 100,000 TPS, 1000x leverage, and strong community governance, ensuring long-term growth and real value. DOGE was valued at $0.341 on January 3, up 8.26% in the past week. Explore New Crypto Opportunities: DTX Exchange Outpaces PENGU and DOGE As 2025 unfolds, DTX Exchange (DTX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogecoin (DOGE) offer exciting opportunities for investors seeking high potential in the crypto trading market. Whether it’s DTX’s fair launch model and innovative platform, PENGU’s meme coin momentum, or DOGE’s sustained bullish sentiment, these assets offer unique advantages. Exploring these hidden gems now could lead to significant rewards in the cryptocurrency space. Nonetheless, DTX Exchange is the best investment due to its massive growth potential. At just $0.14 during Stage 7 of the public presale, DTX tokens are a great opportunity, with a listing price set at $0.20, a 42.86% profit.

Stellar, valued at $0.43, has analysts predicting a surge to $1.29 by 2025, driven by its role in cross-border payments and blockchain efficiency. Meanwhile, Litecoin has crossed the $100 threshold, bolstered by its capped supply and faster transaction times. However, amidst these established players, Web3Bay is quietly reshaping the decentralized e-commerce sector. Its 3BAY token, currently in presale, offers users governance rights and discounts, carving a distinct niche and providing an intriguing alternative in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Stellar (XLM): Price Predictions for 2025 and 2030 Stellar (XLM), valued at around $0.43, shows potential for significant growth. Specifically, analysts forecast a rise to $0.72 by early 2025, marking a 68% increase. Furthermore, by the end of 2025, XLM could reach $1.29 if market conditions remain favorable. Meanwhile, projections for 2030 predict a peak price of $6.19, with an average hovering near $4.60. These estimates are informed by a combination of technical indicators, market sentiment, and Stellar’s expanding use cases in cross-border payments and blockchain technology. In terms of technical analysis, current data reveals a 50-day moving average of $0.38 and a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 58.22, suggesting bullish momentum. Moreover, Stellar’s ecosystem continues to attract attention due to its efficiency and scalability, supporting its long-term growth potential. However, while optimism surrounds these predictions, the speculative nature of cryptocurrency markets necessitates a cautious approach, as external factors and market volatility could significantly influence XLM’s trajectory. Litecoin Surpasses $100 as Crypto Markets Regain Momentum Litecoin (LTC) has surged past $100, reflecting renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency market. More specifically, trading at $101.96, the asset has gained 1.28% in the past 24 hours, with a significant 22.73% rise in trading volume to $465.51 million. Additionally, its market capitalization now stands at $7.68 billion, emphasizing its continued market relevance. Often called “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin has maintained a pivotal role due to its faster transaction times and capped supply of 84 million coins. Currently, 75.36 million LTC are in circulation, enhancing its scarcity and appeal. Furthermore, its consistent performance through market cycles underscores its resilience and reliability as an investment. On the technological front, advancements have strengthened Litecoin’s scalability and privacy features, furthering its adoption. As a result, this renewed momentum is drawing investor attention as the cryptocurrency market shows signs of recovery. Thus, Litecoin’s consistent liquidity and robust performance highlight its enduring presence in the evolving digital asset ecosystem. Web3Bay Presale: Token Utility, Future Expansion, and Benefits for Early Adopters The Web3Bay presale introduces the 3BAY token, designed to redefine decentralized e-commerce. Notably, holding 3BAY tokens provides users with exclusive benefits, including transaction discounts, platform perks, and governance rights. Furthermore, token holders gain a voice in crucial decisions about the platform’s future, ensuring a community-driven ecosystem. Consequently, these utilities enhance user engagement and incentivize long-term participation, making 3BAY a unique asset in the crypto space. Looking ahead, Web3Bay’s ambitious roadmap promises transformative features aimed at reshaping online commerce. Specifically, future integrations include an NFT marketplace, enabling users to trade digital assets seamlessly. Additionally, plans for decentralized finance (DeFi) options will introduce staking and yield farming, providing additional earning opportunities. Moreover, Web3Bay aims to achieve cross-chain interoperability, connecting with major blockchain networks to ensure seamless transactions and scalability. Collectively, these innovations position Web3Bay as a forward-thinking project in the decentralized commerce domain. Currently, the presale is in stage 3, with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.0039675. Having raised over $300,000, the presale demonstrates strong investor confidence and interest in the platform’s potential. Furthermore, each subsequent stage includes a 15% price increase, offering early investors a chance to maximize returns before the token’s price escalates further. Therefore, joining at this stage secures a position in a pioneering project combining e-commerce with blockchain technology, while also capitalizing on the potential for substantial financial growth. Web3Bay offers a rare opportunity to participate in shaping the future of decentralized shopping. Final Call Stellar and Litecoin continue to demonstrate their potential as reliable assets, with promising price predictions fueled by solid use cases and market confidence. However, as these established cryptocurrencies aim to maintain their momentum, Web3Bay stands out by addressing a distinct sector: decentralized e-commerce. With its presale gaining traction and a roadmap rich in features like NFTs and DeFi integration, Web3Bay not only complements the broader crypto space but also introduces practical utility for users.

The crypto industry backs Deaton, citing stifled innovation and unfair treatment. Deaton emphasizes transparency and fair regulations for U.S. crypto growth. Attorney John Deaton, an ardent XRP holders’ advocate and a lawyer who was in direct confrontation with the SEC, presented a petition seeking a federal investigation into Operation ChokePoint 2.0, which has been reported to target cryptocurrency activity throughout the United States. John Deaton’s Fight Against Operation ChokePoint 2.0 He is willing to conduct the probe for free because, he claims, the people of America are entitled to more scrutiny and openness amid the rising intrusion of the government in the financial world. A discovery order revealed a massive coordinated effort to restrict cryptocurrency-related services. Coinbase was able to successfully gain unredacted documents from the FDIC. The exchange claims that between 2022 and 2023, the FDIC sent at least 25 letters to different banks, demanding that they either stop or scale back their services related to Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions, blockchain settlement networks, and tokenized deposit products. According to an industry expert, Nic Carter, the measures have suppressed financial innovation, thus locking out the emergence of products like Bitcoin-reward debit cards and loans collateralized by Bitcoin. He continued by saying that the actions by the FDIC were anti-consumer and anti-innovation as they halted the United States from gaining any ground in financial technology. Deaton contributes his voice in the discussion by claiming that he is afraid that Operation ChokePoint 2.0 will be very destructive. He argues that this is not just a matter of cryptocurrency but an outright attack on the free market system in America. This kind of move creates a very bad precedent as it limits financial infrastructure for legitimate businesses. Deaton further argued that unelected bureaucrats should not have the authority to determine who wins and who loses in the marketplace. He said such policies truly undermine America’s ability to remain a leading world power in innovation and economics. Custodia Bank was among the worst-hit institutions. They could not access the infrastructures of banking. However, the Custodia case was only a part of the bigger issues related to businesses that were seeking innovation in the crypto space. Calls for Accountability and Crypto-Friendly Regulations As Deaton notes, the effects of Operation ChokePoint 2.0 go far beyond immediate impacts on companies and ripple into their ability to succeed and innovate overall within the industry. He described these actions as a direct assault on the foundational principles of free market capitalism and transparency. The crypto industry has welcomed Deaton’s call for an investigation with open arms. In his appeals to Congress, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, urged earnestly that hearings be held regarding the actions of the FDIC. Nic Carter praised Coinbase’s choice to unveil the documents and advocated for prompt measures to tear down the systematic barriers that have been erected against the industry. The change in administration now to be manned by President-elect Donald Trump has also brought about a better regulatory environment. There is also a new “Crypto Czar” David Sacks who promised to take on the ChokePoint agenda, as well as Rep. French Hill who endorses reforms on fair and balanced crypto regulations. Many citizens have voiced optimism for future industry prospects, yet the sector still faces significant challenges. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has clearly stated that the Fed plans to make no investment in Bitcoin or similar initiatives. In addition, critics claim one needs to attain regulatory clarity while making sure that fair treatment of digital assets is ensured before additional barriers inhibit innovation. After all, Deaton himself recalled in a speech a call for accountability in investing which encouraged a balanced approach between innovation and investor protection. As they await the response from the new administration, the efforts of Deaton shine bright light on what is urgently needed concerning Operation ChokePoint 2.0. This interested industry people that one who took significant steps toward a long-held aspiration: a steadfast movement toward a fair and transparent system that would promote growth and innovation in the realm of digital assets. Based on the analysis of the FDIC documents and the response from the industry, it is clear that it is necessary to address these issues in a manner that the United States remains ahead of the rest of the world in the financial sphere.

Lenders are now witnessing a 14-year high in credit card defaults, reports the Financial Times. The bad credit forced lenders to collectively write off a whopping $46 billion in loans that are considered seriously delinquent in the first nine months of 2024. Based on data compiled from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the US banking industry information platform BankRegData, the figure represents a 50% year-over-year increase. According to BankRegData, Capital One customers are facing the highest credit card delinquencies, with a total delinquent amount of $7.68 billion, representing 5.36% of their credit card loans. Next is Citibank with $4.79 billion (2.93%) in delinquencies, followed by Synchrony Bank at $4.50 billion (5.02%), JPMorgan Chase at $4.10 billion (2.16%), Discover Bank at $3.9 billion (3.93%) and Bank of America at $2.56 billion (2.54%). The rapid rise in credit card loan defaults is a sign of strained consumer finances after years of high inflation and the subsequent rise in interest rates. Mark Zandi, head of Moody’s Analytics, tells FT that consumer spending power has clearly diminished in most households. “High-income households are fine, but the bottom third of US consumers are tapped out. Their savings rate right now is zero.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 00:26:00

In a recent tweet, Jones emphasized the importance of early investments and urged individuals to seize the opportunity before the token’s value increases further. She used her personal experience to illustrate the asset’s growth trajectory and its potential for long-term investors. Jones revealed that her initial investment of $100 in XRP occurred at a time when the token was priced at approximately $0.25. This allowed her to acquire 400 tokens. According to Jones, the asset last traded at that price range in January 2021, around four years ago. Since then, it has reached a peak value of $2.9 and currently trades at $2.37, reflecting a significant 275% increase over the past year. The Future Value of $100 in Investments Jones highlighted the dwindling purchasing power of $100 to XRP as the asset’s value has risen. She pointed out that the same $100 investment now would buy fewer than 50 XRP tokens. Looking ahead, she predicted that as the price continues to climb, $100 could eventually purchase only one XRP token. This projection underscores her belief that the asset is poised for substantial price growth in years to come, potentially reaching $100. Jones urged the crypto community to consider investing in XRP sooner rather than later, emphasizing the benefits of a patient, long-term investment strategy. “Don’t wait to invest, invest and wait,” she advised, adding that success in cryptocurrency often lies in holding investments over time rather than attempting to time the market. However, she clarified that her statements are personal opinions and do not constitute financial advice. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reactions From the Cryptocurrency Community Linda Jones’s prediction raised considerable discussion among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, with several agreeing on the importance of patience in achieving investment success. Rob Cunningham, host of KUWL.show, echoed Jones’s sentiments, stating that while money cannot buy patience, exercising patience in the market can lead to significant rewards. Cunningham highlighted that early investors who remain committed to their investments are often well-positioned to benefit from future growth. Other members of the crypto community also shared their experiences. An X user, Mr. Hillard, recalled his journey, noting that his initial $100 investment in the token allowed him to acquire 769 tokens. He described his satisfaction with the decision, attributing his success to thorough research and confidence in the asset’s potential. Hillard emphasized that taking informed risks early can lead to meaningful gains over time. Jones’s optimistic projection reflects her confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. While skepticism and uncertainty remain within the cryptocurrency market, her call for early investment and patience resonates with many investors.

Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Martinez identifies how Bitcoin ( BTC ) could confirm its next breakout. “BTC remains at a critical point. This might just be a retest of the 50-day MA (moving average) before a potential move lower.

According to an analyst, Litecoin’s current technical setup points to strong potential for a parabolic breakout, with the $130 price mark emerging as a critical resistance zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details Narrow Bollinger Bands To Trigger Litecoin Breakout Prominent crypto analyst Tony Severino shared a price chart on X (formerly Twitter) showing Litecoin’s price action on a bi-monthly time frame, applying Bollinger Bands as a technical indicator to measure a cryptocurrency’s price volatility. The Bollinger Bands examine market volatility by plotting an upper and lower band around a Moving Average (MA), which acts as a basis line. In Litecoin’s case, Severino has indicated that the cryptocurrency’s 2M Bollinger Band width is extremely narrow, underscoring a lack of or significantly decreased volatility. Historically, Bollinger Bands are known to expand during periods of high volatility and tighten at low volatility. Severino’s Litecoin chart displays the upper Bollinger Band marked by the red line, the basis line by a blue line, and the lower band highlighted in the green area. The analyst disclosed that Litecoin’s candlesticks are currently positioned above the basis line at $83.3, indicating potential for bullish momentum. If the price of Litecoin continues upwards and crosses the upper Bollinger band at approximately $130, Severino predicts that it could trigger heightened volatility and an explosive price breakout. Based on historical trends, an extremely narrow Bollinger Band often indicates a potential for a bullish trend reversal after a period of consolidation. Severino’s analysis has pinpointed the upper BB at $130 as a crucial resistance area for Litecoin. A sustained break above this level on a high timeframe could pave the way for more gains, potentially pushing Litecoin significantly above its current market value of around $111.5. According to CoinMarketCap, Litecoin has recorded modest gains, increasing by 6.14% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the prominent cryptocurrency has also experienced a higher increase of about 11.7% to its current level. To reach the critical resistance area at $130, Litecoin is required to rise by approximately 18% from its market price. Litecoin Rally Predicted, Targets 38% Upside According to crypto analyst Mike on X, Litecoin is preparing for a significant breakout to a new price high. He forecasts that the cryptocurrency will record a 38% price rally from the breakout point at $106 to reach a fresh bullish target of $146.67. Looking at the analyst’s price chart, Litecoin appears to have broken the $102 resistance level and is approaching its next significant resistance at $122.77. The chart also highlights horizontal lines indicating critical resistance areas for Litecoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Critical Support Amid Long-Term Holder Selling Pressure—Analyst Mike has pinpointed a key support zone at $99.91 that could act as a safety net for Litecoin during a downtrend.

One name making waves in the crypto world is PropiChain , a project that promises a massive 12,000% return. Offering a blend of real-world utility and innovation, PropiChain is quickly becoming the go-to choice for traders looking to diversify and maximize gains. Let’s dive into why it is stealing the spotlight and leaving meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in its wake. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Losing Their Spark? For years, Dogecoin was the poster child for community-driven cryptocurrencies, powered by memes and viral trends. But even with its cult-like following, the coin is starting to show cracks. The Dogecoin price has seen sharp declines recently, highlighting its inherent volatility and limited clear use cases. While some loyalists remain hopeful, others are growing impatient with its inability to break free from its meme status. Similarly, Shiba Inu , touted as a “Dogecoin killer,” has tried to prove its worth through initiatives like Shibarium and token burns. While these efforts have created buzz, they haven’t resolved the coin’s primary issues: an oversaturated token supply and limited real-world applications. Despite its innovative moves, Shiba Inu continues to struggle with attracting long-term investors. This has left traders wondering if meme coins are really worth their time or if they should shift their focus to projects like PropiChain , which combine innovation and practicality. PropiChain: A Fresh Alternative to Meme Coins Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PropiChain is not built on hype alone. It’s designed to offer tangible value through cutting-edge features that redefine how people interact with cryptocurrency and investments. Here’s what makes PropiChain stand out: Fractional Ownership One of PropiChain’s standout features is its approach to real estate investment. Instead of needing enormous capital to purchase properties, investors can buy fractional ownership of high-value assets. This model democratizes access to the real estate market, opening the doors for small-scale investors to earn from a market previously restricted to the elite. AI-Powered Insights PropiChain’s AI tools are here to help with navigating real estate investments. From property appraisals to market trend analysis, these tools empower investors to make smarter decisions. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rely on social media buzz to drive value, PropiChain offers real utility, making it a more attractive option for serious investors. Metaverse Real Estate The metaverse might just be the future of how we live, work, and play. PropiChain taps into this space by enabling users to invest in virtual properties. Think of it as owning a piece of the next big digital world. As the metaverse grows, so will the value of PropiChain’s ecosystem, making it a unique blend of physical and digital investment opportunities. With features like these, PropiChain is quickly gaining traction as a crypto with real potential. What’s the Opportunity for Investors? PropiChain is in its second presale stage with tokens currently priced at just $0.011. This presents the perfect entry point as prices are set to increase in the next stages. Let’s put it into perspective: an investment of $500 today could potentially grow to $60,000 if PropiChain delivers on its projected 12,000% return. And with nearly $2M already raised, it’s clear that investors are taking notice. The platform’s successful listing on CoinMarketCap and completion of a rigorous security audit only add to its credibility. PropiChain is a well-structured, secure project that’s ready to make waves in the market. Conclusion The days of relying solely on meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu for quick profits may be numbered. While they’ve brought excitement and fun to the crypto world, their limited utility is becoming increasingly evident. PropiChain , on the other hand, offers a refreshing alternative; combining innovation, security, and real-world applications. For investors looking for a project with both short-term and long-term potential, PropiChain stands out as a clear choice. With the presale heating up and tokens selling fast, now is the time to act.

Insights from Crypto Experts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, seems to be gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts as it has formed a bullish price action pattern on its daily time frame. Amid this bullish outlook, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) where they made a bold prediction that XRP could reach $11 in the coming days. $XRP is still consolidating within the pennant of a massive bull pennant pattern. Until the $2.73 resistance is broken, a pullback to $2.05 remains possible before a potential breakout to $11! pic.twitter.com/ET39FJMtAc — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 Expert Bold Prediction for XRP In a post on X, the expert noted that XRP is currently consolidating within a bullish pennant price action pattern, which appears similar to a flag and pole pattern on the daily time frame. Amid this consolidation, the price seems to be be stuck in a narrow range and is facing resistance at the $2.73 mark. The expert highlighted that before XRP breaches this resistance level, there is a strong possibility it could pull back to the $2.05 mark. Additionally, if the XRP price further breaches the resistance level and closes a daily candle above the $2.73 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar significantly to reach the $11 level in the future. Besides this bold prediction, XRP is currently trading near $2.42 and has experienced a price decline of 1.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 25%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors amid the bullish outlook. XRP Price Prediction and Upcoming Levels However, CoinPedia’s technical analysis suggests that XRP has already broken out from a bullish flag and pole price action pattern, but is currently retesting the breakout level of $2.40. Based on the recent price action, if the asset holds this level and closes a daily candle above it, it could signal further bullish momentum.

Crypto analyst Javon Marks has identified key indicators that suggest that the asset is set for a substantial rally in the coming months. As of now, the token is trading at $0.00002242, reflecting a 7.9% increase in the last 24 hours. Marks has pointed out that the token recently surpassed a major resistance trendline that had been holding back its price growth. Following this breakout, SHIB reached a seven-month high of $0.00003329 earlier in December. However, the rally was followed by a corrective phase, during which the asset retraced most of its gains. This correction saw the token revisit lows around $0.0000186, erasing much of its earlier progress. Despite this pullback, Marks noted that the asset successfully retested its breakout level as a new support zone. Since then, it has rebounded and is currently consolidating in the $0.000022 range. Marks considers this development a strong bullish signal, emphasizing that the asset’s ability to hold above the breakout level sets the stage for continued upward movement. Price Projections Javon Marks has set an optimistic price target of $0.000081 for Shiba Inu, which would represent a more than 270% increase from its current trading levels. This price point marks a critical area where SHIB faced significant resistance during its previous market cycle. Marks has consistently identified $0.000081 as a key target for the token throughout 2024 and maintains confidence that the token will eventually reclaim this level. In addition to this projection, he has suggested that Shiba Inu could reach as high as $0.000155 during the current bull market. This higher target represents an unprecedented price level for the token, signaling the potential for significant gains if market conditions remain favorable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hidden Bullish Divergence One of the factors supporting the bullish outlook for the digital asset is the presence of hidden bullish divergence on its price chart. This phenomenon occurs when the asset’s price forms higher lows while momentum indicators display lower lows, indicating underlying strength and potential for further upward movement. Marks has highlighted this divergence as a critical component of Shiba Inu’s bullish narrative. Combined with the asset’s ability to maintain its position above the key breakout level, this divergence reinforces the case for continued price growth. With Shiba Inu holding above crucial support levels and displaying robust bullish signals, analysts are optimistic about its near-term performance. Marks’s target of $0.000081 reflects significant growth potential, while his higher projection of $0.000155 suggests even greater opportunities for long-term investors.

Originally created in 2016 by blockchain entrepreneur Ned Scott and BitShares founder Dan Larimer, Steem Dollars ( SBD ) were designed to provide stability in the volatile world of cryptocurrency while powering a unique ecosystem of social media and content creation. Its market cap currently hovers just above $47.5 million. Source: CoinGecko The coin’s recent rally highlights renewed interest in the Steem ecosystem, where Steem Dollars play a central role. Pegged to the U.S. dollar, the coin offers a relatively stable cryptocurrency option — integral to the platform’s reward system. Additionally, Steem – like most cryptocurrencies – can also be used to make digital peer-to-peer payments. Users earn SBD for publishing and curating content on platforms like Steemit, a New York-based startup that touts itself as a decentralized alternative to traditional social media networks. You might also like: NFT sales drop to $132m, Pudgy Penguins loses steam Why Steem Dollars matter SBD provides liquidity for transactions within the Steem blockchain and can be used to earn interest as part of a decentralized savings account. It is also convertible to other cryptocurrencies or fiat. Additionally, Steem Dollars can be traded for STEEM tokens or Steem Power, the latter increasing influence and voting weight on the platform. The sharp price increase, however, raises questions about its stability. While the token is intended to maintain a value close to 1 USD, its market-driven price has occasionally deviated from this peg. The current surge might reflect speculative trading rather than organic growth in the ecosystem, but it nonetheless underscores the enduring relevance of Steem Dollars in the blockchain space. Looking ahead As SBD continues to climb, analysts and community members will be watching closely to see if this momentum translates into lasting growth for the Steem ecosystem. Whether the surge is a fleeting speculative event or the start of a broader renaissance, one thing is clear: Steem Dollars are once again making waves in the cryptocurrency world. Several platforms integrate stablecoins into reward ecosystems to incentivize user participation and provide stability. Examples include Hive Dollar on the Hive blockchain, offering rewards for content creators, and DAI from MakerDAO, widely used in DeFi for staking and liquidity rewards. Binance USD ( BUSD ) and USDC are commonly utilized in platforms like PancakeSwap and PoolTogether for similar purposes. Curve Finance employs stablecoins like DAI and USDT in liquidity pools, while sUSD from Synthetix powers synthetic asset trading and staking rewards. Social media platforms like Roll and Rally also incorporate stablecoins to reward creators. These ecosystems highlight the versatility of stablecoins in reducing volatility and fostering user engagement.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 01:55:00

Concurrently, the Dogecoin price forecast has attracted considerable attention due to a 40% increase in whale transaction activity. The standout event, however, is BlockDAG’s $1M New Year’s raffle. This compelling promotion has surged BDAG’s presale to an impressive $175.5 million, with $5 million gathered within just 24 hours. The raffle offers three unique prizes alongside a 200% BDAG bonus, igniting enthusiasm across the crypto community as participants hurry to claim their shares before upcoming exchange listings. With initial participants achieving returns of 2,240%, BlockDAG (BDAG) is rapidly emerging as the top crypto to buy at the moment. Future Prospects for Dogecoin: What Lies Ahead? Recent increases in whale transactions have ignited significant interest in the Dogecoin price forecast, with a notable uptick in trading suggesting a potential rise. Observers have recorded a 40% increase in large transactions within Dogecoin’s network, pushing transaction volumes above $23 billion in a single day. The anticipation around Dogecoin’s price forecast grows when considering its historical performance, which has seen significant spikes in previous cycles, such as a 90-fold increase in 2017 and a 306-fold increase in 2021. Although these historical data points suggest potential for growth, caution is advised. The future trajectory of Dogecoin’s price is poised to potentially include unexpected developments, warranting both interest and cautious scrutiny. Chainlink Whales Demonstrate Market Confidence Chainlink whales have invested approximately $76.9 million in purchasing 3.58 million LINK tokens over three days, showcasing their belief in LINK’s long-term viability despite recent price declines. This aggressive buying indicates their anticipation of potential recovery and enduring robustness in LINK’s future. As the price of Chainlink stabilizes around $21.50, these significant participants continue to accumulate LINK at reduced prices, demonstrating ongoing confidence even as the broader market undergoes corrections. Their proactive acquisitions underscore a bullish perspective on LINK’s prospects as we progress towards 2025. BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle Sparks Major Daily Gains BlockDAG, a key player in the cryptocurrency arena, is currently the center of attention with its New Year raffle, offering a chance to win up to $1 million in USDT. The raffle is structured with three ticket types—Bronze, Silver, and Gold—ranging from $250 to $1000 each. Every ticket comes with a 200% BDAG bonus, positioning it as an attractive choice for those searching for the top crypto to buy. The reaction to this raffle has been extraordinary. Enthusiasts have poured in, contributing $5 million overnight and elevating the presale to a notable $175.5 million. With just one day remaining for entry, the anticipation is tangible, drawing both individual participants and major figures eager to capitalize on this rare chance. Beyond the raffle, early participants have enjoyed a return of 2,240%, with BDAG’s value increasing from $0.001 to $0.0234. Analysts anticipate even greater returns in the future. This progress is sparking discussions about BDAG’s prospects once it is available on major exchanges. This event represents more than a mere opportunity to win substantial sums; it’s a gateway to becoming part of an expanding ecosystem set for significant advancements. With substantial daily contributions from whales, the opportunity to join this rapidly developing venture is narrowing. Identifying the Next Big Crypto Opportunity Chainlink and Dogecoin are commanding the spotlight in the crypto market for solid reasons. Chainlink whales are placing substantial bets on LINK’s hopeful rebound, while the Dogecoin price forecast is gaining momentum as transactions driven by whales increase. Each of these cryptocurrencies provides distinct prospects, capturing the interest of veteran traders and new enthusiasts alike, all keen to see what unfolds next. Yet, BlockDAG steals the show with its $1M New Year’s raffle and unprecedented presale achievements. Having amassed $175.5 million and offered a 200% BDAG bonus, it is quickly becoming the top crypto to buy . As the chance to participate dwindles, BlockDAG’s ongoing success points to a promising future, distinguishing it as a key contender in the competitive crypto market.

SUI, Solana, and Web3Bay are prime examples, each bringing distinct advantages and massive growth prospects for 2025. SUI has been making news with its notable price trends and market achievements, while Solana’s unmatched network capabilities and rising institutional interest suggest a standout year ahead. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is innovating in the e-commerce sector with its decentralized, community-driven platform. Let’s delve into why these three projects are transforming their sectors and why they might be the best investments to watch right now. SUI Price: Is it Ready to Reach $4.96? SUI has been drawing attention in the crypto sphere with its notable performance despite a recent 4.89% drop in the last 24 hours. The token has seen a significant 24.75% increase this month, indicating strong bullish momentum. Currently, SUI is trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern, hinting at a potential breakout with a target price of $4.96. Key support levels at $3.926 and the triangle’s lower boundary might provide the boost needed for further price increases. Recent on-chain data showing $26 million in SUI withdrawals from exchanges suggests a decrease in selling pressure as traders hold on for the long haul. Although it faces challenges like reduced Open Interest and trading volume, SUI’s surpassing of Shiba Inu in market cap underlines its expanding market presence. Keep an eye on SUI’s upward movement, as it could become a strong contender. Solana’s 2025 Surge: Will It Hit $330? Solana is gaining momentum as we enter 2025 with positive market signals. Despite past challenges in breaking the $160 mark, Solana has recently surged past $200, setting an optimistic outlook for the year. Projections show SOL could climb to between $274 and $330, supported by its fast transactions and efficient network relative to competitors like Ethereum. Growing institutional interest is evident as applications for a Solana ETF by major entities like Grayscale and VanEck are pending SEC approval. If greenlit, these ETFs could significantly elevate Solana’s market position by broadening its investor base. With robust on-chain data indicating a strong holding pattern among investors and ongoing market consolidation, Solana’s prospects make it an exciting watch for 2025. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce Through Blockchain Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by creating a decentralized, transparent, and efficient marketplace. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that involve intermediaries and high fees, Web3Bay uses blockchain technology to eliminate these barriers, ensuring secure and cost-effective transactions and giving users full control over their data. Currently, Web3Bay is in presale stage 3 with $0.0039675 per token, with over $303,849 already raised. So far, 90 million tokens have been sold, reflecting strong investor demand as the project gains momentum. Web3Bay’s presale spans 28 stages, with a planned 15% price increase at each stage, culminating in a final price of $0.1959. Early backers stand to gain returns of up to 6,430% , making 3BAY a promising opportunity within the evolving Web3 landscape. This not only sets Web3Bay apart but also makes it highly practical. The platform accepts both cryptocurrency and standard payment methods like PayPal, broadening its accessibility. Future plans to incorporate NFTs and DeFi elements aim to establish a comprehensive decentralized trading platform. Whether you’re a merchant aiming for worldwide exposure or an investor seeking a notable altcoin with real-world applications, Web3Bay’s innovative features and potential for significant returns make it a leading choice in the burgeoning decentralized market. Final Remarks Web3Bay, SUI, and Solana epitomize the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation, each with its potential to disrupt. SUI’s positive price direction and strong market stance suggest a bullish future, while Solana’s operational efficiency and increasing institutional focus position it for significant growth. Web3Bay, with its novel e-commerce model and solid presale strategy, is set to transform how we shop online. Together, these projects highlight the varied opportunities within the crypto sphere. Whether you’re drawn to technical innovation, financial growth, or ground-breaking applications, these three cryptos are paving the way for the future.

The token’s trading price has also surged, with analysts pointing to the recent network unlocking event, which saw the addition of 82 million SUI tokens, about 0.82% of the cumulative token supply, The SUI token sees a remarkable start to 2025 The SUI token’s value has increased by over 1312% since its lowest price level in 2023 and by 25% in the last seven days. Additionally, its market cap is now over $15.2 billion, edging out TON and Chainlink, and it is now closely approaching the $16 billion mark. Aside from its market cap, its 24-hour trading volume is also at its peak at $2.6 billion, while the token trades at $5.34, more than an 8% uptick in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, its open interest has also grown over 37% to $1.22 billion, while its total value locked stands at $2.039 billion . SUI’s network token unlocking, heightened demand, and collaborations have helped push its trading price SUI’s price rally in the last few days coincides with the network’s token unlocking, suggesting the release helped elevate trading prices. On January 1, 2025, the SUI network released roughly 82 million tokens, 0.82% of its total token supply. Moreover, the token’s increased prices could be attributed to its bulked-up demand, even with its surging trading volume close to $ 3 billion. The Sui network has also partnered with multiple firms and technologies, raising investor interest. For starters, the network is currently working with Ant Digital Technologies to expedite the adoption of real-world assets in Web3, marking the debut of tokenized assets on the platform. It is also collaborating with Wall Street companies VanEck, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton, boosting investor confidence in the L1 blockchain. The network’s recent integrations are also doing fairly well, with Deepbook V3, the network’s proprietary on-chain order, recording over $1 billion in trading volume and its DEEP token climbing to a market valuation of more than $375 million.

Adding to the excitement, a top market expert recently shared a bullish forecast for Ripple’s native crypto, predicting a potential surge to $11. However, despite the positive long-term outlook, the expert said that the crypto could witness a pullback before the strong rally. Top Expert Predicts XRP Price Rally To $11 As XRP price recorded a robust rally recently, market experts remained positive on the future trajectory of the coin. For context, crypto market expert Ali Martinez recently shared a price chart highlighting the key levels for Ripple’s native crypto. He has shared a key resistance level that the crypto should break to avoid the bearish momentum ahead. For context, the expert said that the crypto’s price action remains in focus as it consolidates within a bullish pennant pattern. In addition, he said that crypto could risk falling to $2.05 ahead “until the $2.73 resistance is broken.” However, despite the warning on the short-term performance, the analyst noted that the crypto could rally to $11 after the “pullback.” Source: Ali Martinez, X In other words, this analysis suggests that while the long-term outlook is optimistic, traders should prepare for potential short-term volatility. Historically, bull pennant patterns indicate accumulation phases, followed by significant price moves. XRP’s current technical setup aligns with this, signaling a possible retracement before achieving new highs. Meanwhile, the crypto market’s growing bullish sentiment adds further momentum to XRP. Notably, this projection reflects both the token’s strong fundamentals and renewed investor confidence in the broader crypto market. A Closer Look Into Ripple’s Native Crypto & Its Future Prospects The warning over the short-term pullback in XRP price also aligns with the current market sentiment as the US SEC’s deadline to file the opening brief in the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit is approaching. Notably, a flurry of experts believes that SEC Chair Gary Gensler would file the opening brief before leaving his chair later this month. This development, if happens, could impact the price trajectory of the token. However, despite that, the market sentiment remained high over the long-term scenario for XRP. For context, in a recent X post, a pro-XRP lawyer recently commented on the potential conclusion timeline of the ongoing XRP lawsuit. On the other hand, the anticipation over positive crypto developments under Donald Trump’s presidency and crypto-friendly SEC Chair Paul Atkins has further bolstered sentiment. Notably, XRP is one of the leading contenders among the top crypto ETF launches expected this year. Having said that, the market experts anticipate these developments to further send the XRP price to a new high, potentially to $11 as Martinez predicted. In addition, another top analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has reiterated his bullish stance on XRP, saying that the crypto is poised to hit $27 in the long run.

Since losing the $100,000 level on December 19, 2024, the premier cryptocurrency has struggled to gather any significant bullish momentum. However, the price of BTC seems to be in the recovery phase at the moment, with an almost 5% increase in the past week. According to a prominent crypto analyst on the social media platform X, the current price setup suggests that Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal juncture. Bitcoin Price Retests 50-Day MA — What Next? Popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to reveal the current layout of the Bitcoin price and the potential impact on its future trajectory. According to the analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency’s price is at a “critical point.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase The rationale behind this claim is Bitcoin’s action around the 50-day moving average (50MA) on the daily price chart. The 50-day MA is a common technical indicator used to track the medium-term trend of an asset’s price (Bitcoin, in this scenario). In Bitcoin’s case — from the highlighted charts, the 50-day moving average has served as significant support and resistance points in the past. It appears that the Bitcoin price successfully broke underneath the 50-day MA and has climbed back to retest the breached support. According to Martinez, the price of the premier cryptocurrency is at risk of moving to the downside once the retest is complete. However, the analyst noted that a sustained close above the 50-day moving average could invalidate the bearish projection for Bitcoin and perhaps signal the end of the ongoing price correction. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $98,358, reflecting a 1% increase in the past day. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by nearly 5% in the last seven days. Can Growing Exchange Outflows Trigger Fresh Bullish Momentum? In another post on X, Martinez revealed that significant amounts of Bitcoin have been flowing out of exchanges in the past week. Data from CryptoQuant shows that over 48,000 BTC (worth more than $4.5 billion) have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past seven days. Related Reading: XRP Surpasses USDT: Becomes 3rd Largest Crypto With $139 Billion Market Cap This funds’ movement signals a shift in sentiment, as investors are moving their coins to non-custodial wallets possibly for long-term storage. This could suggest that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the future promise of the market leader. The increased flow of coins from centralized exchanges could also indicate fresh buying activity, with investors choosing to store their newly acquired assets off the trading platforms. Ultimately, this exchange outflow could be a bullish signal for the Bitcoin price.

Simultaneously, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is making waves with its initial coin offering (ICO), rapidly gaining investor attention for its innovative AI-blockchain integration. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT), a once-dominant player in the Web3 space, appears to be losing some of its momentum as newer, more agile competitors emerge. FLOKI Rides High on Meme Coin Hype FLOKI has taken over the funny coin world, pulling in a huge group of fans and getting people to invest with its trendy ads and fun name. FLOKI is riding on the wave of past meme coins such as ͏Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, using its funny aspect to grow into NFTs and DeFi tasks. The meme coin area often counts a lot on buzz. FLOKI has shown a promise to new ideas by bringing in things like staking and use in its group. This mix of fun and use has let it stay important in a very tough market, keeping control over other meme coins. Lightchain AI’s ICO Signals Massive Potential in Blockchain Innovation While FLOKI thrives in the meme coin niche, Lightchain AI is carving out its own space with a groundbreaking approach to integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain technology. Priced at $0.0041 during its ICO, Lightchain AI has already raised over $5.7 million, reflecting significant investor confidence in its potential. Unlike speculative meme coins, Lightchain AI focuses on real-world applications. Its decentralized infrastructure supports AI-driven computations, enabling industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance to adopt blockchain-based AI solutions. This practical utility positions Lightchain AI as a high-growth asset in a market often dominated by speculative projects. The platform’s roadmap includes global adoption, developer-friendly tools, and industry partnerships, ensuring it remains a leader in innovation. With its focus on privacy-preserving AI computations and scalable solutions, Lightchain AI offers an attractive investment opportunity for those looking beyond meme coin hype. Is Polkadot Losing Its Edge? Polkadot, a blockchain platform renowned for its multi-chain framework and interoperability, has experienced both advancements and challenges in 2024. The network boasts a vibrant developer community, with approximately 2,400 monthly active developers as of July 2024, positioning it among the top blockchain networks. However, Polkadot faces significant competition from emerging platforms like Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Avalanche, all striving to enhance scalability and interoperability. Additionally, in Q3 2024, Polkadot’s market capitalization declined by 27%, and daily active addresses decreased by 26%, indicating potential challenges in user engagement and market positioning. Despite these hurdles, Polkadot continues to innovate, with developments such as the introduction of Polkadot 2.0 aiming to address scalability and cross-chain connectivity, underscoring its commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Ask anybody who bought into Solana at its presale prices or very early into its lifecycle, and you’ll know this to be the truth. The trouble is that given the glut of crypto presale opportunities, it could be a lot like finding a needle in a haystack. But like anything, the only way to find out whether an investment opportunity is a blue chip is to do your own research and see for yourself. In 2025 one crypto presale investment opportunity distinguishes itself as a real gem: Remittix , which some analysts believe could become XRP 2.0. Here’s why the smart money is taking out big positions in Remittix this year and has seen over $1 million raised in just over a week! Crypto presales: The smart money’s choice Imagine if you had the chance to buy Ethereum during its presale for a fraction of a dollar. Or Solana, BNB, or Dogecoin when they were available at their historic all-time lows. But it’s no use crying over spilled milk. Luckily, hope springs eternal in the cryptosphere’s breast and the crypto presale opportunities are abundant. The next 100x is just around the corner and the next strong candidate looks to be Remittix . Remittix: Enabling fast, secure crypto-to-fiat transactions like no other Crypto has been derided as something less than legal tender. Save for a handful of jurisdictions, most users need to sell their crypto for fiat on a third-party exchange or P2P transaction—and take on extra exchange fees—before they can use it to buy items. That is, until the arrival of Remittix. Remittix enables users to use crypto to perform direct bank-to-bank deposits in over 40 fiat currencies. This enables merchants, sellers, and buyers to perform cross-border crypto-to-fiat without exorbitant fees, long delays, and excessive paperwork. Remittix enables merchants to pay their suppliers in the latter’s native currency directly to their bank account instantaneously, without friction, and at a negligible cost. With Remittix, users don’t have to worry about the existing circuitous and impractical paradigm of having to manually go through various exchanges, P2P transactions, or swaps before they can use their crypto to pay in fiat—the receiver gets their payment in their native currency directly in their bank account. Remittix’s unique value proposition can be a real game-changer in the existing global supply chain—which could translate into massive growth for its native token $RTX. No other protocol democratizes global trade and levels the playing field like Remittix does, making it one of the hottest crypto presale investment opportunities of 2025. Missed out on 2024 gains? Don’t miss out on the Remittix crypto presale The best part about Remittix is that it’s just in its presale phase so if you’ve missed out on the gains last year, don’t miss out on one of the microcap blue chips of the 2025 bull cycle. With current token prices at just $0.0177, Remittix tokens are available at a significant discount and good value to turn in parabolic growth this year. It’s been suggested that the RTX token will launch at a minimum price of $0.135 marking a huge return for early adopters! Alongside this utility never goes out of style—and with Remittix’s ability to change the way the world conducts business, it’s all just a matter of time before it moons.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Bitcoin recently saw an increase of up to 2.9%, reaching $97,526, while alternative cryptos such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) surged by over 4%. Notably, Solana (SOL) climbed an impressive 8.2%, signaling a renewed interest in digital assets beyond the leading cryptocurrency. Altcoins And Crypto Stocks Gain Momentum In New Year Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted that investors are diversifying their portfolios as they enter 2025. “Market participants have started to allocate capital to representations of more speculative narratives,” he stated, highlighting a shift towards altcoins that may offer higher returns. This trend aligns with historical data showing that digital assets often perform well in the first quarter, adding to the optimism surrounding the current market dynamics. Related Reading: XRP Surpasses USDT: Becomes 3rd Largest Crypto With $139 Billion Market Cap The positive momentum is further supported by the notion of capital rotation into thematic sectors, which Newhouse describes as a “strong tailwind for altcoins.” Investors appear to be capitalizing on seasonal strength, coupled with improving macroeconomic conditions and an interest in narratives that extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This renewed enthusiasm isn’t limited to cryptocurrencies alone; crypto-dependent stocks are also benefiting from the market’s upswing. On the first trading day of 2025, Coinbase shares climbed as much as 5.6%, while MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings saw increases of 7.3% and over 8%, respectively, indicating a growing confidence among investors in the broader cryptocurrency sector. Optimism Grows For 2025’s Bull Market Amid Regulatory Changes Despite the gains, it’s important to note that cryptocurrency prices remain below the highs experienced in December. Some market analysts suggest this dip may be fueling current buying activity. Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at FRNT Financial Inc., remarked, “Rallies among alts like the one we are seeing today are investors following the popular crypto mantra of ‘buy the dip’ in anticipation of the bull market’s continuation.” For many crypto investors, the fundamental case for a budding bull market remains robust, despite the inherent volatility. Looking ahead, many investors are optimistic about a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in 2025, particularly with the anticipated presidency of Donald Trump. Trump’s election victory and the nomination of crypto-friendly individuals to his administration have already resulted in substantial inflows into altcoins that had previously faced scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

By 2034, AI agents are projected to replace 800 million jobs worldwide, adding $19.9 trillion to the global economy, according to McKinsey and IDC. As traditional 9-to-5 jobs face extinction, here’s everything you need to know to prepare for this seismic shift in 2025. What Are AI Agents ? AI agents are not your typical automation tools. They are autonomous systems designed to: Learn from interactions: Constantly improving with every task. Make complex decisions: Acting as independent problem solvers. Operate seamlessly: Coordinating with other AI systems in real-time. Imagine having an army of 1,000 expert employees who never sleep, never complain, and constantly get smarter. These agents can: Process 10,000 legal documents in seconds. Draft flawless reports or emails in milliseconds. Make data-driven decisions at speeds humans can’t match. It’s no wonder companies like Amazon are already exploring how multiple AI agents can work together to revolutionize operations. For instance: One agent could analyze data. Another could handle logistics. A third could oversee management. As Sam Altman predicts, AI agents may eventually run entire companies. The Job Market in Chaos The effects of AI agents are already being felt: Industries are vanishing: Sectors that seemed untouchable are now obsolete. Careers built over decades are disappearing: AI is outperforming human workers at an unprecedented pace. Job market disruption: 1 in 7 workers have already lost their jobs to AI agents. Elon Musk describes this shift as “the biggest risk to the future of civilization.” By 2030, McKinsey forecasts that AI agents will replace 70% of office work. The World Economic Forum predicts that only 5% of jobs will remain unchanged. The Skills You Need to Survive Despite the challenges, there’s a clear path forward for those who adapt. The survivors of this AI revolution will focus on skills that remain uniquely human: Strategic thinking: The ability to see the big picture and make long-term decisions. Relationship building: Fostering trust and collaboration. Emotional intelligence: Understanding and responding to human emotions. These are areas where AI cannot replace humans, no matter how advanced it becomes. Creativity, empathy, and storytelling are qualities that will be more valuable than ever. How to Prepare for the Future To thrive in this new era, consider these steps: Master AI tools: Learn how to integrate AI into your workflow to boost productivity. Develop human-centric skills: Focus on creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Build a personal brand: As AI dominates tasks, people will crave human connection. Sharing your story, insights, and experiences will set you apart. Elite entrepreneurs like Alex Hormozi believe that personal brands will thrive in the age of AI. The more AI takes over, the more people will value genuine human interaction. Conclusion The rise of AI is inevitable, but your response to it isn’t. By adapting early, mastering AI tools, and focusing on uniquely human traits, you can secure your place in the future economy. The AI revolution is both a challenge and an opportunity—those who embrace it will emerge stronger than ever.

Stellar, currently pegged at $0.43, has experts predicting a rise to $1.29 by 2025, fueled by its integral role in global payments and blockchain efficacy. Meanwhile, Litecoin has breezed past the $100 mark, its ascent backed by a finite supply and swift processing speeds. Yet, in the shadow of these giants, Web3Bay is carving out its territory in the decentralized e-commerce arena. Its 3BAY token, now up for grabs in a presale, dishes out governance rights and discounts to its holders, presenting a captivating alternative in the ever-adaptive crypto landscape. Stellar (XLM): Price Forecasts for 2025 & 2030 Stellar is making waves at around $0.43, with substantial growth on the horizon. Analysts eye a climb to $0.72 by early 2025, a robust 68% leap, and even see it reaching $1.29 by year’s end if the stars align. By 2030, Stellar might hit a high of $6.19, with an average price likely orbiting around $4.60. These projections draw from a mix of technical analyses, market vibes, and Stellar’s burgeoning roles in international payments and blockchain tech. The latest tech readings show a 50-day moving average of $0.38 and a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 58.22, signaling a strong upward trend. Stellar’s platform is gaining traction for its scalability and effectiveness, solidifying its potential for sustained growth. Yet, the unpredictable nature of crypto markets calls for a cautious eye, as outside forces and market shifts could heavily sway Stellar’s path. Litecoin Climbs Over $100 Litecoin has recently soared above $100, mirroring a broader wave of optimism sweeping through the crypto markets. Trading at $101.96, it has notched a 1.28% increase over the past 24 hours, with trading volume spiking by 22.73% to $465.51 million, bolstering its market cap to $7.68 billion. Affectionately dubbed “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin has held its ground with quicker transaction speeds and a max supply of 84 million coins, of which 75.36 million are already circulating, adding a layer of rarity and allure. Its reliable performance across varying market conditions cements its status as a solid investment. Tech advancements have also spiced up Litecoin’s features, enhancing its scalability and privacy, which in turn boosts its uptake. With the crypto market showing signs of rejuvenation, Litecoin’s consistent liquidity and strong performance are drawing investors’ eyes, underscoring its lasting relevance in the digital currency world. Web3Bay Presale: Token Utilities, Expansion Plans, & Early-Bird Perks The ongoing Web3Bay presale is making waves by introducing the 3BAY token, set to transform decentralized e-commerce. Holding these tokens not only brings transaction discounts and platform perks but also grants a say in the platform’s future decisions, promoting a community-driven approach. These benefits are designed to ramp up user engagement and encourage long-term involvement, marking 3BAY as a standout player in the crypto sphere. Web3Bay’s roadmap is chock-full of ambitious features that aim to revolutionize online shopping. Upcoming integrations include an NFT marketplace to facilitate smooth digital asset exchanges and DeFi options that offer staking and yield farming, opening up new earning avenues. Moreover, Web3Bay is targeting cross-chain interoperability, linking with major blockchain networks to ensure fluid transactions and greater scalability. Now in its third presale stage, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.0039675, with over $300,000 raised, signaling strong investor confidence. With each new stage, the price jumps by 15%, giving early investors a chance to maximize gains before prices climb further. Engaging now places you at the forefront of a trailblazing merger of e-commerce and blockchain tech, with significant growth potential. Web3Bay offers an exclusive chance to shape the future of decentralized shopping. Summing Up Stellar and Litecoin continue to prove their mettle as sturdy assets with bright futures, backed by solid use cases and market trust. Yet, as these veteran cryptos strive to keep up their pace, Web3Bay stands out by targeting a niche: decentralized e-commerce. With its presale advancing and a roadmap brimming with NFT and DeFi enhancements, Web3Bay doesn’t just add to the crypto universe—it reinvents it, providing real utility for its users.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Yellen says the government will likely reach its debt limit sometime in January, largely because of obligations related to Medicare payments – forcing the government to take “extraordinary measures” to pay its bills. The Treasury has previously used the term “extraordinary measures” to refer to suspending investments in certain entitlement programs, pausing sales of Government Series treasury securities and other accounting maneuvers to keep the government running. Says Yellen, “Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23 at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures. I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States ” At time of writing, the US national debt is currently at $36.28 trillion. The government spent nearly $1 trillion simply to service the interest on the debt in fiscal year 2024, which ended last year on September 30th, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In a recent interview at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit, Yellen expressed regret about not being able to improve the US fiscal situation. “I am concerned about fiscal sustainability, and I am sorry that we haven’t made more progress. I believe that the deficit needs to be brought down, especially now that we’re in an environment of higher interest rates. For example, over the last year the interest cost of the debt has increased by several hundred billion. It’s one of the largest items responsible for the increase in the budget deficit. And we do need to bring it down. The primary deficit excluding interest is now a little over 3% and I believe it needs to come down.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

For XRP to maintain its upward momentum, it must hold above current support levels, particularly the $2.29 mark. Keep in mind that XRP, like many major altcoins, often follows Bitcoin’s price action. If Bitcoin experiences a short-term bounce, we may see similar movements in altcoins like XRP. Possible Pullback or Minor Slowdown Ahead? Although the bearish divergence may signal a pullback, it does not always lead to a significant drop. Sometimes, it results in a minor slowdown, like the current resistance around the $2.50 mark. With XRP nearing a key resistance point and flashing this warning sign, it’s not the best time to open new long positions. In fact, it could be a good idea to take some profits from existing positions for now. Support and Resistance Levels The price is also encountering resistance at $2.70 and $2.63. Pivot points show additional resistance at $2.58 and $2.53, with some stalling observed in the 3-10 day moving average crossover and raw stochastic levels at 80% and 70%. The price crossed the 18-day moving average at $2.41, and the 38.2% retracement from the 4-week high stands at $2.41. Additional support is found at $2.40 (first support point) and $2.35 (second support point), with a 50% retracement from the 4-week high/low at $2.31. The 9-day moving average also stalled at $2.33. Further support levels appear at $2.27 and $2.19, where the price crosses the 9-day moving average.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

(COIN) will soon release its much-anticipated Q4 report. However, even before that, speculation has begun about the possible impact of this earnings report on the Coinbase stock price, as the company’s performance could significantly affect the prices. Coinbase expert CBduck has also presented some interesting insights, claiming that the COIN price could hit $400. Coinbase is one of the biggest crypto exchanges , which is gaining massive adoption worldwide. Its adoption and growth/ earnings are key factors determining the stock prices. So, let’s discuss how the Coinbase earnings could impact COIN stock price. Coinbase Stock Price Looks Promising, $400 Next Target? After a long downtrend, the Coinbase stock price chart has begun following an uptrend thanks to the upcoming Coinbase earnings announcement. As the Q4 earnings report is due, bullish sentiments have formed for COIN stock performance. More importantly, the charts show the COIN forming the famous cup and handle formation, a highly bullish price pattern. The COIN stock price currently sits around $270 and has surged nearly 5%, pulling itself out of the long consolidation phase. A breakout above the trendline could confirm the upward momentum, especially if the high trading volume accompanied the price momentum. With that, a Coinbase expert, CBduck.base.eth’s stock prediction , says the COIN stock price could hit $400. Although the Coinbase stock is showcasing a bullish trend, investors should monitor further price actions and macroeconomic events to analyze the growth potential clearly. Coinbase Earnings Forecasts Coinbase has significant positive performance in the Q4 projection, where analysts anticipate the Q4 revenue is projected to be $2.18 billion, a 128.5% increase from the same quarter in 2023. The CBDuck projected EPS (Earnings Per Share) is $6.07, up 432% year-over-year. Interestingly, these numbers are much higher than Wallet Street’s expectation, as that comes at $1.585B in revenue and only $1.13 EPS. CBDuck eventually claims that the Coinbase stock price is undervalued. He expects it to generate $6.5M in revenue and around $12 EPS in 2024. So Coinbase $COIN 4Q projection is completed. Have fun! $2.18B Rev 128.5% increase from 4Q23 $6.07 EPS 432% increase from 4Q23 Wall Street expecting $1.585B Rev and $1.13 EPS We beat by 37.5% and 437% respectively.

This stock price rally will likely be fueled by strong technical indicators, i.e., cup and handle pattern formation. Additionally, analysts like CBDuck anticipate that the crypto platform will outperform most expectations. He says it can achieve a $2.18B revenue and $6.07 EPS, much higher than Wall Street expectations. However, significant factors could become a barrier between the COIN price rally to $400, so careful planning is needed. Interestingly, further clarity is awaited, especially as the base developers are considering launching COIN on the Ethereum L2 .

With the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance soaring to $80.2 billion, nearly doubling from last year’s $39 billion, the ecosystem’s momentum is undeniable. However, this rapid expansion has brought new complexities, making it harder for users to move assets between chains and for projects to attract audiences beyond their native ecosystems. Fragmented liquidity, convoluted asset transfers, and integration challenges for developers are pressing issues. Here’s how LI.FI simplifies the DeFi landscape by addressing these pain points. The Challenges of Fragmented DeFi As DeFi evolves, four primary challenges hinder the ecosystem’s progress: 1. Scattered Liquidity Across Chains The proliferation of blockchain networks has distributed liquidity across multiple ecosystems, leading to inefficiencies like higher slippage and suboptimal trading conditions. Navigating this fragmented landscape often requires manual processes to connect to various liquidity sources, creating friction for users and developers. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI aggregates liquidity from 30+ blockchains, 18+ bridges, and 38+ decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DEX aggregators. By providing a unified platform, LI.FI ensures users and developers can access the best rates and deepest liquidity without needing multiple integrations. This results in better prices, reduced slippage, and smoother transactions. 2. Complex User Experiences in Multi-Chain Interactions For users, swapping, bridging, or transferring assets across chains can be a tedious process. With multiple steps and tools required, this complexity often discourages full participation in DeFi. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI’s Zaps streamline multi-step processes like swapping, bridging, and staking into single, seamless actions. By automating the complexities, users can perform cross-chain transactions through a single API call, ensuring a simplified and intuitive experience. This eliminates the need to understand the intricate processes happening behind the scenes. 3. Developer Hurdles in Multi-Chain Integration Developers face significant challenges when incorporating multi-chain features into their applications. Integrating multiple bridges, liquidity sources, and protocols is time-intensive and increases maintenance demands, delaying innovation. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI crypto offers flexible integration tools tailored to different development needs: APIs and SDKs: For developers seeking full customization, LI.FI provides APIs and SDKs to build cross-chain swaps, bridges, and liquidity solutions. These tools ensure optimal routing, efficient gas fee management, and minimized slippage. Widgets: For rapid deployment, LI.FI’s plug-and-play widgets allow developers to instantly integrate multi-chain capabilities with minimal effort. This flexibility empowers developers to choose the best solution for their specific use cases, saving time and reducing costs. 4. Lack of Gas Tokens on Destination Chains A frequent issue in cross-chain transactions is the absence of gas tokens on the destination chain, which can leave users stranded without the resources to complete their transactions. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI addresses this with its gas refuel feature, ensuring users automatically have the required gas tokens for their destination chain. By eliminating the need to manually acquire gas tokens, LI.FI significantly reduces transaction failures and streamlines the user journey. Redefining DeFi Simplicity LI.FI’s comprehensive approach to solving DeFi fragmentation unlocks new opportunities for both developers and users: Developers can focus on building innovative applications rather than grappling with integration complexities. Users enjoy a frictionless experience, empowering them to engage more deeply with the DeFi ecosystem. By aggregating liquidity, simplifying multi-chain transactions, and providing developer-friendly tools, LI.FI is paving the way for a more cohesive and accessible decentralized finance landscape. Conclusion DeFi’s potential to revolutionize finance is immense, but its current fragmentation presents significant obstacles. LI.FI bridges these gaps, creating a unified, user-friendly experience that benefits all stakeholders. As DeFi continues to expand, platforms like LI.FI are essential for fostering growth, innovation, and accessibility. Whether you’re a developer building the next big application or a user exploring decentralized finance, LI.FI makes the journey smoother and more efficient. Take the next step with LI.FI and embrace the future of seamless DeFi interactions.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 04:38:57

Traditionally, the top digital assets, like Dogecoin, are subject to market analysis and price predictions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details Galaxy Digital, a leading blockchain company, has joined the conversations and offers its price prediction for Dogecoin, the market’s leading meme coin. According to the Galaxy Digital team, Dogecoin will finally breach $1 this year and top a $100 billion market cap. In its Crypto Predictions Report, the team expects that Dogecoin’s potential performance and market cap may be affected by the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) operations, which they expect to call for cuts, impacting Dogecoin’s market capitalization. Dogecoin On Track To Hit $1 Soon? As part of this year’s wrap-up, Galaxy Digital has published its predictions for top digital assets and the industry in general. In a report published on its official website on December 31st, the company offers its team’s take on Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and meme coins like Dogecoin. According to an opinion by Alex Thorn of the Galaxy Digital team, they see the world’s top meme coin finally hitting the $1 mark and its market cap finally reaching $100 billion. The target of $100 billion as a market cap is surprising since no other meme coins have achieved this feat. In 2021, Dogecoin surged in price and, for a moment, hit $98.7 billion, but its price immediately retreated. What To Expect From Dogecoin, According To Galaxy Digital If Dogecoin’s market cap finally reaches the $100 billion valuation, the token’s price will have hit $0.678, still below its all-time high of $0.739. If Dogecoin’s price surges to $0.678 to finally hit the $100 billion mark, it means that the price will have jumped by 87%. However, the Galaxy Digital team believes that $0.678 isn’t the price peak for Dogecoin this year. According to their estimates, Dogecoin will finally surpass its current all-time high and top $1. If this scenario happens, Dogecoin’s market cap will be $147.47 billion, an increase of 176% from its current valuation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Recovery In Sight: Strong Support Hints At Bullish 2025 Galaxy Digital Team Also Offers Predictions For BTC, ETH In the same report, the Galaxy Digital team also offered their insights and price predictions for other digital assets. According to Thorn, Bitcoin will trade past $150k during the year’s first half and may test $185k by the last quarter. Thorn adds that the top digital asset will get support from increasing institutional adoption. The team expects Ethereum to trade over $5,500, adding that the second-best blockchain will benefit from favorable regulatory conditions for staking and DeFi. Ethereum will also benefit from the growing number of companies that will test their Layer 2 networks using Ethereum’s technology.

The start of the year has been impressive for ADA, as it surged through the $0.9 level after staying calm for over a week. That brought a halt in the four-week correction, and as we can see on the price chart, the bulls are slowly stepping back in their actions. Though the latest surge in volatility has yet to confirm with a break. While anticipating, the $1.3 level is an important resistance to watch on the way up. A successful break above it should trigger a massive rally. The early drop in Bitcoin’s price today was a bit worrisome as most altcoins currently paint minor loss, but ADA defied the odds as it kept rising Looking at the setup, the price remains strong on a daily scale. If ADA loses grip above $1, the price may pull back to the $0.9 level before regaining strength. A continuous breakdown from there could cause serious panic selling in the short-term. As of now, the bears are off the market. If they step back to resume correction, ADA may plummet into the $0.52 range before locating a threshold for a rebound. But currently, the bulls are taking charge. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Moving higher, ADA may encounter resistance at the $1.18 level before reclaiming the $1.32 high, where it initiated drops last month. Crossing over this high could stir a surge to the $1.5 level in no time. A sudden drop from the current trading level could send us back to the $0.9 support. Failure to bounce back may result in a dip to $0.765. The lower level to watch for drops is $0.69.

It appeared to have finished correction while the bounce indicates signs of bullish. Ending a month’s correction at the $0.32 level earlier this week, XLM mounted support above the mentioned level and the price bounced back. At first, buying pressure was low but altcoin recovery later became strong daily as the market started the new year on a bullish note. Though XLM was not left behind in the move as it saw an interesting 10% increase since yesterday. From a technical standpoint, the bulls are back in the market and without any doubt, we can anticipate a bigger price movement in the next few days. However, the $0.50 level might pose a little threat on the way up. A successful breakout of this high should signal a bigger upward movement and at the same time validate more growth on a daily scale. Looking at the price actions, there’s currently no room for a drop. However, if the bears show up again, we may see a slight reduction before rising back. But as it stands, the bulls appear to have the upper hand. For this reason, bigger growth should be expected in the next few days. XLM’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential obstacle for the bulls right now is a minor $0.51 resistance, followed by $0.63. If the price breaks higher, the next resistance level may surface around $7 in the near term. A drop from the current trading level could allow a retest at $0.414.

This puts the asset on the top-gainer spot, leading the daily altcoins recovery. SUI’s overall market structure remains bullish on the daily timeframe following a higher high and higher low formation in the past months. But during the mid-December crash, it took a short break in buying and pulled back to crucial rising trendline, which has been serving as support since August. Though the drop was not much compared to other large cap altcoins that corrected by over 50%. Respecting this support line, the price bounced back this week and broke higher following an impressive gain in the 24 hours. The latest breakout indicates a fresh buying phase, and as we can see on the daily chart, the bulls are set to claim more highs from a technical perspective. The only condition for bearish right now lies in a rejection of the latest move, which could bring a little slowdown in the bullish move. Looking back from where the price started to pick up in August 2024, SUI is up by over 10x ever since. More growth should be expected! SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview There is no major resistance for SUI at the moment. The potential level to consider for a test is $6. Higher levels to watch above it are $7 and $8. Aside from the ascending trendline that provided support, the $4 level is a crucial horizontal support to watch for a drop. If the price dips below it, the lower level to keep in mind is $2.973, followed by $2.37.

A successful breakup could set the asset for another major rally. The last quarter of 2024 saw Dogecoin through its highest buying period in two years as it rallied 3x to a peak of $0.48 in December in early. But it later ended the year in a correction mode after making a double-top. Following a quick recovery from the $0.263 level, the volatility dropped and the price traded sideways for almost a week before initiating a buy in the mid-week. This led to a surge and it reclaimed a three-week high. Staging a new rally on the daily chart, Doge’s bulls are back in actions but the $0.4 level has been posing threat over the past hours. Pushing through it could bring us back to the recent peak with a potential surge. If the bulls fail to push higher, we may see a slight pullback to the $0.35 level before rising back. An increase in this volume should set the price up for a strong surge in volatility. Currently, the daily volume indicator is still in a downward range. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The latest buying is aimed at retaking the previously lost $0.48 peak. Breaking above it could result in a serious rally to $0.6 and $0.75 in the near future. If Doge drops below the holding $0.365 support, it may pulled back into the $0.31 level for a rebound. While the ongoing surge is supported by the $0.262 level, a drop below it could plummet the price to $0.22 and even $0.18.

According to CoinMarketCap , Tron recorded over 130% growth in value within 2024, its highest year-to-year increase so far. In the process, the token reached an all-time price value of $0.44 on Dec 4th. Despite seeing a significant retracement in bullish momentum, Tron’s price has maintained a positive growth trajectory. Its value increased 12% in the last month, which flipped Bitcoin in percentage growth within the same timeframe. While trading at $0.25, Tron could lay claim on the $1 price target in Q1 if it can establish support above the $0.40 mark before the end of January. At the current trajectory, achieving that support level is a strong possibility. Moreover, the TON blockchain has witnessed a recent surge in activity, exceeding 20 million transactions . With over 2.5 million active addresses recorded in mid-December and an impressive 52.7 million transactions processed in the same timeframe, the Tron coin is one of the altcoins to watch in 2025. Analysts Bullish on Cardano’s Imminent Breakout After more than 27% decline in price value for Cardano in the past 30 days, the positive sentiment surrounding the token is inevitably fading. However, several notable analysts are confident that the Cardano token is on the verge of a bullish breakout. TheMoonCarl on X set a bullish target for Cardano at $1.77, noting that the token’s bullish rally is imminent. Another analyst, Ali_Charts , reported a buy signal for Cardano crypto stemming from his TD sequential indicator analysis. The Cardano price chart from CoinMarketCap also points toward the start of an uptrend, given the token’s 10% price increase within the last 7 days and the rising Cardano trading volume . A rally continuation will see the ADA token rise beyond the $1 mark toward a possible target of $1.77. This puts Cardano among the top altcoins on investors’ watchlists. Increased Momentum for Lunex Network (LNEX) as Project Targets 100x Value Growth The Lunex Network (LNEX) project is growing into a massive presale movement as thousands of investors join the presale ahead of potential high-end ROIs. So far, over 2.4 billion LNEX tokens have been sold in presale, and early investors have already recorded over 333% ROI from the token. Lunex Network’s presale trajectory has set it on the path toward becoming the next blue-chip DeFi project. Thanks to its unique utility and contribution to a better DeFi ecosystem , the momentum and high-growth potential could see Lunex Network record 100x in Q1. For context, Lunex Network is a web3 multi-chain bridge protocol that will facilitate cross-chain transactions while offering secure, fast, and reliable crypto transactions. With Lunex Network, members can trade over 50,000 crypto pairs using the project’s DEX exchange , unlocking a series of trading opportunities that will increase investors’ chances of making profits. Businesses can also utilize the non-custodial B2B payment gateway to receive payments from customers and convert them to fiat. These use cases and high growth potential make the LNEX native token a top crypto coin to invest in now that it is still in the presale phase. LNEX offers a low price entry advantage at $0.0052, allowing investors to accumulate the DeFi coin without breaking the bank. As smart investors know, early investment in high-potential projects is where significant gains are made. Final Verdict: Top Investment Option in 2025 Lunex Network stands out as a viable crypto investment alternative given its early entry advantage, low price value, and exponential growth potential. While Tron and Cardano harbor fair growth potential, Lunex Network represents a gem poised for high-end growth in 2025.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 05:33:00

Let’s examine their growth potential, features, and the factors driving their success. IntelMarkets: Revolutionizing Trading with Real-World Utility and Unmatched Opportunities IntelMarkets is raising the bar in crypto trading, offering practical solutions. The platform prioritizes real-world utility, price stability, and advanced trading capabilities to accommodate traders at any level. The dual-chain functionality of IntelMarkets, operating on Ethereum and Solana, ensures flexibility and speed. Ethereum’s expansive ecosystem connects to DeFi applications, while Solana delivers unmatched scalability and low costs. Traders can pick the blockchain that best supports their strategy, ensuring optimal efficiency. This approach ensures stable prices even in volatile markets, making INTL a standout among rivals. Enhanced liquidity is another hallmark of IntelMarkets, enabling easy transactions and quick access to capital. Whether it’s trading major asset pairs or niche tokens, the platform’s diverse offerings empower users to explore a wide array of opportunities. With IntelMarkets’ 1000x leverage, traders can amplify their positions, unlocking the potential to turn $200 into $2,000. Such leverage allows even small movements in the market to yield significant results. By blending innovation with user-centric features, IntelMarkets positions itself as a leader in the realm of promising altcoins. This is fueling intense demand in its ongoing presale which has raised over $5.2 million. Dogecoin’s Real-World Adoption Could Transform $200 into $2,000 Elon Musk has reignited interest in Dogecoin by supporting the idea of the Texas Institute of Technology and Science (TITS). Initially shared by Katherine Boyle, a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, this proposal received Musk’s endorsement on the X platform. Musk hinted at Dogecoin potentially being used for tuition payments, which aligns with his previous vision of integrating DOGE into real-world systems. This development could solidify Dogecoin’s position among promising altcoins. Musk’s humor aside, the possibility of a university accepting DOGE presents a groundbreaking use case. Such moves strengthen Dogecoin’s utility and adoption, boosting its potential for long-term growth. Despite recent turbulence in December 2024, during which its price dropped from $0.46 to $0.28, DOGE demonstrated resilience by stabilizing at $0.30. If its real-world applications expand, Dogecoin might see a surge in demand. For investors, the opportunity to turn $200 into $2,000 with Dogecoin no longer seems far-fetched. PENGU’s Meteoric Rise: $2.27 Billion Market Cap and Growing The Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) token has taken the Solana blockchain by storm, captivating the market. Since its launch in December 2024, PENGU’s market capitalization has surged reaching $2.27 billion. This growth has made PENGU the 56th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Despite crypto’s inherent volatility, PENGU has steadily built a strong holder base. Its price has grown from $0.0049 to $0.0365, fueled by major exchange listings on Binance and OKX. These partnerships, alongside MoonPay’s support, have boosted PENGU’s liquidity and accessibility. Forecasts suggest PENGU could reach $0.139 by 2025, increasing its allure. This growth trajectory solidifies PENGU’s position as one of the promising altcoins in the market. This makes the chances of turning $200 into $2,000 with PENGU appear increasingly plausible. INTL, DOGE, and PENGU: Unlock Your $200 Potential with These Promising Altcoins IntelMarkets, Dogecoin, and PENGU are leading the charge in reshaping the crypto landscape for 2025. IntelMarkets essentially stands out with its dual-chain architecture, solving real-world trading challenges while offering significant profit potential. Currently, in Stage 8 of its public presale, INTL is at $0.07. With the token’s growing momentum backed by its innovative platform, experts predict a 100x increase post-launch, further emphasizing INTL’s profit potential.

Furthermore, this accumulation suggests that whales are positioning themselves for 2025, ensuring they don’t miss out on any substantial upside momentum. However, it has been observed that this notable acquisition has led to a 22% price rally during the same period and is continuing to drive upward momentum. LINK Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, LINK appears to be consolidating within a tight range between $23 and $24 and is poised for a breakout. Since the beginning of 2025, LINK has consolidated twice on the four-hour time frame before experiencing upward momentum. Source: Trading View Experts and analysts speculate a similar upside rally to what was observed in the past four days.

38558269,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=27716,1736058055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,MicroStrategy Eyes $2 Billion Raise for More Bitcoin Purchases,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/microstrategy-eyes-2-billion-raise-for-more-bitcoin-purchases/,"MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, plans to raise $2 billion through a perpetual preferred stock offering to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions, expanding its ambitious “21/21” strategy. The offering could involve converting MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, paying cash dividends, redeeming shares, or a combination of these, the company explained in a Jan. 3 statement. This move is separate from MicroStrategy’s ongoing effort to raise $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income instruments, a strategy it has executed recently through senior convertible notes and debt to fuel its Bitcoin purchases. The perpetual preferred stock offering aims to bolster the company’s balance sheet and finance more Bitcoin acquisitions. It is expected to take place this quarter, although MicroStrategy emphasized, “The decision whether to proceed with and consummate the Offering is in MicroStrategy’s sole discretion and is subject to market and other conditions. MicroStrategy may choose not to proceed with or consummate the Offering at all.” Unlike class A common stock, the perpetual preferred stock is “senior,” giving holders priority in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. MicroStrategy’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy currently owns 446,400 Bitcoin worth $43.9 billion, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. In 2024, the firm purchased 257,250 Bitcoin, marking its largest annual acquisition to date. The company’s Bitcoin has been acquired at an average price of $62,500, leaving it up 57.2% on its investment. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the architect of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, has been pivotal in promoting corporate Bitcoin adoption globally. The strategy has significantly boosted MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), which rose 13.2% on Jan. 3 to $339.6, representing a 438% increase compared to last year. Following the announcement of the perpetual preferred stock offering, MSTR shares fell slightly by 0.19% in after-hours trading.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 06:20:55
38558379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671031,1736058345,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/38558379.jpeg,Top 5 Cryptos to Buy In Early 2025 for Maximum Gains,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/top-5-cryptos-to-buy-in-early-2025-for-maximum-gains/,"2025 is all set to be an exciting year for crypto. With Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential elections and promising to support cryptocurrency and rally behind the increasing interest of retail investors, this could be one of the most transformative years for the industry ever. Great transformations often bring mind-boggling rewards, so now is undoubtedly a great time to invest in crypto tokens that might just turn out to be multi-baggers of monumental proportions. The cream of the crop, as per our analysis and market sentiments, is $WEPE, which recently hit a record-breaking presale revenue of $40 million. Keep reading to find out four other tokens that are equally promising and worth investing in 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is one of the most trending meme coins at the moment. Its presale started in November 2024 and has so far raised more than $40 million. The $WEPE presale is expected to end in February, so there’s still plenty of time for its presale collection to reach record-breaking heights. The biggest reason behind such tremendous performance is the uniqueness of the project. It provides community members with unique insights into the market so that they can make better decisions. It’s important to note that until now, retail investors have had a hard time making big in the crypto space because they were mostly controlled by “crypto whales.” However, $WEPE has broken down barriers and made it easier for smaller investors to access the same information and opportunities as the big shots. $WEPE is currently available for purchase at $0.00036641 per coin – and future annual yields are currently estimated to be just over 150%. ChatGPT’s predictions for $WEPE are even more ambitious. It says that returns could vary between 10x and 100x. Well, that’s a huge range, and it’s too soon to know whether $WEPE can be the next 100x coin. However, one thing’s almost certain: you have a winner at hand. With the price increasing every few days, there’s no time like the present to hop in. 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) $MEMEX represents the Meme Index, an interesting new project that lets you invest in a diverse basket of crypto tokens. It works a lot like mutual funds. Instead of spending all your money on one token, you get a basket of tokens so that even if one token performs poorly, you still have a chance of turning a profit with the cumulative positive results of other tokens. Currently, there are four indices (baskets) to choose from: the Titan Index, the Moonshot Index, the Midcap Index, and the Frenzy Index. Each of these offers a unique advantage over the others, and you can choose one as per your goals and preferences. For instance, if you want to be able to aim for high rewards, the Frenzy Index might be for you. However, do note that it also comes with high risk. Check out how Meme Index sorts meme coins . Coming back to the token, it went into presale in early December 2024. However, unlike $SOLX or $WEPE, $MEMEX’s presale has been a little slow, but we’re expecting better performance as the year progresses. Currently, the token is priced at $0.0149234, but experts say it can hit $0.0172 by the final quarter of the year. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) $SOLX is also one of the hottest tokens available right now. It represents Soldex, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Solana blockchain that allows investors to make direct transactions, without any middlemen. The token is currently in presale and has already raised over $8.3 million. At the time of writing, the token is priced at $0.00159, but experts are predicting that by the end of 2025, the prices might jump to $0.00879, which is a staggering 550% increase from its current value. Unlike some of its competitors that are expected to lose value after this year, Solaxy will likely keep growing well into 2026, too, and hopefully till 2030 before finally coming to halt at approximately $0.0340. Some experts also believe that $SOLX has the potential to be the next 100x token. This is primarily because of two reasons. First, the platform is offering investors staking rewards, which means they can earn passive income from their investment. This is quite an incentive for them to not sell the token immediately after listing. Secondly, SOLX will be used in transactions on the Solaxy Layer 2. So, traders who are planning to use the platform will hold onto their SOLX tokens instead of selling them. These two factors will not only prevent the price of the token from dropping but might also encourage steady growth. 4. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) PENGU isn’t just any other meme coin. It’s the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, which consists of over 8,888 unique cartoons of adorable penguins. For those unaware, the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection is an Ethereum project that was launched in July 2021 and quickly grew into one of the biggest NFT projects in the industry. Coming back to PENGU, it was launched on the Solana blockchain and soon managed to overtake BONK (the former largest meme coin on Solana). PENGU has allowed Pudgy Penguins to expand beyond its NFT origins and establish itself in the web3 ecosystem. PENGU launched on December 17 for $0.003375. After hitting a record high of $0.0684, it quickly hit a record low of $0.0114. However, after the first couple of days of roller coaster action, it has nicely settled on a steady upward curve and is currently priced at $0.041. For the rest of the year, the token is expected to maintain an average price of $0.045 with the maximum potential of reaching around $0.068. 5. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) Fartcoin is a new meme token created on the Solana blockchain on October 18, 2024. It allows users to claim free tokens by submitting fart jokes. Initially after its launch, investors didn’t think it had much potential. It all started out as a joke. Basically, it was a suggestion by the Truth Terminal crypto AI chatbot to create a token based on Elon Musk’s alleged amusement with fart jokes. Naturally, no one had any expectations from this token. However, soon the token defied all predictions and went viral, even soaring past Dogecoin. Today, its global capital stands at more than $1.5 billion. It’s hard to say what exactly contributed to Fartcoin’s massive growth. Perhaps the absurdity of the whole project is what made it unique. Plus, there’s a “Gas Fee” feature that emits a fart sound every time a transaction is made, which, again, is quite amusing. Regardless of its start, though, Fartcoin is now expected to keep growing. Currently priced at $1.34, experts suggest it’ll hit its peak in July 2025, when it’ll be priced around $1.8165801. Bottom Line All the tokens on the list have the potential to churn out a handsome return on your investment, but as you can clearly see, the potential for $WEPE and $SOLX is much bigger. Regardless of the token(s) you choose, we recommend doing your own research, which will give you the required confidence in your investment. Needless to say, cryptos are highly volatile, and the picture that we have right now might not be the same a few days, let alone weeks, down the line.",Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-05 06:25:45

Deaton shared his views after Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto, provided bullish predictions for several cryptocurrencies while excluding XRP from his analysis. In a recent interview, Chung predicted that Bitcoin could reach $210,000, Solana might climb to $1,000, and Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin could increase from 0.03 to 0.05 by the end of 2025. However, XRP’s absence from his forecasts raised questions, especially considering the token’s notable achievements in recent months. Deaton Highlights the Token’s Strong Performance Reacting to the omission, Deaton emphasized XRP’s growing significance in the cryptocurrency market. He noted that the asset is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins. He also pointed out that the token closed 2024 with significant gains, building optimism for its future performance. Deaton referenced an article from Barron’s that highlighted the token’s remarkable rally last year. According to the report, the token’s price surged from $0.55 on November 5 to $2.86 by December 3, marking a substantial increase. Diverse Predictions for Future Performance Several industry leaders have shared their predictions for XRP in 2025, with varying levels of optimism. Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BinPay, suggested that the token could trade between $5 and $7 in the early part of the year, citing Ripple’s technological developments and the favorable market conditions following the U.S. presidential election. Hani Abuagla, a crypto analyst at XTB, provided a broader forecast, suggesting that the token’s price could range from a conservative $5 to an ambitious $100. Abuagla believes regulatory developments, particularly under a potential Trump administration, could help shape the token’s future. Ryan Lee, a researcher at Bitget, offered a balanced outlook. He predicted that XRP could trade within an average range of $1.8 to $8.4. He also expressed optimism that the token might surpass $10 if favorable conditions persist throughout the year.

While some analysts remain optimistic about the asset’s potential, others argue that its recent rally to $2.86 in December may have marked a peak. Deaton refrained from offering his forecast but underscored the importance of the token’s current market performance. Currently trading at $2.39, the asset reflects a 3.76% increase over the past 24 hours. It has solidified its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a market value of $137.26 billion. The token’s absence from Presto’s predictions has reignited discussions about its potential in the cryptocurrency market. While forecasts vary, the token’s strong 2024 performance has left many investors and analysts optimistic about what lies ahead in 2025.

Despite this price gain, the Ethereum Spot ETFs recorded a net weekly outflow of $38.20 million, ending a five-week positive streak. Interestingly, the underperformance coincided with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs managing a return to the green track as they recorded their lowest positive inflows in the last five months. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs Witness Unbroken 16-Day Inflow Streak: New ETH ATH Soon? Ethereum Spot ETFs Open 2025 On Negative Note Following the US elections in November, the Ethereum Spot ETFs alongside other crypto-related markets registered a massive level of investor interest tied to the expectations of a pro-crypto government led by President-elect Donald Trump. Despite a significant wide-scale crypto price correction in which ETH price dropped by 23%, interest in the Ethereum Spot ETFs remained strong with an estimated $2.11 billion recorded in net inflows over the month. However, data from SoSoValue shows these Ethereum ETFs have now experienced a net outflow of 38.20 million in the first trading week of 2025, indicating a change in US institutional investors’ sentiments. Bitwise’s ETHE accounted for the largest outflows valued at $56.11 million, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE, which recorded around $51.62 million in withdrawals. Franklin Tempton’s EZET also registered outflows to the tune of $3.11 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FETH experienced the largest inflows in the past week with investments of $38.42 million as BlackRock’s ETHA emerged second with $33.88 million in new deposits. Grayscale’s ETH witnessed modest inflows of 1.10 million as 21 Shares’ CETH and VanEck’s ETHV saw no market flows at all. At press time, BlackRock’s ETHA remains the most attractive Ethereum Spot ETF with total cumulative inflows of $3.56 billion. However, Grayscale’s ETHE maintains market dominance with net assets of $5.07 billion. Despite the recent weekly net outflows, the Ethereum Spot ETFs have experienced remarkable growth in the past few months resulting in a current total net assets of $13.03 billion representing 3% of the Ethereum market cap.

Total net assets in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market is now valued at $111.46 billion with the BlackRock’s IBIT asserting a 48.68% market dominance.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 06:53:00

This transaction drew attention in the crypto community due to its significance. SHIB Market Struggled in December December has proven challenging for Shiba Inu, with the token recording a 25% decline over the month. Despite a recent increase, SHIB has struggled to recover from prolonged downward pressure. While there’s a 6.4% increase in the past 7 days, a two-week analysis shows a 7.7% decline, reflecting ongoing volatility. These market challenges have coincided with heightened whale activity and substantial outflows from centralized exchanges like Binance. Dormant Whale Reactivates with Major Withdrawal Blockchain data from Lookonchain identified the reactivation of a Shiba Inu whale wallet. The wallet withdrew 220 billion SHIB from Binance after five months of dormancy. A whale withdrew 220B $SHIB ($4.63M) from #Binance 2 hours ago after being dormant for 5 months. https://t.co/vHHs25C754 pic.twitter.com/r0sFEXMyEC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 1, 2025 Previous transactions tied to the same wallet include notable inflows of 65.28 billion and 64.52 billion SHIB, recorded 146 and 151 days ago, respectively. These earlier inflows were followed by minor outgoing transactions, making the recent withdrawal the largest activity from this address. Distribution Patterns Raise Concerns Further insights from IntoTheBlock have highlighted a significant rise in outflows from large holders, reflecting a possible shift in confidence among major stakeholders. Over the past week, outflows surged by 627.85%, suggesting increased distribution of SHIB tokens by influential wallets. Monthly data indicates a 121.61% rise in large outflows, while the 90-day trend points to a consistent increase of 108.23%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The growing frequency of substantial withdrawals and redistributions may signal declining confidence in the token or strategic reallocation of funds by whales. Such outflows often contribute to heightened selling pressure, which can negatively impact token prices. Shiba Inu Community Advances Token Burn Initiatives While whale activity has raised concerns, the community has made progress in its token burn initiatives, achieving a notable milestone in 2024. Data from Shibburn reveals that 44.6 billion SHIB tokens were burned over the year, representing a value of approximately $1,014,740.75 based on current market prices. The burn efforts, executed at varying price levels, have sought to reduce the token’s circulating supply and support its long-term value. In December alone, 2.67 billion SHIB were destroyed through 143 separate transactions. This underscores the community’s consistent commitment to reducing supply despite the token’s ongoing market challenges. The recent withdrawal by a dormant whale and the sustained outflow trends from large holders highlight potential shifts in the ecosystem. While these activities raise questions about market confidence, the community’s dedication to token burns demonstrates a counterbalancing effort to stabilize and enhance the token’s long-term prospects.

Compare that to US stocks’ performance over the same time period, and the original and most secure cryptocurrency massively over-indexed for investor profits: Over the same span, the S&P 500 Index, the broad benchmark for US stocks, gained 45% . Meanwhile, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite jumped by 55% , according to data from Yahoo Finance. What makes Bitcoin’s feat in 2023 especially remarkable is that it was a landmark record year for stocks. However, key analysts among the crypto X community and in traditional finance companies are expecting a repeat of the cryptocurrency sector in 2025. Below are six key factors pouring rocket fuel on the Bitcoin economy. 1. Crashing CX Balance to Bitcoin Price Ratio Based on the simple economics of supply and demand, one of the most bullish portents of 2025 for Bitcoin is the vanishing supply of BTC on crypto exchanges. That decreases the available supply of Bitcoin for sale. The remaining supply is becoming radically more precious and thus commands a higher price. Moreover, the flight of BTC from exchanges signals the intention of owners to hold their stashes long-term. That entails sustained support for Bitcoin’s price at its current levels. The balance of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges crashed over the New Year holiday to a low unseen since Feb. 2018, according to Coinglass data. Meanwhile, BTC’s price is soaring near record highs. 2. Corporations, Governments Join Roaring ’20s The anticipated entry of the US government into the BTC race is another sure sign of massive and lasting price support to come for Bitcoin. In addition to the incoming Trump Administration, which plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a volley of publicly traded corporations are jumping into the fray. The Donald Trump Administration plans to hold onto its current stockpile of 198,000 BTC, mostly seized from criminal operations, instead of continuing to sell it off at auction. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) proposes going further and accumulating one million BTC. She’s taking its disruptive changes to global finance in the Internet era very seriously. Japanese venture capital firm MetaPlanet’s CEO said on New Year’s Eve that he expects other governments in the Asia Pacific region to follow after the US and establish national reserves. Meanwhile, several publicly traded companies, such as MetaPlanet, VA-based MicroStrategy, and CA-based Semler Scientific, are hoarding Bitcoin to bolster their finances and profit from its historic market gains. Plus, there’s the voracious demand on Wall Street for Bitcoin ETFs. 3. Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score: Screaming Bull Signal MVRV stands for market value to realized value. Z-score is a term from statistics that means the average of the differences between a set of values and their average value. This is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market cap to the total of all the BTC calculated at its average market price the last time it moved wallets. A recent article that appeared in Forbes explains why this is important: “By factoring out short-term price fluctuations, realized value offers a clearer view of Bitcoin’s “fair” long-term valuation.” In past cycles, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio flagged the market top within two weeks when the ratio reached 7. On Jan. 1, the MVRV for Bitcoin was under 3, signaling plenty of upside left. In fact, it’s strongly suggestive that Bitcoin’s price could still double from here by the end of the cycle. 4. Bitcoin Hash Rate Tops New All-Time Highs BTC hash rate charted new records through December on a steep upward historical trend line for 2025. The Bitcoin hash rate is a measure of the number of computer cycles BTC mining machines are running to secure the network and keep an accurate, up-to-date copy of the blockchain. When it rises, that’s a bullish sign for Bitcoin’s price because miners must use electricity and tie up computer cycles that could be used for something else to run the cryptocurrency’s core software. They’re doing that to get the blockchain reward for helping to maintain Bitcoin, which is paid out in new BTC. So, a rising hash rate indicates optimism about a rising BTC price going forward from some of the most well-informed stakeholders in the entire enterprise. 5. Macro Rate Cuts and US Federal Deficit Here’s your real Trump bump for crypto assets. On top of an administration that will be friendly to the blockchain sector, Trump’s plans for the federal government over his next term will melt up the federal budget deficit. Fiscal year 2024 was the third largest deficit in history at $1.833 trillion. However, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump’s plans will do this four more times each year he’s in office. That macro tide is certain to boost inflation across the economy and most dramatically in financial markets like the NYSE, NASDAQ, and Bitcoin exchange markets. 6. Urgent Bitcoin Chart Technical Indicator Bitcoin’s price appeared to be already breaking out of a classic 15-day bullish falling wedge pattern with declining volume on Dec. 31, according to data compiled by CoinGecko. Traders may have to act fast to take this ride up. The year began with a rally from under $93,000 to over $97,000.

What does this mean for XRP’s prices, given the fact that the asset is already up by around 20% in 2025? The end of the year and the beginning of the new one are typically sluggish days for the cryptocurrency markets as traders tend to stay away and spend their time with other activities. This was evident during the past few weeks as well, as the trading volumes for almost all digital assets slumped, including XRP’s, on December 31. However, the landscape changed in a different direction on the next day. Ali Martinez outlined a massive milestone for XRP, showing that the transaction volume skyrocketed to over $7 billion on January 1. This was the highest level in at least a month, as the days prior and after that date saw a lot less activity. $XRP recently experienced a spike in transaction volume, surpassing $7 billion! pic.twitter.com/Mm82HzpctC — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 In terms of XRP price movements, such a development could be considered bullish if it persists. A single spike and a subsequent decline could result in immediate but brief price increases, which is actually what transpired at the start of the new year. The asset went from around $2 to $2.5 within the first few days but is down on a daily scale to $2.4. ChatGPT asserted that XRP could indeed benefit from such prolonged increases in transaction volumes but under certain conditions. These include rising demand and utility for the underlying token, the overall market sentiment, and XRP’s correlation with the broader market trends. However, the AI chatbot warned that such high transaction volumes “might temporarily inflate the price, but if driven by speculation alone, the price might correct sharply” in what is known as ‘pump-and-dump’ risks.

Expert Analyst Explains Why The inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump on January 20 is seen as a potential catalyst for cryptocurrency prices. Expectations from the new administration include more favorable cryptocurrency regulations and improved economic policies in the United States. However, Bitfinex analysts warned that the inauguration may not trigger a sudden price rally for Bitcoin: “We expect the new US administration to provide greater clarity on crypto policy, but we do not see the inauguration itself as a significant price event. On the contrary, it could pave the way for cryptocurrencies to face fewer obstacles in the United States going forward.” *This is not investment advice.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/raoul-pal-says-theyll-come-in-and-buy-xrp-anyway-heres-why/,"Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and prominent investment strategist, recently discussed XRP’s enduring popularity among general investors. Despite its association with a high-profile legal battle involving Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the asset remains one of the leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Pal offered insights into why the token continues to attract attention, even as new trends emerge in the crypto industry. I think you are midcurve in over thinking of this! Fartcoin funny. Holds attention. Ai16z not interesting to normies. They'll come in an buy XRP anyway… — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) January 2, 2025 Accessibility for New Investors In a recent post on X, Pal highlighted XRP’s broad appeal, especially for individuals new to the cryptocurrency market. According to him, the simplicity and familiarity of XRP make it a favored option for everyday investors compared to other complex or niche crypto projects. He contrasted this trend with the rise of AI agents in the crypto ecosystem. AI agents, which utilize artificial intelligence to perform autonomous blockchain transactions, have gained traction due to their potential applications in portfolio management and on-chain activities. However, Pal dismissed the enthusiasm around these technologies as a passing trend fueled by high-risk investors looking for excitement. In his post, he remarked that while these advancements attract attention from some market participants, the average individual is more likely to invest in XRP, given its reputation as a straightforward entry point into the crypto space. What Makes XRP Stand Out? Although Pal did not elaborate on the specifics, the asset’s consistent appeal to general investors can be attributed to several factors. These include its low transaction fees, straightforward use cases, and association with Ripple—a well-established company recognized for its expertise in cross-border payment solutions. These qualities position the token as a user-friendly option, especially for those seeking less complexity in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Moreover, XRP has cultivated a strong and loyal community over the years. This “cult-like” following, as Pal described in a 2024 video, continues to play a significant role in sustaining the asset’s relevance. The reputation Ripple has built, combined with the token’s ease of use, reinforces its position as a gateway cryptocurrency for newcomers. Interestingly, Pal’s current acknowledgment of XRP’s appeal contrasts with his earlier skepticism. In mid-2024, he urged investors to move away from the asset, suggesting that it lacked relevance in comparison to emerging projects that followed market trends. However, he revised his stance as the digital asset demonstrated impressive growth later that year. Between November and December 2024, the token surged by 475%, significantly outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market. The rally that followed Donald Trump’s reelection, sparked optimism regarding potential regulatory clarity under the incoming administration. This development contrasted sharply with the legal challenge s XRP faced under the SEC, which had previously sought to classify it as a security. Token’s Position Amidst Shifting Trends While new narratives, such as the rise of AI agents, continue to shape the crypto landscape, Pal’s remarks underscore the token’s enduring appeal among average investors. Its ease of use, reliability, and association with Ripple make it a consistent choice for those entering the market. Although the ongoing evolution of blockchain technology introduces new investment opportunities, the token’s ability to maintain its relevance speaks to its unique position in the industry. Pal’s acknowledgment of this dynamic offers valuable insight into how certain assets remain resilient in an environment familiar with constant change.

With the weekly close just hours away, here are the potential risks the cryptocurrency faces if it remains under this coveted level. BTC to Close Below $100K? The last couple of weeks of 2024 were quite painful for BTC as its price dumped from its latest all-time high registered on December 17 of over $108,000 to $91,300 in days. The latter came on December 30 and marked the asset’s lowest price point in over a month. However, bitcoin reacted well to this correction and now sits above $98,000. This represents a 7.5% increase since that low. On a weekly scale, BTC is up by 3.5% compared to the valuation last Sunday. Perhaps the biggest factor holding bitcoin below $100,000 now is the ‘stiff supply wall’ that appears in its current levels. This means that a lot of investors have accumulated their BTC holdings at prices between $98,000 and $100,000, which essentially turns these levels into critical resistance lines, according to Ali Martinez. #Bitcoin $BTC faces a stiff supply wall between $98,000 and $100,000 that is currently acting as resistance! pic.twitter.com/GrDNNATLgT — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 On the plus side, the same analyst outlined a highly bullish development for BTC, which occurred at the end of 2024. More than 48,000 BTC (valued at $4.7 billion at today’s prices) were withdrawn from exchanges, thus reducing the immediate sell pressure. Over 48,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have been pulled from exchanges in the past week, valued at over $4.5 billion! pic.twitter.com/V1agc0EtCe — Ali (@ali_charts) January 3, 2025 Where to Next? Martinez believes BTC might retest the 50-day moving average, which is currently at just under $97,000. Although bitcoin is currently above that level, it needs to close there, which will be “essential to signal the end of the correction and confirm bullish momentum.” #Bitcoin $BTC remains at a critical point. This might just be a retest of the 50-day MA before a potential move lower. A sustained close above the 50-day MA is essential to signal the end of the correction and confirm bullish momentum. pic.twitter.com/ppfEjfoJkc — Ali (@ali_charts) January 3, 2025 The analyst told his over 100,000 followers on X that he remains ‘cautiously bullish’ because the cryptocurrency could be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern that might lead to an even more violent decline to $78,000. In his latest post, Martinez highlighted that BTC has to close above $100,000 to invalidate this bearish setup, which is currently not the case. I’m cautiously bullish because for all we know, #Bitcoin $BTC could be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern that anticipates a correction to at least $78,000. This is why a strong close above $100,000 is crucial to invalidate this bearish setup. pic.twitter.com/2O1y3sEWgq — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 The post Bitcoin Below $100K: Key Factors Holding BTC Back and Potential Risks appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-05 07:54:06

In a January 3 post , Musk revealed plans to promote content deemed “informative” or “educational,” citing a need to reduce negativity on the platform. “Our goal is to maximize un-regretted user-seconds. Too much negativity is being pushed that technically grows user time, but not un-regretted user time.” Musk Seeks to Silence Diverse Viewpoints However, critics on X have argued that the shift risks silencing diverse viewpoints and could be used as a tool for censorship. “Mr. Musk, it’s your platform. If you want to turn it into silly cat videos and pharma-commercial people blissfully running through sunlit fields, that’s your prerogative,” one X user wrote . “We aren’t children. We don’t need to be coddled. And speaking for me, I guarantee I’ll “regret” wasting time watching stupid cat videos a LOT more than I regret “fighting” to save my country.” Hey Buddy, you OK? pic.twitter.com/TUilURfWfU — Trans(je suis Alex Cargill #PPC) (@TransSplendor) January 4, 2025 The backlash comes on the heels of Musk allegedly stripping premium features from accounts involved in a heated debate over U.S. immigration policies. The controversy began on Dec. 27, when Musk suggested reforming the immigration process to attract global talent. The proposal was met with resistance from some right-wing influencers, who argued that the U.S. should focus on reducing immigration. The online feud escalated as these influencers accused Musk of retaliatory actions, including removing monetization and premium access to their accounts. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin joined the debate , cautioning Musk to uphold free speech principles. “Respecting free speech is easy when we agree with the speech, and hard when we think it’s awful,” Buterin noted, emphasizing the long-term risks of restrictive policies. The controversy follows another high-profile clash between Musk and the Brazilian government over alleged censorship, which led to X being banned in Brazil. Germany Accuses Musk of Election Interference Last week, a German government spokesperson accused Musk of attempting to interfere with the nation’s upcoming election. According to German spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann, Musk tried to influence the outcome of the country’s upcoming national election by backing far-right group, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Musk made headlines over the weekend for endorsing the controversial political party in an opinion piece published in a German newspaper, prompting an outcry from the country’s officials. The X CEO and Tesla founder claimed that he has a right to endorse the AfD given that he operates businesses within the country, though authorities have labeled the group as suspected extremists. “After all, freedom of opinion covers the greatest nonsense,” Hoffmann claimed when addressing reporters on December 30. Musk has repeatedly backed the group on his social media platform, most recently labeling current German Chancellor Olaf Scholz a “fool.” Just over a week ago, incoming U.S. vice president JD Vance seemingly trolled pushback Musk received for his commentary supporting the AfD.

This recent bullish momentum made ADA the best-performing asset among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies in the past week. While this burst of positive price action could be linked to the improving climate of the altcoin market, it appears that the increased activity of large holders (whales) is responsible for the latest price surge. Here’s how much the ADA whales bought in recent days. Cardano Whales Purchase 40 Million ADA In 2 Days Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in a new post on the X platform that the Cardano whales have become increasingly active in the market over the last few days. This on-chain observation is based on the increase in the holdings of investors who own between 10 million and 100 million coins. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Can Break To $0.48, But This Needs To Happen First The investor cohort under review is a class of whales, which refers to entities that wield significant influence over the market due to the amount of cryptocurrencies they own. Many investors pay attention to this class of large holders, as the market often reacts to their movement. According to data from Santiment, Cardano whales acquired more than 40 million ADA tokens (worth about $42.8 million at the current market value) in 48 hours. This level of buying activity highlights the strong faith in the asset’s promise despite the sluggish market climate. As seen with the price action over the past few days, increased whale activity can have a positive impact on the price of Cardano. Hence, sustained buying activity could see the altcoin’s price to its highs of early December 2024. What Next For Cardano Price? As of this writing, the Cardano price sits just above the $1 mark, reflecting a nearly 2% decline in the past 24 hours. However, this negative performance has barely impacted the altcoin’s weekly gain, which currently stands at around 26%. In another post on X, Martinez revealed that the Cardano price is playing out like it did in the previous cycle. During the last bull cycle, the ADA token grew exponentially in less than a year, reaching the current all-time high price of $3.09. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction To $4.9: How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Drive The Next Wave The analyst believes that if the altcoin follows the recent historical pattern, a move to $4 could be imminent.

The surge marks a significant reversal following two years of declining transaction volumes since 2021, according to Pierre Rochard , vice president of research at Riot Platforms. During the 2021 bull market, Bitcoin’s transaction volume peaked at $47 trillion but plummeted sharply in the subsequent years. “The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that Bitcoin is both a store of value and a medium of exchange,” Rochard said. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bolster Bitcoin Performance Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 was bolstered by key milestones, including the approval of a U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the April 2024 halving event, and a record-breaking price of approximately $108,000. The network’s security also reached unprecedented levels. On January 3, 2024, Bitcoin’s hashrate — a measure of the computing power securing the network — hit an all-time high of 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s). While it later stabilized around 775 EH/s, the increase underscores the growing commitment of miners worldwide. The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that bitcoin is both a store-of-value and a medium-of-exchange. pic.twitter.com/NqPI8Db1We — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) January 4, 2025 Despite the geographic concentration of some mining pools, accurately determining hashrate dominance remains challenging. The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin mining means that many miners contribute anonymously or via virtual private networks (VPNs), masking their true locations. Bitcoin’s resurgence in transaction volume, alongside its growing hashrate and global adoption, reinforces its role as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. US Dominates Bitcoin Mining At the close of 2024, the United States solidified its position as a leader in Bitcoin mining, accounting for over 40% of the global hashrate — the total computing power securing the Bitcoin network. U.S.-based mining pools Foundry USA and MARA Pool played a significant role, collectively mining more than 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks. Foundry USA increased its hashrate from 157 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the beginning of the year to approximately 280 EH/s by December. Despite these advancements, China-based mining pools remain influential, controlling 55% of the global hashrate as of September 2024, according to CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju. The dominance persists despite a 2021 ban on cryptocurrency mining in China, with miners circumventing restrictions through virtual private networks (VPNs) and peer-to-peer apps that bypass the national firewall. Last month, Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain announced the expansion of its production operations to the United States, citing a strategic goal of improving supply chain efficiency. The move came amid escalating trade tensions between China and the US, highlighting the growing need for companies to adapt to geopolitical challenges. As reported, Jack Dorsey’s Block has also announced plans to ramp up investments in its Bitcoin mining initiative and self-custody Bitcoin wallet. At the time, the company said it would reallocate resources from its canceled “Web5” project, TBD, and cut investments in the music-streaming service, Tidal, to support this move.

Pseudonymous trader The Crypto Dog tells his 853,00 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the market will not regain bullish momentum until President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. The analyst believes that Trump’s inauguration on January 20th will act as a strong catalyst that sends Bitcoin and altcoins to greater heights. “The inauguration likely acts just the same as election day – it’s going to pin us down until it’s over. We’re not exactly bearish, but we’re probably not going higher until Trump is in office. Just had a bunch of people excited longing the highs, they probably get rinsed now.” Looking at historical data, The Crypto Dog notes that Bitcoin rallied in 2021 after President Joe Biden took over the White House. “You can see how we behaved Jan 2021… Downtrend until inauguration then ripped +100% afterward.” Source: The Crypto Dog/X The analyst also notes that the same behavior can be seen during the 2017 cycle. “2017 breakout happened pretty much right on inauguration.” Source: The Crypto Dog/X While the analyst says historical trends call for more consolidation, he notes that his stance will be invalidated if the S&P 500 continues to show strength. “Looks like post-election January is pretty much up only for equities. Since the [launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds] we’ve been pretty lockstep so up only makes plenty of sense.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $98,219.

Deaton made his offer in a Jan. 4 post on X , addressing President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other members of the incoming administration. “If these actions go unchallenged, it creates a dangerous precedent where regulatory bodies can quietly suppress entire industries they disfavor, stifling innovation, competition, and economic opportunity,” Deaton stated. Deaton Calls Operation Chokepoint 2.0 More Than a Crypto Issue He framed the initiative as more than a crypto issue, calling it a fight against “the erosion of institutional integrity and the unchecked power of unelected bureaucrats.” Deaton, who gained prominence through his involvement in Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, pledged to undertake the task without salary. “The American people deserve the truth a hell of a lot more than I or anyone else needs another taxpayer-funded paycheck,” he added. The initiative follows a recent legal breakthrough, with a court permitting Coinbase to access unredacted Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) documents. These files could provide insights into the role of federal agencies in the alleged Operation Chokepoint 2.0. As a former prosecutor and Special Assistant United States Attorney I am very serious about volunteering to help lead a federal investigation into ChokePoint 2.0. I would accept the task without salary. The American people deserve the truth a hell of a lot more than I or anyone… https://t.co/LFdhpCixnr — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 4, 2025 Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, commented on the filings, noting evidence of “a coordinated effort to stop a wide variety of crypto activity — from basic BTC transactions to more complex offerings.” The alleged architect of the initiative, former FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg, resigned in November, months after the collapses of Silvergate and Signature Bank left crypto exchanges like Binance without U.S. banking partners. Deaton’s proposal comes on the heels of his unsuccessful bid for a Massachusetts Senate seat against crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren. During the campaign, Deaton accused Warren of prioritizing her “anti-crypto army” over addressing issues affecting working-class Americans. US Crypto Owners Expect Less Regulation Cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump. Scott Hartman, co-chief of the securities and commodities task force at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, revealed that fewer resources will be allocated to policing cryptocurrency crimes. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. As reported, the Republican Party is preparing to introduce a comprehensive crypto market structure bill within the first 100 days of the upcoming legislative session, according to Representative French Hill.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.93. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $6.38 and an average forecast price of $6.14. EOS is a fully decentralized network that supports the development, hosting, and execution of large-scale decentralized applications (dApps), offering significant advantages in scalability and user experience. The cryptocurrency entered the crypto market in 2017 and has experienced a significant journey, including a record-breaking $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Despite its initial promise as an “Ethereum killer,” it has faced various challenges impacting its market performance and reputation. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.9034 Market Cap $1,387,350,342 Trading Volume $148,712,352 Circulating Supply 1,538,114,450 EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.9239 24-hour Low $0.8882 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.838516 Volatility 20.29% 50-Day SMA $0.889678 14-Day RSI 44.12 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.62185 EOS price analysis: Cryptocurrency ascends to $0.9034 amidst upturn TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed an increasing trend at $0.9034. Cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.55% of its value during the day. EOS coin prices are targeting the next resistance around $0.969. On January 5, 2025, EOS coin price analysis revealed an upward market trend for the cryptocurrency. Coin value has spiked up to a $0.9034 high over the past 24 hours. Cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.55% of value from its previous close. Despite the bearish turn yesterday, today the market events remained in favor of the bulls. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of EOS coin confirmed an increasing market trend for the currency. EOS/USD value has improved up to a $0.9034 high in the last 24 hours. As the volatility is declining, there is a lower chance of a reversal in the coming days. The gap between the Bollinger bands defines the market volatility. Currently, this gap is converging, resulting in a declining volatility. Moving on, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to a $0.9698 high. Whereas, its lower limit, serving as the support band, has moved to a $0.7084 low. EOS/USD 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is situated within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has stepped up to 52.70 over the day. The ascending curve on the indicator’s graph marks a rising buying pressure. If the buying activities continue to intensify, the market can be expected to enter a period of stability. EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis confirmed an uptrend for the cryptocurrency today. Cryptocurrency value has climbed up to a $0.9034 high in the past few hours. Although a strong downward slide was observed in the earlier hours, currently, the market trend is relatively positive. The Bollinger bands are narrowing down, leading to a receding market volatility. This reduction in the volatility signals a lower market unpredictability in the approaching hours. Moving on, the upper Bollinger band has moved to a $0.9684 high, determining the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has shifted to $0.7807 low, securing the support. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is situated close to the overbought area. Its value has hiked up to 61.08 over the past four hours.

Coin value has spiked up to a $0.9034 high over the period of the past 24 hours. Side by side, if we analyze the overall market scenario, then its overall sentiment remains negative. Technical indicators give out a bullish verdict regarding the ongoing market events. Similarly, the price charts continue to present a positive outlook in regard to the market inclinations. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price increased by 50% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a correction cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1.47. Why is EOS up? EOS is in ascent, with bullish pressure affecting its price action. The coin has increased to $0.9034 in the past 24 hours, and bulls have made all efforts. EOS will increase further if insufficient support from the buyers is experienced. Will EOS Recover? EOS is currently trading in its lower historical price envelope. The coin enjoyed some bullish action from late October 2023 until March 2024 and then again in December, but that did not match the price levels it had previously seen. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price will remain low. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach the $2 level by the middle of 2026 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2030. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $6 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

We expect EOS to reach a maximum price of $1.39 during the year. EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. In January 2025, EOS is trading near the $0.82 level.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-05 08:07:00

The token has shown a significant rebound, catching the attention of investors and analysts alike. XRP Rising Influence in South Korea Jaime Rogozinksi, the founder of WallStreetBets, recently highlighted XRP’s remarkable performance in South Korea. In a statement on January 2, he said the token has consistently outperformed popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin. This observation aligns with data showing the token leading trading volumes across South Korea’s major cryptocurrency exchanges over the past 24 hours. On Upbit, the country’s largest exchange, XRP’s trading volume surpassed $606 million, nearly tripling Bitcoin’s $246 million during the same period. Dogecoin followed with approximately $210 million in volume, further underscoring the token’s dominance. Similar patterns are evident on prominent South Korean exchanges, including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. The strong demand for XRP highlights the significant interest in the asset within South Korea’s retail-driven crypto market. This market has been a historically critical driver of rallies in leading cryptocurrencies. Recent Price Movements and Market Impact The token’s resurgence has been accompanied by a substantial price increase lately, positioning it as a leader among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. After dipping below $2, the asset rallied by 24% to approach the $2.50 mark. This rebound follows nearly a month of price correction after the token reached a seven-year high of $2.90. Analysts suggest that the correction phase may be concluding, with indications that the asset is gearing up for another upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Predictions and Market Sentiment The recent price recovery has sparked optimism among analysts. A market expert known as “Dark Defender” projected that XRP might be preparing for further gains, setting potential targets at $4.11 and $5.85. These predictions reflect the growing confidence in the token’s performance among investors. Jaime Rogozinksi also expressed a bullish outlook for the token, suggesting it could achieve an $8 valuation by year-end, provided the global cryptocurrency market reaches a $5 trillion market cap. His optimistic stance aligns with the digital asset’s increasing popularity and ability to maintain a significant position in the market. The token’s dominance in South Korea underscores its appeal in one of the world’s most influential cryptocurrency markets. With trading volumes outpacing major competitors and analysts forecasting higher price targets, the asset appears well-positioned for continued growth.

Most altcoins are also quite sluggish today, but the weekly scale shows massive recoveries from the likes of ADA, DOGE, AVAX, and others. BTC at $98K The business week started on the wrong foot for BTC. The asset struggled to remain above $94,000 during the previous weekend but lost that resistance and slumped hard on Monday. As reported at the time, the cryptocurrency dumped by roughly three grand and fell to a monthly low of $91,300. Many started to anticipate that the correction will endure and drive BTC to under $90,000, but the bulls intercepted the move and didn’t allow another such retracement. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to regain value and go through substantial fluctuations but overall managed to get out of its dire situation. It spiked to $99,000 on Friday but was stopped there and pushed south to $98,000. It has remained in a relatively tight range over the weekend and now stands just inches above $98,000 after gaining 3.3% on a weekly scale. Its market capitalization has risen to almost $1.950 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is down by over 1% in a week to 53.1%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 5.1.2025.

Ripple’s native token is around $2.4 after a 9% weekly surge. The biggest gainers from the larger-cap altcoins come from Cardano and Dogecoin. Both assets are up by double digits, with ADA leading the way following a 22% surge. Other notable gainers include SUI, which registered a new all-time high, XLM, and AVAX. In contrast, TON and BNB are slightly in the red on a weekly scale. The total crypto market cap has jumped to $3.660 trillion on CG after bottoming at under $3.4 trillion earlier this week.

Many users have reported issues such as failed INR withdrawals and delays in resolving their support tickets, with some claiming their withdrawal requests have been pending for weeks. This has led to growing frustration among users. The confusion surrounding CoinDCX’s withdrawal policies has raised questions about the platform’s Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. Users are concerned about inconsistent rules, with some speculating that the sudden changes to withdrawal processes could indicate potential issues with the exchange’s regulatory compliance. As the complaints continue to mount, CoinDCX faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of user funds and policies. As reported by Analytical Insights, CoinDCX co-founder Sumit Gupta addressed the ongoing withdrawal issues, explaining that relaxing withdrawal restrictions could pose a risk to the exchange, as authorities might freeze bank accounts. Gupta clarified that crypto withdrawals on CoinDCX currently operate on an opt-in basis, with the process being carried out in stages. However, he did not provide a specific timeline for when these withdrawals would be fully available to all users. WazirX Scare Looms On July 18, a devastating hack on WazirX, India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, resulted in the theft of $230 million, affecting 15 million users. Despite the platform’s strong security measures, cybercriminals breached one of its main trading wallets, siphoning off over 50% of the exchange’s assets, which amounted to more than $230 million. The stolen funds have led to significant financial loss for investors, with the stolen assets laundered and uncertainties surrounding the legal and financial repercussions. As a response to the breach, WazirX froze all trading and withdrawals, a measure that remains in effect as the company continues to investigate and recover from the hack.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-05 08:14:20

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 08:25:00

Experts have compressed a list of three coins that can turn $100 into $10,000 shortly. These top DeFi coins are: Ripple (XRP), Curve DAO (CRV), and FXGuys ($FXG). Additionally, XRP and CRV are targeting to break the $2.90 and $1.30 resistance levels. Meanwhile, crypto experts said $FXG is the best crypto coin to buy now as it can offer 100x by 2025. Its staking and other use cases have increased the demand in the crypto market. Let’s dig these coins that could turn $100 into $10,000 quickly! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Ripple’s XRP Faces Key Resistance at $2.90 Amid RLUSD Launch In mid-December 2024, Ripple launched its stablecoin–RLUSD on global exchanges . Ripple aims to meet a wide range of needs like instant global payments and on-off ramps payment with RLUSD. Reports suggest RLUSD also allows users to access value in real-world assets. However, Ripple’s XRP wasn’t impacted by this news and dropped over 6% since December 24 and was trading around $2.10 on December 30. Yet, analysts say that if XRP breaks the resistance at $2.90, it will have a great upward rally. They believe XRP along with $FXG and CRV are the best coin in 2025 to turn $100 into $10,000. DeFi Coin CRV Gains 400% and Targets $2.50 Next Since early August 2024, Curve DAO’s CRV rose over 400% from its all-time low of $0.18. In late December, CRV traded around $0.97 with a monthly gain of 79.40%. Yet, this DeFi coin is down around 98% from its all-time high. According to analyst The Mental Trader , Curve DAO’s CRV is now trading above the 21 EMA, which signals a return of bullish control. It must break above the resistance of $1.30 to move toward $2.50. If Curve DAO’s CRV reaches this new level it could target $3.50. As a result, the analyst thinks that this DeFi coin is the best crypto coin to buy now for a huge ROI. In addition, $FXG and XRP could also join this rally. FXGuys Is a User-Centric Ecosystem for Traders and Investors $FXG is another top DeFi coin to turn your $100 into $10,000.

While this suggests a strong bullish trend for early January, their prediction for February 2, 2025, estimates a price of $0.00002287, only a modest 1.25% gain from the current levels. Similarly, LongForecast offers a more tempered outlook for January 2025. They predict a high of $0.00002175 and a low of $0.00001258, with an average price of $0.00001717. Their projection of $0.00001353 by the end of January implies a -35.0% change, indicating potential bearish trends later in the month. Optimistic Scenarios For Shiba Inu (SHIB) Some analysts and community posts on X lean towards more optimistic scenarios. Gov.Capital, for example, predicts SHIB could reach $0.000271 by late 2025. This suggests that if the bullish momentum sustains, SHIB could reach similar levels by the end of January. On X, speculative posts often predict much higher prices, including $0.0001 by February 2025 or even $0.01 by the year’s end. While these projections generate excitement, they are less grounded in rigorous analysis and more reliant on community-driven enthusiasm. Moderate Predictions Crypto.News presents a middle-ground forecast, citing analysts who predict a 234% surge for SHIB in 2025, targeting $0.000081. While this would mark a substantial increase, it is still far from the speculative highs floated by some community members.

Regulatory Developments: Any changes in cryptocurrency regulations could support or suppress SHIB’s performance. Ecosystem Growth: The development of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, including projects like Shibarium , could boost investor confidence. Macro Trends: Broader market trends, including Bitcoin’s performance, often dictate the direction of altcoins like SHIB. While Grok has aggregated diverse predictions for SHIB’s price on January 31, 2025, the disparity between these forecasts illustrates the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. Conservative estimates suggest modest growth or even a decline, while optimistic projections envision exponential gains.

While there are no concrete plans at the moment, Pollak’s comments hint that the platform has ambitions to expand its offerings to US citizens in 2025. “We are in the exploratory phase and working to understand what needs to be unlocked from a regulatory perspective to bring assets like COIN to Base in a secure, compliant, and future-proof way,” Pollak wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He acknowledged that integrating COIN into the network “will be a huge undertaking.” Related News: Is Gold or Bitcoin the Real Currency? Expert Analyst Explains Why For now, COIN is accessible to non-US residents through platforms like Backed, a tokenization project for real-world assets (RWA). However, Pollak noted that clearer regulations are needed before such offerings can be widely used. “We need regulatory clarity and improvements that embrace on-chain transactions as an open platform to make this available to everyone,” Pollak added. *This is not investment advice.

The lending platform founder, Stani Kulechov, disclosed this in a post on X, stating, “Fee switch incoming.” The statement follows a report that the Aave treasury, excluding its AAVE tokens, has surpassed $75 million, a sign of the protocol’s robust performance. Talks of a fee switch for Aave are not new, with the Aave DAO having a temperature check on the issue in 2024. With many people supporting it at the time, the platform appears ready for the final governance proposal to be implemented. A fee switch returns value to the protocol users by allowing the platform to distribute parts of its revenue to its ecosystem participants. Unsurprisingly, the idea of a fee switch is something many people endorse as they believe it would make holding the AAVE token even more beneficial. At the time of the temperature check, Aave Chan Initiative founder Marc Zeller noted that the proposal to enable a fee switch could initiate restaking on the Aave protocol. With the fee switch now looking more likely than ever, many crypto enthusiasts believe it would be great for Aave and DeFi. Interestingly, other leading DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, have considered enabling the same mechanism. Aave net deposits increased by $25 billion in 2024 Meanwhile, Aave’s decision to opt for a fee switch is unsurprising, given how successful the protocol has been. The lending platform is one of the best-performing DeFi protocols based on several metrics, including its total value locked (TVL). DeFiLlama data shows it has $21.63 billion in TVL, which has increased by 5.5% in the last seven days. However, Aave’s net deposits stand out. The protocol saw its net deposits increase by $25 billion within 2024, going from $10 billion as of 2023 to $35 billion by the end of last year. According to Token Terminal , its net deposit has surpassed $36 billion, making it the largest DeFi protocol. Part of Aave’s success has been due to the struggles of other leading DeFi protocols, such as Curve, with its massive outflows, and Sky, formerly Maker, with its complex restructuring plans. Still, Aave had to compete with several other lending protocols, such as Morpho Labs, Compound, and Spark. Beyond its net deposits, the protocol also has the largest active loans, at $14.99 billion, and has collected around $500 million in total fees over the last 12 months. What is next for Aave Despite the news that Aave will enable a fee switch, the AAVE token did not see any sizable changes in its price. This indicates that the market has not yet priced in the announcement. Still, the token has been highflying in recent weeks, gaining more than 35% in the last 30 days to reach $352. It is currently among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and many believe that it could see more substantial growth in 2025. This is highly likely, given the protocol’s planned expansions. Currently, Aave has 13 markets across 11 chains. In 2025, it plans to add six new chains, including Mantle, Aptos, Sonic Linea, BOB, and Spider Chain. It is also planning to expand its GHO stablecoin, which currently has a market cap of around $150 million, to the Avalanche and Base Layer 2 networks to boost its usage. The protocol is now targeting the development of the Aave V4 as part of its Aave 2030 plan. The V4 will offer improved modularity, capital efficiency, and more innovations.

Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, highlighted the milestone, noting that Bitcoin’s transaction volume peaked at $47 trillion during the 2021 bull market before declining sharply in 2022 and 2023. Rochard stated, “The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that Bitcoin is both a store of value and a medium of exchange.” Bitcoin’s notable achievements in 2024 included the launch of a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, the April 2024 halving event, and a new all-time high price of approximately $108,000. Bitcoin Hashrate Reaches New Records in 2025 The hashrate of the Bitcoin network, which measures the total computing power securing the protocol, hit a record high of 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Jan. 3, 2025. However, it has since decreased to around 775 EH/s, according to data from CryptoQuant. In 2024, over 40% of the global Bitcoin hashrate was contributed by U.S.-based mining pools. Foundry USA and MARA Pool, two major U.S. mining pools, collectively accounted for 38.5% of all blocks mined during the year, according to TheMinerMag. Despite the rising influence of U.S.-based pools, China-based mining pools continue to control a majority of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate. Accurately measuring hashrate dominance remains challenging due to Bitcoin mining’s decentralized and pseudonymous nature. Mining companies may operate in one country while sourcing computing power from miners worldwide. Additionally, VPNs allow miners to obscure their geographic locations, further complicating efforts to determine true hashrate distribution.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 09:27:00

Currently trading near $98,000, speculation is mounting about whether Bitcoin has exited its correction phase, with high expectations of an impending bull market. Related Reading: Short-Term Bitcoin Holders See 10% Profit – Potential Impact On Price? Strong Bitcoin Support Zone Emerges Between $95,090-$96,531 In an X post on January 4, digital asset analysis platform More Crypto Online shared an insight on the present state of the Bitcoin market. With the application of the Elliott Wave Theory, these analysts deduced that Bitcoin’s price may have developed a potential 5-wave pattern which can be indicative of a bullish movement. For context, the Elliott Wave Theory works on the basis that financial markets move in predictable patterns due to investor psychology and natural market rhythms. The 5-wave pattern also known as the impulsive wave pattern generally moves in the direction of the larger trend. With Bitcoin still in a bullish shape despite recent corrections, the completion of the 5-wave pattern to the upward direction indicates a strong price rally i.e. BTC is out of correction with a focus on new highs. However, in order to solidify this notion of impending new all-time highs, Bitcoin must break above the December 26th price peak of $99,900 which represents a major resistance level. In the advent of any rejections/retracements amidst this bullish charge, the crypto analysts at More Crypto Online have pinpointed a significant support zone between $95,090 – $96,531 capable of acting as a cushion for retest. Albeit, if there is an overwhelming selling pressure, Bitcoin could slide as low as $92,950 representing a potential 5.5% fall from its current market price.

The premier cryptocurrency remains one of the best-performing coins in the last year having a profit of 121.32% in this timeframe. According to data from Coincodex, sentiments in the BTC remain bullish with the Fear & Greed Index now at 73 reflecting an “almost” extreme greed among investors. With the crypto bull market set to take off with the potential of a pro-crypto US government on the horizon, the analysts at Coincodex predict Bitcoin to reach $132,775 in the first quarter of 2025, and rise as high as $172,192 by June.

Ethereum Dominating Smart Contracts, and Celestia Redefines Blockchain with Its Modular Approach The crypto market is heating up, and if you’re looking for the best altcoins to join this weekend, you’re probably wondering where to place your bets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have already made their mark, new contenders are emerging, offering fresh opportunities. Qubetics, Celestia, and Ethereum are leading the charge, each bringing something unique to the table. From Qubetics’ innovative tokenized marketplace to Ethereum’s unmatched smart contract capabilities, and Celestia’s revolutionary modular blockchain, the future of crypto is looking incredibly exciting. But here’s the kicker—Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s shaking things up with its tokenized marketplace, and analysts are predicting a price surge for its native token ($TICS) once the mainnet launches. Imagine buying in now, and seeing a potential jump to $10-15 per token. That’s some serious growth potential! As crypto enthusiasts search for the best altcoins to join this weekend, Qubetics is already making waves, and it could be your ticket to the next big thing. Qubetics: A Tokenized Marketplace Ready to Change the Game Let’s talk about Qubetics. This project is no small player—it’s making waves with its tokenized marketplace. What does that mean? Simply put, it’s a platform where users can trade tokenized assets in a decentralized and secure manner, without having to rely on intermediaries. Whether it’s NFTs, digital real estate, or even traditional assets, Qubetics is creating a marketplace where everything can be tokenized, making transactions smoother and more secure. (qubetics.com) The kicker? Analysts are projecting that the value of $TICS, Qubetics’ native token, could skyrocket to $10-15 after the mainnet launch. Imagine investing $1,000 today and reaping the rewards when the token’s price increases. With this level of growth potential, Qubetics is definitely one of the best altcoins to join this weekend. It’s an exciting time for those who want to get in early before this project takes off. What makes Qubetics stand out even more is its focus on user control and security. With its non-custodial wallet and in-app, feeless $TICS transfers, users can enjoy seamless and secure transactions without the usual headaches of high fees or middlemen. Whether you’re buying or selling tokenized assets, the platform is designed to keep things simple and user-friendly. But it doesn’t stop there—Qubetics is also working on integrating debit and virtual cards for real-world purchases, making it even easier for users to spend their crypto. (qubetics.com) The tokenized marketplace is something we haven’t seen done in quite this way before, and the analysts are definitely taking notice. Early investors are looking at major potential, with many predicting a price surge as high as $10-15 per $TICS after the mainnet launch. That’s a serious return on investment, and it’s why Qubetics is one of the best altcoins to join this weekend. To learn more about Qubetics and this revolutionary project, check out this video. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts and DeFi Now, let’s talk about Ethereum. When you think of smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum is still the name that comes to mind. Ethereum’s smart contract platform has powered countless projects and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. It’s the backbone of so much of what we see in the blockchain space, and its network upgrade, Ethereum 2.0, promises to make it even more scalable and eco-friendly. Ethereum has faced its fair share of criticism due to its high gas fees, but with the shift to Ethereum 2.0, the hope is that these issues will become a thing of the past. The network upgrade is designed to improve scalability, reduce fees, and make Ethereum more accessible to the average user. Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities make it one of the best altcoins to join this weekend if you’re looking to invest in a stable, reliable platform with real-world applications. For those who are looking to make an investment in Ethereum, the potential for growth is still very real. Even though it’s one of the most established cryptocurrencies out there, Ethereum continues to be a dominant force in the market. With DeFi protocols and NFTs taking off, the use cases for Ethereum are expanding, and it shows no signs of slowing down. Ethereum has proven its resilience, and with the transition to Ethereum 2.0, it’s positioned to stay at the forefront of the crypto revolution. Celestia: A Modular Blockchain That’s Changing the Way We Think About Scaling Last but certainly not least, we have Celestia. This new project is taking a fresh approach to scaling and modularity. While most blockchains try to do everything in one package, Celestia is focusing on doing one thing really well—modular blockchain infrastructure. The idea is to separate the consensus layer from the execution layer, which allows developers to build their own blockchains that can scale as needed. This modular approach is a game-changer for developers. Instead of relying on one monolithic blockchain, Celestia offers the flexibility to create customized blockchains with their own rules and governance. This is a big deal because it opens up possibilities for more innovative solutions to real-world problems, particularly when it comes to scalability. Celestia is already gaining traction in the blockchain space, and it’s quickly becoming one of the best altcoins to join this weekend for anyone interested in next-gen blockchain technology.

Is that good?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microstrategys-stock-feels-like-gamestop/,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) has turned into a Wall Street circus act, and its stock feels like it’s auditioning for a meme stock reboot. One so iconic, it’d put Roaring Kitty to shame. Investors are glued to this suburban Virginia-based company, not because it’s a leader in data analytics (does anyone even care about that anymore?), but because it’s become a walking, talking Bitcoin experiment. Thanks to its relentless Bitcoin-buying spree, MicroStrategy is now treated like a crypto ETF with a sprinkle of retail investor frenzy. The numbers? Wild. MSTR soared by 358% in 2024, even making its way into the Nasdaq-100 club. But as Bitcoin cooled off in December, MicroStrategy gave back 25% of its gains. Still, a yearly performance like that is the kind of stuff that gets the nerds crazy. But is this company a genius for riding the Bitcoin wave or just another potential victim of hype-fueled chaos? Let’s dig in. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin obsession Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman, is the guy who turned this ship into a Bitcoin casino. His playbook? Buy Bitcoin. Then buy more Bitcoin. And when in doubt, raise billions in debt to—surprise—buy even more Bitcoin. Yes, he is a very special guy. The company started its crypto journey in 2020, calling it a “defensive” strategy to preserve shareholder value. By 2024, defense turned offense, and MicroStrategy just couldn’t stop. During the year alone, these guys bought Bitcoin 18 times, and eight of those were after the November presidential election. MicroStrategy now holds a jaw-dropping 446,400 Bitcoin, or about 2% of the entire global supply. Saylor calls this the “forever” strategy, comparing Bitcoin to Manhattan real estate. “We’ll keep buying the top forever,” he has declared , leaning on the fact that Bitcoin’s price has never been lower over a five-year period. That’s impressive, sure, but it comes with a side of risk. Bitcoin is famously volatile, with historic drawdowns of 30% or more, even in bullish markets. Yet MicroStrategy’s strategy hinges on long-term gains. Its debt doesn’t come due until 2029, and analysts argue that the odds of Bitcoin’s value being lower by then are slim. The meme stock parallels Saylor has fully embraced meme culture, plastering his social media with rocket ship emojis and Bitcoin memes that make him look like the pope of the crypto church. He plays around with AI and makes fun images of himself with Bitcoin. Thinking about Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/aV42LzSjBp — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) January 4, 2025 Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Co., says this behavior makes sense. “What Michael Saylor has done over the past few years is draw attention to what MicroStrategy is doing by embracing social media and meme culture,” he explained . “He hasn’t shied away from over-the-top promotion.” This approach has worked to some extent, as MicroStrategy has cultivated a crypto-native cheering section. But it’s also invited skepticism. Meme stocks like GameStop and AMC have taught us that hype-driven investing can collapse just as fast as it rises. And while Bitcoin has a lot more substance than Reddit-fueled stock plays, the volatility remains real. MicroStrategy’s stock moves almost in sync with Bitcoin, which means any crypto dip hits its shares hard. In 2022, during a Bitcoin bear market, the company’s stock plunged 74% while Bitcoin itself fell 64%. Despite the carnage, MicroStrategy survived. The company emerged from the rubble and doubled down on Bitcoin, becoming even more aggressive in 2024. What’s next for MicroStrategy? MicroStrategy isn’t ever slowing down. Earlier this week, the company announced plans to raise $2 billion through perpetual preferred stock offerings. This is part of its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” which plans to raise $42 billion over three years—half through equity, half through fixed-income instruments—all to buy more Bitcoin. But wait, there’s more. The company is asking shareholders to approve a proposal to increase its authorized common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion shares. If that sounds like a dilution nightmare, it is. However, Michael Saylor controls 46.8% of the company’s voting power, so this plan is likely to pass. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself is flirting with $100,000 again, and analysts are throwing out wild predictions. A report from H.C. Wainwright, a 156-year-old investment bank, predicts Bitcoin would hit $225,000 this year, thanks to growing institutional adoption and ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 09:53:00

According to reports, the individuals belonged to a syndicate carrying out their crimes across several locations in Asia. The group majored in investment and romance scams, defrauding victims across Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore. Authorities say the group has netted more than $4.3 million in criminal proceeds. According to the Commercial Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong police, the group was apprehended in a string operation between Thursday and Friday. The authorities’ statement revealed that the syndicate rented two buildings in the neighboring industrial building, making it a base where their activities were conducted. The group also positioned their offices at strategic angles, making their operations easy, according to authorities. Hong Kong police detail the criminals’ operations According to the details of the gang’s operations, the Hong Kong police said that they would look for images of good-looking women on the internet. After collating the pictures, the group would make a deepfake of the images before approaching their intended target. The victims would first be lured into keeping a worthy romantic relationship with the fake online scammers. After a while, the criminals, under the cover of the fake persona, will now introduce the victims to a sham investment scheme. This method usually works, as the scammers would have made the victims comfortable enough to part with considerable funds either by sharing fake personal information or other methods, including video calling. Police mentioned that scammers generated about HK$34 million, but the number of victims and their losses were still being reviewed. Superintendent Fung Pui-Kei mentioned that the two buildings run shifts, where members are supposed to clock in at different times of the day. The syndicate also lured youngsters, including students, by promising to furnish them with goodies and cash if they carry out the scams. Fung mentioned that the recruits were used to find new targets based in Taiwan or South Asia. “Recruits would be trained to use different dating apps to fish for targets, who would usually be based in Taiwan or [Southeast] Asia, such as Singapore and Malaysia,” he said. Fung highlights the use of new technologies Fung highlighted the use of deepfake technology and how it has helped the criminals in their activities. He mentioned that they use technology to redesign the lifestyle of the picture of good-looking people that they stole on the internet. The pictures are usually designed to show the person flaunting wealth by driving exotic cars or showing off money. Another plus is pictures tying the people to several cryptocurrency events. The Superintendent stated that the redesign usually works in the romance scam business. “They also make use of the new technology, like AI face-swapping technology, to [pretend] to be some good-looking ladies and gentlemen to induce potential victims, gain their trust, and develop into romance relationships in order to commence the romance scams,” he said. According to the police, about HK$100 million worth of cash and assets, including luxury handbags and watches were found during the raid on their base of operations. Most of the criminals were unemployed, with only a small percentage of them being university students. The police said they have held five of them, who are believed to be core syndicate members and will be charged in court for conspiracy to defraud. Other suspects have since been released on bail. This is not the first deepfake criminal organization to be arrested, as the police apprehended a group with the same operations last October. The group carried out major crimes in Southeast Asia, netting $46 million from unsuspecting users. The police arrested 21 men and six women while carrying out a raid on their 4000-square-foot base of operation in Hung Hom. Police said they are still carrying out investigations to determine if the two groups are connected.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A Trump presidency in 2025 could reshape crypto, with Ethereum, Ripple, and emerging platforms like Lightchain AI in focus. The possibility of a Donald Trump presidency in 2025 has significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. With Trump’s mixed record on digital assets and his administration’s prior focus on regulation, the market could see new trends in adoption, scrutiny, and innovation. While Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are established players, emerging platforms like Lightchain AI are gaining momentum. Let’s explore how a Trump presidency could influence the trajectory of these three cryptocurrencies. You might also like: Lightchain AI price forecast: A promising short-term investment opportunity Ethereum navigating a regulatory maze As the next big digital money by market worth, Ethereum faces rules problems. With a Trump rule, the crypto market can see more watchfulness as lawmakers look at rules and anti-cash laundering steps. For Ethereum, this can mean closer checks on DeFi plans and harsher guides for sma͏rt deal sites. But, Ethereum’s changeability can be good for it. With its shift to proof-of-stake by Ethereum 2.0 the network is more ready to meet environmental and rule needs. A Trump term might also speed up Ethereum’s use in business places as firms look for legal blockchain fixes. Though the path could be rough, Ethereum’s strong builder community and broad examples of use keep it tough. Ripple battling regulatory pressures Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dominated headlines, and a Trump presidency could reshape the outcome. Trump’s administration previously expressed mixed views on cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the need for clear rules while being critical of Bitcoin. For Ripple, this could mean either a resolution to its SEC dispute or continued uncertainty, depending on the administration’s stance. If Ripple can secure regulatory clarity, XRP could experience a resurgence, especially as the platform focuses on cross-border payments and partnerships with financial institutions. On the other hand, prolonged legal struggles might hinder its growth, leaving room for other blockchain projects to capture market share. Ripple’s future under Trump hinges on whether the administration adopts a crypto-friendly or restrictive regulatory approach. Lightchain AI new frontier amid shifting policies Unlike Ethereum and Ripple, Lightchain AI is an emerging player, offering a unique blend of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. A Trump presidency could create both challenges and opportunities for creative projects like Lightchain AI . Increased regulatory scrutiny might require the platform to demonstrate compliance and transparency, but its focus on real-world applications gives it an edge. Lightchain AI’s ability to integrate blockchain with AI-driven solutions positions it as a transformative force in industries such as healthcare, logistics, and finance. If the Trump administration prioritizes technological creativity and competitiveness, Lightchain AI could benefit from policies that encourage growth in blockchain-based AI systems. With its presale success — raising over $7 million at a price of $0.0045 — Lightchain AI is well-equipped to navigate the complexities of a shifting political landscape.

On-chain data shows whales making large acquisitions amid the price dip. Is SHIB price on the verge of sharp rebound? Shiba Inu Price Holds $0.000023 Amid 5% Pullback Shiba Inu price has underperformed in the last 24 hours, relative to the broader crypto market trends. While the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE advanced above the $0.40 and $0.00020 levels respectively, SHIB has struggled to keep up with the pack. Shiba Inu price action | SHIBUSDT The chart above shows how SHIB price has retraced 5% in the last 24-hours, after hitting a brick-wall at the $0.000025 territory on January 3. With SHIB currently hovering above the $0.0000023 support level, trading volumes have also declined considerably, raising further downside risks despite the dominant bullish within the broader crypto markets. Whales Spotted Buying the Dip After 3-day Selling Spree Shiba Inu recent 5% price pullback has been linked to intense selling pressure from whale investors capitalizing on the positive start to 2025 to book profits. Lending credence to this narrative, the IntoTheBlock chart below monitors the daily netflows from wallets holding at least 0.1% of SHIB tokens in circulation. Shiba Inu Large Holders’ Netflow | Source: IntoTheBlock The chart above shows that Whales capitalized on the positive start to year, buy offloading 466 billion SHIB, worth approximately $11.7 million, in a 3-day selling spree between January 1 and January 3. When whales execute such large sell-offs during rally, it dillutes the short-term market supply, decelarating the price uptrend. This partly explains why Shiba Inu price has rejected the $0.0000025 resistance in the last 24 hours, while rival memes like DOGE and PEPE have advanced. However, the trend could flip as the latest data shows the whales acquired 67.5 billion SHIB tokens on January 4, snapping the 3-day selling spree. If whales sustain the buying pressure, SHIB price could be in for an early rebound to make another attempt at breaching $0.0000025 resistance in the week ahead. SHIB Price Forecast: More Consolidation Before $0.0000025 Breakout Shiba Inu price is predicted to remain in a consolidation phase below the $0.000030 in the week ahead. Whale investors, who recently booked $14 million in profits, have shown renewed interest, but declining trading volumes indicate a lack of strong momentum to break key resistance levels in the short term. The Parabolic SAR indicator has moved below the current price, signaling buyer dominance and potential for further upside. Shiba Inu Price Forecast | SHIBUSD If SHIB can reclaim $0.00002450 and sustain its momentum, the next critical resistance at $0.00002500, near the upper Bollinger Band, becomes attainable. A breakout above this level could open the door to a rally toward $0.000030. On the downside, declining trading volumes and oversupply from last week’s sell-off may limit SHIB’s upward trajectory. If SHIB fails to hold the immediate support at $0.00002200 (middle Bollinger Band), the price could pull back further to $0.00001923, aligning with the Parabolic SAR trendline. A breach of this support risks extending the consolidation toward $0.00001800, a critical lower support zone.

38566400,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=637821,1736073758,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38566400.jpeg,Doctors turn to AI for easier medical note-taking,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doctors-turn-to-ai-for-easier-medical-note-taking/,"AI is taking over the grunt work in healthcare, and doctors couldn’t be more ready for the help. Investment in artificial intelligence tools for medical note-taking hit $800 million in 2024, more than doubling from $390 million in 2023. The $26 billion healthcare AI market has Big Tech and scrappy startups battling it out. Startups like Nabla, Heidi, Corti, and Tortus are leading the charge, backed by investors like Khosla Ventures and French billionaire Xavier Niel. These companies reportedly want to turn AI into the perfect medical scribe, automating note-taking to save time and improve patient care. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle have jumped into the race with their own AI-driven tools. Tech giants take the lead Microsoft has made one of the biggest splashes. After acquiring Nuance for $20 billion in 2022, the tech giant launched the DAX Copilot. This tool uses large language models and speech recognition to document patient visits, highlight key medical details, and generate clinical summaries. Already, DAX Copilot is reportedly transcribing over 1.3 million physician-patient interactions every month across more than 500 U.S. healthcare groups. Microsoft says it can cut doctors’ time spent on documentation by half. At Stanford Medical School, more than 50 primary care physicians tested the DAX Copilot in 2024. While two-thirds of them said the tool saved time, they weren’t just hitting “approve” on AI-generated notes. A whopping 90% of the notes needed manual corrections. But even with the extra editing, doctors found the tool valuable enough for Stanford to plan a broader rollout. Amazon and Oracle are chasing Microsoft’s lead, rolling out their own AI-powered solutions for healthcare. These tools integrate large language models with advanced speech recognition to turn conversations into polished medical records. On the startup side, Nabla is making waves in Europe. Using OpenAI’s Whisper transcription tool, Nabla’s app has processed over 7 million medical visits as of October 2023. Apparently, the app saves three to four minutes per patient, freeing up hours in a packed clinic day. AI controversy and concerns Not everyone is cheering for AI’s growing role in healthcare though. Researchers have raised alarms about “hallucinations,” where AI tools fabricate data. A study by Cornell University and the University of Virginia analyzed Whisper-generated transcripts and found that about 1% of them included phrases that were completely made up. Even worse, 40% of these errors involved harmful misinformation, such as suggesting false medical facts or even perpetuating violence. These issues are real risks in a field where accuracy is literally a matter of life and death. Doctors using AI tools are still double-checking every note, and for good reasons. While AI can speed up workflows, it’s not perfect, and any errors can have serious consequences. Privacy is another hot-button issue. Handling sensitive medical data with AI raises questions about how secure the systems really are. Hospitals and tech companies claim to prioritize data security, but skepticism remains. Critics think that the rush to adopt these tools might overlook critical safeguards. Still, many doctors believe the benefits outweigh the risks. AI expands its dominance across industries AI is embedding itself into nearly every major sector in the United States. Diagnostics is one of its most impressive applications. Algorithms now process medical images faster and more accurately than doctors, identifying cancers, fractures, and other conditions in record time. This capability is particularly critical in emergency settings, where speed can save lives. AI is also at the forefront of personalized treatment plans, tailoring therapies to individual patients by analyzing genetic data and medical histories. Known as precision medicine, this approach is revolutionizing outcomes for patients who once relied on one-size-fits-all treatments. Surgical robotics is another area too. These systems assist surgeons with complex procedures, reducing human error and speeding up recovery times for patients. The transportation sector is also undergoing an AI-driven transformation. Autonomous vehicles are becoming more reliable, using real-time data to get through roads and reduce accidents. Traffic flows more smoothly with these vehicles in operation, cutting congestion in busy cities. AI also predicts maintenance needs for transportation fleets, preventing breakdowns and keeping supply chains running on time. Finance is another area where AI is firmly entrenched. Fraud detection systems are now capable of scanning millions of transactions to identify suspicious activity, helping banks protect their customers and their bottom lines. On Wall Street, AI algorithms dominate trading floors, analyzing market trends and executing trades faster than human traders ever could. These tools have completely changed how financial firms approach investments, turning data into profits at lightning speed. In retail, AI is focused on understanding and anticipating customer behavior. By analyzing purchase histories and preferences, AI delivers personalized shopping recommendations that boost sales. Inventory management is another area where AI excels, predicting demand with uncanny accuracy and ensuring shelves are stocked with what customers want while minimizing waste. Even education has embraced AI. U.S. colleges are now using AI tools to streamline admissions processes. These systems analyze test scores, transcripts, and personal essays, categorizing applicants to save time for overburdened admissions officers. With increasing competition for spots at top universities, these tools are proving invaluable. Agriculture is being redefined by precision farming techniques powered by AI. Drones equipped with sensors scan fields for crop health and soil conditions, ensuring that irrigation and other resources are used efficiently. This leads to higher yields while conserving water and other inputs. Entertainment hasn’t escaped AI’s reach either. Streaming services like Netflix rely on algorithms to recommend content tailored to individual preferences. Beyond recommendations, AI is generating new music, movies, and even video games, expanding the boundaries of creative industries.

According to MarktQuant, Bitcoin is showing significant long liquidation concentration around the $90,000 level, identifying this level as a critical downside target. However, most of the short liquidations have been cleared to $99,000. While a near-term reversal seems likely, analysts noted that there is still a possibility that Bitcoin could test the $101,000 short liquidation cluster before a significant downside move occurs. “In this scenario, caution and patience are advised,” the statement emphasized. Related News: Giant Bull Michael Saylor Reveals What Will Happen to His Bitcoins After His Death According to MarktQuant, Ethereum’s liquidation patterns suggest that short liquidations at current levels are insufficient to sustain upward momentum. Meanwhile, long liquidations are increasingly clustering around the $3,300 level, marking that level as a possible pullback target. “This growing cluster suggests that a pullback to $3,300 is a realistic possibility in the near-term,” the analysis concluded. For Solana, the $185 price level stands out due to a significant long liquidation cluster. MarktQuant notes that liquidation volume at this level exceeds all other price zones, making it a key downside target in case the market weakens. *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, analysts believe XRP is well on the way to smashing its own record, eclipsing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana’s gains in December. In December, XRP tokens retraced 84% of losses from its all-time high price of $3.4 a coin in Jan. 2018 to a multi-year bottom of $0.16 in Mar. 2020. After seven years of turmoil in XRP markets, Ripple Labs’ cross-border blockchain settlement tokens notched $2.17 on Dec. 2. After that, the asset charted a 30-day bullish falling wedge pattern with declining daily trade volumes. The bullish reversal of this classic technical chart pattern materialized on New Year’s Day. Ripple has already gained 26% since the turn of the year. Here are six of the key supports for further price gains that XRP markets are counting on moving forward. 1. Musk Is Backing Ripple’s Bid to Cast Off The SEC In December, the new D.O.G.E. advisor to incoming President Trump tweeted his latest broadside against the SEC. He made a very favorable statement about XRP when asked in October. Shortly after the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court in New Orleans ruled the SEC broke the law (by endorsing diversity requirements for corporate boards), Musk tweeted: “The SEC is just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.” It was a quote on a repost by pro-cryptocurrency Utah Sen. Mike Lee. The senator said, “The SEC is yet another “independent commission” that cannot be trusted.” The SEC is just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work https://t.co/5w9ajcS6bf — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 12, 2024 Musk’s post came shortly after a US Fifth Circuit Court ruling against the SEC in another case that bolsters Ripple’s argument that the agency is regulating by enforcement rather than policy. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse jumped on the repost train to second Musk’s description. “What he said,” Garlinghouse added. What he said https://t.co/sHs1aLkf8Z — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 13, 2024 Earlier in Q4, at an America PAC conference, an audience member asked the tech titan, “Do you envision the XRP Ledger being incorporated into the financial institutions in the future.” Musk replied, “This is definitely not an endorsement or lack of endorsement for XRP, but I do think crypto, by its very nature, helps with individual freedom.” 2. Trump Back in White House a Big Win for XRP FOX Business Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino recently stated that incoming US president Donald Trump could put his thumb on the scale in the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs. He made the comments to Professional Capital Management CEO Anthony Pompliano on the Pomp Podcast. Gasparino said he expects the new Trump Administration to shift the SEC’s approach to Ripple drastically. He specifically pointed out Mr. Trump’s Paul Atkins nomination for SEC Chair as a sure sign of a more Ripple and XRP-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission for the next four years. Atkins is the CEO of a global consulting firm with clients in the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, Trump appears apt to purge the SEC of anti-crypto commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. The SEC’s case against XRP is arguably the most considerable headwind for XRP’s price. It represents the most serious ongoing threat to Ripple and the institutional adoption of XRP. 3. XRP for Oil in The Middle East and North Africa Looking back on a milestone year for crypto and ahead to 2025, @Ripple remains committed to advancing the digital asset ecosystem across the Middle East and Africa. Here’s what we are looking forward to in 2025. – UAE’s Crypto Leadership The UAE is setting the pace for crypto… — Reece Merrick (@reece_merrick) January 2, 2025 Reece Merrick, Ripple managing director for the Middle East and Africa, shared a detailed note on Thursday about the #RemittanceRevolution happening in MENA nations. He says the oil-rich Persian Gulf’s United Arab Emirates is currently leading cryptocurrency adoption in the Middle East: “Remittances in MENA are getting a crypto makeover. Stablecoins are cutting costs & speeding up transfers—bringing the Middle East, South Asia, & Africa together like never before. The UAE leads the charge in financial connectivity.” He predicts banks in the Middle East will “fully embrace blockchain” solutions like XRP in 2025: “2025 will see MEA’s banks fully embrace blockchain. Look at UAE, KSA, Bahrain, Qatar & Morocco. Faster payments, tokenized assets, and stablecoin utility are rewriting the rules of banking. This is how we diversify & future-proof financial systems.” The skyrocketing total value locked in real-world asset tokenization (RWA) platforms is a bullish indicator of the value of XRP as a tool for fast, low-fee settlement in international trade. Most crypto analysts agree this is one of the most important metas for blockchain going into 2025. 4. Markets Are Going Crazy for Ripple’s RLUSD Ripple Labs launched its new stablecoin RLUSD on Dec. 17. That creates more liquidity next to the XRP pool in the blockchain ecosystem, so it’s likely to create more long-term support for XRP’s price in due time. Stablecoins hold a 1:1 buying power peg to the US dollar or some other free-floating sovereign currency like the yen or euro. So far, the new stablecoin is already available on several crypto exchanges. Traders can use RLUSD on Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, Moonpay, CoinMENA, and Bullish, among others. The sector was already so enthusiastic about RLUSD ahead of its launch that Ripple CTO David Schwarz had to warn against FOMO before the coins went to market. Interestingly, blockchain had minted most of the new stablecoins on Ethereum—some $52 million. Ripple senior vice president of stablecoins Jack McDonald told CNBC the growth XRP has seen prior to RLUSD’s launch inspired the new Ripple brand stablecoin: “Part of the impetus for us wanting to launch a stablecoin is the growth we’ve seen specifically in cross-border payments.” “As we’ve been using stablecoins more and more in our flows, that really piqued our interest that we should have our own native stablecoin that can be more cost effective and more operationally efficient to use,” McDonald added. Bottom Line for Investors Over the New Year holiday, XRP made a bullish reversal. Ripple broke out of a descending wedge pattern with declining volume. Interestingly, the rally took markedly far less daily trade volume to retrace 68% of its decline from XRP’s record-high price on Dec. 2. That indicates this market is far from the euphoria stage of this rally, with plenty of room left to the upside.

While these tokens delivered impressive short-term gains, investors are now turning their attention to Lightchain AI (LCAI), a presale gem that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence. Priced at just $0.0041, Lightchain AI has raised over $5.7 million, with experts predicting it could follow a similar trajectory to this week’s trending tokens—only with stronger fundamentals and long-term potential. Meme coin mania captures market attention with GOAT, NEIRO, and PEPE The crypto space has been lively of late with a rise in joke coins like GOAT, NEIRO and PEPE. GOAT, which means Goatseus Maximus, came from an AI test w͏ith the Truth Terminal chatbot which hyped up the coin and helped it hit a big market cap of more than $600 million. NEIRO, known as First Neiro on Ethereum, has been surfing the Dogecoin wave; calling itself the Heir of Doge. Its fame has shot up, mainly after getting listed on big exchanges like Binance which boosted its look and trade action. PEPE, moved by the famous Pepe the Frog meme, is another bright spot. With a market cap of $4 billion its no tax rule and shrinking system, which burns tokens to keep supply down have pulled in a big and eager group of backers. These coins show how lively and fun the realm of meme coins can be where online culture and strong groups can cause big market shifts. Lightchain AI offers innovative solutions beyond speculation Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain, offering practical solutions for industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. Its focus on building AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) gives it a clear edge over speculative meme coins. One of Lightchain AI’s standout features is its ability to enable secure, privacy-preserving AI computations, making it a highly versatile platform. The token’s presale success, with over $5.7 million raised, reflects growing investor confidence in its real-world applications and long-term potential. Unlike meme coins, Lightchain AI is backed by a clear roadmap and innovative technology, positioning it for sustained growth rather than fleeting hype. Experts predict Lightchain AI could outshine meme coins with steady growth Experts anticipate that Lightchain AI (LCAI) will surpass meme coins in growth due to its innovative integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. The project’s tokenomics, which includes fixed supply and token-burning mechanisms, ensure a continuous demand for its token, contributing to long-term appreciation. This approach enhances the ecosystem’s sustainability while supporting its broader adoption. With a successful presale that has raised significant funds, Lightchain AI offers an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on its promising growth potential. By focusing on real-world applications, its roadmap sets the stage for both industry disruption and substantial long-term returns for early investors.

Could This Altcoin Stealth XRP’s Market Share,https://timestabloid.com/the-most-promising-altcoin-of-2025-revealed-could-this-altcoin/,"2025 could be a defining year for the cryptocurrency world, as experts believe it will see the biggest bull market in history. In recent months, Ripple (XRP) has performed remarkably, surging to the $2.90 high from the $0.60 breakout level. Though XRP price has done exceptionally well, it has already seen its largest upswing. For the fresh bull stage, investors are flocking towards DTX Exchange (DTX), which industry experts hailed as the best altcoin of 2025. DTX is riding the presale waves and has tremendous upside potential. XRP Price Breaks Resistance, New Highs Soon? Ripple (XRP) has recovered from the month-long correction as XRP price broke the decreasing triangle pattern on Wednesday’s upmove. XRP price was trading inside this pattern from the exhaustion of the previous rally. Following the breakout, it has gained 21% in the last three days, creating a weekly high of $2.47. This rise was fueled by anticipation of the Ripple ETFs, which are expected to launch in 2025. Source: CoinMarketCap On technical analysis, XRP price has two major local barriers at $2.65 and $2.90, where supply has taken control in the past. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 60, indicating the buying force in XRP price. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has nearly formed a bullish crossover as the short-term MA is crossing the long-term from the downside. This bullish crossover indicates a trend change and can push the XRP price to a new high if the momentum sustains. Ripple Unveils Vision For MEA Countries Reece Merrick, the director of Ripple for the Middle East and Africa, confirmed that the company is seriously committed to the region in which the ecosystem of cryptocurrency is being developed. Recently, on the social network Merrick mentioned again how Ripple strives to develop blockchain and crypto assets in the area which is being recognized as a global center for it. Ripple was able to achieve a landmark step last year by getting the rulers of Dubai, the most populous city in the UAE, to accept its regulatory application. It was this clearance that helped Ripple to reach all of the Middle East countries. The company keeps on paying attention to this sector showing its faith in the potential of the Middle East and Africa to become the very transmuting factor of the crypto industry. DTX Exchange: Solid Investment Opportunity For Exponential Growth Although Ripple has been a top cryptocurrency since its inception, recent market swings have made it difficult for large-cap coins to compete. Meanwhile, emerging low-cap gems like DTX Exchange (DTX) have demonstrated increasing investor interest through exceptional token presales and cutting-edge technology. The DTX platform combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges, offering a trading place with a simple interface and great features. Users can access 120,000 trading instruments, such as ETFs, CFDs, stocks, crypto, and forex.

Crypto Analyst Sets $11 Target,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-an-xrp-price-explosion-imminent-crypto-analyst-sets-11-target/,"The cryptocurrency market seemed to be in its recovery phase over the past week, with most large-cap assets recording significant gains to close the week. Specifically, the XRP price performance was the cream of the crop, with the altcoin showing strong signs of resurgence. The XRP token has picked up this year from where it left off in 2024, posting double-digit profit over the previous week. This single-week performance helped push the altcoin to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, displacing the USDT stablecoin. Can The Price Of XRP Soar 350% In 2025? In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting analysis of the XRP price that captures the altcoin’s potential trajectory over the next few months. According to the crypto pundit, the third-largest cryptocurrency could be on track for a rally to around $11. Related Reading: MARA CEO Advocates “Invest And Forget” Approach To Bitcoin, Citing Strong Historical Performance The reasoning behind this prediction is the formation of a “massive” bull pennant price pattern on the 12-hour chart. A pennant is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a price spike (the flagpole) followed by a consolidation range with converging trend lines (the pennant) followed by a price breakout in the same direction as the initial flagpole. The pennant pattern looks similar to a bull flag, except that the latter’s consolidation range looks like a rectangle rather than a triangle. The bull pennant similarly serves as a continuation pattern, indicating the persistence of an upward trend. From the highlighted chart above, the relevant level to watch here is the $2.73 level, which is a significant resistance region. According to Martinez, a price correction to $2.05 is possible if the XRP witnesses rejection around the $2.73 mark. If the XRP price successfully breaches and closes above the $2.73 level, the altcoin could travel to a new all-time high of $11. This represents an over 350% rally from the current price point. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of XRP stands at around $2.42, reflecting a 1% decline in the past 24 hours. This decline has yet to impact the weekly performance of the altcoin, with the XRP price up by more than 16% in the last seven days.

In particular, prominent cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez has pointed out that ETH has been trading within an ascending parallel channel since June 2022, creating a pattern that could pave the way for the $6,000 target, he said in an X post on January 5. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts An ascending parallel channel is a bullish pattern signaling higher highs and lows, indicating steady upward momentum and a long-term uptrend. Price consolidations within the channel often present buying opportunities. As long as the channel holds, it suggests continued growth and potential breakouts. The analyst noted that Ethereum’s price has consistently followed this pattern. Recently, Ethereum encountered resistance around the $4,000 level, leading to a temporary pullback. However, the channel’s midline has acted as a solid support zone, preventing deeper declines. Martinez stated that this midline support is crucial for the record-high target. Notably, this $6,000 target aligns with the channel’s upper boundary, suggesting a potential surge of over 50% from current levels. More bullish outlook for ETH Meanwhile, another price outlook by pseudonymous cryptocurrency trading expert CryptoELITES in an X post on January 4 backed the bullish outlook for ETH. The analyst noted that Ethereum has been forming a symmetrical triangle pattern for months, and the asset is now approaching a key resistance level that could trigger significant upward momentum. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView /CryptoElites To this end, the analyst noted that the next key targets to look out for include $5,000, $7,500, and potentially even $15,000 if the rally gains enough traction. As things stand, Ethereum’s next key target is at the $4,000 level, and if historical performance replicates, this level is potentially achievable in January 2025. Specifically, January has historically emerged as one of the strongest months for ETH. For instance, in the last eight years, the asset had positive returns in January in five of those years. Overall, Ethereum’s average return in January is 21.2%. The highest return was 78.51% in 2021, followed by 52.01% in 2018 and 39.28% in 2020, all setting bullish trends. However, negative returns occurred in 2022 (-26.89%) and 2019 (-20.23%), reflecting occasional volatility. ETH monthly returns.

Specifically, the asset’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) sits at $3,518.40, slightly below the current price, reinforcing the upward trend. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA is at $3,051.34, further supporting long-term bullish sentiment.

In 2027, it will range between $29.33 and $35.91, with an average price of $30.18. In 2030, it will range between $89.95 and $109.65, with an average price of $92.60. Aptos has aggressively attracted capital into its ecosystem with its total value locked (TVL) rising above $1 billion. Aptos is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain with a mature ecosystem comprising a variety of decentralized decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Aptos Ticker APT Current price $9.82 Market cap $5.48B Trading volume $247.65M Circulating supply 558.49M All-time high $19.90 on Jan 30, 2023 All-time low $3.09 on Dec 30, 2022 24-hour high $10.05 24-hour low $9.70 Aptos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 18.96% 50-day SMA $11.74 200-day SMA $8.77 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) Aptos price analysis At press time on January 5, Aptos traded at $9.80, a 0.88% rise in 24 hours, with its trading volume dropping by 18.96%. The price chart shows that Aptos could be heading for a retest after a daily breakout. Aptos 1-day chart price analysis APT/USD 1- day chart. Source: TradingView At current levels, Aptos is recovering from the month’s low at $8.42. The William Alligator trendlines are closing signaling waning volatility, while the relative strength index is now in neutral territory. The MACD histogram indicator signals positive price momentum. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis Aptos/ USD 4-hour chart. TradingView The 4-hour chart differs from the daily chart with rising volatility and positive price momentum on the MACD histograms. If Apto’s price drops, watch the $8.5 level on the chart at the channel’s lower trendline. The cryptocurrency could find resistance near a range of narrow consolidation. Investors should monitor the $10.0 level upon an upside revival. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from an earlier high at the flattening 200-day EMA.

Our analysis shows a bearish market sentiment, while the Fear and Greed Index shows greed among investors. The charts also show APT continues to register positive momentum. Why is Aptos up? Aptos was bullish in the last quarter of 2024. The wider crypto market shared a similar sentiment despite a correction into 2025. Is Aptos a good investment? APTOS’s design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and upgradeability. It is notable for using the MOVE programming language, developed by Facebook and now META. While the current trend is bearish, predictions paint a different narrative. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will Aptos reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach the $100 mark in 2031. Will Aptos reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that Aptos will get to $1000 before 2031. Does Aptos have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, Aptos will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Recent news: CEO Mohammad Shaikh resigns Mohammad Shaikh, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs, has resigned from the top position to “start a new chapter,” with co-founder and chief technology officer Avery Ching taking over as the CEO.

Miners are stuck in the endless loop of having to procure more efficient miners. Increased competition from countries with cheap electricity like Kazakhstan and Russia.

Click here to find out more » This is my first coverage of Bitfarms (BITF), so I will not go into their story so far; there are other articles that explain it well. I want to focus on recent events from operations, the recently announced merger, and my opinion on how it will affect the company's future. Operations Bitfarms managed to increase their revenues from 41.5M in Q2 to 44.9M in Q3, while operating loss worsened from 23.7M to 39.4M in Q3. This clearly reflects a steep decrease in hashprice. Increases in revenues were mainly due to increased hashrate - it rose from 10.4 EH/s to 11.9 EH/s. Bitcoin's average hashprice between March 30th and June 30th was around 70 USD/PHS/DAY, between June 30th and September 30th, it was 45 USD/PHS/DAY, according to the hashrate index and the author's calculations. Between September 30th and December 27th, hashprice was around 53 USD/PHS/DAY, which will play an important role in Q4. But the question is, what will the hashprice be a year from now? To start, hashprice is based on four factors: BTC price, network difficulty, transaction fees, and block subsidies (currently it is at 3.125 BTC per block, and the next ""halving"" is projected for April 2028-so I will ignore it for now). BTC price rose 119% YTD (Chart 1); it is currently sitting at $92,800 per BTC. It is hard to say where the price will be in a year, but historically, it tended to rise significantly before making a pullback and consolidating for a year or two (Chart 2). I believe history will repeat itself, and BTC price will stabilize, make a pullback, and that will negatively impact the hashprice in the next year, maybe two, before BTC rises further. Chart 1 (Yahoo Finance) Chart 2 (Yahoo Finance) Second, the network difficulty rises when hashrate increases. Historically, it has been increasing steadily (Chart 3), and I surmise it will continue to do so, again negatively impacting the hashprice. Chart 3 - BTC Network Hash Rate (YCharts) Third are the transaction fees, which tend to spike when the BTC price is rising exponentially (compare Charts 2 and 4). Currently, they are at around 5% of the total block income, and without further spikes in BTC price or hype around events like runes or NFTs, I believe fees will remain under 10% of the block income, thus minimally affecting hashprice. Chart 4 - Transaction fees as % of total block income (Bitbo) From the points I stated above, we can surmise BTC hashrate will remain steady or will be lower in the foreseeable future (1-2 years), thus negatively impacting revenues. Since in Q4 hashprice was higher than in Q3 but lower than Q2, the company will probably improve net loss a bit in Q4, while remaining far from profitability. To achieve net profit, hashprice would need to increase dramatically, which I find unlikely as discussed above. This makes the business model currently unsustainable, which may be why the company is looking to expand its business into the HPC/AI territory, as I will discuss. Additionally, the company likes to state how total cash cost per BTC is lower than average revenue per BTC (Table 1-Q3 Earnings Report), while producing a negative gross margin of 26% for Q3 (Table 2-Q3 Earnings Report) and negative 25% for the nine months ended September 30th. Operating margins are looking even worse at -81% in Q3. Current cash cost may be lower, but cash cost doesn't include depreciation and amortization, which is included in the operating margin. To me, it looks like the company wants to redirect attention to other metrics that look more favorable. Table 1 (Q3 Earnings report) Table 2 (Source Q3 Earnings report) Unlike some other companies, notably CleanSpark (CLSK), Bitfarms is selling most of its BTC assets. In Q3 they sold 461 BTC, while adding only 41 BTC to the treasury for a total of 1188 BTC held in the treasury. The total value of said BTC is $109 million (calculated on December 27th-$92,000/BTC)-which is currently 14% of their market cap. CleanSpark has, for example, 29% of their market cap in BTC and is in the long term in a much better position to benefit from BTC price increases than Bitfarms. I also argue that Bitfarms has the lowest TTM operating margins compared to the other US-listed BTC miners, making it the least attractive (Chart 5). Chart 5 - Operating margins of BTC miners (Author's work based on data from Seeking Alpha) Planned upgrades and increases in mining efficiency Currently, the company is replacing Bitmain T21 Miners with Bitmain S21 Pro Miners. Bitfarms will be installing more powerful and efficient S21 Pro miners, operating at 234 TH/s and 15 w/TH, which represents a 20% improvement from the T21 miners in both energy efficiency and hashrate. CEO of Bitfarms Ben Gagnon talks about this in the interview with Bryce McNallie. He outlines the possibility of either improving energy efficiency or reducing electrical costs. Currently, they are mostly working on improving energy efficiency with the new miners while their cost of electricity rose. But in my opinion, so is the competition; bitcoin miner efficiency is constantly improving, with more advanced ASICs, while mining companies are stuck in the constant loop of having to replace old miners. Acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining Bitfarms announced the acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) in an all-stock transaction, with the goal of increasing its energy portfolio to over 950 MW by the end of 2025. Stronghold Digital has, in total, two waste coal power plants in Pennsylvania that are burning leftover coal from the coal miners. After the merger, they will have 65% of electricity generation in North America, while the rest is in Latin America. The company likes to offer the story of a transformative acquisition for a variety of reasons, from environmental leadership to power grid energy trading and HPC & AI. In my opinion, both power plants ( Scrubgrass plant and Panther Creek plant ) are relics of the past, not the datacenter power plants of the future, and Stronghold's operating loss proves it, as I will discuss. In my opinion, Stronghold Digital Mining has similar problems as Bitfarms, declining profitability (in the last quarter, a negative operating margin of 206%) and strong competition from countries with cheap and abundant energy resources like Kazakhstan and Russia ( legalized cryptocurrency mining in November 2024). After the merger, Bitfarms will do their best to improve margins and unlock synergies. Most likely, they will reduce SG&A expenses. But even if all of the Stronghold's Selling, General & Administrative expenses are absorbed into the current Bitfarms expenses, the Stronghold part of the merged company will still have a negative 103% margin. Can merging two unprofitable companies create synergies and improve margins? Yes. Do I believe it will make a meaningful difference? No. Competition from countries like Kazakhstan and Russia Russia and Kazakhstan have around 25% of the total global hashrate . Note that this data is before Russia officially legalized BTC mining in November 2024, and their market share is bound to increase in 2025, due to both cheap electricity and as a means to bypass western sanctions. Electricity in Russia currently costs $0.054 per kWH for residential customers and $0.067 for businesses; in Kazakhstan it costs $0.046 per kWh for residential customers and $0.074, while in the US the average is $0.169 per kWh. This makes BTC mining in the US much less profitable. HPC/AI opportunity The company states during the Q3 earnings call that they plan to disrupt the datacenter and AI industry with a hybrid AI/BTC mining/HPC combination. Currently, they are planning a 1-2 MW pilot site (Slide 1) to evaluate datacenter opportunity and possibly get some smaller contracts. I believe for BTC miners, there is a long-term opportunity in the HPC market, possibly much more profitable compared to BTC mining. Slide 1 (Company's presentation) One example in the industry would be Hut 8, a Canadian BTC miner, that in June 2023 signed an agreement with Canadian health authority Interior Health to provide colocation services from its Kelowna data center until 2028; in the last quarter they launched a GPU-as-a-Service business. Their gross margin from the HPC segment sits at 23% in Q3 2024. They didn't provide details about operating expenses for the specific segment, so it's hard to estimate the segment's profitability. I cannot deny there is an opportunity in the datacenter operations, but I believe it's still too early to put the money behind the company's plans; there are just too many unknowns. I'd prefer to wait for the results from the pilot plant and then do a reevaluation to see if there is indeed an opportunity. As soon as we have some results from the pilot plant and the water is clearer, I will provide a reevaluation. Risks to my theory The highest risk to my short theory would be continued BTC price appreciation and subsequently for the hashprice to increase. But for the reasons stated above, I find meaningfully higher hashprice unlikely. Second is the possibility of a short squeeze. The latest short interest data indicates short interest at 10%; for me, that indicates low risk of a short squeeze. Trading plan The company is currently at the YTD lows. I plan to see how it will react at this price; hopefully, we'll see a bounce toward $1.80-1.90, in which case I'd love to add to my short position. I plan to hold my short position until I see some data from their HPC pilot plant; success there could present an opportunity and trend reversal, but until that happens (mid to late 2025), I am bearish.",BITF|BITF:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-05 11:20:45

Recent developments in regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and political shifts are shaping Bitcoin’s future, with some analysts projecting new highs in 2025. Trump’s Impact on Bitcoin’s Growth Donald Trump’s re-election in November has significantly influenced BTC’s rally. Previously a critic of cryptocurrencies, Trump has shifted gears, calling for the U.S. to become “the crypto capital of the planet.” His administration has nominated Paul Atkins , a well-known crypto advocate, as SEC Chair, fostering optimism for favorable regulatory changes. The countdown has begon! Paul Atkins is soon in office and will change the crypto landscape #PaulAtkins #Trump #SEC pic.twitter.com/T1nsaDIeqG — Paul Atkins – SEC Chair (@paulatkinsx) January 5, 2025 With discussions of a potential strategic BTC reserve circulating in Washington, the U.S. government’s backing of Bitcoin could further bolster its market position. Pieran Maru, a fund manager at Liontrust, notes, “The incoming Trump administration could create the most crypto-friendly environment in the world, setting the stage for exponential growth.” The potential for U.S. government involvement in Bitcoin is seen as a game-changer, likely to encourage broader adoption and stabilize its position as a globally recognized asset. Updated Institutional Adoption Accelerates Bitcoin’s Legitimacy Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, driven by the rising adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs. As of January 3, 2025, Bitcoin ETFs manage $113.52 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), with net inflows of $907.3 million on the same day, underscoring robust demand from institutional investors. Spot ETFs have simplified access to Bitcoin for banks, pension funds, and hedge funds, cementing its role in mainstream finance. BlackRock’s research highlights Bitcoin’s diversification benefits, noting that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio offers a risk-reward profile comparable to leading tech stocks. Regulatory shifts further support Bitcoin’s legitimacy. The U.S. SEC is advancing crypto-friendly policies, while the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority is easing restrictions. Combined with growing ETF inflows, these factors reinforce Bitcoin’s standing as a credible institutional asset. Bitcoin’s Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Bitcoin is testing key resistance near $98,000, a level reinforced by a downward trendline. Immediate resistance levels stand at $98,000, followed by $100,071 and $102,010. On the downside, support zones are positioned at $96,375, $95,446, and $93,344. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 58, reflecting neutral momentum, while Bitcoin remains above its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $96,375. This suggests moderate bullish sentiment but also highlights the importance of breaking the $98,000 resistance to unlock further upside potential. $BEST Wallet: Web3 Simplified, $6.27M Raised in Presale Best Wallet is redefining Web3 with an innovative platform that supports thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Altcoin season looms as Bitcoin’s rally sparks capital inflows. XRP, Litecoin, and iDEGEN lead the top altcoins to watch. Table of Contents Best altcoins to invest in for 2025: Top 3 picks iDEGEN: The most exciting new AI crypto project dominating X XRP: Best performing altcoin in the top 10 Litecoin: Is a resurgence in the works? The final word In case someone has been living under a rock, the altcoin season is about to break out. Bitcoin kicked off what could be the definitive altcoin season of the ages after hitting new all-time highs earlier in December, resulting in capital inflows spilling over into altcoins. XRP and Litecoin, in particular, became some of the best altcoins to buy this month, with both tokens making substantial gains. Retail investors are following suit and looking for new altcoins to buy — and people can best believe everyone is sifting through stacks, looking for the best altcoins to invest in. However, one new altcoin looks like it could quickly outperform the top 10 altcoins in terms of price appreciation potential in the form of iDEGEN , topping the list of our top 3 altcoins to buy in 2025. Here’s why. You might also like: iDEGEN’s viral surge: exploring the potential of the next big AI token Best altcoins to invest in for 2025: Top 3 picks Altcoins are a dime a dozen — but if those who are looking for the ones that can bring in substantial gains, these three choice cuts could make a nice addition to a portfolio ahead of 2025. iDEGEN : The most exciting new AI crypto project dominating X XRP: Best performing altcoin in the top 10 Litecoin: Is a resurgence in the works? iDEGEN: The most exciting new AI crypto project dominating X The term “revolutionary” is thrown around so much in crypto circles that the word has lost all meaning. If every new crypto is radical, what’s left? But every so often, one crypto befitting of the title comes around — and it’s right at the intersection of the extremely lucrative AI and meme coin narratives. Enter iDEGEN , a new AI agent conducting what could be a truly transforming social experiment. iDEGEN was created with a blank slate and zero corporate guardrails and censorship to blunt its sophisticated large language model (LLM). iDEGEN publishes tweets, creates viral images (and soon videos) with its generative AI functionality, and responds to every single @ or mention. Here’s the interesting part: it’s training its algorithms on the madness that is Crypto Twitter. Completely unfiltered and uncensored, iDEGEN is an exercise in the capability of AI without political correctness and woke culture — and it’s already gone viral with some of the most based and redpilled takes ever seen from an AI agent . Better yet, no one knows how far it can and will go. More importantly, iDEGEN lays down a marker by taking a state-of-the-art AI directly to the masses instead of moderating it like a caffeinated tech exec. The early traction has already translated to $8.6m raised in its native token IDGN’s adaptively priced auction, where token prices are dictated solely by market forces. No VC shenanigans, no programmed increases, no vesting periods — just the invisible hand working its magic. iDEGEN offers greater upside than other altcoins that have already peaked and are just chasing past glories that may never return. Still sitting at a low market cap and in its pre-market sale, iDEGEN is virtually programmed for a parabolic pump by sitting right at the forefront of meme coin virality and AI sophistication. Those who are looking for the best new altcoin to invest in ahead of 2025, only have one shot at iDEGEN before it hits exchanges. XRP: Best performing altcoin in the top 10 XRP had long been underperforming relative to other altcoins that pumped all year long. However, XRP shed its laggard status by turning in upwards of 4x in the final quarter of 2024, outperforming the rest of its competition within the top 10 altcoins by market cap. One of the key factors driving XRP buy-side pressure is the prospect of a pro-crypto administration taking over in January and putting the drawn-out SEC vs. XRP lawsuit to a conclusion. While no one expects XRP to go anywhere realistically further from 2x to 4x at most from its current prices, those gains are nothing to sneeze at for a big-cap altcoin. Litecoin: Is a resurgence in the works? Litecoin , in many ways, is a victim of its success. Forking from the original Bitcoin ledger in the Wild West days of crypto, Litecoin differentiated itself as a faster, more scalable version of Bitcoin suitable for online payments as the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold.” The trouble with investing in Litecoin as a speculative investment is its growth upside is limited by its widespread use. If no one is holding Litecoin for speculation and instead uses it for online payments, there is little value to be extracted for long-term holders expecting gains. However, after a solid pump past the $100 range in December, Litecoin could, in theory, retest its 2021 all-time highs of $410 in 2025…which isn’t a bad return. The final word XRP and Litecoin are solid investments as far as high caps are concerned. But iDEGEN easily trumps them as far as a ceiling for price appreciation is concerned. iDEGEN has the tech, the narrative, and the community backing — not to mention it being a micro-cap.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 11:42:12

The token’s performance did not start in the new year, bringing its momentum from last year, when it became the go-to option for South Koreans. According to several reports , the token’s trading volume leapfrogged Bitcoin and Ethereum in the country heading into the new year. This trend is evident in the token’s trading volume against the Korean won on prominent South Korean exchanges. XRP trading volume surges on South Korean exchanges According to data tracking the trading volumes of South Korean exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone, XRP’s trading volume has been on a heater. On Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in the country, XRP’s trading volume is around $591 million, ranking above Dogecoin’s volume at $340 million. Bitcoin ranks further down in the trading volume category, boasting a small figure above $133 million. These stats reflect the country’s crypto crowd’s affinity for XRP. The market has been responsible for several rallies over the last few years. Aside from Upbit, the trend is also evident on other exchanges in the country. The token’s rise has seen it hit different significant price milestones, setting it up firmly in the top 10 of digital assets according to market cap. However, the rally had intermittent drops which saw the asset initially drop below the $2 mark before surging by 24% to trade close to $2.50. The rebound also comes after the asset dipped for nearly a month after hitting a high of $2.90. While some market participants attributed the rally to Donald Trump’s emergence as the President in the United States election last year, others attributed it to the likelihood of a favorable verdict in Ripple’s legal tussle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Analysts make bold predictions The recent XRP rise has sparked optimism in the market, as analysts and experts are starting to make favorable predictions. Some believe that XRP is primed for further gains, noting that the asset could be targeting $4.11 and $5.85. More bullish predictions have made $8 price target calls for the end of the year, contingent on the global crypto market hitting a $5 trillion valuation. These price calls also depend on XRP maintaining its popularity in the market, especially in the cross-border payments scene. XRP’s dominance in South Korea also shows the asset’s appeal in one of the leading crypto markets worldwide. With its trading volume on the way up, and experts making renewed optimistic predictions, XRP could well be prepared for an interesting year ahead. Meanwhile, for that to happen, it would need to get its legal battle with the SEC sorted. With Donald Trump at the helm of affairs at the White House, there have been predictions about the SEC possibly dropping the case. With SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his way out, the incoming pro-crypto Paul Atkins may want to use the Ripple case as a show of good faith to the crypto industry, showing them what the Trump administration has in store for them.

These wallets collectively made over $20 million in profit trading FOCAI, a memecoin recently launched on Solana’s memecoin platform Pump.fun. The insiders allegedly achieved a 136,000-fold return on their investment, controlling over 60.5% of the token supply, according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. “They then sold all their $FOCAI for 94,175 $SOL ($20.5M), netting 94,108 $SOL ($20.48M),” Lookonchain reported. The large concentration of FOCAI tokens in a few wallets has drawn criticism from analysts, highlighting risks to decentralization—a key principle in cryptocurrency. FOCAI’s market capitalization peaked at over $46 million at 4:45 am UTC before falling nearly 14% to $39.6 million by 11:55 am UTC, according to Pump.fun data. One Wallet Profits $3.5M in Three Hours Among the 15 wallets, one address, labeled “9DtTb,” made $3.47 million within three hours. Onchain Lens, a blockchain analytics platform, explained, “The insider bought 123.32M $FOCAI for 5.39 SOL ($1,168) on Pump.fun. The insider then sold the entire $FOCAI for 16,070 SOL worth $3.47M, making a x2973 profit.” Memecoins: High Gains for Few, Losses for Many While memecoins like FOCAI can yield massive profits for a select few, most traders incur losses. Over 99% of traders on Pump.fun are unprofitable, with only 50 wallets generating up to $1,000 in returns out of 9.8 million.

Shiba Inu: The Ethereum-based meme coin with growing potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, making it compatible with Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem. It started with 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to build trust. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and decentralized governance system. This integration offers potential for broader utility in the crypto space, making SHIB an interesting option in the current market. PEPE meme coin: Deflationary tribute to Pepe the Frog on Ethereum PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme. Inspired by the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE distinguishes itself with no transaction taxes and a commitment to its pure memecoin identity. In mid-2023, it reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, sparking enthusiasm among crypto communities. The coin’s roadmap aims to boost visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. It employs a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and a redistribution system to reward long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake security and is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. Conclusion Coins like SHIB and PEPE may have less short-term potential, but DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens, building a community of leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

Investors are closely watching the impact of Paul Atkins’ appointment as the new SEC Chair, anticipating a shift toward a more transparent and less adversarial regulatory approach. Atkins’ leadership could mark a departure from previous enforcement-heavy policies, with implications that extend well beyond Ripple’s case to the broader cryptocurrency market. The countdown has begon! Paul Atkins is soon in office and will change the crypto landscape #PaulAtkins #Trump #SEC pic.twitter.com/T1nsaDIeqG — Paul Atkins – SEC Chair (@paulatkinsx) January 5, 2025 Here’s a detailed breakdown of the case progress and its potential market impact. Ripple Case Update: SEC’s Appeal Under Review Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC remains unresolved, but new SEC leadership under Paul Atkins could shift the agency’s approach. The October appeal of the XRP ruling, following Ripple’s $125 million penalty settlement in August 2024, has extended the case. Atkins has been critical of the SEC’s enforcement-heavy tactics and may favor negotiated settlements, such as consent decrees, to balance compliance with clear regulatory guidelines. Resolving Ripple’s case could signal a more cooperative stance from the SEC, offering much-needed clarity for the crypto industry while boosting market sentiment for XRP and similar assets. Market Implications: Ripple’s Case and XRP Price Action A potential resolution in Ripple’s SEC case could significantly impact XRP’s price and broader market dynamics. If the SEC drops its appeal or settles, investor confidence may rise, attracting retail and institutional players. Analysts suggest this could signal regulatory maturity, fostering blockchain adoption in financial services. For XRP, clearing legal uncertainties would likely boost its price, though sustained growth hinges on Ripple’s ability to leverage partnerships and expand its cross-border payment applications. Such developments could also benefit other cryptocurrencies facing regulatory challenges, marking a turning point for the industry’s evolution. Daily Technical Outlook: XRP/USD – January 5, 2025 XRP is trading at $2.35, down 3.49% over the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $4.16 billion and a market cap of $134.8 billion. The token is facing strong resistance at $2.50, aligned with a descending trendline that has restricted upward momentum. A breakout above $2.50 could pave the way for targets at $2.71 and $2.90, signaling a bullish continuation. BTC/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the downside, support lies at $2.31, with additional levels at $2.23 and $2.11. The RSI at 48 indicates neutral momentum, while the 50-day EMA at $2.31 provides short-term stability. Key Insights: Resistance Levels: Immediate resistance at $2.50; a breakout could target $2.71 and $2.90. Support Levels: Key support at $2.31, with additional levels at $2.23 and $2.11. Market Outlook: Regulatory clarity could act as a major catalyst for XRP, but near-term price action hinges on breaking $2.50.

Its next significant trend depends on the potential direction toward which the range would break out. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart After failing to breach the critical $3 resistance, XRP has entered a consolidation phase within the decisive $2-$3 range. During this period, the price has formed a sideways wedge pattern. The cryptocurrency recently found support at the wedge’s lower boundary near $2, followed by a bullish surge toward the upper trendline around $2.3. A breakout above the wedge’s top boundary could signal further upward momentum, potentially propelling XRP toward the $3 resistance level. Conversely, a rejection at this threshold would likely prolong the consolidation phase in the short term. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights a strong support region defined by the 0.5 ($2) and 0.618 ($1.9) Fibonacci retracement levels. This zone has consistently acted as the primary defense for the buyers, preventing significant price declines. Recently, XRP rebounded from there, triggering an influx of buying activity and initiating a bullish reversal. Despite this recovery, the altcoin remains confined within the $2-$3 range. Buyers are making attempts to push the price toward the upper boundary, but a valid breakout is required to determine the its next major move. Until such a breakout occurs, heightened volatility and continued consolidation are expected.

Recent trading data shows that XRP is witnessing intense sell-side pressure. Is XRP price at risk of double-digit losses in the week ahead? XRP Price Retraces 7% as Profit-Taking Begins XRP price action has experienced downward volatility in the last 24 hours, after a remarkable start to 2025. As the global crypto market rally entered its 5th day, investors began to reshuffle capital across the markets, with the likes of XRP and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) witnessing bearish tailwinds. XRP Price Action | XRPUSD The TradingView chart above illustrates how XRP prices climbed 25% between December 30 and January 4. But after a 5-day winning streak, early profit-taking signals have emerged as XRP price retraced 7% from $2.50 to $2.33 in the last 24 hours. With the broader crypto market sentiment still largely positive, recent declines in XRP transaction volumes suggest traders could be rotating gains towards other assets. CryptoQuant Data Signals Growing Sell-Side Pressure Failure to breach the $2.50 resistance on January 4 has dampened bullish momentum within the XRP markets over the last 24 hours. However, derivatives markets data show active holders ramped up sell-side pressure since January 2. Indicatively, CryptoQuant’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio tracks and compares the volume of buy orders to sell orders executed at current market rates. Taker Buy/Sell ratio values below 1 signal bearish dominance, where sellers exiting at current prices outpace willing buyers. Ripple (XRP) Taker Buy/Sell Ratio | Source: CryptoQuant The chart above shows that XRP Taker Buy/Sell ratio fell as low as 0.93 on Sunday, January 5, signaling that sell order volumes have outpaced demand in each of the 3 previous trading days. This evidently set the stage for the 7% price dip experienced in the last 24 hours. If this shortfall in market demand persists relative to supply, XRP prices could face additional downside risks in the week ahead. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Could Regroup at $2.20 Support Level XRP’s recent 7% price dip has been driven by a rapid profit-taking frenzy, with the Taker Buy/Sell ratio dropping to 0.93 as of January 5. This indicates a consistent dominance of sell orders over buy orders in the past three trading days, leading to intensified downward pressure. If this imbalance between supply and demand persists, XRP could face further declines in the short term. Trading volumes have been gradually decreasing, signaling weak participation from both buyers and sellers. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending downward at 53.69, suggesting more downside potential before approaching oversold territories. In terms of short-term XRP price forecasts, immediate support lies at $2.27, which aligns with the lower Bollinger Band. A breach below that key XRP support level could extend the reversal toward $1.85. XRP Price Forecast | XRPUSD On the upside, the recent peak at $2.50, which aligns with the middle Bollinger Band, acts as immediate resistance. A sustained recovery above this level could pave the way for XRP to retake the $3 mark. If XRP rebounds from $2.20 and buyers regain dominance, the price could climb back toward $2.35, and a breakout above $2.52 would invalidate the bearish outlook. However, if selling pressure continues and XRP loses $2.20 support, the next leg down to $1.85 could materialize quickly.

Table of Contents DTX Exchange to see more price pumps in presale Dany: The next Shiba Inu price surge is coming Analyst says Solana looks ready for a generational price run Which crypto coin may stand out – DTX Exchange, Shiba Inu or Solana? The crypto market had a rough time before 2025 started. Many of the top crypto coins showed red price charts. But now that the storm has passed, some of them are rebounding. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Solana (SOL) stand out. Even market analysts like Dany and Dubzy have made bold price predictions for SHIB and SOL. However, all eyes are on DTX Exchange (DTX) . This project has managed to give early buyers a 600% return. Many investors think DTX could have a higher upside potential in 2025 as it will change online trading. You might also like: Trump presidency could open floodgates for XRP; DTX to hit $1 after Coinbase listing DTX Exchange to see more price pumps in presale As Shiba Inu and Solana continue riding a bullish wave, DTX Exchange is becoming one of the hottest presales. This crypto ICO event has already rewarded early investors with a 600% return while raising over $11M. Many have seen big gains, with over 300K active wallets holding DTX. Hype is growing for DTX Exchange as the project prepares to launch its hybrid trading platform in Q1 of 2025. This platform will allow users to trade over 120K asset classes like gold and crypto coins in total privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. The testnet for the blockchain that will power this platform, VulcanX, has already launched, too, surpassing 100K TPS. The DTX token will also be a big part of its ecosystem. It now costs just $0.14. This altcoin price will rise to $0.16 after phase eight begins. Demand is so high for DTX that even CoinMarketCap listed it. However, everyone is waiting for a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap to list DTX. This may spike its value to $0.20. This growth makes DTX one of the best cryptos this year. Dany: The next Shiba Inu price surge is coming Shiba Inu is among the meme coin titans that are now rebounding after its downtrend in Q4 2024. CoinMarketCap shows that its value moved between nearly $0.0000223 and over $0.000023 in the past week alone. This is around a 3% increase in just a few short days. Crypto analyst Dany also excited traders with his Shiba Inu price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers he now sees a strong, bullish candlestick. Dany says the next surge could be around the corner as the Shiba Inu price may reach $0.000032. Although the Shiba Inu coin may surge soon, its high market cap may slow its growth. Currently, it sits at $13B, which means this meme coin will need a lot of new funds for its price to skyrocket. However, tokens like DTX will not have this problem and may rise faster. Analyst says Solana looks ready for a generational price run Solana is another altcoin that has seen some gains recently. On the one-week chart, the price of Solana increased nearly 10% as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value moved between $190 and over $210. Market expert Dubzy also remains optimistic for Solana. According to his X post, this crypto coin looks ready for a generational run. As a Solana price prediction, he said it may even reach $900 by June 2025. Even if the Solana crypto may see a good rise soon, many investors have noted that DTX has some advantages. For instance, while Solana can handle around 65K TPS, the DTX has peaked at 100K TPS. Which crypto coin may stand out – DTX Exchange, Shiba Inu or Solana? Shiba Inu and Solana are top tokens in the crypto arena, but DTX Exchange stands out. It will introduce something new to online trading while tapping into many trillion-dollar markets like the $18T gold one. Plus, its great presale performance so far could suggest sky-high demand for it. As it grows, so will its value. Thus, market analysts predict a potential 3x surge for DTX that will come faster than both SHIB and SOL in 2025.

(BTC Price Analysis),https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-about-to-explode-above-100k-soon-btc-price-analysis/,"Bitcoin has continued to receive substantial support around the $90K level, sparking a slight recovery. However, the prevailing bullish momentum appears insufficient to trigger a fresh rally toward a new all-time high, suggesting the likelihood of consolidation within this area in the short term. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart After a period of decline, Bitcoin has found strong support at the critical $90K region, highlighting the presence of buyers at this level. This support aligns with the middle threshold of its multi-year ascending channel, reinforcing its significance. Despite a slight increase in buying pressure resulting in a minor bullish rebound, the current momentum remains subdued, suggesting a continuation of the consolidation near this support zone. For Bitcoin to initiate a new rally and aim for a new all-time high, the market must witness heightened demand and stronger bullish momentum. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, the $90K support level emerges as a pivotal defence zone, as evidenced by its role in halting the downward pressure over recent months. The price action has recently formed an inverted head and shoulders pattern near this level, accompanied by an accumulation phase, signalling a potential bullish resurgence. However, increased market demand and buying activity are necessary for BTC to break out and target the significant $108K resistance. Until then, the cryptocurrency will likely consolidate within the $90K region, awaiting a more evident directional move. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan American investors, particularly U.S. institutions, play a significant role in driving market movements. Consequently, analyzing their behaviour can provide valuable insights for predicting short-term market trends. The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index is a critical metric that compares buying and selling pressure on Coinbase, a U.S.-centric exchange, against Binance. The chart reveals that the Coinbase Premium Index has recently seen a notable increase, breaking above its 14-day Simple Moving Average for the first time in recent months. The index has approached values of zero, which indicates a shift in market dynamics, with U.S.-based buyers showing renewed interest and exerting buying pressure.

However, as 2025 begins, Ethereum is starting to show signs of recovery, gaining over 10% in less than a week. This early surge has rekindled hope among investors and analysts who see potential for a strong performance this year. Related Reading: Dogecoin Explodes Overnight – Price Action Suggests Fresh Highs Above $0.50 Top analyst Maartunn recently shared insightful data highlighting an ongoing trend of aggressive shorting in Ethereum markets. According to Maartunn, taker sellers have been dominating the market, outpacing taker buyers by over $350 million daily. This aggressive shorting could explain Ethereum’s poor performance in 2024, as constant selling pressure likely suppressed upward momentum. With the new year’s optimism, many believe this shorting trend may begin to shift, creating conditions for Ethereum to reclaim its position as a market leader. As the altcoin leader pushes past its challenges, the coming weeks will be critical to determine whether this early rally marks the beginning of a more sustained upward trend. Investors are closely watching Ethereum, anticipating that a reversal of these bearish trends could lead to a stellar 2025 for the network. Ethereum Rising Amid Aggressive Shorting Trends Ethereum is attempting to push above its 2024 high, but a decisive breakout remains elusive. Recent price action indicates the potential for a rally, with ETH posting early gains in 2025. However, the path forward isn’t clear-cut, as significant selling pressure continues to weigh on the altcoin leader. Top analyst Maartunn recently shared insightful data from CryptoQuant, shedding light on the current market dynamics. According to the data, Ethereum is experiencing aggressive shorting, with taker sellers dominating trading activity. Over $350 million more in sell-side pressure than buy-side activity is recorded daily, creating a challenging environment for ETH to break free from its current range. This trend, while suppressing prices in the short term, can’t last indefinitely. Market cycles often see such aggressive shorting as a precursor to a reversal, as sellers run out of momentum and buying pressure begins to build. Long-term investors are reportedly eyeing this phase as an opportunity, positioning themselves to capitalize on Ethereum’s relatively low prices.

A clean breakout above last year’s high could signal the start of a broader rally, attracting renewed interest and potentially reversing the ongoing shorting trend. For now, ETH remains at a pivotal juncture. Price Testing Crucial Levels Ethereum is trading at $3,650 after a robust start to 2025, gaining significant traction in the early days of the year. The price recently broke above the 4-hour 200 EMA with impressive strength, a technical indicator often viewed as a critical threshold for long-term trends. ETH is now testing the 200 MA on the same timeframe, a level that could confirm the bullish trend if reclaimed and held as support. A strong daily close above the 200 MA would solidify Ethereum’s upward momentum, potentially paving the way for a massive rally to challenge and surpass last year’s highs. Such a move would likely reinvigorate market sentiment and attract additional buying pressure, driving Ethereum to new levels in the near term. Related Reading: Chainlink Tunrns Resistance Into Support – ATH Next? However, the bullish outlook is not without its risks. If Ethereum fails to hold the 200 MA as support, the market could witness a renewed wave of selling pressure. This would likely push ETH back toward lower levels, eroding recent gains and prolonging its battle to regain upward momentum.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 108,000 followers on the social media platform X that it’s possible the Ethereum ( ETH ) rival is forming a cup-and-handle pattern that could push it to astronomical levels. “There’s a chance SOL is forming a cup-and-handle pattern, and it will reach $4,000!” Source: Ali Martinez/X A cup and handle is typically observed when the price movement of an asset forms a “cup” pattern before printing a smaller “handle” structure which suggests consolidation prior to a potential breakout. Solana is trading for $215 at time of writing, a 1.3% decrease during the last 24 hours. If Solana were to reach Martinez’s target price, it would represent a staggering 1,760% increase. Moving on to the flagship digital asset Bitcoin ( BTC ), Martinez notes that Coinbase’s Premium Index – which tracks the price premium for BTC on Coinbase and therefore its demand in the US by proxy – suggests that institutional demand for the top crypto asset by market cap is ramping up in America. “The Coinbase Premium Index recently hit -0.23%, a two-year low, but it’s now rebounding quickly.

Table of Contents Solana’s bullish momentum- AI’s $600 price prediction The rise of Lightchain AI – A rival’s ambitious 38x growth forecast Comparing the futures- Solana vs. Lightchain AI in the crypto race ChatGPT has made bold predictions about the crypto market, expecting Solana (SOL) to reach $600 during the next bull run. Meanwhile, a rising star in the space, Lightchain AI presale , is gaining attention for its unique approach to combining blockchain and artificial intelligence. Lightchain AI (LCAI) is leveraging its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to position itself as a game-changer in the industry. Analysts are projecting an incredible 38x surge for this project, making it a hot topic among savvy investors. As blockchain adoption continues to grow, both Solana and Lightchain AI are emerging as leaders in their respective niches, offering exciting opportunities for exponential returns by 2025. You might also like: Pepe coin alternative Lightchain AI set to reach $1 by end of Q2 Solana’s bullish momentum- AI’s $600 price prediction Solana has shown a great jump in upward trend, with experts thinking big rises in price are likely. Importantly, ChatGPT sees SOL hitting $600 early 2025, pushed by signs like the cup-and-handle shape and strong growth of its system. This forecast hints at a possible rise of more than 200% from now levels. Backing this view, Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has hit a new top high of $9.215 billion, showing more use in decentralized money (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). ͏Also, Solana got 7,625 new builders in 2024, going past Ethereum and showing its growing system. The rise of Lightchain AI – A rival’s ambitious 38x growth forecast Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a formidable competitor in the cryptocurrency arena, with projections indicating a potential 38-fold increase in value. Currently priced at $0.0045 during its presale, analysts forecast that LCAI could reach $1 by the end of 2024, representing a 3,500% surge. This anticipated growth is attributed to Lightchain AI’s unique integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering real-world applications across various industries. As the project advances through its roadmap, including testnet and mainnet launches slated for early 2025, investor interest continues to rise. The presale has already garnered over $6.5 million, reflecting strong market confidence in Lightchain AI’s potential to change the crypto landscape. Comparing the futures- Solana vs. Lightchain AI in the crypto race Solana and Lightchain AI represent two distinct approaches in the evolving blockchain landscape. Solana is renowned for its high-speed transactions, capable of processing over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) through its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, making it a preferred platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In contrast, Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, introducing innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These features enable efficient AI computations and support the development of intelligent decentralized applications (dApps) across various industries, including healthcare and logistics. While Solana boasts a well-established ecosystem, it has faced challenges such as network outages and centralization concerns. Lightchain AI , though newer, emphasizes decentralized governance and sustainability, aiming to address some of the limitations observed in existing blockchain platforms. As the blockchain sector continues to innovate, both platforms offer unique value propositions, catering to different needs within the crypto community. Interested investors can join Lightchain AI’s presale and keep an eye on Solana for potential market-moving developments.

Priced at just $0.004875 per token, Lightchain AI has already raised $8 million in its presale, showcasing strong interest from whales and early adopters alike. Experts predict that this token could flip meme coins like Shiba Inu due to its practical applications and growth potential. Shiba Inu's Legacy and Current Challenges Shiba Inu (SHIB) was made in August 2020 by a person using the name ""Ryoshi."" It came to be a digital currency based on funny internet images, and it got popular fast because of its fun ͏style and loyal group of fans. Its spread-out setup, along with sites like ShibaSwap, tries to give use more than just being a funny token. Yet, SHIB has many big hurdles. The token shows wild price swings, marked by huge rises and quick drops, turning it into a risky buy. Also, its large amount of around 589 trillion tokens stops serious price growth. Larger market falls in the crypto world have also hurt SHIB's value, showing how much it reacts to general market moves. For Shiba Inu to address these challenges, it must focus on continuous innovation and the expansion of its ecosystem. Developing real-world applications and enhancing its utility will be essential for fostering long-term growth and stability. Lightchain AI's Revolutionary Approach to Blockchain In stark contrast to Shiba Inu, Lightchain AI offers a technology-driven ecosystem that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence. One standout feature is its focus on privacy-preserving AI computations. By introducing developer-friendly tools such as SDKs and APIs, Lightchain AI fosters an environment for innovation, allowing developers to build scalable and impactful decentralized applications (dApps). These practical utilities are what position Lightchain AI as a potential market leader, outpacing speculative tokens like Shiba Inu. Calculating Potential Gains From $1,000 to $50,000 by 2025 Experts estimate that Lightchain AI could witness exponential growth, driven by its strong presale performance and technological edge. A modest investment of $1,000 at the presale price of $0.004875 could translate to significant returns if the token reaches projected prices of $0.25 to $0.50 in the next two years. This kind of return dwarfs what Shiba Inu offers, especially as the latter faces stiff competition from innovative projects like Lightchain AI . Analysts believe that this token's ability to address real-world challenges could drive adoption, leading to a potential 5,000% growth or higher by 2025. By focusing on innovation and real-world applications, Lightchain AI is quickly positioning itself as a token that could redefine the altcoin market. If Shiba Inu remains stagnant in terms of development, it may soon lose its crown to this emerging powerhouse. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 13:01:00

Out of 72 economists surveyed, 46% reportedly believe the ECB has “fallen behind the curve.” They argue its policies don’t match the dire state of the economy. Only 43% said the ECB’s approach was “on the right track,” while a resounding zero respondents felt it was ahead of economic trends. Since June, the ECB has trimmed rates four times, dropping them from 4% to 3%. These cuts followed a rapid decline in inflation, but instead of stabilizing the economy, the Eurozone’s outlook has weakened some more. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the Eurozone economy will grow just 1.2% this year. The economists are even less optimistic, expecting a mere 0.9%. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is predicted to grow at 2.2% in the same period. Economists call ECB’s strategy too slow Karsten Junius, chief economist at J Safra Sarasin, thinks the problem lies in how decisions are made. He pointed out the ECB’s governing council has too many members, making it slower than the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Swiss National Bank. Junius also called out ECB President Christine Lagarde’s leadership style, which prioritizes consensus over speed. The bank’s cautious steps have not gone unnoticed either. UniCredit’s chief economist Erik Nielsen said, “As soon as the risk of de-anchoring inflation expectations evaporated, they should [have] cut rates as fast as possible.” Instead, the ECB opted for gradual adjustments that critics argue are doing more harm than good. Sluggish growth, inflation, and political risks The gap between the Eurozone and the U.S. is growing, and economists expect the ECB to play catch-up for years. Markets anticipate the ECB will deliver four or five more 25 basis-point cuts by the end of 2025. This contrasts sharply with the Fed, which is only expected to lower rates twice late this year. Average inflation in the Eurozone is predicted to drop to 2.1% this year, just above the ECB’s target. By 2026, inflation is forecast to reach 2%, but the path there is uncertain. Not all economists are on board with rate cuts. Willem Buiter, a former Citi economist, said the ECB’s current 3% rate might already be too low. He pointed to core inflation sticking at 2.7% and the Eurozone’s record-low unemployment of 6.3%. France has become another major headache for the ECB. For the first time, economists see France as more at risk than Italy for a sudden sell-off in government bonds. 58% of survey respondents named France as their top concern, compared to just 7% for Italy. The change comes as French politics remain in chaos. A deficit-cutting budget proposed by former Prime Minister Michel Barnier sparked a crisis, leading to his government’s collapse. Economists are worried that rising debt levels and populist policies could trigger a financial crisis. Lena Komileva, chief economist at (g+)economics, warned of “capital flight and market volatility” due to France’s instability. However, Ulrike Kastens of DWS was more optimistic, saying the ECB has tools to manage any fallout, unlike during the debt crisis of the 2010s. ECB under pressure as inflation challenges loom New inflation data expected could complicate the ECB’s task even further. Consumer prices are forecast to have risen 2.4% in December, up slightly from 2.3% the month before. Core inflation, which excludes energy and volatile items, is predicted to stay stuck at 2.7%. Fuel costs are partly to blame for the stubborn inflation. Rising gas prices and looming U.S. trade tariffs add to the uncertainty. Lagarde has acknowledged the challenges but remains hopeful that inflation will hit the 2% target by late 2025. In a video posted on X for Christmas, Lagarde said, “We have made significant progress in 2024 in bringing down inflation. Hopefully, 2025 is the year when we are on target as expected and as planned in our strategy.” 2024 was an eventful year, and 2025 promises to be just as exciting. I wish you all a Happy New Year! pic.twitter.com/uFzMoQ23iB — Christine Lagarde (@Lagarde) January 1, 2025 Still, investors and economists remain divided on how the ECB should proceed. Markets expect rates to fall to 1.75%-2% by 2026, but only 19% of economists believe the ECB will continue cutting that far into the future. Meanwhile, the ECB has avoided giving clear guidance on the timing or pace of rate cuts. Lagarde’s “meeting-by-meeting” approach leaves analysts guessing. Investors are waiting to see if the bank will take bolder action or stick to its incremental strategy. Despite mounting concerns, the ECB has yet to signal it will use its Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) to stabilize bond markets. Only 19% of economists see the bank resorting to emergency measures this year, even with the risks in France and elsewhere.

Polygon: Enhancing Ethereum with faster and cheaper transactions Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is a layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to improve the Ethereum ecosystem by providing faster transactions and lower fees. POL is Polygon’s native cryptocurrency used for network fees, staking, and governance. The platform uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, allowing users to earn rewards by staking POL. Validators secure the network and process transactions, while delegators can stake their POL with trusted validators. Polygon’s efficient and low-cost infrastructure has made it popular for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other applications. By enhancing scalability and accessibility, Polygon’s technology holds significant potential in addressing blockchain scalability challenges. Polkadot: Enhancing blockchain interoperability and scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that connects different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. It allows value and data to be shared securely without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to increase speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking, letting holders participate in the network’s development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem. The technology’s potential lies in its ability to solve interoperability and scalability issues. In the current market cycle, DOT appears attractive due to its innovative approach. BNB: Binance’s native cryptocurrency with expanding utility and deflationary supply BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, launched in June 2017 as an ERC-20 token. It works on Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain, enabling fee payments, token creation, and asset transfers. BNB supports smart contracts using Proof-of-Staked Authority, allowing users to earn rewards by staking. Beyond blockchain transactions, it offers fee discounts on Binance.com and is used by various third-party services. The supply of BNB decreases over time through quarterly burns, aiming to reduce the initial 200 million supply by half to enhance its value. With its broad utility and a decreasing supply, BNB presents potential attractiveness in the current market cycle. Toncoin: The Open Network’s native cryptocurrency and its potential Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain. Originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the ‘Gram’ token, it was discontinued after a legal challenge in 2020. Now, the TON Foundation and community enthusiasts lead its development. Toncoin uses a proof-of-stake consensus model, improving scalability and reliability. It aims to offer fast, secure payments with low fees and build a broad ecosystem with decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on price predictions, Toncoin could see significant growth by 2025 and 2030. Given its technology and potential for growth, Toncoin may be attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion While POL, DOT, BNB, and TON have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking excellence and success. Expected to grow by 700% by the end of its presale, DOGEN may offer thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following the success of tokens like BONK and WIF, it builds a community of leaders and provides real benefits to early adopters.

38571109,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671077,1736083032,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,$WEPE Hits $40M as Meme Coin Market Recovers,https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/wepe-hits-40m-as-meme-coin-market-recovers/,"The most trending meme coin and one of the fastest-growing tokens right now, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), has crossed the $40 million mark during its ongoing presale . $WEPE raised $100k within five hours of launching its presale on Decembers 3, and investors have been pouring in a daily average of $1.5 million into this project. Given the rate at which the tokens are selling out, the presale will probably end by February 2025. Two Big Reasons for $WEPE’s Record-Breaking Sales Many people may believe that WEPE’s exceptional presale numbers are due to its inspiration from the viral PEPE meme coin. If that were true, then all other PEPE-inspired coins that were launched in the last two years would be equally viral, but that didn’t happen. This means $WEPE is winning on its own merit. What we think is the biggest reason is that $WEPE offers holders of the token unique tools (similar to ones actual Wall Street traders use) to provide them crucial and unique trading insights, allowing them to make profitable investments. Up until now, the crypto markets have mostly been controlled by the crypto whales, who hide in insider groups. However, WEPE seeks to change this by vesting retail investors with the ability to have a serious say in the market. This will be done through the “WEPE army,” or the “Frog army,” which refers to the group of $WEPE holders. These crypto underdogs will be able to take back power from the whales through coordinated knowledge sharing, discussions, and crucial updates that will be exclusive to them. $WEPE Current Price & Predicted Future Growth The WEPE token is currently available for $0.00036642, but the prices will increase in around 35 hours from now, as it’ll enter the next stage of its presale. Do note that this is, at the moment, the lowest you can get $WEPE tokens for, so there’s little reason to delay what can be a golden opportunity. Expert investors are predicting that the token will offer a minimum of 10x return at launch. Furthermore, even ChatGPT has a positive stance on WEPE’s expected growth. The chatbot said that in the best-case scenario, WEPE might be the next 100x coin – and even conservatively, a minimum of 10x return is still expected, just as the other experts predicted. This is what traders call confluence, aka multiple iterations backing a trade idea. It’s worth noting that $WEPE’s price is expected to continue increasing even after launch. To join the $WEPE Army , visit the Wall Street Pepe website, connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ), and purchase $WEPE using either ETH or USDT. Bank card payments are also accepted. Last but not least, even though the market sentiments and technical factors point towards $WEPE being one of the best meme coin investments, we strongly recommend doing your own research and considering the above as a well-calculated opinion instead of financial advice.",meme coin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-05 13:17:12

With Bitcoin predicted to smash the $140K mark, investor optimism is surging across the industry. Amidst this bullish trend, Lightchain AI’s presale continues to gain traction, having already raised over $8.51 million, with tokens priced at $0.0048. As a unique project blending blockchain with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI is positioned for explosive growth, making it a standout opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the upcoming crypto boom in 2025. January Predictions- Turning Point for Lightchain AI and Bitcoin In Jan 2025, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are ready for big changes. Bitcoin, trading around $98,331 is expected to see a large rise in market value with hopes it may hit $2͏25,000 by end of 2025. This hope comes from good rule changes and more support from businesses. At the same time, Lightchain AI plans to start its testnet in January, letting node runners and builders check token staking and run AI tasks. The mainnet is set to come out by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Experts think that LCAI might get into the top fifty money types by late 2025 with a possible price aim of $0.05, showing a big gain from its present presale cost of $0.0048 These developments indicate a pivotal month for both assets, with Bitcoin's price surge and Lightchain AI's technological advancements offering promising opportunities for investors. Bitcoin’s Surge to $140K- What It Means for Crypto Market Bitcoin's recent surge to $140,000 has significantly impacted the cryptocurrency market, highlighting its growing acceptance and potential as a mainstream financial asset. This milestone has attracted increased institutional investment, with major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity embracing crypto assets. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has further facilitated institutional participation, contributing to the price surge. However, some analysts caution about potential volatility, suggesting that the market could experience corrections. Overall, this surge underscores Bitcoin's evolving role in the global financial landscape, offering both opportunities and challenges for investors. Lightchain AI Altcoin Significant Growth in 2025 Lightchain AI is poised for significant growth in 2025, driven by its innovative approach to blockchain and AI integration. The platform’s clear roadmap sets it apart, beginning with Prototype Development in November 2024, where PoI and AIVM will undergo rigorous testing. The Testnet Rollout in January 2025 will allow community engagement, followed by the Mainnet Launch in March 2025. Ecosystem Growth is planned for May 2025, focusing on grants and cross-chain integration. Global Adoption follows in June 2025, with partnerships in multiple industries. By October 2025, sustainability and scalability optimizations will ensure long-term success, making Lightchain AI a promising altcoin for the future. Join this wonderful journey and seize the opportunity to invest in Lightchain AI during its presale, as it gears up for a game-changing month ahead. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Saylor, a huge Bitcoin fan and advocate, made the remarks during an appearance in a video show. Saylor’s suggestion of burning Bitcoins or destroying the private key will permanently remove access to the tokens, reducing the number of BTC in supply. It is like halving Bitcoin, but in this case, all the Bitcoins under the private keys disappear permanently. Ultimately, it will ensure the value of Bitcoin goes up, which will benefit holders. Bitcoin scarcity is critical for its value Bitcoin’s value is mostly due to its scarcity as only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be mined. Saylor’s suggestion of destroying Bitcoin upon death fits with the narrative of scarcity as a driver of value. Burning Bitcoin is a “pro rata contribution to everyone in the world who owns Bitcoin.” According to BiTBO , 19,924,481.25 Bitcoins exist, implying that 94.878% of the token’s lifetime supply has been issued. Only 1,075,518.8 Bitcoins remain to be mined. Currently, almost 450 Bitcoins are mined in a day. Michael Saylor has been consistent in his Bitcoin advocacy. He has led his firm, MicroStrategy , to become the top Bitcoin holder among public corporations. During the video show, Saylor said he wants to be known for “having taken the torch from Satoshi and went on to commercialize Bitcoin with corporations and governments decades after he passed.” Saylor’s sentiments generate chatter and criticism in the crypto arena Michael Saylor’s proposal has sparked significant debate in crypto circles, given his influential position in the Bitcoin community. Looking at the suggestions critically, burning Bitcoin upon one’s death may look careless and wasteful. It goes against the spirit of financial inclusion and utility, which are major principles on which Bitcoin thrives. Another concern is that such action could distort the Bitcoin ecosystem if whales adopt it. However, some X users feel positive about the push, with one Bark Ruffalo saying that burning Bitcoin keys after death is some “next-level diamond hands stuff.” Another comment mentioned that either way, it would be a “crazy ride for those holding the bag.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Bitcoin News & Insights|BTC|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-05 13:26:10

PI Network Price Retests $50 as Team Confirms 2025 Updates PI Network price received a major boost over the last 24 hours as a crucial network update sent the community abuzz with anticipation. According to the Pi Core Team’s official X post published on Sunday, the long-awaited Open Mainnet launch, previously moved from December 31, has now been confirmed for the first quarter of 2025. This transition is pivotal as it will allow Pi coins to be transferred and used across different platforms, marking a significant expansion of Pi’s utility and reach. The latest PI price market movements suggest traders have reacted positively to the updates. PI Network (PI) Price Action | Source: TradingView As seen above, PI price had traded as low as $44 on Saturday, January 4. But after the team published the network update on January 5, PI price surged by 6% to hit the $49 mark at press time. However, this excitement is tempered by ongoing challenges, particularly around the Know Your Customer ( KYC ) verification process and the migration to the Mainnet. The Pi Network has extended the deadline for KYC submissions and Mainnet migration to January 31, 2025, in an effort to include more users in the launch. PI Network Price Forecast: $50 Breakout Could Trigger 3x Gains PI Network price is predicted to enter a bullish breakout as the recent migration deadline announcement fuels renewed investor interest. The PIUSD daily chart highlights a well-defined ascending channel, suggesting a long-term build-up of bullish momentum. PI price has posted extended consolidation near the lower boundary of this channel $46.32. This zone has been tested multiple times, as indicated by the blue arrows, confirming its reliability as a key support level. PI Network Price Forecast | PIUSD The RSI is trending upward from a neutral zone around 45.44, signaling improving momentum and the potential for a shift toward bullish dominance. The MACD histogram also exhibits a bullish divergence, with higher lows forming despite the recent price consolidation, indicating growing buying pressure. Key resistance levels lie at $57 and $67, as shown by the red arrows and horizontal lines. A breakout above $67 would confirm a strong bullish continuation, targeting the upper boundary of the ascending channel at $183.79, representing a potential 265% rally. If the upward trajectory persists and buyers capitalize on the improving market sentiment, PI could see a significant price surge in the coming weeks, potentially tripling its value.

Table of Contents Shiba Inu: The meme coin seeking stability amid investor shifts The allure of PropiChain: Blending AI and blockchain with real estate Early investor advantage of the PropiChain presale The ongoing bear market has taken a toll on investors, with meme coins like Shiba Inu leading the declines. As losses mount, many investors are now turning their attention to more promising opportunities with higher ROI potential. Among the standout choices for Shiba Inu investors is PropiChain , a unique AI altcoin poised to change the real estate market. This AI altcoin is not just another speculative asset; it’s a game-changing platform poised to transform the real estate landscape. With projections indicating a staggering 50,000% growth by Q2 2025, the buzz around PCHAIN is palpable, capturing the interest of seasoned investors and newcomers alike. You might also like: XRP price declines, but PropiChain gains momentum with its AI-powered real estate features Shiba Inu: The meme coin seeking stability amid investor shifts Despite its ecosystem developments and loyal community, Shiba Inu (SHIB) , the popular dog-themed meme cryptocurrency, has struggled to break through the $0.0001 price barrier. A sluggish burn rate has hindered The token’s performance, with only 55.54 million coins burned in the past week. This low burn rate has left the circulating supply largely unaffected, contributing to its stagnation. Broader market trends and a seasonal holiday slowdown have further weighed on SHIB, with investors showcasing a diminished risk appetite. Although developments like the SHIB Metaverse and the upcoming TREAT token continue to highlight Shiba Inu’s potential, its limited price momentum has prompted many investors to seek alternatives. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , with its AI-driven creativity and real-world use case, has emerged as an appealing option for Shiba Inu investors looking for greater stability and exponential growth potential in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The allure of PropiChain: Blending AI and blockchain with real estate The Investors’ shift from Shiba Inu to PropiChain is not only a strategic move to hedge their funds and recover losses but also a confidence in the growing AI altcoin sector. PropiChain is a unique project integrating blockchain technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and the metaverse to solve long-standing inefficiencies in the property market. At the heart of PropiChain lies the concept of tokenized real estate, achieved through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each property listed on the platform is represented as an NFT, allowing users to buy, sell, or transfer ownership easily. The tokenization process eliminates the cumbersome paperwork, long transaction times, and opacity often associated with traditional property markets. Investors can also partake in fractional ownership, enabling them to purchase shares of high-value properties and democratizing access to assets previously reserved for the wealthy elite. This mechanism introduces liquidity to a historically illiquid asset class and allows users to diversify their portfolios effortlessly. PropiChain’s integration of AI sets it apart from competitors in the real estate space. Its predictive analytics give users actionable insights into market trends, property valuations, and investment opportunities. Whether predicting price fluctuations or evaluating demand shifts, the AI provides real-time data that allows investors to make informed decisions. Moreover, PropiChain automates transaction processes through smart contracts, ensuring secure, efficient, and error-free executions. For instance, users can set AI-powered triggers to automatically buy or sell property assets when specific conditions are met, optimizing their strategies while minimizing risks. Through its metaverse integration, the Propiverse, PropiChain also allows users to explore properties from the comfort of their homes virtually. This immersive experience, which includes 3D property tours and interactive environments, eliminates the need for physical site visits, making global property investment more accessible. PropiChain uses blockchain’s inherent transparency and security to ensure all transactions are tamper-proof and verifiable. The decentralized ledger, referred to as “Title Contract,” stores and updates all property records, mitigating risks of fraud or corruption prevalent in traditional systems. Additionally, by eliminating intermediaries such as brokers and government officials, PropiChain significantly reduces transaction costs and friction, creating a seamless user experience. The project’s smart contracts are audited by BlockAudit to assure investors of the security of the project and the assets. Early investor advantage of the PropiChain presale Shiba Inu investors are inclined to the PropiChain AI altcoin presale due to it’s low entry point and high ROI potential. PropiChain is conducting its second phase altcoin presale at $0.011 with additional stages designed to maximize investor participation while gradually increasing AI altcoin prices. Investors participating in this presale stand to gain substantially as the PCHAIN AI altcoin transitions from presale stages to public trading on exchanges at an anticipated listing price of $0.032 per AI altcoin. This represents an immediate potential return on investment (ROI) of over 900% for current investors. As the real estate sector evolves and traditional investments face increasing scrutiny for their inefficiencies, PropiChain, currently listed in CoinMarketCap offers a refreshing alternative that promises both innovation and substantial returns for those willing to embrace it early on.

FBTC provides maximum Bitcoin exposure per share, outperforming peers, making it a top choice for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure through ETFs. The fund's shares outstanding are managed well versus Fidelity's Bitcoin treasury making this a superior ETF compared to other Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin's positive market sentiment and bullish institutional demand suggest continued momentum, supporting a Buy rating for FBTC. Despite Bitcoin's volatility, structural catalysts and a crypto-friendly US administration present opportunities for investors to buy the dip in Bitcoin ETFs like FBTC. Investment Thesis By the end of this week, most Bitcoin ETFs will be celebrating their first anniversary since being launched on the public markets last year. The sentiment around Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been phenomenal over the past year as a cohort of multiple macro catalysts converged to keep the investible momentum of key digital assets, including Bitcoin, elevated. As Bitcoin gains more widespread traction among global markets for its investability from a macro standpoint, investors are responding to the positive traction seen in the digital asset space by allocating a growing share of their portfolio towards Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs have offered investors a fairly easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the hassles of custody and security. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (BATS: FBTC ) does more than just give investors exposure to Bitcoin. It actually is one of the few ETFs that offers the maximum exposure to Bitcoin noted via the Bitcoin Per Share metric. Along with higher exposure, Fidelity also strips away custody concentration risk by opting for self-custody of its Bitcoin stash. This makes FBTC my top pick for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, and I recommend a Buy on FBTC. FBTC Offers Multiple Advantages Over Other ETFs - Superior Bitcoin Exposure Is One Of Them As noted in Fidelity’s fund prospectus , the FBTC fund’s investment objective “is to seek to track the performance of Bitcoin,” and it tracks Bitcoin’s performance via its own Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate index . Fidelity’s index is essentially the firm’s own reconstitution of Bitcoin’s price using live feeds from the live spot price of Bitcoin versus the USD and is volume-weighted. Like most spot Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity offers investors exposure to Bitcoin, and investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin by just buying shares of FBTC. But, unlike most spot Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity keeps custody of its own Bitcoin treasury via its Fidelity Digital Asset Services, and herein lies one of the key advantages of using FBTC as an investment vehicle over the other Bitcoin ETFs to gain exposure to Bitcoin. As seen in Exhibit A below, Fidelity is the only Bitcoin ETF, apart from VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (BATS:HODL), that does not use Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN ) as the primary asset custodian. While Coinbase has positioned itself as a compelling candidate to offer custody services and is quite capable of continuing to offer these services, it also has to deal with an increasing amount of security risk with every additional customer that Coinbase offers custody services to. From the exhibit below, it's clear that Coinbase alone is responsible for cumulatively safekeeping almost 900k Bitcoin from all the other ETFs apart from FBTC and the futures Bitcoin ETF ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ). I believe FBTC has done the right thing by going against the grain and using its in-house custodial services, thus minimizing the security risk most other ETFs undertake by placing their custodial faith in a single entity counterparty such as Coinbase. This will serve FBTC and its investors well were there to be a security lapse in the single custodial entity. Exhibit A: How Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF stacks up against its peers (Author's compilation) The other reason I prefer FBTC over its spot Bitcoin peers is the superior exposure to Bitcoin that Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF provides as compared to its peers. For Bitcoin ETFs, a proxy measure I use to quantify investors’ exposure to Bitcoin is via the Bitcoin per share metric that I calculate using the fund's Bitcoin holdings versus its shares outstanding. Every investor that buys shares in their respective Bitcoin ETF aims to gain exposure to Bitcoin. And my estimates suggest FBTC is well placed to offer maximum exposure to Bitcoin since it has a superior Bitcoin-per-share metric. In Exhibit A above, I compiled a list of the top 7 Bitcoin ETFs by AUMs along with their Bitcoin treasury holdings. After noting their last known shares outstanding base per ETF, my estimates suggest that FBTC provides investors with about 88k satoshis or 0.00088 BTC. Only 21 Shares/ARK’s Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) rivals FBTC in terms of Bitcoin exposure. This is one of the reasons why FBTC and ARKB marginally outperform most other Bitcoin ETFs since inception last year due to the superior Bitcoin exposure per share. Exhibit B: Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF outperforms its peers since launch last year. (note: BITO's performance is adjusted for yields) (tradingView) Over the past year, FBTC has managed its Bitcoin holdings and shares outstanding in a manner that is in the highest interest of its shareholders, relatively speaking. In terms of my outlook for Bitcoin, which is the underlying asset for all Bitcoin ETFs, I recently published a note on BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) last month, where I noted that global liquidity cycles continue to favor another strong year for Bitcoin. Most market predictions call for Bitcoin to end 2025 anywhere between $150k and $250k. Consensus estimates settle at ~$200k, which indicates a strong year for Bitcoin. This should be a compelling enough reason for most Bitcoin ETFs to continue outperforming markets this year too. If Fidelity can continue managing its Bitcoin hoard consistently in line with its outstanding share base, it should give investors another compelling reason to value FBTC above other Bitcoin ETFs due to the superior Bitcoin exposure. In addition, an expense fee that is competitive compared to peers as well as minimized single-entity custody risk that I explained at the start of this note should also help FBTC investors. Risks & Other Factors To Know It is possible that Bitcoin could pull back further due to the strong run-up the digital currency had since the US election results. If this pullback occurs, ETFs such as FBTC will provide investors with an opportunity to buy the dip since I expect structural catalysts for Bitcoin to remain intact. By now, most investors are also aware that bitcoin is a fairly volatile asset versus other macro assets so investors will have to deal with a fair amount of volatility that is usually not seen in other asset classes. Takeaway Many catalysts still lie in place for Bitcoin to continue another bull run this year. An incoming US administration that is regarded as crypto-friendly, global liquidity that should positively support Bitcoin’s momentum, as well as bullish institutional demand, should keep the momentum going. In such cases, FBTC offers superior exposure to Bitcoin for those investors who are looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin via the ETF route. I recommend a Buy rating on the FBTC ETF.",BTC-USD|FBTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-05 13:43:24

At the same time, the US Fed has different plans. China Announces Interest Rate Cut Financial analysts expect the bank to make adjustments to the target funds rate so that credit demand aligns better with monetary policy, according to Reuters. As a result, crypto analysts expect a big wave of monetary support for Bitcoin prices in the Middle Kingdom’s yuan printing press. China’s central bank issued a statement on Friday announcing a cut to the banks’ reserve requirement ratio and interest rates at “a proper time.” The central bank says the PBOC is likely to further slash China’s interest rates from the current target of 1.5% sometime soon in 2025. The PBOC last cut rates to 1.5% from 1.7% in September, the same month as the Federal Reserve pivoted to a rate-cutting regime. Moreover, China’s 10-year and 30-year treasury yields both hit record lows on Friday over expectations of fresh monetary easing. Arthur Hayes Predicts ‘Glorious’ Bitcoin Rally The interest rate cut at China’s central bank will help to counter a deflationary yuan that threatens to spiral into debt-crippling loan revaluation. But, it will also push up the prices of the basket of financial goods, especially stocks and cryptocurrencies. South Africa cut its main overnight money market rate by 0.25% to 7.75% in November. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted the next rate cut in Beijing will combine with the Fed’s low rate regime and cause a “glorious” rally for Bitcoin and other crypto assets in 2025. Hayes is an influential macro strategic analyst for the price levels of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Immediately after the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a rate cut in September, Bitcoin’s price rocketed above the $60,000 level. Since then, the little orange coin has reached record high levels of $100,000. Seven months ago in May, Hayes wrote on his Medium blog that when China brings out the monetary “bazooka,” buying a Wall Street Bitcoin ETF will be a no-brainer for regulated investors in the US. “If my theory becomes reality, it is trivial for any institutional investor to buy one of the US-listed Bitcoin ETFs,” Hayes wrote. “Bitcoin is the best-performing asset in the face of global fiat debasement, and they know it.” In addition to a rising Coinbase premium index, ETF flows for Bitcoin are two strong indicators that mainstream investors are flocking back to Bitcoin in January.

Analysis Company Shares What They Expect,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-expected-in-the-coming-period-in-bitcoin-analysis-company-shares-what-they-expect/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has shared its latest views on the state of the crypto market, examining the market dynamics of sentiment indicators such as the Fear & Greed Index, social media sentiment, and Google Trends data. Alphractal highlighted that the Fear and Greed Index recently broke out of the “extreme greed” zone, a phase usually associated with market tops. This shift coincided with Bitcoin’s $108,000 peak. The analysis suggests that a breakout from this zone could signal the start of a more sustainable market trend. The firm also pointed to Google Trends data that showed a spike in search interest when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $100,000. However, overall search volume remained consistent with levels observed since 2022. The apparent decline in interest once Bitcoin fell below the $100,000 threshold suggests that new entrant participation in the market remains low. Related News: Giant Bull Michael Saylor Reveals What Will Happen to His Bitcoins After His Death Alphractal analyzed sentiment using the Alpha Crypto Sentiment tool on social media platform X. The tool revealed a shift from euphoria to neutral territory, reflecting a cooling in investor excitement. Despite the waning interest from new entrants, Alphractal sees the positive sentiment among existing market players as a potential catalyst for continued upward momentum in the medium term. The firm concluded: “The positive sentiment combined with low interest from new entrants could point to a continued uptrend in the medium term.” *This is not investment advice.

As of January 2, 2025, Solana is trading at $207, marking a 9% increase over the last 24 hours. This surge in SOL price follows a brief consolidation phase, reflecting renewed investor confidence and optimism. The open interest in Solana futures contracts has climbed to $3.42 billion, fueled by heightened investor engagement. Perpetual contracts dominate the landscape with $3.4 billion in open interest, while futures contracts account for $15.8 million. Over the past 24 hours, perpetual contracts grew by 10.67%, and futures contracts experienced a significant 85.59% increase, contributing to an overall 10.87% rise in total open interest. Among crypto exchanges, Binance leads with $1.7 billion in open interest, followed by Bybit at $1.1 billion and OKX at $520.5 million. On Binance, SOL’s price rose 6.32% over the last 24 hours and recorded a 6.96% gain over the past seven days. Coinbase and Kraken reported similar 24-hour increases of 6.34% and 6.28%, respectively for SOL’s price. Binance also leads in trading volume, with 56.1k SOL/ETH pairs traded in the last day, while Coinbase and Kraken follow with 5.2k and 4.6k, respectively. The sharp increase in SOL’s price and open interest highlights growing optimism among investors. The 85.59% surge in open interest for Solana futures contracts suggests a rising number of traders are betting on SOL’s price movements. Open interest is often linked with strong market activity and confidence, indicating that the market expects further upside for SOL price. The dominance of perpetual contracts reflects traders actively capitalizing on SOL’s price volatility through short-term strategies. This trend underscores the interplay between increased speculative activity and fundamental interest, both of which are driving the SOL price’s strong performance. Awawat, trader and angel investor at APG Capital, tweeted a convincing visual representation of Solana’s current market movements.

Last year, Dogecoin achieved an impressive 252% price hike although towards the end, in December, it encountered bearish conditions that saw its price slide by 25%. #Dogecoin daily candle closed.

The crypto analyst defined the Power of Three pattern as a structure with three phases that DOGE follows throughout its market cycle. The three phases are accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. According to Tardigrade, the Accumulation Phase began after DOGE’s price increased significantly in November 2024, which can be linked to the cryptocurrency market’s upbeat outlook following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. The crypto expert added that the meme coin went through steady price hikes and gained investor optimism during this phase. The Accumulation phase ended on December 17, signaling the arrival of the Manipulation phase, wherein investors saw DOGE price took a dip. Trader Tardigrade said that December had been a bearish period for DOGE, wherein its price went down and had a consolidation, adding that this phase continued until the end of 2024. During this turbulent period, Dogecoin lost around 25% of its value. However, the market analyst said that the Manipulation phase was essential for the meme coin because it prepared DOGE for the next phase, the Distribution phase. The Distribution phase began in the first four days of 2025 wherein the meme coin moved towards recovery by posting a 23.15% price increase in that four-day swing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details $1 Dogecoin Can Be Achieved Trader Tardigrade clarified that DOGE would soar to the highly expected $1 per coin because of the favorable conditions in this phase. A 157% price increase would push Dogecoin to $1 from its current price of $0.38961, according to the analyst, who also stated that the bullish forecast for the meme crypto is based on its past price swings. A feat the crypto analyst predicted Dogecoin could achieve since November 2024, the meme coin successfully pulled off a 160% price surge. Therefore, a 157% increase seems realistic.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE.

The token has a total supply of 88.88 billion, with about 25.9% allocated to airdrops given to NFT holders. While the project is yet to confirm a use case for the token, there are rumors that it could play an important role in its ecosystem. According to Bybit, the token could be used for governance, and allow holders exclusive access to the ecosystem. Rumor has also grown about the possibility of a future airdrop exclusively for token holders. According to X user and crypto trader Pentoshi, the project may decide to reward token holders this month. “$PENGU holders to receive Abstract (potentially another 6 fig + airdrop. You may potentially qualify by getting the token holder role and the token enjoyer roles in the Pudgy discord,” he said. Pudgy Penguins NFT sales slides Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins’ NFT sales have declined drastically. According to data from CryptoSlam, the total sales dropped to $5.5 million, a 52% slide from last week. Overall, NFT transactions are struggling, falling by 51%. In addition, buyers dropped by 56%, while sellers dropped by 41%. Aside from Pudgy Penguins, another leading NFT on Ethereum Azuki dropped by 17.65, while the DMarket NFT project on Mythos escaped the slide, seeing a 10.43% increase in sales. According to NFT Price Floor, Pudgy Penguins is now the second-largest NFT project by market cap in the crypto industry, with a value of $721 million. The project is only behind CryptoPunks, valued at $1.4 billion. The project secured a partnership with retail firms Walmart and Target to add Pudgy Penguins-licensed toys in their stores.

Among its ambitious projects is X Money, which aims to integrate cryptocurrency to enhance user transactions. To address this critical decision, Grok, X’s AI, provided a detailed analysis of potential cryptocurrency options. Here’s a breakdown of Grok’s response, highlighting key insights. The Criteria for Choosing a Cryptocurrency Grok emphasizes that selecting the right cryptocurrency depends on several factors, including transaction speed, cost, scalability, regulatory compliance, and user familiarity. According to Grok, “These considerations are crucial for ensuring that the integrated cryptocurrency aligns with the platform’s global vision and functionality.” For instance, cryptocurrencies with fast transaction speeds and low fees are better suited for microtransactions or frequent use cases. Meanwhile, regulatory compliance ensures smooth operation in multiple jurisdictions. Top Contenders: XRP, Dogecoin, and Stellar XRP: The Speedy Payment Solution Grok highlights XRP’s suitability, noting that it is “designed for fast, low-cost international payments, making it ideal for a global platform like X Money.” Its partnerships with financial institutions add credibility and potential scalability. However, regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. remains a significant concern, as Grok points out, “Ripple Labs has faced significant regulatory scrutiny, which could pose integration challenges or compliance issues.” Dogecoin: The Brand-Friendly Option Dogecoin’s association with Elon Musk makes it a natural candidate for X Money. Grok explains that Dogecoin’s “low transaction fees and faster confirmation times compared to Bitcoin” make it ideal for tipping or small payments within social interactions on X. However, Grok cautions that “its lack of advanced features and scalability may limit its use for high-volume transactions.” Stellar (XLM): A Balanced Choice Similar to XRP, Stellar offers fast and cost-effective cross-border payments. Grok notes its alignment with decentralization and its use in financial inclusion projects. However, Grok also states, “Stellar might not have the same level of public recognition or high-profile support as Dogecoin.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Grok’s Final Suggestions Grok concludes with three distinct approaches for integrating cryptocurrency into X Money: For immediate payment solutions: XRP or Stellar (XLM) are top contenders due to their design for fast and cost-efficient transactions. However, XRP’s regulatory issues may tip the balance in Stellar’s favor. For brand synergy: Dogecoin’s popularity and Musk’s support make it a logical choice, though technical limitations must be addressed. For innovation: Grok highlights Nano as a future-proof option due to its “instant, feeless transactions,” but acknowledges that its adoption may require significant effort. Additionally, Grok proposes a multi-currency approach, suggesting that X Money could integrate several cryptocurrencies to cater to diverse user needs. “A combination of XRP/XLM for payments and DOGE for brand recognition could offer the best of both worlds,” Grok advises. Adapting to a Dynamic Crypto Landscape Grok’s analysis provides valuable insights into selecting the best cryptocurrency for X Money, balancing technical capabilities with user expectations and regulatory realities. As Grok aptly concludes, “The crypto landscape is dynamic, and what’s optimal today might change with technological advancements, regulatory shifts, or changes in market sentiment.” This adaptability will be crucial for X Money as it seeks to redefine financial transactions on the platform, ensuring it stays ahead of the curve in an ever-evolving digital economy.

This revelation has sparked controversy, with critics drawing comparisons to the infamous “Operation Chokepoint.” Industry leaders, including Coinbase and Ripple, argue that the FDIC’s actions overstep constitutional boundaries and aim to stifle the crypto sector. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, disclosed on January 3 that the FDIC issued additional letters instructing banks to limit crypto services, including Bitcoin transactions and advanced crypto activities. Grewal highlighted the lack of transparency, stating, "" FDIC magically found two more pause letters after claiming compliance with a court order."" He called for congressional hearings to investigate these actions. Between 2022 and 2023, the FDIC directed certain banks to suspend crypto services while the agency assessed risks and finalized guidelines. One letter specifically addressed concerns about Bitcoin transactions facilitated through third-party partnerships, urging banks to pause such activities until further regulatory instructions were issued. The letter stated, “At this time, the FDIC has not determined what filings will be necessary for a bank to engage in this type of activity.” Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticized the FDIC’s approach, claiming the letters were designed to discourage banks from engaging in crypto-related business. He emphasized the unusual tactic of directly addressing bank boards, interpreting it as a deliberate move to intimidate institutions. ""These letters scream one message: shut down everything crypto-related ASAP,"" Alderoty said. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expressed confidence in the judiciary's ability to address what he described as unconstitutional actions. Armstrong stressed that regulatory agencies should enforce laws rather than create new ones, asserting, ""The Constitution grants lawmaking powers solely to Congress."" The FDIC’s actions have revived memories of ""Operation Chokepoint,"" where regulatory pressure indirectly targeted specific industries. Recent surveys reveal that crypto-focused firms face significant banking challenges, unlike industries such as real estate or private credit. Attorney John Deaton called for a federal investigation, arguing that these measures go beyond regulatory overreach and pose a threat to free-market principles. ""ChokePoint 2.0 is not just regulatory overreach. It’s a direct challenge to American free-market capitalism, which thrives on competition, innovation, and equal opportunity,"" Deaton stated. As criticism mounts, Coinbase and other crypto leaders are gearing up for further legal battles, determined to counter what they view as unjust regulatory interference.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-05 14:18:15

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin could reach $1.50 for a 394% ROI, while Rexas Finance, with a 19,500% ROI by Q2 2025, gains momentum in presale. Table of Contents Rexas Finance changes asset ownership: $34M raised as RXS soars in presale momentum Dogecoin eyes $1.50 by 2025, while RXS shines with a 19,500% ROI in the RWA movement Conclusion Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.3207, and top DOGE traders predict that Doge may hit $1.5 per Dogecoin, resulting in a 394% ROI. On the same note, the trader spotted another coin with rising utility. Based on the momentum of the token, a prediction of 19500% by Q2 2025 ROI seems fair since the token has already achieved a whopping 500% ROI within a very short period. The token is Rexas Finance , which is currently in presale stage 11, where one token is priced at $0.175. With its presale making headlines and completing its presale stage ahead of its schedule. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Rexas Finance changes asset ownership: $34M raised as RXS soars in presale momentum What Rexas Finance is capable of in the crypto space is genuinely transformative. It focuses on real-world asset tokenization, which allows fractional ownership of traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, art, and intellectual properties. When added to that the democratization of asset ownership, the implications are game-changing and essential for more investors looking for ways to diversify and secure their portfolios. RXS tokens are currently in Stage 11 of their presale and are priced at $0.175, with a plan to rise to $0.200 in Stage 12. It has already raised a very impressive presale amount of $34,272,869 out of the sought-after $41 million, with 386,556,969 tokens sold out of a total supply of 425 million. Such figures indicate massive interest in the market and confidence in Rexas Finance’s vision and abilities. The project even has credibility from Certik audits for safe smart contracts. Furthermore, RXS is listed on platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Dogecoin eyes $1.50 by 2025, while RXS shines with a 19,500% ROI in the RWA movement Dogecoin is trading At $0.3207, an increase of 3.30% over one day. The chart shows positive trading activities. According to analysts, recent patterns suggest it could reach those key Fibonacci retracement levels and grow in price. There is a strong case that DOGE is beginning to break through resistance levels that, historically, have resulted in significant price surges. Technical analysis shows that if Dogecoin can stay above critical support, then Dogecoin could aim for targets of around $1.50 in 2025. This correlates with previous cycles of DOGE, which were accelerating momentum after breaking significant resistance points. RXS is forging the path of an incredible 19,500% ROI by Q2 2025, owing to its unique services and soaring adoption in the RWA market. Based on this projection, Dogecoin can project to grow slowly but constantly, while RXS may be able to blow away DOGE for return on investment (ROI). Not only is the profitability of RXS around its price appreciation, but it has a very real use case in multiple markets. Rexas Finance is enabling mass utility asset tokenization. With tools like the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot designed to simplify the tokenization of assets even for non-technical users, Rexas Finance is well poised to take the lion’s share of the NFT and tokenized assets market. Conclusion As 2025 approaches, Dogecoin is predicted to hit a 394% ROI, while Rexas Finance is expected to hit a 19,500% ROI. Savvy investors should position themselves accordingly as RXS quickly completes its presale stages. Intersted investors should act soon before stage 11 ends, where one token is priced at $0.175 and with the next stage priced at $0.2 An investment of $300 in RXS can turn to a whopping $58,500, while a similar investment in Dogecoin, with a 394 ROI, can turn to $1,182.

Cardano and XRP investors are eyeing Catzilla, a meme coin with a feline theme, sparking a shift in crypto sentiment. Table of Contents Catzilla: The meme coin for crypto warriors Cardano: A sustainable and scalable blockchain platform XRP: A fast and borderless cryptocurrency for global payments Conclusion Investors holding Cardano and XRP are turning their gaze toward a new meme coin making waves. Catzilla, with its playful feline theme, is capturing the attention of the crypto community. What is sparking this surge of interest, and why are enthusiasts considering adding this token to their portfolios? Unpacking the reasons reveals an unexpected shift in investor sentiment.

Designed for those seeking financial freedom, this coin’s playful theme masks its explosive growth opportunities. 14 stages of growth: Limitless possibilities Catzilla’s unique 14-stage presale offers early adopters the chance to amplify their investments by up to 700%. Each stage adds momentum, turning the CATZILLA token into a force to be reckoned with. As the presale evolves, investors move closer to financial victory — but only the swift will secure their place in this rapidly advancing journey. The rise of the cats: MEW, Popcat, and now Catzilla For years, dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin ruled the market, but a new era has arrived. Feline-focused coins like MEW and Popcat are delivering staggering returns, signaling a shift in the meme coin landscape. MEW: Achieved a 103.7% climb in three months, proving its place among the top meme coins. Popcat: Leapt to a 157.44% surge, capturing the imagination of investors. These coins are setting the stage for Catzilla, a coin poised to pounce with unmatched meme power. Forget chasing tails — this is where the real action is. Catzilla’s mission: Rewrite the rules, empower investors Catzilla isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a movement aimed at changing outdated systems and empowering investors. Its presale model, combined with governance rights, loyalty rewards, and staking opportunities, makes it a compelling choice for those looking to maximize gains in the crypto space. Time is of the essence. Interested investors should consider seizing the chance to join Catzilla’s movement before the market moves on. Cardano: A sustainable and scalable blockchain platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency is ADA. Cardano aims to be flexible, sustainable, and scalable. It uses a proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros, which is energy-efficient compared to proof-of-work systems. The blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design enhances its transaction processing capability. ADA is used to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. With its technology, Cardano offers potential for decentralized finance apps, tokens, and games. In the current market cycle, ADA’s sustainable approach and scalability make it an attractive option. XRP: A fast and borderless cryptocurrency for global payments XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. With XRP, users can make borderless transactions without a bank account. It operates on a decentralized system, making transactions secure and irreversible. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company involved with XRP, was gifted 80 billion coins to help develop the ecosystem. XRP aims to simplify payment transfers across different currencies. Its technology has the potential to change global payments by offering quick and affordable transactions. This could benefit people and businesses looking for efficient ways to send money. Conclusion ADA and XRP may offer less short-term potential during the current bull run. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as a leading meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a presale offering up to 700% ROI, starting at $0.0002 and rising over 14 stages, it provides governance rights, loyalty rewards, and staking benefits. Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join its mission by acquiring CATZILLA tokens and battling crypto villains. To learn more about Catzilla, visit the website , X , Telegram chat , and Telegram news .

The trade, executed on the decentralized exchange ( DEX ) on Solana ( SOL ) Raydium, involved the BUZZ/SOL trading pair and utilized the high-risk strategy of sniping, according to data shared by on-chain cryptocurrency analysis platform Lookonchain in an X post on January 3. Specifics of the trade indicated that the trader acquired 268.12 million BUZZ tokens, representing 26.8% of the token’s liquidity pool, shortly after its launch. To secure priority on the Solana blockchain, they paid a 49 SOL fee (approximately $10,000) to ensure their transaction was processed ahead of other buyers. Within eight minutes, the trader sold all their BUZZ tokens for 6,090 SOL, generating a net profit of 6,008 SOL ($1.25 million). SOL/BUZZ pair on Taydium. Source/DexScreener Possible concerns regarding the trade Although the trade can be viewed as sheer luck or perfect timing, particulars of the transaction could elicit possible concerns regarding the use of insider information. For instance, the trader’s ability to secure 26.8% of the token’s liquidity at launch suggests possible advanced knowledge of the timing and pool structure. The unusually high transaction fee of 49 SOL indicates confidence in the token’s rapid appreciation, potentially pointing to privileged information. Additionally, the swift exit just eight minutes after purchase, ahead of any corrections, raises further concerns. BUZZ was launched on the Solana blockchain to make decentralized finance ( DeFi ) more accessible and understandable through interoperable AI agents. Since the platform’s launch in late December 2024, the cryptocurrency has generated a buzz within its online community, with the founder initiating sustained network development to improve the ecosystem. For instance, in an X post on January 3, Hive AI announced an upcoming upgrade enabling users to create autonomous on-chain agents with natural language prompts. Under these upgrades, the system seeks to select tools, models, and runtime, then deploys a scheduler to execute tasks seamlessly, aiming to bring automation on-chain.

Table of Contents XYZVerse: a new heavyweight in the meme coin arena XRP Solana Conclusion Major shifts are capturing attention.

At the same time, XYZVerse emerged with bold ambitions, aiming for an unprecedented surge that could elevate it above well-known tokens like Dogecoin. These developments suggest significant movements worth monitoring in the crypto sphere. XYZVerse: a new heavyweight in the meme coin arena While XRP solidifies its position, XYZVerse is making waves as a fast-rising challenger with game-changing potential. Priced at just $0.001333 during its presale phase, XYZVerse is projected to reach $0.1 by the final stage, representing an extraordinary 7,402% growth. This trajectory puts XYZVerse in a position to surpass even meme coin heavyweights like Dogecoin in terms of returns and market impact. XYZVerse isn’t following the typical path of meme coins.

That’s XRP, a digital currency built for fast, low-cost, and secure transactions. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP runs on the decentralized XRP Ledger without a central authority. This means transactions are irreversible and safe from censorship or counterfeiting. Plus, users don’t need a bank account to use it. XRP aims to make moving money between different currencies seamless. With a significant supply dedicated to supporting its growth, the currency seeks to improve liquidity in the network. In today’s market, where speed and cost matter, XRP’s technology makes it stand out. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin, which can be slower and more expensive to use, XRP offers quick settlements and lower fees. As demand for efficient cross-border payments grows, XRP could become a key player in the evolving digital economy. Solana Solana is turning heads in the blockchain world with its commitment to scalability and speed. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana sets itself apart by avoiding sharding and second-layer solutions. Instead, it uses a unique architecture that supports thousands of transactions per second. This makes it an attractive foundation for decentralized applications (dapps) that demand high performance. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, which facilitates transactions, powers programs, and rewards network supporters. In the current market, where efficiency and scalability are highly valued, SOL presents interesting possibilities for users and developers. Its flexible development options across multiple programming languages make it accessible to a broad range of projects. As the demand for high-capacity networks grows, Solana’s approach could position it favorably among other cryptocurrencies. While the crypto market is always changing, Solana’s technological advancements may contribute to its appeal in the evolving blockchain landscape, offering an alternative to more established platforms. Conclusion While XRP, SOL, and other coins perform well in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse distinguishes itself with its sports-focused community and aims for unprecedented growth.

While Ripple’s steady trajectory promises solid 2x gains, DTX’s groundbreaking presale success and innovative platform have positioned it as a potential 1,000% gainer in this bull cycle. Let’s take a closer look at what makes these two stand out. DTX Exchange: The Upcoming Platform Revolutionizing Finance While Ripple (XRP) prepares for 2x gains ahead, DTX Exchange (DTX) is cementing its position as one of the top players in the market. Behind such a phenomenal growth record is its revolutionary approach which is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and modern-day finance and bring it all together on one single platform. By having this approach, DTX Exchange will have over 100,000 commodities to be traded on its platform. These will include all asset classes like stocks, forex, bonds, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, etc. This is enabled by its layer-1 blockchain solution, VulcanX. The platform believes big on security, trust, and transparency. Depicting their dedication to achieving top-class security and transparency, they’ve taken multiple steps. The project even before its official launch is listed on one of the most reliable platforms of the crypto town, CoinMarketCap, boosting the reliability of the project. Furthermore, the platform has undergone vigorous security audits to ensure maximum security. It’s recently launched Phoenix Wallet is a safe and secure non-custodial solution for holding all your assets. Additionally, the platform is KYC policy-regulated, ensuring the discreet identity of each trader and investor. Ripple on the Rise: Aiming for $2.90 in This Bull Run Ripple (XRP) is one of the top altcoins, according to CoinMarketCap, its value has increased by more than 9% just in the last week. To put it another way, the price of XRP increased from about $2.10 to more than $2.40 in a matter of days. Recently, XRP Whale, a cryptocurrency expert and fan of Ripple (XRP), also thrilled the community. According to his X post , the coin is set to experience a price jump to $2.90. Since the XRP’s price hasn’t been this high since 2018, this prediction has caused a stir in the market. This claim is supported by the Ripple (XRP) coin’s technical analysis. According to TradingView, the current value of this cryptocurrency is higher than its 10-day EMA ($2.22). Additionally, its weekly momentum indicator is in the purchase zone at 1.86, indicating an upcoming rebound. According to the most recent XRP news, there is a 70% chance that a Ripple ETF would be approved in the US. The data indicates that the bets have grown considerably in comparison to a possible approval by December 31, 2025. Given that market mood has lately improved following Donald Trump’s presidential victory, this has increased investor speculation. In addition, his recent appointment of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to succeed Gary Gensler as chair of the US SEC has increased investor optimism. These events have created immense hype surrounding Ripple (XRP), causing analysts to predict a price upswing, delivering gains up to 2x. DTX Presale Hits $11M: What’s Driving the Hype? DTX Exchange (DTX) is currently in its presale stage 7, and setting new records every day. It recently surpassed $11M in funding, being one of the fastest-growing ICOs of the recent time. Each DTX token is available to be bought at only $0.14. Analysts are terming this price point a cheap entry point to a project that has the potential to make millionaires ahead. Rumors are surfacing on the internet regarding the potential Coinbase listing for DTX in this quarter, this has got analysts to forecast a 1,000% uptick in DTX’s price. As the project is in its quite early stages, this leaves its investors with plenty of room to generate maximum ROI. All the early investors have already enjoyed over 450% ROI. The presale rounds are selling out quickly, if you want to be on the ground floor of such a revolutionary platform, then it is the perfect time to jump into this project.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 15:05:00

Meanwhile, Do Kwon, facing legal challenges over the TerraUSD collapse, pleaded not guilty to charges and awaits extradition to the US after Montenegro denied South Korea's request. Find out more. Bitcoin A Hong Kong lawmaker has proposed incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) into the region's national reserves to enhance financial security and position Hong Kong as a global crypto hub. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) set a record as the most successful ETF launch in history, surpassing $50 billion in assets within 11 months, dominating both spot and options markets, and fueling Bitcoin's price surge to an all-time high. Altcoins A new altcoin, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), is attracting interest due to its innovative crypto-gaming combination. With the Bitcoin price flipping its 50-day Simple Moving Average, experts believe that Wave 3 of the crypto bull market — also known as the “altseason” — has started. With a proven track record in Web3 development, Blocksync has simplified the presale process, providing the expertise and tools you need to launch confidently.

Among the best candidates ready to challenge the status are Rexas Finance (RXS), Mantle, and Arbitrum. These creators are setting themselves up to replace DOGE’s long-held dominance by bringing fresh ideas that increase blockchain capability and scalability. Rexas Finance (RXS): DOGE Rival Poised For Amazing Growth Rexas Finance has received much attention as it moves into stage 11 of its presale. The price of a token is $175. Surprisingly, the project chose a public presale over venture capital funding so that more people could participate in this financial change. Analysts think RXS could reach an impressive $12 in the next ten weeks, a 6,757% increase from its current presale price. By the middle of 2025, thanks to its strong fundamentals and growing investor interest, RXS could be a clear winner in DeFi. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a blockchain-based tool that could revolutionize business. Using cutting-edge technologies, RXS lets users tokenize assets like real estate and access clear, quick, and safe banking services. This new idea directly solves problems with liquidity in the world’s $280 trillion real estate market. The tokenomics of Rexas Finance are created with laser-like attention to inclusivity and sustainability. Out of all the presale tokens, shockingly, 42.5% are set aside for community development, enabling the project’s lifeblood—active and thriving. A staking pool receives another 22.5% to encourage long-term dedication and ecological building. This progressive attitude encourages a devoted community to engage in developing Rexas Finance. 15% of tokens are set aside for liquidity to guarantee flawless operations and protect against market changes. A wise 10% is set aside for the Treasury, acting as a war chest for subsequent development and expansion. The rest of the tokens are strategically distributed among marketing campaigns, partnerships, team operations, and community giveaways. For example, 20 winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS in a $1 million giveaway—this all-around approach supports Rexas Finance’s vision for a thriving, decentralized ecosystem. Mantle (MNT): Advancing Ethereum Scalability Mantle Network is Ethereum’s modern Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution. Separating data availability, finality, and transaction execution, this platform—the first fundamental component of the Mantle Ecosystem—separates this modular architecture, which guarantees fit with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and lets constant integration of the newest developments possible. As of writing, Mantle’s live price is $1.21, reflecting excellent investor trust in its usefulness. The network’s emphasis on scalability and cost-effectiveness helps explain why Ethereum’s growth depends on it so strongly. Mantle appeals to developers and investors because it guarantees flawless interoperability with Ethereum-based applications by maintaining EVM compatibility. Arbitrum (ARB): Optimizing Ethereum Transactions Arbitrum is another outstanding Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. It uses hopeful roll-ups to improve transaction speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Arbitrum gains security and compatibility from Ethereum’s blockchain while shifting most processing and storage off-chain, which allows It to achieve better throughput and lower fees than Ethereum. Through the Arbitrum DAO, ARB, the native token of Arbitrum, is essential for governance. Reinforcing the platform’s dedication to decentralization, token holders can vote on fund allocation, protocol changes, and Security Council elections. Arbitrum is a strong rival in the L2 market with a current price of $0.77 since it emphasizes scalability and governance. The Case for Diversifying Beyond Dogecoin Although Dogecoin is still popular among meme coin aficionados, its low value limits its expansion possibilities. Conversely, with strong use cases and creative technology, Rexas Finance, Mantle, and Arbitrum are changing the blockchain and DeFi environments. Rexas Finance solves real-world problems by making the substantial real estate market more flexible. This causes prices to skyrocket, making it a good investment. The Mantle Network makes Ethereum more scalable while still working with current apps. This builds a strong base for DeFi and blockchain growth. Arbitrum is even more of a leader in Ethereum scaling solutions because it makes transfers faster and cheaper without lowering security. When considering projects like Rexas Finance, Mantle, and Arbitrum, these competitors offer honest answers to problems, differentiating them from Dogecoin’s meme-based appeal. If buyers are looking for high-growth opportunities that can be used in real life, these three tokens are strong options. As the cryptocurrency market matures, 2025 could be the year these projects change what it means to be successful in the blockchain space.

This Trending Meme Coin Presale Strikes Gold,https://thecoinrise.com/failed-to-ride-the-mog-coin-frenzy-this-trending-meme-coin-presale-strikes-gold/,"Meme coins have become the wildcards of the crypto world, offering massive opportunities for early investors who play their cards right. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s breakout, these tokens have reshaped what it means to invest in the digital economy. While Mog Coin (MOG) grabbed headlines earlier this year with its viral appeal and billion-dollar market cap, a new player has emerged that’s redefining the meme coin game: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . BTFD Coin is more than just a meme coin—it’s an ecosystem that combines gaming, staking, and community-driven growth. Its trending meme coin presale has already raised over $4.9 million, selling more than 62 billion tokens to 7,600+ holders. With innovative features like a play-to-earn (P2E) game , 90% staking APY, and a referral programme that rewards investors, BTFD is leading the charge into a new era of meme coins. For those who missed out on Mog Coin’s rise, BTFD offers a fresh chance to ride the next big wave in the crypto world. Let’s explore what makes these two projects stand out and why BTFD Coin might be your next golden ticket. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star of the Meme Coin Market BTFD Coin is creating a buzz like no other. Launched on November 26, 2024, this trending meme coin presale has already reached Stage 13, with a token price of $0.000142. By the time the presale concludes, the coin is expected to list at $0.0006, offering early investors a potential 361% return. But BTFD isn’t just about numbers—it’s about innovation. The beta version of its P2E game was launched in Stage 10, but the full version was made available to the BTFD community on January 1, 2025. The game has already generated excitement among the community. Staking, which went live on December 2, offers a whopping 90% APY, making it one of the most attractive passive income opportunities in the crypto market. The Bulls Squad referral programme is another standout feature, rewarding users for bringing in new investors. This not only grows the community but also creates a sense of shared success among holders. Let’s break it down with an example. If you invest $15,000 in Stage 12 at $0.000142 per token, you’ll get approximately 115,384,615 BTFD Coins. When the price hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment will grow to an impressive $69,230. And that’s before the token even hits mainstream exchanges. With over $4.9 million raised and counting, BTFD Coin is proving it’s not just another meme coin—it’s a movement. Analysts are already predicting strong post-listing performance, making this presale an opportunity you don’t want to miss. Mog Coin: The Cat Meme That Conquered the Market Mog Coin clawed its way to the top of the meme coin world earlier this year, becoming the king of cat-themed tokens. Its listing on Coinbase triggered a 20% price spike, propelling it to an all-time high of $0.00000338 and cementing its status as a market leader. With a market cap surpassing $1 billion, Mog Coin’s “joycat” branding captured the hearts of investors everywhere. But Mog’s journey hasn’t been without its challenges. The coin’s derivatives market has seen increased activity, adding a layer of volatility that has kept traders on their toes. Despite this, Mog’s strong community and consistent growth make it a standout in the meme coin space. The coin’s ability to tap into the internet’s love for cats, combined with its robust exchange listings and technical potential, has ensured its place as a top-tier meme coin. However, for new investors, Mog’s current valuation might make it harder to see the same explosive gains that early adopters enjoyed. Why did this coin make it to this list? Mog Coin’s viral success and billion-dollar market cap make it a benchmark in the meme coin space, proving that community and timing are everything. Get Ahead with $BTFD BIG50 Navigate to the Presale Page . Connect your wallet using the “Connect Wallet” button. Use the code BIG50 in the bonus field to claim your extra tokens. Input your desired purchase amount and validate the bonus. Finalise the transaction by clicking “Buy Now.” The Final Thoughts Meme coins are no longer just jokes—they’re evolving into serious investment opportunities with real-world utility.

After a stellar rally, BTC is now testing its ability to push past critical resistance, as traders and investors remain cautious about its short-term trajectory. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, highlighting key metrics that suggest the market is entering a cooling phase. According to Adler, the Block P/L Count Ratio model—an indicator that tracks Profit and Loss within each block on the BTC network—shows a gradual decline in activity as profits are realized. Investors securing maximum gains at $90K–$100K levels have contributed to this shift, signaling a potential slowdown after the bullish frenzy. The current market environment reflects a mix of optimism and hesitation as BTC consolidates near its psychological resistance. While the broader sentiment remains cautiously bullish, the cooling of market dynamics could extend the consolidation phase. As Bitcoin struggles to overcome this critical barrier , the next few days will be pivotal in determining its direction. Whether BTC manages to push above $100K or settles into a more extended consolidation, its performance will likely set the tone for the broader crypto market. Bitcoin Facing Risks Bitcoin’s struggle to reclaim the $100K mark has placed the market leader at a crossroads. While the price shows resilience, every day spent below this critical level raises questions about the strength of the bullish structure. To confirm a continued rally, BTC must break through and hold above $100K, signaling renewed confidence in the market. Axel Adler recently shared critical insights on X , shedding light on the current market dynamics. Adler’s analysis focuses on the Block P/L Count Ratio model, a key metric that tracks Profit and Loss activity within each 10-minute Bitcoin block. The data reveals that after investors locked in maximum profits at $90K–$100K, the metric has dropped significantly, from levels above 100K to 159. This sharp decline suggests a cooling market as trading activity slows and participants reassess their positions. Adler notes that the amount of time BTC will spend at these levels depends heavily on demand. If buying pressure remains stagnant, the market could struggle to sustain its current valuation, increasing the risk of a deeper correction. Conversely, a surge in demand could rapidly push BTC back above $100K, reigniting the bullish trend. The coming days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s direction. A decisive reclaim of $100K would solidify its bullish outlook, while extended consolidation below this mark could test investor confidence. As traders monitor these developments, Bitcoin’s ability to navigate this pivotal phase will likely shape the broader crypto market’s trajectory. Struggle Below Key Moving Average Bitcoin is currently trading below the critical 4-hour 200 moving average at $98,208, a key level that must be reclaimed to confirm a bullish structure. This mark has become a significant resistance point, and the price appears to be setting a lower high within the main liquidity range between $108K and $92K. This signals potential risks for further downside if momentum does not shift soon. The $98,208 level is pivotal for Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. A failure to break above this moving average could indicate that bearish pressure remains dominant, potentially driving the price toward lower demand zones closer to $92K. Such a move would challenge the broader bullish narrative and test investor confidence. For bulls to regain control, BTC must decisively break out above the $100K mark in the coming days. A successful move above this psychological and technical level would likely trigger a strong rally, attracting renewed buying interest and solidifying the bullish structure.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 493,800 followers on the social media platform X that altcoins are poised to outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ) based on historical data. The crypto strategist shares a chart to show that in 2017 and 2021, altseason happened when Bitcoin printed a new six-month candle after surpassing the cycle’s all-time high. “This has been the candle that altcoins make the moves many wait four years for.” Source: TechDev/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that it takes 1,280 days after Bitcoin prints a cycle top before altcoins can go on a rampage. When the signal appeared in 2017 and 2021, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) saw sharp declines for one year, giving altcoins a lot of time to outperform BTC. The BTC.D chart tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to Bitcoin. A bearish BTC.D chart suggests that altcoins are gaining value faster than Bitcoin. Zooming in, TechDev says altseason also tends to happen when Bitcoin taps the upper range of its Bollinger Bands on the weekly chart. Traders use the Bollinger Bands to identify potential periods of volatility expansion and determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. “When Bitcoin hits this expansion line, altcoins have gone on a steep six-month run.” Source: TechDev/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that the TOTAL2 chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, will witness huge upside bursts in the coming months. At time of writing, TOTAL2 is trading for $1.476 trillion.

The meme coin leader is now testing critical resistance around the $0.40 mark, a level that could determine its next move. Related Reading: Chainlink Tunrns Resistance Into Support – ATH Next? Top analyst Bluntz recently shared an insightful analysis, emphasizing that Dogecoin appears to be in a strategic accumulation period. According to Bluntz, this phase is setting the foundation for an aggressive surge later in the cycle, potentially positioning DOGE for significant gains. Such accumulation periods are often precursors to explosive upward movements, especially for assets with strong community backing like Dogecoin. The coming days will be pivotal for DOGE as it battles to break above the $0.40 resistance level. A successful breakout could ignite a bullish rally, reinforcing Dogecoin’s position as a market favorite. However, failure to clear this zone might result in short-term consolidation, delaying the anticipated surge. Dogecoin Devising A Rally Dogecoin has displayed strong bullish price action since early November, defying market volatility and capturing the attention of investors. Even with its recent correction, the price has managed to recover, showing growth that underscores its potential for further upside. Bluntz recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the accumulation phase in the DOGE/BTC ratio. According to Bluntz, the ratio is “still accumulating,” suggesting that Dogecoin is preparing for a significant rally in this cycle. Bluntz confidently stated that there is “no chance” DOGE won’t surge during this bull run, reflecting the analyst’s optimistic outlook on the meme coin leader. While Dogecoin’s trajectory looks promising, it’s essential to recognize the associated risks. Volatility remains a hallmark of cryptocurrency markets, and Dogecoin is no exception. The broader economic landscape adds another layer of uncertainty, with rising interest rates, inflation, and global economic pressures influencing investor sentiment. These factors could contribute to periods of sharp price fluctuations for DOGE. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts A Bullish Q1 – Can ETH/BTC Ratio Push Above 0.04? For long-term investors, Dogecoin’s ongoing accumulation phase may present an opportunity to enter the market ahead of a potential breakout. However, risk management and a cautious approach are vital, especially given the unpredictable nature of both the crypto market and the global economy. If Dogecoin manages to clear key resistance levels, it could validate Bluntz’s bullish thesis and solidify its status as a top performer in this cycle. Price In Consolidation Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.38 after encountering resistance at the $0.40 mark. This level has temporarily halted DOGE’s upward momentum, placing the price in a consolidation phase. Such periods of sideways trading are not uncommon and could last for several days or even weeks as the market gathers strength for the next move. Despite the pause, optimism remains high among investors and analysts. The $0.43 mark is emerging as a critical resistance level for DOGE. A clean breakout above this level would signify renewed bullish momentum, potentially propelling Dogecoin to multi-year highs or even new all-time highs. Achieving this would likely draw fresh attention from both retail and institutional investors, further bolstering its upward trajectory.

We also look at the record outflows of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF plus regulatory updates from China and other trending news items. FalconX, Arbelos take crypto derivatives to another level FalconX, a digital asset prime broker, acquired Arbelos Markets, a New York-based derivatives trading firm led by industry veterans Joshua Lim, Shiliang Tang, and Sergio Almada Monter. The purchase price wasn’t revealed. Arbelos Markets raised a substantial $28 million in funding back in May. FalconX backed Arbelos at the time. FalconX CEO Raghu Yarlagadda and Arbelos CEO Joshua Lim both emphasized the shared mission to enhance market liquidity and expand crypto’s role in cross-asset portfolios. The partnership marks a pivotal moment for the crypto derivatives market as it evolves to mirror traditional asset classes. MicroStrategy targets $42 billion in funds MicroStrategy intends to raise $2 billion through preferred stock offerings as part of its 21/21 Plan. The company is targeting $42 billion in fundraising over three years. Shares in the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company dropped by 21% in December, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down by less than 2%. This marks a significant divergence (MicroStrategy stock typically moves in tandem with Bitcoin). MicroStrategy shares spiked over 320% in 2024, while Bitcoin jumped by 120%. Some investors now view it as a better alternative to BTC and spot Bitcoin ETFs.

The acquisition grants Coinbase a Cyprus Investment Firm license under the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, enabling it to offer contracts for differences (CFDs) in Europe. CFDs allow traders to speculate on asset price movements without owning the underlying assets, catering to professional and institutional clients. With its new license, Coinbase is positioning itself to compete in global markets, with some analysts predicting it could surpass Charles Schwab, the $7 trillion asset manager, as the world’s most valuable brokerage. China’s new rules, South Korea considers crypto ETFs China has introduced new rules requiring banks to monitor and flag risky transactions, including those involving cryptocurrencies, making it more difficult for mainland investors to trade digital assets. The regulations focus on identifying “risky foreign exchange trading behaviors,” such as underground banking, cross-border crypto transactions, and other illegal financial activities. These measures aim to curb unauthorized financial practices and strengthen oversight of digital asset trading. South Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo revealed plans to evaluate crypto spot ETF approval in 2025, while the FSC considers permitting security token offerings. Binance bags another approval Binance received full regulatory approval from the Banco Central do Brasil to acquire Sim;paul, a licensed broker-dealer.

The overall crypto market cap reached $3.5 trillion, up from $3.42 trillion last week, marking continued market strength. However, NFT sales declined 17.54% to $132.7 million, according to CryptoSlam data. December 2024 recorded over 25 crypto hacks, resulting in losses totaling $24.7 million. This is a 71% decrease from November’s figures, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield’s latest report. Inflows, outflows BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experienced its largest-ever single-day outflow on January 2, with $332.62 million withdrawn, contributing to a three-day streak of outflows totaling $392.6 million. The decline came as U.S. trading resumed after the New Year, and Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw $242.3 million in withdrawals, according to SoSoValue data. While BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF faced withdrawals, other crypto funds gained traction. Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark 21Shares’s ARKB recorded inflows of $48.31 million, $36.2 million, and $16.54 million, respectively, reflecting continued investor interest in Bitcoin-related products despite the short-term outflow trend. The Floki ( FLOKI ) DAO approved a significant proposal to allocate a portion of its token supply as liquidity funding for a Floki exchange-traded product. Legal matters Former Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon entered a not guilty plea to criminal fraud charges in Manhattan federal court on Jan. 2, following his recent extradition from Montenegro. Defunct crypto lender Celsius Network filed an appeal challenging a U.S. court ruling that dismissed its $444 million claim for damages against FTX. Judge John Dorsey previously rejected Celsius’ claims, stating the firm’s initial proof of claim, which briefly mentioned investigating preference claims, failed to meet the Bankruptcy Code’s requirements. Celsius had reduced its original $2 billion claim to $444 million, but the amendment was deemed untimely and unrelated to the original filing. Meanwhile, former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky faces multiple fraud charges, including wire fraud and market manipulation, related to Celsius’ collapse.

This is despite the declining NFT sales of the Pudgy Penguins collection, which fell 52% over the last week, per CryptoSlam. Main Metrics Showing Token Growth The current price of PENGU stood at $0.040 at writing time, a spectacular 250% jump from its listing on December 17. At launch, the token’s market capitalization stood at $2.8 billion, but has contracted to $2.5 billion. Hours earlier, on-chain data provider Lookonchain had reported that a wallet transferred out 84 mln PENGU, worth $3.13 mln, from Binance – a possible sign that some big holders have been cashing out. Viral Marketing and Community Engagement Pudgy Penguins still find innovative ways to capture the attention of the public. The GIFs and Telegram stickers of the project reached 1.1 billion views within the first five days of January, which helped increase brand awareness. According to Berko Crypto, the community lead, the viral campaigns have increased engagement manifold on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. PENGU Token Expansion Plans Currently, PENGU runs on the Solana blockchain but plans to expand into Ethereum and Abstract, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum built by Igloo Inc. The maximum supply of the token is 88.88 billion, out of which 25.9% is reserved for airdrops to Pudgy Penguin NFT holders. There is no confirmation on the official use case for the token. However, several analysts believe it will be used for governance and exclusive ecosystem perks. Slumping NFT Sales Despite the token growth, Pudgy Penguins NFT sales slumped considerably. Weekly sales dropped to $5.5m, down by 52% alongside a slump in transactions by 51% and by 56 and 41%, respectively, active buyers and sellers over the week. In comparison, the Azuki NFTs were slumped by 17.65%, while DMarket on Mythos surged 10.43%. A Retail Success Story Pudgy Penguins remains the second-largest NFT collection by market cap, with $721 million, only second to CryptoPunks at $1.4 billion.

Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) price jumped by almost 17%, making it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. According to CryptoSlam , Pudgy Penguin’s sales rose by 68% on Jan. 5, making them the second-best performing NFTs after Guild of Guardians Heroes. The number of transactions rose by 85% to 13. As a result, the total sales of the NFT project rose to over $545 million, making it one of the most successful collections in the industry. All sales transactions rose to over 62,500, while all owners rose to 5,004. Pudgy Penguins’ sales rose by over 261% in the last 30 days to $104 million, possibly because of the PENGU airdrop, which happened on Dec. 17. You might also like: Berachain, Linea airdrop odds rise on Polymarket Still, it is not clear whether the upward momentum will continue for Pudgy Penguins. Data shows its sales dropped by double digits in the last seven days. Historically, many NFTs tend to lose momentum after a while. For example, once-popular NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club have seen their floor prices crash in the past few months. Their sales have dwindled, with BAYC’s sales falling by 41% in the last 30 days. ApeCoin ( APE ), the token created by Yuga Labs, has also crashed by over 95% from its all-time high. PENGU price has formed a double-top Pudgy Penguins Token | Chart by crypto.news The two-hour chart shows that the Pengu token has been in a steady uptrend after bottoming at $0.02286 in December. It has formed a series of higher highs and higher lows, and an ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since Dec. 20. Pengu has also moved slightly above the key resistance level at $0.04080, its highest swing on Jan. 2 and invalidating that double-top pattern. The Pudgy Penguins token has now hit a key resistance at $0.0433, where it has formed another double-top pattern whose neckline is at $0.030. A double-top is one of the riskiest patterns in the market. Therefore, there is a risk that the Pengu price will suffer a big reversal unless it moves above the resistance at $0.043. On the positive side, a move above that level will raise the chances of the token hitting its all-time high of $0.04600.

Johnson cited several issues in his warning that the stock could experience huge losses this year. He noted that this could cause distress for the company’s businesses in the long run. Johnson’s prediction is coming after Tesla’s Q4 2024 deliveries failed to meet the predicted target. Despite this, the stock registered a slight surge on January 3, climbing to $410.44 after an 8% jump. According to Johnson’s post on X, Tesla is experiencing distress on its business front, a development that could have a telling effect on its stock. Analyst explains why Tesla’s stock could decline In his post on X, Johnson explained that Tesla is suffering from declining sales for the first time in its history. He said it could translate to a worse margin when the 2024 earnings are released. “Things are bad for $TSLA’s actual biz. Sales just went ex-growth for the first time, and margins will likely see an absolute bloodbath when Q4 earnings are reported,” Johnson said. 1/2 Things are bad for $TSLA’s actual biz. Sales just went ex-growth for the first time ever, and margins will likely see an absolute bloodbath when Q4 earnings are reported. Oh… & the betting websites peg 1Q25E sales at 395K, down from 495K in Q4 (-20% QoQ). That’s a DISASTER. https://t.co/DRob74DfPp pic.twitter.com/ThplEwkgNv — Gordon Johnson (@GordonJohnson19) January 4, 2025 Analysts have projected Tesla’s average total revenue in Q4 2024 to be around $27.18 billion, representing an 8% increase from its Q4 2023 revenue figure of $25.17 billion. The full-year revenue is also expected to increase by $99.63 billion, a 3% increase from its 2023 revenue of $96.77 billion. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Q4 2024 report indicated that deliveries dropped to 495,570 from the 504,770 expected by analysts for the quarter. The total number of deliveries for the year also dropped to 1.79 million compared to the 1.81 million deliveries in 2023. Although production numbers were fair, there have been raised eyebrows over the drop in annual deliveries considering its aggressive market share growth influenced by CEO Elon Musk ’s affiliation with incoming president Donald Trump. Notably, Tesla suffered significant challenges in 2024, with its decline in demand worsened by competition from rivals like Hyundai. Musk had initially predicted slowed growth in 2024, a reality that has dawned on the company. The future of Tesla’s stock According to Johnson, Tesla’s stocks’ ability to rally regardless of its failure to meet analysts’ expectations can be tied to a rise in options trading. He noted that the stock price is being pushed upwards by heavy call option purchases. He said the moves, dictated by speculative traders, are legally manipulating the stock price. In addition, he mentioned that the development is taking the attention away from the company’s deteriorating fundamentals. Furthermore, he predicts that the stock will see bearish signals, as it will battle with declining growth and increased competition. Johnson has always held a bearish view of the stock, noting that the company is overvalued. However, Johnson is not the only one with a bearish outlook. JPMorgan has also warned that several issues, including delivery and regulatory changes, could cost the company about $3.2 billion. JPMorgan has consequently issued an underweight rating, adding a $135 price target. Meanwhile, a narrative that counters the bearish outlook is the advancement of its full self-driving (FSD) and AI technology. The company has focused on both areas even in the face of competition and delivery challenges. Although both areas of focus are still speculative at the moment, the move could help the company maintain its lead in the EV market. Analysts have also floated that friendly regulations under Donald Trump’s administration could potentially help Tesla thrive.

The Ethereum counterparts sit in the opposite corner, as they have been mostly in the green since mid-December despite the FOMC aftermath on the entire market. BTC ETFs Are Back The latest FOMC meeting that took place in mid-December had a dramatic and immediate effect on US-based investors in terms of their Bitcoin-related activities. Following a superb streak after the presidential elections in which they poured billions of dollars within weeks into the regulated BTC financial vehicles , they did a 180-turn and started taking funds out. December 19 was the worst day in terms of daily net outflows, with $671.9 million taken out. By January 2, seven out of the nine trading days were in the red, with a total withdrawn amount of roughly $2 billion. This negative streak was finally broken on Friday as the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $908.1 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with $357 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT at $253.1 million and Ark Invest’s ARKB at $222.6 million. No fund recorded any outflows. Friday’s numbers were so impressive that they managed to turn the whole week around. After the $415.1 million withdrawn on Monday and $242.3 million on Thursday, the week ended in the green with $256 million in net inflows, given the minor $5.3 million on Tuesday. BTC’s price actions within the same week were quite volatile as the asset slumped hard on Monday amid the massive outflows to $91,300. However, it pumped to almost $99,000 later during the week as the inflows returned. Ethereum ETFs’ Landscape Unlike the BTC ETFs, the funds tracking Ethereum saw fewer days in the red after the aforementioned Fed meeting. Withdrawals were observed on December 19 and 20, but investors started to pour funds into them in the following days. The past week was less positive, though, as net outflows dominated. $55.5 million was withdrawn on Monday and $77.5 million on Thursday. The $36 million in net inflows on Tuesday and $58.9 million on Friday couldn’t make up the difference, and the week ended with $36.1 million in the red. ETH’s price tumbled hard on Monday as well but is 6.5% up on a weekly scale, which is more than double the increase for BTC. As of press time, Ethereum’s native token stands above $3,600.

The fluctuating prices of Pepe and the struggles of Bonk, especially following its recent token burn, have sparked doubts about the long-term viability of meme coins. These coins, largely driven by speculation, often result in significant uncertainty for investors. Web3Bay emerges as a formidable contender, aiming to transform decentralized e-commerce. This platform’s foundation is built on practical innovation rather than transient excitement, positioning it as a likely leader in the next crypto bull run and providing a stable opportunity for investors seeking more than speculative gains. Web3Bay: Converting FOMO into Tangible Benefits While coins like Pepe and Bonk continue to fuel speculative interest, Web3Bay introduces a tangible alternative through its decentralized e-commerce platform. By removing intermediaries, it facilitates direct interactions between buyers and sellers. The platform’s reliance on blockchain technology and a clear practical application establishes a solid foundation, unlike the less stable meme coins. With a presale structured across 28 stages, featuring incremental price increases, Web3Bay has already drawn significant interest, showcasing its potential for sustained growth. Currently in its third stage, the presale offers 3BAY tokens at $0.0039675 each, with over 76 million tokens sold, totaling more than $303,849 in funds raised. Starting at $0.003 per token, the strategic pricing model incentivizes early participation, with a target of $0.1959 per token by the final stage, potentially yielding substantial returns for initial investors. Allocating 40% of its total 2 billion token supply to the presale underlines Web3Bay’s commitment to community engagement and foundational strength. Innovative features of the platform, including dual payment options and decentralized storage through IPFS, along with automated smart contracts, ensure scalability and accessibility. Further roadmap plans, like integrating an NFT marketplace and DeFi staking, position Web3Bay as a prime candidate to spearhead the next bull market. Pepe Price Dynamics: Ongoing Meme Coin Speculation Pepe continues to be a central figure for meme coin enthusiasts, illustrating the erratic nature of speculative cryptocurrencies. Recently valued at around $0.00000183, Pepe has experienced significant price swings. A recent substantial purchase by a notable investor momentarily boosted its market presence, suggesting possible upward trends. Yet, the inherent volatility casts doubt on its sustained relevance, with investors closely watching its performance metrics. Despite initial excitement, sustaining its momentum has proven difficult. Originally popular as a community-driven token, its dependency on market sentiment makes it a risky bet. Although analysts suggest a potential rise to $0.01 by 2025 if conditions are favorable, the speculative basis of Pepe remains a concern for prudent investors. Challenges for Bonk Crypto in Sustaining Interest Bonk has made headlines as Solana’s meme coin, but keeping its momentum has been a struggle. It recently traded at $0.00003547, suffering a 7% decline even after a significant token burn event meant to enhance its value. This event underlined its reliance on community-driven hype over substantial innovations. Despite its unique positioning as “the people’s dog coin,” Bonk’s speculative nature limits its long-term appeal. Faced with growing competition and a lack of distinctive utility, its ability to remain relevant depends on its capacity for innovation. In Conclusion The volatility of Pepe and Bonk’s ongoing challenges exemplify the speculative risks inherent in meme coins.

Deaton made his proposal in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on January 4, addressing President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other members of the incoming administration. Deaton framed the investigation as a critical matter that extends beyond the crypto industry, calling it a fight against the erosion of institutional integrity and unchecked power from unelected bureaucrats. He warned that failure to challenge these actions would set a dangerous precedent, where regulatory bodies could quietly suppress entire industries they disapprove of, hindering innovation and economic opportunity. “A lot of people, including some in crypto, underestimate the significance of ChokePoint 2.0. In the middle of the @Ripple case, which I argued was the most significant non-fraud @SECGov enforcement action in modern history,” he wrote. In his post, Deaton offered to lead the investigation into this alleged operation without salary, saying that the American public deserves the truth far more than anyone needs another taxpayer-funded paycheck. His comments follow a significant legal development in the case, as a court recently allowed Coinbase to access unredacted documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). These documents could provide further insight into the role federal agencies may have played in the supposed operation. As a former prosecutor and Special Assistant United States Attorney I am very serious about volunteering to help lead a federal investigation into ChokePoint 2.0. I would accept the task without salary. The American people deserve the truth a hell of a lot more than I or anyone… https://t.co/LFdhpCixnr — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 4, 2025 Deaton’s proposal comes on the heels of his recent defeat in the Massachusetts Senate race, where he ran against crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren.

The company has confirmed the arrangement in its latest production update describing the loans as part of a strategy to generate yield and manage operating expenses. Why Is Bitcoin Miner MARA Lending 17,377 Bitcoin Bitcoin miner MARA has stated that the 7,377 BTC loans are indeed short-term in nature and the company has entered into these arrangements with “credible counterparties only.” Robert Samuels the Company’s Director of Investor Relations said that the lending programme is to achieve ‘modest single-digit yield’ to enhance the operational sustainability. ”The long-term goal is to achieve a level of return on investment adequate to cover operating costs,” Samuels noted. This is in line with the MARA’s continuous involvement in Bitcoin lending in the whole of 2024 where it earned $3.9m in interest income in Q3 and $4.8m in the first half of the year. Concurrent with the announcement, Bitcoin price trend had turned positive after reclaiming the $98k resistance and trading at $98,194. As for the third-party borrowers, the MARA did not reveal their identities, but the firm said that the demand for its lending program is still strong in light of increased market risk aversion. The recent failures of BlockFi and Genesis in 2022 have only raised questions about counterparty risks in the crypto lending market. MARA’s Expanding Bitcoin Reserves Bitcoin miner MARA closed the year with a total of 44,893 BTC in its reserve which was a 192.5% growth from the initial 15,174 BTC in the year. The company achieved this growth through two main avenues: mining and acquisitions. Throughout 2024, MARA mined 9,457 BTC and bought 22,065 BTC at an average rate of $87,205. As of now, total reserves are estimated at about $4.4 billion at the current market price. The firm’s approach to acquisition is consistent with its treasury policy of holding all mined bitcoins and increasing reserves through the capital markets. Fred Thiel, CEO of MARA, confirmed that the company remains steadfast in its decision of holding Bitcoin in the long-term as a part of the company’s strategic asset. Boost in Mining Performance MARA reported an energized hashrate of 53 exahashes per second (EH/s) as of December 31, exceeding its year-end goal. However, its realized hashrate—the effective mining power used for production—stood at 47 EH/s, consistent with November figures. The company’s year-end hashrate performance represented a 15% increase compared to earlier in the year. Mining operations remain central to MARA’s growth, as the firm continues to scale its infrastructure to keep pace with the competitive and energy-intensive Bitcoin mining industry. Bitcoin miner MARA’s CEO Fred Thiel concurrently shared his optimism about Bitcoin’s future, predicting that the cryptocurrency could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. Speaking to FOX Business, Thiel emphasized the role of institutional adoption and regulatory changes as key drivers for this anticipated growth. Thiel encouraged retail investors to consider Bitcoin as a long-term asset, advocating for consistent, small-scale investments. “My recommendation is to put just a little away every month in Bitcoin and forget about it,” he said.

Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. Developer activity has surged by 45.6% over the past year, indicating strong ecosystem momentum. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in the price of OP. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and would require an unprecedented level of growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Elon Loves MAGA (ELOMAGA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Loves MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Loves MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Loves MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Loves MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Loves MAGA by entering its contract address – 6mRLPcgWXUBYNfXouCxBoyjFzNjww9HNVFpBJkrqmFeE – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 16:23:00

Bitcoin has spent the weekend consolidating, but this could signal a potential breakout. Looking at the bigger picture , Bitcoin’s current price action is framed within a larger cycle that began in late 2022. According to the Elliott Wave theory, the market has moved through multiple waves, and we may be nearing the end of the current cycle. The first wave completed in April 2023, followed by a series of corrections and rallies. Currently, the market seems to be completing wave five, which could signal another high before a major correction. Short-Term Price Action: Identifying Support and Resistance For short-term traders, Bitcoin’s price action has been consolidating with minimal movement over the weekend. The nearest support levels are between $95,900 and $96,530. A move above the $98,500 level would provide confirmation of further upside, with key resistance levels at $99,000 and $100,200. Key Fibonacci Levels and Potential Upside Targets The next key resistance target for Bitcoin is seen around the $30k region, a significant Fibonacci level. This level could act as a milestone, signaling the final push in this cycle. However, even if Bitcoin reaches this level, it may experience a larger correction afterward. Will Bitcoin Dip to $90k Levels? In a recent CNBC interview, Jim Cramer, host of “Mad Money,” recommended $90,000 as the next price point for those looking to buy Bitcoin. He explained the importance of monitoring Bitcoin’s price and said $90,000 could be a good entry level for new investors.

A notable response came from Jator, who commented , “No doubt, brother! This is the moment $XRP holders have been waiting for. 7 years of diamond hands and unwavering faith are about to pay off big time. And let’s not forget, the $ARMY is right here alongside, ready to conquer new heights together.” His mention of $ARMY, a meme coin on the XRP Ledger, highlights the growing ecosystem surrounding XRP, which continues to attract attention and innovation. Technical Analysis Suggests a Promising Price Target Adding weight to the community’s optimism, renowned crypto analyst TonytheBull recently shared a technical analysis predicting a potential price breakout for XRP. According to his study, the formation of a bull flag—a classic pattern indicating upward momentum—could propel XRP’s price to $13 if confirmed under favorable market conditions. While he acknowledged the ambitious nature of this target, TonytheBull emphasized that it remains achievable within the right macroeconomic and market environment. Such predictions have sparked enthusiasm among investors, particularly those who believe XRP’s price has long been undervalued. The possible $13 target represents a substantial increase from current levels and could signify a pivotal moment in XRP’s market trajectory.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently reinforced confidence in XRP’s future in a message to the community . In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he stated, “Momentum and increased focus on real-world utility continues to build.” His remarks emphasize Ripple’s commitment to expanding XRP’s adoption in practical use cases, particularly in cross-border payments and decentralized finance. The XRP Ledger itself continues to thrive, with projects like $ARMY showcasing its versatility and appeal to developers. These developments point to a growing ecosystem that could further enhance XRP’s value proposition as a utility-focused digital asset. As 2025 begins, XRP remains a focal point in the cryptocurrency market. Community optimism, technical insights, and Ripple’s strategic initiatives suggest that XRP could be positioned for a significant breakout. However, investors are encouraged to remain cautious, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. For the XRP community, the current momentum represents not just price potential but also the validation of years of belief in the asset’s long-term promise.

38577262,https://finbold.com/?p=226018,1736095820,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Dogecoin price prediction as whales accumulate 1 billion DOGE in 24 hours,https://finbold.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-as-whales-accumulate-1-billion-doge-in-24-hours/,"Top meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has experienced minor short-term volatility, with on-chain data suggesting growing investor confidence in the token. Specifically, Dogecoin whales accumulated over 1.08 billion DOGE within 24 hours, according to data from prominent on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on January 3. This significant accumulation coincided with when DOGE witnessed a price decline, indicating that major investors were capitalizing on the dip. Such whale accumulation often precedes a price recovery, pointing to strong confidence from investors with substantial holdings. Dogecoin whale transactions. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts DOGE price prediction Regarding Dogecoin’s next price action, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT-4o for insights on how the token will likely trade in light of the current on-chain developments. The AI tool provided three possible scenarios. In a bullish case, where ChatGPT predicted that Dogecoin accumulation is substantial, market sentiment could shift positively. The DOGE price is projected to reach the $0.40 to $0.45 range within a few weeks in such a case. In a balanced situation, where the asset makes minimal moves with mixed market signals of balanced buying and selling pressures, the AI tool estimates that DOGE could trade between $0.28 and $0.32. Meanwhile, in a bearish scenario, where Dogecoin experiences sustained profit-taking, especially from whales, alongside possible bearish market sentiment, DOGE could drop to $0.27. Dogecoin price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Dogecoin’s technical setup Regarding Dogecoin’s technical setup , analysis by pseudonymous cryptocurrency market analyst CryptoBullet in an X post on January 4 highlighted a possible path to the elusive $1. According to the analysis, Dogecoin recently retested the lower boundary of a well-defined ascending channel. This retest, marked by a bounce off the channel’s support, signals potential bullish momentum. The current price level of around $0.38 is pivotal, as Dogecoin remains within this ascending channel, which has guided its upward trend since 2021. The channel’s lower boundary, around $0.26, acted as a support level during the recent retest, while the upper boundary, near $0.54, serves as a key resistance level. If Dogecoin can sustain its upward movement within this formation, the analyst noted the door towards $1 will be open. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: TradingView On the other hand, an analysis by Martinez highlighted the possibility that Dogecoin could experience a 1,000% spike if historical bull cycles are replicated. In this instance, past bull runs of 2017 and 2021 saw Dogecoin surge by 1,000% within 27 to 42 days. Therefore, this consistent pattern raises the possibility of a similar surge in the current market. DOGE price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts Notably, Dogecoin has benefited from the recent crypto market rally, partly inspired by the election of Donald Trump, who is viewed as bullish for digital assets. At the same time, Dogecoin investors will be watching the influence of its top promoter, Elon Musk , and his potential role in the upcoming Trump administration, especially under the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). To this end, Alex Thorn from blockchain firm Galaxy Digital predicted that Dogecoin will surpass $1 and reach a $100 billion market cap in 2025. The firm suggested that Dogecoin’s performance might be influenced by D.O.G.E. operations, potentially impacting its market capitalization. “Dogecoin will finally hit $1, with the world’s largest and oldest memecoin touching a $100bn market cap. However, the Dogecoin market cap will be eclipsed by the Department of Government Efficiency, which will identify and successfully enact cuts in amounts exceeding Dogecoin’s 2025 high-water mark market cap,” Alex Thorn said. Dogecoin price analysis By press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.38, having rallied by almost 0.5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, DOGE has rallied by a massive 20%.

According to data from CoinWarz , the Bitcoin hashrate has hit an all-time high (ATH) of over 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s). The hashrate is the total computational power that secures the network and processes transactions. Bitcoin Miners Double Hashrate in a Year The recent increase sets the hashrate to approximately twice its level last year. In January 2024, Bitcoin’s hashrate fluctuated around 510 EH/s. As of this writing, the hashrate has reduced slightly and hovers around 780 EH/s. However, the spike to above 1,000 EH/s shows that BTC miners have dedicated more computational resources to the blockchain. This increased resources ultimately implies an improved security network. The development is significant, considering miners have seen their reward crash from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This slash occurred after the April halving event , which reduced all miners’ rewards. So, the increased hashrate means miners have gone out of their way to make the network more resistant to attacks. Strategic Adaptations Post-Halving Following the halving in 2024, BTC’s strong performance helped offset the headwinds. According to JPMorgan, mining firms had to acquire other miners with turn-key facilities. The aim was to boost their power pipeline. Additionally, these miners have prioritized the accumulation of BTC on their balance sheets. Last month JPMorgan said it raised the price targets for four Bitcoin mining stocks. This was to reflect the value from the miners’ electrical power assets as well as their Bitcoin holdings. Institutional Interest Bolsters Bitcoin’s Network The improvement in security of the Bitcoin network as a result of increasing hashrate is crucial given soaring interest from institutional players. There has been an upsurge of investment by institutional investors into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) products. Available data reveals that in November 2024, Bitcoin ETFs flipped $100 billion in net assets, marking the first time to achieve that feat. JPMorgan noted that there was huge profit-taking in the sector in November. At the moment, stakeholders anticipate an uptick as more institutional investors embrace the asset. A driving force is the regulatory clarity the incoming administration of President-elect, Donald Trump could provide to the industry.

The analyst said he was “cautiously optimistic” about Bitcoin, citing the BTC price forming a Head and Shoulders Pattern (OMO). According to the analyst, a correction to $78,000 could occur as a result of this formation. Ali Martinez said that a strong close above $100,000 is needed to break this bearish pattern. BTC price is trading at $97,641 at the time of writing. The analyst notes that BTC has a hard supply wall between $98,000 and $100,000, which is why this area acts as a resistance zone. Related News: Coinbase Reveals 2025 Announcement That Could Radically Change the Cryptocurrency World Ali Martinez also talked about Dogecoin, Cardano, and XRP in his statement about altcoins. According to the analyst, crypto whales bought 40 million Cardano (ADA) coins in the last 48 hours. On the other hand, there are also active moments in the XRP network. XRP experienced a sudden jump in transaction volume and exceeded the $ 7 billion level. Evaluating Dogecoin, the analyst recalled that in previous bull cycles, it took 27-42 days for DOGE to rise by 1,000%. *This is not investment advice.

The strategy encompasses three key initiatives: improving shareholder transparency through new reporting mechanisms, expanding global partnerships to advance Bitcoin adoption, and strengthening Metaplanet’s position within Japan’s cryptocurrency ecosystem.

This positions Metaplanet to potentially climb higher in the rankings of corporate Bitcoin holders, which currently includes notable companies like Marathon Digital (44,394 BTC), Riot Platforms (17,429 BTC), and Tesla (9,720 BTC).

Daily trading volume has jumped 18% to $836.8 million, and market capitalization now stands at $31.35 billion, securing Cardano’s position among the top ten cryptocurrencies. However, while ADA’s recovery fuels optimism for a rally to $1.45, the path to higher benchmarks remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS), currently priced at $0.175, is poised to outpace ADA’s growth trajectory, with its innovative features and real-world applications setting the stage for exponential growth to $5 and $10. Cardano’s Mixed Outlook Cardano’s recent price movement highlights its fluctuating momentum. While the token has risen 2% over the last 24 hours, reaching $0.8927, its position below critical resistance levels signals potential challenges. Analysts suggest supporting above $0.7620 is crucial to sustaining the current upward trend. If ADA breaks past the $0.93 resistance, it could climb to $1.12 or even $1.45. However, bearish indicators, such as a declining RSI of 43.79 and a negative MACD, point to waning buyer interest. The token’s market performance reflects its struggle to achieve consistent upward momentum, leaving investors wary of its potential to sustain gains. Rexas Finance Revolutionizes Real-World Asset Tokenization In stark contrast, Rexas Finance emerges as a transformative force in the crypto market. RXS bridges the gap between real-world assets and decentralized finance by leveraging blockchain technology. The platform enables investors to easily tokenize and acquire assets such as real estate, gold, and commodities. Full ownership or fractional investment is now accessible with a single click, removing traditional barriers and unlocking endless possibilities. Rexas’ Token Builder tool empowers users to effortlessly tokenize their assets, while its Launchpad facilitates fundraising for these tokens. The Rexas Estate platform further extends the ecosystem, enabling seamless investment and asset management. Complementing these features, tools like the Quickmint Bot, GenAI, and AI Shield integrate advanced technology to streamline operations and enhance security. RXS operates on the ERC-20 standard, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Its allocation is meticulously planned: 42.5% for presale, 22.5% for staking pools, and smaller percentages for marketing, liquidity, and team incentives. Rexas Finance prioritized public participation in its presale over venture capital funding, raising $33,125,000 in the first ten stages alone. The eleventh stage is now open at $0.175 per token, with total funds raised reaching $34,280,237. Early investors have already seen the token’s value increase nearly sixfold from its initial price of $0.03, signaling strong market confidence. Rexas Finance has also launched a $1 million giveaway to celebrate its growth, offering 20 winners $50,000 each in USDT. Participants can boost their chances by completing actions and referring friends. Additionally, the project’s listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has enhanced its visibility, credibility, and community engagement. With plans to launch on three tier-one exchanges and a CertiK audit ensuring security and trustworthiness, RXS demonstrates its commitment to transparency and growth. Why RXS Will Surpass ADA Rexas Finance’s unique value proposition positions it to outperform Cardano and similar tokens. While ADA’s technical outlook remains uncertain, RXS continues to attract investors with its innovative solutions and real-world applications. By enabling fractional ownership of high-value assets, Rexas Finance democratizes investment opportunities, appealing to a broader audience. For example, an Asian investor can own a percentage of a European hotel and earn passive income, illustrating the platform’s global reach. These capabilities highlight RXS’ potential to disrupt traditional investment models and achieve widespread adoption. Final Thoughts Cardano’s climb to $1 underscores its resilience, but the uncertainty of sustained growth raises questions about its long-term potential. In contrast, Rexas Finance’s innovative asset tokenisation approach and rapid presale success make it a standout contender in the crypto market. With a clear roadmap, robust ecosystem, and growing investor interest, RXS is on track to reach $5 and $10, offering unparalleled opportunities for early adopters.

One such initiative, Rexas Finance (RXS), is creating a lot of excitement for its creative strategy and the possibility of yielding more returns than even reputable coins like XRP. Rexas Finance, priced at just $0.175 in its current presale, is attracting interest from retail investors as well as XRP aficionados since it is positioned as a top investment choice. Many XRP bulls are hedging their bets by investing in Rexas Finance , which has special features, unparalleled use cases, and explosive development potential. Even if they remain hopeful about Ripple's price recovery and supremacy, could this viral altcoin surpass XRP by 2025? XRP: Recover Mode Market Veteran With a market capitalization of about $125 billion, Ripple's XRP, which is currently trading at $2.20, has exhibited a remarkable increase—52% over the past month. Even with this rebound, XRP's market dominance has dropped over the years; its share of the cryptocurrency market today is just 2%. Driven by Bitcoin's possible climb above $100,000, analysts like EGRAG have observed that XRP might reclaim some supremacy as it approaches new all-time highs. Although XRP's path is still bright, many investors are eager to diversify into rising altcoins with more upside potential; Rexas Finance has rapidly become a leading contender. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Real-World Asset Tokenizing Game-Changer Rexas Finance's popularity stems mostly from its innovative use case: real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The platform uses blockchain, artificial intelligence, and distributed finance (DeFi) to allow fractional ownership of real estate, goods, and collectibles. Offering practical value that appeals to both retail and institutional investors, this utility-driven strategy distinguishes RXS from speculative tokens. Important Characteristics Boosting Investor Interest Certified Audited Security Certified by CertiK, one of the most reputable names in blockchain security, Rexas Finance has undergone a thorough smart contract audit. This guarantees a clear and safe ecosystem, inspiring investors in the platform's dependability. Presale Strategy Across VC Money Rexas Finance chose a presale strategy, handing power directly to its community, unlike many blockchain initiatives that depend on venture capital backing. This choice guarantees decentralization and allows early investors to benefit from reduced token prices and great growth possibilities. Rexas Finance Giveaway Rexas Finance is conducting a $1 million USDT giveaway to honor its expanding community. Twenty lucky winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS. Completing tasks and recommending friends helps participants increase their entries and win extra prizes. This project has attracted a lot of attention, which will help it sustain its momentum. Can RXS Exceed XRP to Show the Road to 2025? XRP has an established track record and a big market capitalization, but its expansion potential is restricted compared to a low-cap cryptocurrency like Rexas Finance. With its present presale price of $0.175, RXS presents noticeably more upside potential. Elements Encouraging the Growth Market Opportunity of RXS The worldwide market for actual asset tokenization is expected to reach $16 trillion by 2030. As one of the first movers in this field, Rexas Finance is positioned to grab a sizable portion of this market, creating demand for its token Driven Community Development Rexas Finance has developed a devoted investor base that aggressively supports its expansion by giving the community top priority above venture capitalists. This grassroots method fits the distributed mindset of blockchain technologies. Listing Momentum Future listings of RXS on significant centralized and distributed exchanges should increase liquidity and draw a larger investment base. This might result in a significant price rise, similar to what XRP experienced during its early acceptance period. Investor Opinion: Why Even XRP Bulls Purchase RXS? Comparisons between Rexas Finance and Ripple abound in the crypto industry, and even strong XRP supporters are branching out into RXS. The logic is straightforward: although XRP's adoption and recovery show promise, its expansion is unlikely to match the explosive climb RXS might attain when it acquires market momentum. Rexas Finance is looking to be the next great thing in cryptocurrencies with its strong use cases, security-first strategy, and disruptive power. Participating in the continuous presale could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for investors looking for better returns. Conclusion Utility-driven initiatives like Rexas Finance are demonstrating in the contest for crypto supremacy that long-term success depends on creativity and practical applications. At just $0.175, RXS presents a special chance to enter early on a project that might rival—and maybe exceed—XRP's profits by 2025. Rexas Finance is a token worth considering regardless of whether you're an XRP bull or a new investor. With its aspirational road map, tested security, and expanding community, RXS is positioned to challenge Ripple and redefine what is feasible in the realm of blockchain and finance.

Bitcoin Coinbase Premium | Source: CryptoQuant The Coinbase Premium Index is an important figure that examines purchases by American investors, including institutions. Coinbase is the most widely used exchange in the United States, so when it rises, it indicates that the biggest pool of capital is possibly accumulating. Additionally, Bitcoin faces other fundamental catalysts ahead, including President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and the upcoming FTX $16 billion distributions . There are chances that some of the recipients of these funds will invest in Bitcoin and other coins. Also, as crypto.news reported last week, Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio is still low — a sign that it is undervalued. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that BTC has rebounded in the past few days. It has risen in the past six straight days and constantly remained above the 50-day moving average. Bitcoin has also found substantial support at the key support at $91,400, where it failed to move below several times since December. Therefore, there are chances that it will continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $108,000. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement point at $114,000. However, forming a head and shoulders pattern is risky. This may lead to a bearish breakdown below $91,400. Analyst’s bearish take Analyst Jacob King of WhaleWire recently issued a stark warning about Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, citing signs of a potential bear market. In a post on social media, King highlighted several developments, including MicroStrategy reducing its Bitcoin purchases, El Salvador seemingly shifting away from crypto-focused policies, and BlackRock selling significant BTC holdings. MicroStrategy's BTC buys are getting smaller and smaller, facing extreme risks. El Salvador is reversing its Bitcoin policies, BlackRock is dumping record-high amounts of BTC, and Tether mysteriously hasn't minted anything new in over 20 days, causing BTC to stagnate. It's the… — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) January 3, 2025 King criticized MicroStrategy’s strategy as a “giant scam” and unsustainable. He also pointed to Tether (USDT) pausing new minting for over 20 days, coinciding with the coin’s recent price stagnation. Labeling the situation as “the calm before the storm,” King warned that a crypto downturn might align with a broader stock market crash, urging investors to reassess their risks. At last check Sunday, BTC was trading at $98,035.

We published an article not too long ago—“Berkshire Hathaway outperforms S&P 500 again. Will Warren Buffett need Bitcoin to compete in 2025?”—where I tried to keep some faith alive. But here’s the thing: that faith is starting to look like delusion. You see, Wall Street analysts are already predicting the monster gains Berkshire’s portfolio will deliver in 2025 while sticking to his strategy that, despite what we thought, isn’t getting “too old.” Trump’s pro-crypto administration is in full swing, Bitcoin’s correlation to U.S. stocks is climbing, and young investors are all-in. Warren? No dice. It’s as if the guy enjoys being the odd one out. Berkshire Hathaway sticks to the ‘no Bitcoin’ playbook 2024 was a banger of a year for Berkshire. While the S&P 500 soared by a historic 24%, thanks to AI giants like Nvidia and Apple, Berkshire’s Class A shares climbed 25.5%, closing at $677,200. Outperforming the market isn’t new for Warren, it’s kind of his thing. Analysts had set a target of $673,660. So, how did they do it? Same old, same old. Berkshire leaned into its core strengths: a portfolio packed with heavyweights like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Chevron, paired with an absurd amount of cash—over $300 billion by year’s end. This war chest gives Warren the power to swoop in when the rest of the market panics. It’s what makes him an unshakable force. Coca-Cola, which he has loved since the ’80s, still spits out a sweet 3.1% dividend yield. Apple, making up 30-40% of Berkshire’s portfolio, remains its crown jewel. And Geico’s underwriting earnings chipped in nicely to keep the balance sheet glowing. Wall Street analysts are predicting more of the same in 2025. They’re particularly hyped about Liberty Latin America, a little-known telecom company Berkshire has quietly owned a small stake in for nearly a decade. It’s expected to jump nearly 58%. Atlanta Braves Holdings, spun off last year, is also on the list, with a projected 42% gain. Then there’s Occidental Petroleum, one of Berkshire’s top six holdings, which analysts think could rise 20%. The oil and gas producer had a rough 2024, dropping 17%, but Warren used the dip to buy even more shares. No full takeover, though. He’s made that clear. Add in steady performers like Coca-Cola, Citigroup, Chevron, and Lennar Corporation, and it’s no wonder analysts are bullish. So, allow us to answer the question the other article’s headline asked: No, Warren doesn’t need Bitcoin to singlehandedly outperform the stock market again.",OP-ED|Apple|Berkshire Hathaway|BTC|Coca Cola|Nvidia|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-05 17:15:54

These top five options include Pepe Unchained (PEPU), Tron (TRX), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and 1Fuel (OFT). Among these, 1Fuel has captured significant attention as a top altcoin for the year, thanks to its impressive presale success and groundbreaking utility in decentralized exchange (DEX) wallets. Pepe Unchained Surges to a New All Time High Pepe Unchained (PEPU) recently shocked investors with an explosive surge. It increased by over 100% to hit its all-time high of $0.06828. After a highly successful ICOs in the crypto space, PEPU has proven its worth as one of the best altcoins of 2025. Analyst projections suggest that PEPU could reach a value of $0.504 by 2025, and even climb to $1.33 by 2030. It’s ideal for investors managing their assets through Ledger and Core Wallet. Tron Builds on Past Success Tron (TRX) has been making some waves in the cryptocurrency space, especially with its track record of innovation. Currently valued at $0.2685 , TRX has surged by an impressive 155.77% over the past year. This upward trajectory is just like what the founder, Justin Sun, had said, comparing Tron as the next Ripple. Boasting $7.1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) in its DeFi ecosystem, Tron is the support of one of the top crypto investments. Solana Set to Break Past the $500 Mark Solana (SOL) is capturing a lot of attention in the crypto space, especially with its remarkable performance. Now priced at $216.87 , Solana has grown quite impressively over the past year, by 120.74% . With speculation about a potential surge of $500 this year, the blockchain platform is firmly in the spotlight as one of the best altcoins of 2025. Investors seeking to capitalize Solana’s potential are using storage solutions like Ledger and Core Wallet. Polkadot Set for a Breakout Polkadot (DOT) is preparing for what analysts say would be a major bullish breakout. DOT’s price of $7.86 is testing support near $6.68, with indicators that signal an upward surge. Price predictions suggest a 52.38% rise to $10.23 in January 2025, with more optimistic projections pointing toward a range of $20 to $40 by the end of the year. 1Fuel OFT Emerges as a Top Altcoin for 2025 1Fuel OFT is quickly rising as one of the top crypto investments for 2025, and it’s a token you definitely don’t want to overlook. Currently in its presale stage, which is already over 75% complete, 1Fuel has sold more than 100 million tokens. With its presale success, the taken is attracting the attention of investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency in crypto. The presale price of $0.012 is the lowest it will ever be, and analysts expect the token to surge by up to 100x once it is publicly listed in 2025. 1Fuel is backed by DEX wallet features, which set it apart from traditional wallets like Core Wallet and Ledger. It features cross-chain transactions which allow you to manage multiple assets across different blockchain networks. 1Fuel also has privacy features that hide user information, a crypto card, integrated P2P exchange, and AI-driven tools. Investors Look Forward to the Emerging Altcoins of 2025 With the rising interest in the presale and the potential for explosive growth, 1Fuel OFT is undeniably one of the most promising investments. It is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the market and become a leader in the crypto space.

Raydium ( RAY ) rose to $5.6, its highest level since Dec. 11 and 50% above its lowest level in December. It has continued to outperform other popular Decentralized Exchange tokens like Uniswap ( UNI ) and PancakeSwap ( CAKE ). RAY has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the past two years as it soared by over 3,100%.

It has now moved above the upper side of this flag, pointing to a bullish breakout. RAY has moved above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a positive sign. It has also jumped above the Supertrend indicator, while the Percentage Price Oscillator and Relative Strength Index have pointed upwards. The Supertrend indicator is based on the Average True Range and is a popular trend indicator. On the other hand, the PPO and the RSI are used to identify an asset’s strength. Therefore, Raydium will likely keep rising as bulls target an all-time high of $6.50. A move above that level will point to more gains, possibly to $7.

Garlinghouse also referenced the “Trump bull market,” which undoubtedly provides a bullish outlook for coins like XRP. Brad Garlinghouse Highlights Trump’s Impact On Ripple In an X post, Brad Garlinghouse discussed the impact of Donald Trump’s election victory on Ripple’s operations. He revealed that 75% of the company’s open roles are now US-based. This represents a change, as Garlinghouse noted that over the last four years, most of the company’s hires were outside the US. Furthermore, the Ripple CEO revealed they had signed more US deals in the last six weeks of 2024 (since Trump’s victory) than in the previous six months. Trump’s victory has undoubtedly provided a bullish outlook for the crypto industry because of his pro-crypto stance. Brad Garlinghouse remarked that Team Trump is already jumpstarting innovation and job growth in the US with Scott Bessent, David Sacks, Paul Atkins, and others at the helm. He added that the “Trump effect” is already making crypto great again through his campaign and in the Administration’s day 1 priority. Ripple looks to have really benefitted greatly from this Trump effect. The crypto firm finally launched its RLUSD stablecoin after the US president-elect defeated Kamala Harris in November last year. The RLUSD stablecoin has already enjoyed significant success, as it recently flipped PYUSD and EURC in 24-hour trading volume. The “Trump Bull Market” Is Real In his X post, Brad Garlinghouse also stated that the “Trump bull market” is real. He remarked that for Ripple, this bull market is even more personal after Gary Gensler’s SEC effectively froze their business opportunities in the US for years. He added that optimism about the bull market is obvious and very deserved. This Trump bull market undoubtedly provides a bullish outlook for the XRP price especially. With pro-crypto Paul Atkins set to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Trump’s Administration, the Commission could drop its long-running lawsuit against Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse. This is bullish for XRP because of the crypto’s ties with Ripple. The coin is believed to have remained stagnant in the 2021 bull run because of the lawsuit.

Both altcoins showed strong momentum at the end of 2024, with analysts forecasting an even greater rally in the new year. However, one altcoin is poised to steal the spotlight—Rollblock. Set to dominate the GambleFi market, Rollblock is expected to surpass both Dogecoin and Solana by the end of 2025. Here’s why experts are bullish. Rollblock Aims to Double Revenue In January Rollblock is a GambleFi pioneer set to disrupt the casino industry. With a library of more than 7,000 games from over 10 gaming providers and the recently introduced sports betting, Rollblock combines the excitement of classic gambling with the transparency of blockchain. The project achieved over $1.3 million in wagers during December, with projections to double that amount in January. Supported by a Gaming Anjouan license and a SolidProof audit, Rollblock provides a secure environment for both investors and gamers. At the core of this ecosystem is its utility token, RBLK, now in its ninth presale stage. Priced at just $0.0445, RBLK is projected to deliver a 100x return upon hitting the open market. A key highlight of RBLK is its innovative revenue-sharing model. Rollblock allocates up to 30% of its revenue to repurchase tokens from the market. Of these, 40% are used for staking rewards, while 60% are burned to reduce supply and increase scarcity as momentum builds. Currently, investors have already more than doubled their returns and anticipate multiple price hikes throughout January, making this an exciting opportunity for early adopters. Is $700 a Realistic Goal for Solana in 2025? Solana is showing remarkable growth, rallying 6% to nearly $198 in 2025 and increasing by 92% year-to-date. Currently trading at $207, its price remains 25% below its all-time high of $263, but analysts predict substantial growth ahead. Technological advancements like the Firedancer upgrade are set to enhance Solana’s scalability and transaction speeds, strengthening its dominance in DeFi and NFTs. Partnerships with Visa and Google Cloud further bolster institutional adoption, positioning Solana for a significant price increase. Analysts project Solana could reach $700 by early 2025, supported by a bullish “cup-and-handle” pattern and near-term Fibonacci retracement targets of $209 and $258. Solana’s ecosystem is thriving, with 7,625 developers and a record $9.215 billion in TVL expected in 2024. While a best-case scenario targets $750, conservative estimates place SOL between $220 and $275, considering competition from Ethereum and macroeconomic challenges. Dogecoin to Double in Price by the End of 2025 Dogecoin has recently broken out of a descending triangle pattern, signaling a potential bullish trend. This formation, observed from late 2023 to early 2024, featured flat bottom support and a declining resistance trendline, often indicating a buildup of market pressure before volatility changes. Dogecoin surged 2.29% in the last 24 hours, reaching $0.3378, with a robust trading volume of $2.53 billion. The breakout volume supports the validity of this pattern, highlighting strong upward momentum. Analysts expect $0.10 to be the next critical resistance level, a potential selling target. A successful breach here could propel Dogecoin to new local highs. With price action showing consistent higher highs, Dogecoin’s recent rally may open doors to a prolonged bullish market. While technical patterns suggest optimism, broader market trends, regulations, and sentiment will also influence its trajectory. Rollblock May Become the Next 100x Gem If Rollblock successfully captures just 1% of the traditional gambling market, the crypto world could see the emergence of its next 100x gem. Unlike Dogecoin and Solana, Rollblock isn't just making waves; it's transforming an entire industry, positioning itself as the next Ethereum or Pump.fun!

Since its launch in April 2023, PEPE has consistently delivered impressive price growth for its investors. In 2024 alone, PEPE surged by over 1,000%, earning a spot among CoinMarketCap's top 30 cryptocurrencies. Now, in 2025, PEPE continues to display positive momentum, having increased by 19.46% in the past week. This surge has drawn the interest of PEPE analysts, who see it as a promising long-term opportunity. The optimism isn't just about price; analysts point to a huge rise in PEPE's trading activity as a key factor. This boost in trading activity has contributed greatly to PEPE's remarkable market capitalization of $9 billion today. As a result, market analysts have begun issuing PEPE price predictions, with many projecting that the token could reach the coveted $0.0001 mark this year. While PEPE investors expect more moderate growth, these analysts agree that the official PEPE price has considerable potential for unrestrained growth. Conclusion While PEPE is justifying its status as a meme coin giant, Remittix is making a name for itself as DeFi's hot new crypto. At the heart of Remittix's ecosystem is its native utility token, RTX. Currently in its presale phase, RTX is priced at $0.0177 and projections suggest the price may skyrocket to up to twice its value by the end of Q1 2025.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 17:44:00

The recent gains could accelerate this week as investors move back to the office after the Christmas and New Year break and as Donald Trump’s inauguration nears. So, here are some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Ethereum Name Service, Aptos, and Flare. Ethereum Name Service Ethereum Name Service ( ENS ) — the biggest domain registrar in the crypto industry — isone of the top cryptos to watch this week. The network will unlock 1.46 million ENS tokens valued at over $52.79 million to contributors and the community. These unlocks are part of the monthly releases that will go on until November this year. The ENS price soared to a high of $50.5 in December and then retreated by about 28% to a low of $30.47. That was a notable level since it was the highest swing in March last year. It has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Ethereum Name Service token’s outlook is bullish because it remains above key averages and has formed a break-and-retest pattern. If this pattern continues, the next point to watch will be its 2024 high of $50.50. ENS price chart | Source: crypto.news You might also like: NFT sales drop to $132m, Pudgy Penguins loses steam Flare Flare ( FLR ), a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine, will be another crypto to watch as it unlocks tokens worth $47.6 million. These tokens will be notable because they will represent about 3.2% of the float. The daily chart shows that the Flare token has formed a combination of a falling wedge pattern and a bullish flag. A wedge comprises two falling and converging trendlines, which are nearing their confluence level. Flare is also supported by the 50-day moving average. Therefore, it will likely rebound, and possibly retest the important resistance at $0.0325, its highest level on June 5. Flare price chart | Source: crypto.news Aptos Aptos ( APT ) is another coin to watch this week as it conducts its monthly token unlocks. The native token of the Aptos blockchain will release 11.31 million tokens, which will be allocated to the community, core contributors, investors, and the foundation. Aptos will continue with these monthly unlocks until September 2032. The Aptos network is doing well. Its locked value has risen to over $1.07 billion, and its stablecoins valuation moved to $646 million. Some of the top players in the ecosystem are Aries Markets, Echo Protocol, Thala, and Echelon Market. On the daily chart, the APT token has rebounded in the past few days after forming a falling wedge pattern. It has retested the key support at $10 and is above the ascending trendline connecting the lowest swings since Aug. 5.

In a statement, Ethena Labs says it’s mulling building a Telegram-based savings and payment application this year as it sees a $50 billion market for its synthetic dollar USDE . “Rather than compete directly with payments companies on their own turf, we plan to address the payments and savings tool use case via building a dedicated application on Telegram and within the TON ecosystem.” The tool will leverage USDe, a stablecoin that aims to maintain its US dollar peg by opening short futures positions whenever a user provides collateral to mint tokens. “In 2025, we will be releasing a dedicated use case for sUSDe within the Telegram application where users can send, spend and save within a mobile neobank-like experience. Payments will be connected directly to Apple Pay where you can move between a savings asset in sUSDe to direct mobile tap payments from your phone.” Ethena Labs says Telegram’s popularity will support its plan to launch the product for one billion people. “Immediate access via Telegram’s 900 million+ users provides the distribution platform to deliver this product to the world. Together we can provide a billion people a payments and savings product which is as easy to access as sending your friend a message.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Schwartz shared his insights while contributing to a conversation on X, which asked me to understand the IRS taxing system on digital assets . Tax Implications of Crypto Airdrops In his post , Schwartz noted that the tax consequences could prove problematic for recipients of these rewards. He sees this challenge more in terms of auto or self-claiming rewards, which are automatically distributed to users without requiring any action on their part. According to Schwartz, long-term capital profits are only taxed when value increases, while income is taxed when the user receives the asset. Hence, with airdrops, the receipt of the assets often determines if it is taxable. The authorities do not bother with how the recipient uses or claims it. Due to their tax implications, the Ripple CTO cautions against using self-claiming distribution methods. In his opinion, receiving auto rewards can lead to immediate taxable events. The recipient is potentially tax-liable even if they have not sold the tokens or received cash for the asset. Schwartz’s Proposed Alternatives to Airdrops Schwartz explained that the complication lies with the holders of the asset. Since airdrop tokens are taxed based on their value when given out, users might have to pay more taxes if the asset appreciates. This arrangement could worsen things for recipients who want to hold long-term. He offers an alternative to the current reward system, suggesting a distribution model where users benefit from appreciating their token’s value. Schwartz favors this approach to users receiving additional tokens as a reward. This model helps defer taxable events until when the tokens are sold or converted to cash by the user. This appears more favorable for taxation purposes, according to Schwartz. As such, users do not have to deal with the tax issues that come with airdrops. Past Warnings and Predictions Schwartz has regularly given insights into crypto activities and events. Notably, before the ecosystem’s launch of RLUSD , he cautioned investors that volatility issues could occur due to supply shortages. True to his prediction, RLUSD was temporarily disrupted due to its initial inflated value.

However, IntelMarkets (INTL), Stellar (XLM), and SUI are emerging as powerful altcoins in the DeFi sector, showing strong potential to surpass Cardano in the coming months. Here’s how! Cardano’s Path Forward: Can ADA Maintain Its Position Among the Best Altcoins in 2025? In December 2024, Cardano’s community was energized by a significant development. ADA can now be exchanged on Ledger Live Desktop through Exodus. This milestone allows ADA holders to exchange their tokens securely within Ledger’s ecosystem. Despite this development, ADA’s market performance faces challenges. After reaching $1.30 in December, ADA dropped to $0.84. This marks a decline from its highest value since 2022. However, Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, remains hopeful, predicting that the platform will soon achieve remarkable success. A key factor in this potential growth is the incorporation of Bitcoin DeFi through BitcoinOS. Hoskinson believes this integration could unlock billions of dollars for the Cardano ecosystem. Such a development could drive Cardano’s position among top altcoins in the market. Hoskinson also points to upcoming upgrades as another catalyst for growth. These include Cardano’s Midnight, new partnerships, and dApp upgrades. With these enhancements, Cardano’s network could receive a significant boost, potentially accelerating ADA’s growth. IntelMarkets: The DeFi Platform Set to Outpace Cardano in 2025 IntelMarkets is shaking up the crypto trading world. With its dual-chain functionality, it’s offering traders something other platforms can’t match. Built on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, this structure gives users the flexibility to pick the best chain for their trading strategy. IntelMarkets’ 1000x leverage feature is a game-changer. Traders can increase their positions, making the most of even the smallest price moves. With this powerful tool, the platform ensures its users can optimize their trading and boost their returns, giving it an edge over other altcoins. IntelMarkets’ strong focus on real-world utility makes it stand out in a competitive market. The platform enables users to access perpetual futures contracts, a flexible trading option with no expiration. This approach ensures that traders can hold positions as long as they see fit. It provides enhanced liquidity, so users can take full advantage of market movements without liquidity issues holding them back. Its tokenomics and asset pairs further enhance IntelMarkets’ appeal. Offering diverse pairs across both blockchains means that traders have access to a variety of investment opportunities. This helps reduce risk and increases the potential for higher profits, which IntelMarkets offers through favorable borrowing terms. Together these features are fueling intense demand in INTL’s ongoing presale. Experts are closely watching INTL, forecasting a 100x price growth that could enable it to surpass ADA in 2025. Stellar’s strategic collaborations Fuel XLM’s Potential Stellar is on track to outperform several altcoins, including Cardano, in 2025. In December 2024, Stellar secured a major partnership with OwlTing and MoneyGram. This partnership allows OwlPay Wallet Pro users to handle USDC transactions worldwide at MoneyGram locations. Stellar’s network is reinforced by this partnership, making it a more dependable blockchain for financial transactions. With increasing credibility and visibility, Stellar is paving the way for broader XLM adoption. Though XLM’s price has fallen from $0.60 to $0.39, experts are still optimistic. With the boost from new partnerships and use cases, price projections show a rise to $0.80 by Q1 2025. SUI Set to Surpass Altcoins in 2025 with Groundbreaking Developments SUI is showing potential to surpass altcoins, including Cardano, in 2025 following key developments. December 2024 was a turbulent month for SUI, with its price dropping from $4.90 to $3.52. However, it quickly rebounded to $4.17, sparking investor optimism. SUI recently introduced SEED, a top-tier farming game, which has the potential to elevate SUI’s standing in the DeFi space. Along with $SEED and an innovative NFT collection, these updates are fueling speculation about SUI’s price potential. Analysts now predict that SUI could surge to $6 by Q2 2025. With such exciting developments, SUI is positioned to become a leading altcoin in 2025. INTL, XLM, and SUI Change the DeFi Game: Is ADA at Risk? While Cardano continues to push forward with optimistic plans and updates, the emergence of platforms like IntelMarkets, Stellar, and SUI is reshaping the DeFi landscape. As these altcoins continue to evolve, they are showing potential to not only compete with ADA but potentially outperform it, most especially INTL. INTL is currently in Stage 8 of its public presale, priced at $0.07. With over $5 million raised, industry experts predict a 100x increase post-launch. This indicates the vast profit potential IntelMarkets offers, making it a top choice for investors seeking strong returns in 2025. Seize the chance to be part of this transformation!

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is trying hard to hold its momentum above $100K. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of holding above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $97,701 Market Cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading Volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating Supply 19,719,062 All-time High $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time Low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $94,111 24-hour low $93,258 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $97,701 Price Prediction $ 112,463 (19.91%) Fear & Greed Index 66 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.39% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 95,668 200-Day SMA $ 71,732 14-Day RSI 44.14 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown BTC price analysis shows a consolidation around $97K. Resistance for BTC is at $99,061. Support for BTC/USD is at $95,991. The BTC price analysis for 5 January confirms that Bitcoin is facing an increased battle between buyers and sellers. Currently, the BTC price is aiming for consolidation below the $98K region. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price struggles to hold above resistance Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC’s price faces consolidation as it struggles to surge above $98K. In recent hours, the price of BTC faced multiple rejections to move above $98,000. The 24-hour volume has surged to $754 million, raising interest in trading today. BTC is trading at $97,701, surging by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades above the buying region at 52, hinting that a bullish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. Bulls are maintaining buying confidence as the BTC price aims for a retest of resistance. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.46, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $99,061, it will fuel a bullish rally to $102,814. BTC/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $95,991, beginning a bearish trend to $92,493. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today? Following Donald Trump’s victory in the elections, Bitcoin faced increasing buying activity. However, in recent weeks, the price of BTC is dropping due to selling pressure from STHs around local top. Will BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC SoSoValue data shows Bitcoin ETFs netted $5.32 million on Jan. 1, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund with $37 million in inflows. FBTC’s total assets stand at $18.9 billion, edging closer to the $20 billion mark. Bitcoin price prediction January 2025 December was a bullish month for Bitcoin, characterized by significant upswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in January 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to surge toward $100,000 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $91K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2025 $91,000 $100,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025.

In a statement, the company said its revenue rose 15.2% to T$2.13 trillion ($64.72 billion). According to a Reuters report , this figure outpaced the T$2.1 trillion forecast on LSEG’s SmartEstimate, which centers on accurate analysts’ estimates. The world’s biggest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn’s strong performance in its cloud and networking products was attributed to the booming AI server market. The company supplies firms such as Nvidia, a leader in AI chips. However, growth in the smart consumer electronics division, which covers iPhones, remained largely steady compared with last year. Foxconn expects a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025 Foxconn’s sales hit T$654.8 billion in December, a rise of 42.3% compared to the previous year’s revenue. This was the second-largest monthly figure in the company’s history. However, Foxconn expects a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025, when it enters the usual off-season. The statement says, “Even with record high revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, the sequential performance of the first quarter will reach roughly similar levels that are average to the past five years; compared with a year ago, it should show significant growth.” Formerly known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, the company did not provide details on forecasts. Last year, the company’s shares shot up 76% compared with 28.5% for Taiwan’s overall stock market. Ahead of the revenue announcement, Foxconn shares fell 0.8%, while Taiwan’s benchmark index rose 0.3% on Friday.

In this article, we’ll explore the top reasons why Web3Bay stands out as the best crypto presale to invest in now, focusing on its structured presale stages, high ROI potential, decentralized marketplace innovation, and dual payment systems. Structured Presale Stages: A Path to Exceptional Returns Web3Bay presale is meticulously designed, offering investors a transparent and strategic entry point into the project. Divided into 28 stages, the presale ensures a gradual price increase of 15% with each stage. This structured approach incentivizes early participation while showcasing the project’s growth potential. Web3Bay presale is currently in presale stage 3 at the price of $0.0039675 with over $320,000 fundraising. The token is set to reach its launch price of $0.1959, allowing early investors to reap a staggering 6,430% ROI. This carefully calibrated presale structure demonstrates Web3Bay’s commitment to providing tangible benefits for early supporters. By steadily increasing token value, the platform not only ensures fair market dynamics but also lays the foundation for long-term growth. These features position Web3Bay as the best crypto presale to invest in now for those seeking high returns and transparency. Decentralized Marketplace Innovation: Reinventing E-Commerce Web3Bay is setting a new standard for e-commerce by integrating blockchain technology into its operations. Traditional online shopping often relies on intermediaries, leading to higher costs and reduced transparency. Web3Bay’s decentralized model eliminates these middlemen, allowing direct interactions between buyers and sellers. This approach not only reduces transaction costs but also enhances trust through blockchain’s inherent transparency. By leveraging smart contracts, Web3Bay automates key processes such as escrow, staking, and governance. These features streamline operations and ensure secure, reliable transactions for all participants. Web3Bay’s decentralized architecture also enables secure data storage using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Unlike centralized systems prone to breaches, this decentralized storage solution ensures user data remains private and protected. This makes Web3Bay an attractive option for privacy-conscious consumers and businesses alike. As blockchain adoption grows, Web3Bay’s innovative approach to e-commerce positions it as a leader in reshaping how online transactions are conducted. This is yet another reason why it’s being hailed as the best crypto presale to invest in now. Dual Payment Systems: Bridging Crypto and Fiat Worlds Accessibility is key to Web3Bay’s vision, and its dual payment system exemplifies this commitment. The platform supports both cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods such as PayPal, catering to a wide range of users. This inclusivity removes barriers to entry, enabling anyone to participate in the Web3Bay ecosystem regardless of their familiarity with crypto. For crypto enthusiasts, Web3Bay offers seamless integration with blockchain wallets, enabling fast and secure transactions. Meanwhile, traditional payment options ensure that users new to blockchain can engage with the platform without technical hurdles. This dual approach not only broadens Web3Bay’s appeal but also enhances its utility as a global marketplace. Furthermore, Web3Bay incentivizes the use of its native 3BAY tokens by offering exclusive benefits such as a 5% discount on purchases. These perks encourage token adoption while providing tangible value to users. By bridging the gap between crypto and fiat payments, Web3Bay demonstrates its focus on usability and inclusivity, making it an ideal investment for those seeking projects with real-world applicability. Why Web3Bay is the Best Crypto Presale to Invest in Now Web3Bay’s presale stands out due to its well-structured stages, promising exceptional ROI for early investors. Its decentralized e-commerce model addresses longstanding inefficiencies in traditional online shopping, while the dual payment system ensures accessibility for users across the spectrum. Together, these features create a compelling investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on blockchain’s potential to transform industries. As the presale progresses, the increasing token value reflects growing interest and confidence in the project. For investors seeking a high-growth opportunity with a clear roadmap and practical applications, Web3Bay offers an unmatched proposition. With its combination of innovative technology, strategic planning, and user-centric design, it’s no surprise that Web3Bay is being recognized as the best crypto presale to invest in now.

The FDIC says that between June 5th of 2023 and September 18th of 2023, Jessica Ann Marshall allegedly stole $345,664.66 while working as a branch manager at the Bank of Idaho in Idaho Falls, Idaho. “Respondent [Jessica Ann Marshall] also falsified Bank documents, including count sheets, in order to hide her theft and embezzlement, and directed Bank employees to sign falsified count sheets.” While Marshal neither admits nor denies the accusations, the FDIC says Marshall’s actions while serving as a Bank of Idaho executive constituted “unsafe or unsound practices.” “Respondent’s practices caused the Bank to suffer financial loss, and Respondent received financial gain. Respondent’s practices involved personal dishonesty and demonstrated Respondent’s willful and continuing disregard for the safety or soundness of the Bank.” The FDIC consequently prohibits the former Bank of Idaho branch manager from participating in the “conduct of the affairs of any financial institution or organization” in any manner. Marshall is also prohibited from “soliciting, procuring, transferring, attempting to transfer, voting, or attempting to vote any proxy, consent, or authorization with respect to any voting rights” in any US financial institution regulated by the FDIC. “The Prohibition Order is effective upon issuance and will remain effective and enforceable until the FDIC, and any ‘appropriate Federal financial institutions regulatory agency,’ … decide in writing to modify, terminate, suspend, or set aside the Order.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Downturn rules, like regular coin burns from deal fees, handle amount and raise rarity, improving worth over time. The LCAI token helps to pay for AI tasks, allows placing bets for rule-making, and opens up special features; it gives a clear and growth-focused money style. Why Lightchain AI Is Positioned to Lead Blockchain Innovation Lightchain AI is poised to lead blockchain innovation through its unique integration of artificial intelligence and decentralized technology. By combining AI-powered solutions with blockchain’s transparency and security, Lightchain AI introduces a powerful platform that addresses critical challenges in scalability, privacy, and governance.

Among these are presales that provide tokens with essential utilities that are transforming industries, such as digital transactions, decentralized finance, and virtual spaces, by addressing real user needs. Explore the top cryptos to buy in 2025 that bring real-world utility. Web3Bay (3Bay) Web3Bay is at the forefront, providing a decentralized marketplace for trading digital assets.

Web3Bay stands out with its decentralized escrow system, which ensures secure, intermediary-free transactions.

Seventy-five percent of Ripple’s open positions are now U.S.-based, a significant reversal from the past four years, when most of its hiring was abroad. According to Brad, the company signed more U.S. deals in the last six weeks of 2024—after Trump’s election win—than in the previous six months. He also credited key figures in Trump’s circle, like Scott Bessent, David Sacks, and Paul Atkins, for kickstarting innovation and job growth in crypto even before the new administration officially takes office. Ripple capitalizes on a crypto-friendly Congress Brad has also called the 119th Congress the “most pro-crypto Congress in history.” He believes that the legislative energy around crypto is unprecedented, with lawmakers seemingly ready to tackle industry challenges head-on. The arrival of this Congress coincides with $135 million in campaign contributions from crypto elites to Trump and other key congressional races. Their demands are straightforward: eliminate the SEC’s lawsuits against the industry, open access to global banking, and launch a U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, as the U.S. prepares for a more crypto-friendly era, the world’s financial systems are splitting into Western and Eastern blocs. Countries like Thailand, Hong Kong, and the UAE have joined China’s mBridge initiative, a platform designed to settle cross-border claims using central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This effort plans to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar and SWIFT, effectively bypassing American financial oversight. Saudi Arabia joined mBridge in mid-2024. Global dynamics in finance are changing The Bank for International Settlements’ withdrawal from mBridge showed growing tensions over the weaponization of the U.S. dollar. Russian President Vladimir Putin sees the technology as a way to sidestep sanctions. Countries like India and Southeast Asia are also developing their payment networks for seamless cross-border transactions. For instance, tourists from Hong Kong can now pay for services in Thailand by scanning QR codes linked to their bank accounts back home. The tokenization of financial and real-world assets is also becoming the next major frontier, with Citigroup estimating a $4 trillion market by 2030. In Asia, countries like Hong Kong and Singapore are leading the charge. Hong Kong is exploring digital green bonds, while Singapore is using smart contracts to automate fund management and private banking. A recent survey found that only 13% of central banks viewed CBDCs as the best solution for cross-border transfers, down from 31% in 2023. China’s digital yuan, which once seemed set to dominate global digital payments, has struggled to gain widespread adoption. Other countries have slowed their CBDC development, opting instead to explore alternatives like tokenized deposits. Deposit tokens, unlike CBDCs, rely on deposit insurance rather than 1:1 reserve backing, making them a more flexible option for financial institutions.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

By 2028, BRETT prediction indicates a maximum price of $0.89. By 2031, BRETT is expected to trade between $1.31 and $1.46. BRETT, or Based Brett, is a meme cryptocurrency launched in February 2024 on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Inspired by the character Brett from Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic series, BRETT aims to engage users through humor and community interaction. It has quickly gained popularity, boasting a market cap exceeding $1 billion and a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with a fixed supply ensuring scarcity. BRETT operates on a renounced contract, meaning the creator cannot alter its supply or functionalities, which fosters a decentralized governance model driven by community engagement. The token does not impose transaction fees, making it attractive for trading and long-term holding. Its cultural significance and partnerships in decentralized finance enhance its utility and value in the crypto space.

Also, recent price movement shows Brett breaking above the middle band, suggesting potential continuation toward the upper band resistance.

If ETH breaches $3,700, it could continue toward $3,800. A rejection may see it testing $3,508.2 for support before further moves.

The 1-day chart shows bullish momentum with RSI at 54.50 and a push above the middle Bollinger Band at $0.13535, targeting resistance at $0.15942. The 4-hour chart shows weakening momentum, with the Balance of Power at -0.26, indicating potential bearish control.

If rejected near resistance, a pullback to the $0.14407 or $0.13535 levels could occur. A breakout above $0.15942 may spark a bullish rally. Is BRETT a good investment? BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their own research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although, it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

This is more than double the $8.7 trillion seen the previous year. As a result of the current figure, the digital asset industry has experienced a reversal of two years of declining transaction volume, which began after 2021. Bitcoin Recovers From Harsh Crypto Winter of 2022 Pierre Rochard, the vice president of research at Riot Platforms, shared data that revealed that Bitcoin transaction volume peaked in the 2021 bull market. It saw approximately $47 trillion in transactions completed but suddenly began to decline sharply in 2022 and 2023. It is worth recalling that 2022 was a significant year for the broader cryptocurrency industry, which faced a harsh crypto winter. Rochard states, “The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that Bitcoin is both a store of value and a medium of exchange.” Bitcoin Experienced a Monumental 2024 Last year was pivotal for the flagship cryptocurrency, from the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States to the halving event held in April and hitting a new All-time-high (ATH) of above $100,000. The new year is already looking good for the Bitcoins network as its hashrate hit a new ATH recently . On January 3, the total computing power securing the Bitcoin protocol was at 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s). However, it fell back to around 775 EH/s a few hours later. Last year, only Bitcoin mining pools in the US accounted for more than 40% of the global hashrate . Ongoing debates exist about the country controlling the most computing power on the Bitcoin network. Debate on Bitcoin Hashrate Dominance Between US and China Ordinarily, it is difficult to develop an accurate gauge of hashrate dominance. This is because of the pseudonymous and geographically distributed nature of Bitcoin mining. There is a possibility that certain mining pool operators and companies are headquartered within a country while relying on hashrate contributed by individual miners across the world. Moreover, they could also utilize Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to obfuscate their IP addresses. However, China-based mining pools control a more significant percentage of the hashrate on the Bitcoin network than the US.

The deal includes Bitmain’s latest S21 XP and S21 Pro models, which marks a major expansion for BitFuFu’s operations. According to the original press release , the agreement allows BitFuFu to purchase miners in stages, offering flexibility to adjust to market conditions and operational needs. The newly acquired hardware will support the Nasdaq-listed company’s self-mining efforts and expand its service portfolio, which includes miner resale, cloud mining, and hosting services. In terms of the deal’s financial structure. BitFuFu can pay part of the purchase price in its own shares and defer a portion of cash payments interest-free until after the equipment is delivered. This arrangement is designed to maintain liquidity while advancing the company’s growth objectives. Commenting on the development, Leo Lu, Chairman and CEO of BitFuFu, said that this strategic partnership with Bitmain will ensure a consistent supply of the latest miners to help the company grow its global mining operations and aim for an additional 1 GW of capacity by the close of 2026. The exec added, “The new miners will be utilized to bolster both our self-mining operations and cloud-mining services, delivering highly cost-effective and energy-efficient solutions. With the flexibility to procure equipment in batches over the next two years based on operational demands, this agreement further reinforces our position as a leader in the industry.” Shortly after the announcement, its stock saw a double-digit gain to $5.60 on January 2nd before undergoing a minor correction to $5.42.

This was an addition to its already impressive performance over the week at 140% and 1800% over the last 30 days. For this increase, the main reason seems to be the currently bullish direction of the artificial intelligence segment, which has recently drawn the attention of more and more investors. Freysa AI uses one of the most advanced AI technologies in its blockchain projects, and thus the solution is still popular and attracts attention. Its constant growth testifies to the big potential of AI-based cryptocurrencies . DeepBook Gains 30%, Surpasses $1 Billion in Volume DeepBook is a decentralized liquidity layer on the Sui blockchain. It surged an impressive 30% in price over the last day. It also comes amidst the bullish momentum of Sui, which continues to rise in the wider crypto market. DeepBook’s success is further reflected in its recent milestone of surpassing $1 billion in cumulative trading volume. The platform’s unique approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) has cemented its position as a key player in the space, offering robust liquidity solutions that appeal to traders and investors alike. Sushi’s 20% Jump Amid Referral Campaign SUSHI, the native token of the popular decentralized exchange SushiSwap, jumped 20% in price from $1.43 to $1.80 within 24 hours. There haven’t been any major updates lately, but one of the reasons could be the ongoing referral campaign on the platform. The campaign provides users with 40% of trading fees as rewards for every successful referral, thus serving as an incentive for increased activity on the platform. This could have been the catalyst that sparked SushiSwap into renewed interest, forcing SUSHI up even without significant development.

According to the Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey report , strong economic and earnings growth in the US inspired optimism for stocks. About 61% of 553 respondents believed the S&P 500 would rise by the end of the year. However, many pointed to the Trump administration’s policy outlook as a key factor. The survey was conducted after the Fed’s December 18 policy decision through the end of the year. Opinions were split over how Trump’s policies have affected the dollar. Half of the respondents thought Trump’s stance on tariffs would have a positive effect on the currency, while only 27% predicted the policy would weaken it. Trump’s policies are a double-edged sword of conflicting US economic expectations. Lower taxes and lighter regulations are seen as moving economic growth forward, but Trump’s trade measures may instead stoke inflation and keep interest rates elevated. This blend may also chill consumer appetites and blur US markets. Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, says, “I expect this to be a higher-volatility environment for stocks. ” The two views will clash at some point, and he expects that stock correlations could turn negative. Gains were made in the S&P 500 despite challenges, with 57 record closes, thanks to the year’s boosters, Nvidia and Apple. The unexpected economic resilience helped the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index to jump as much as 1.8%, the most in a decade. US growth is booming, but equity market gains might not be sustainable, according to Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. While the dollar is strong, he warned, it will stay that way only if the US economy continues on the current path and if global savings keep pouring into US markets. Lower-income households are struggling, and higher-income groups are spending more money US Consumers are key, but cracks are starting to show. This divide could get even worse, with tariffs adding to costs and increasing pressure on demand. Noel Dixon, a State Street strategist, highlighted the risk to households. “The bottom 40% of consumers in the US are still under significant pressure,” said Dixon. He added that higher prices from tariffs or inflation could severely hit demand later in 2025. Up to 57% of survey participants expressed concerns over inflation and believed Treasury yields would rise in early 2025. Following the Federal Reserve’s signal of fewer rate cuts, the 10-year Treasury rate hit a seven-month high as traders braced for tighter monetary policy. Graf warned that any move by the Fed to pause rate cuts or even consider hikes would pose risks for high-valued stocks, even though it is unlikely to occur. A Fed shift to higher rates and stalling monetary support would challenge expensive stocks and be the tipping point, he said.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team have highlighted the increasing structural importance of both gold and Bitcoin in investor portfolios in a report published in 2018. “The rise in gold prices over the past year has far outpaced the movements implied by dollar and real bond yield changes, and likely reflects the reemergence of this ‘depreciation trade,’” the analysts wrote. Bitcoin is also gaining importance, with record capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market in 2024 pointing to its growing role as a portfolio staple. “Bitcoin is becoming a more important component of investors’ portfolios,” the report said. Value trading focuses on assets that preserve value against fiat devaluation, which is often triggered by factors such as inflation, rising government debt, and geopolitical instability. Gold and bitcoin have become prime candidates for this strategy, attracting the attention of both institutional and individual investors.

Investments in physical gold, gold ETFs and other instruments now represent a significant portion of global non-bank investor assets. JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on the outlook for both gold and Bitcoin. In October, they predicted a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrencies through 2025, driven by bearish trading and increasing institutional adoption. If fiat currency problems persist, analysts argue that assets like gold and BTC will become even more attractive. “The depreciation trade is here to stay,” they concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Guided by the vision of “Ideas Transcending Millennia,” Xenea focuses on long-term token and data storage solutions while enabling new capabilities for AI and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). To strengthen the protocol's reliability, Xenea follows a peer-review approach. Core architecture papers are submitted to the IEEE, a prominent academic society in telecommunications, for validation. Code implementation begins only after these papers undergo rigorous academic peer review. The validated papers are accessible on IEEE Xplore . Xenea incorporates two key technological architectures: Proof of Democracy (PoD): Xenea’s proprietary consensus algorithm allows user wallets to determine transaction authenticity. Unlike Proof of Work, which demands significant energy consumption, or Proof of Stake, which relies on token price for security, PoD facilitates secure value transfer over exceptionally long periods. Participation in PoD requires holding a Mining Passport NFT. Decentralized Autonomous Storage (DACS): DACS serves as the foundation of Xenea’s decentralized storage system, enabling seamless integration between the blockchain and various file systems. SGM ensures the preservation of data over the long term. Initially integrating with IPFS, DACS is set to incorporate Xenea's own hash file system by 2025, supporting real-time editing of dynamic data. Through DACS, AI-generated data handled by any blockchain ecosystem in the AI era can be directly managed and stored on the Xenea blockchain. This enables the provision of highly reliable data storage infrastructure for various products. Background of Recruiting Ecosystem Partners Xenea features its own distributed storage system and operates as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, enabling businesses to handle a broader range of data on the blockchain. In the emerging era of the distributed web—integrated with advancements in AI, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI), and virtual technologies—secure and permanent data storage infrastructure is becoming increasingly essential. Xenea aims to meet this need by offering its storage solutions to a broader range of Web3 projects. Xenea's public mainnet and Token Generation Event (TGE) are scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. As part of the preparation, a download campaign for the XENEA Wallet is underway as of December 2024. This campaign serves as a critical step toward ensuring the robustness of the Proof of Democracy (PoD) security at the mainnet launch. Participants who contribute significantly during the campaign will be prioritized for token airdrops and Mining Passport NFTs. Wallets with these NFTs will play an active role in consensus and supporting the Xenea network structure. The XENEA Wallet download campaign has achieved over 1.2 million downloads to date. This growing user base presents a significant opportunity for ecosystem partners, offering high visibility and user acquisition potential. By leveraging the XENEA Wallet for exposure and engaging in collaborative cross-marketing initiatives, Xenea aims to foster mutual growth and strengthen the ecosystem. In a pilot cross-marketing initiative with Chat3 , an early adopter of the Xenea blockchain, over 250,000 users were successfully directed to their service, resulting in notable activity levels. Xenea is actively engaging in business development with local economic organizations and government bodies across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Future expansion into these regions is also being explored in collaboration with ecosystem partners.
