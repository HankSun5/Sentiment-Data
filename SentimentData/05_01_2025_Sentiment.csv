The latest report by blockchain security company CertiK recorded a total of approximately $28.6 million in losses – the lowest monthly figure in 2024. December Crypto Losses Are 2024’s Lowest Exploits dominated the financial impact, accounting for $26.7 million, while flash loan attacks and exit scams contributed $1.7 million and $200,000, respectively. Among the flash loan attacks, the most notable incidents included CloberDex, which suffered $501,279 in losses, followed by Clipper DEX with $450,811 and MoonMaker with $319,320. The largest single exploit in December targeted Gempad, with damages totaling a staggering $2.14 million. Other significant exploits included FBD, which lost $1.07 million, and Vesta DAO, $401,428. CertiK’s infographic revealed that December marks a sharp decline in overall losses, a stark contrast to peak months earlier in the year, where losses reached tens of millions monthly. The report also highlighted the growing threat of phishing, with the top victim (address 0x751e) losing $7.87 million, making it one of the costliest phishing incidents of the year. Other phishing incidents ranged between $1.4 million and $2.8 million in individual losses. Phishing Scams Persists Earlier last month, a cryptocurrency user revealed they lost $300,000 in a phishing scam after clicking a malicious KakaoTalk meeting link shared via direct message on X. The link, which was suspected of installing malware, compromised multiple wallets, including Ethereum and Solana addresses. The attacker allegedly transferred the funds to a wallet tied to the BingX exchange. More recently, Animoca Brands’ co-founder Yat Siu’s X account was hacked despite two-factor authentication (2FA). The attackers resorted to promoting a fraudulent token named “MOCA.” The phishing scheme, tied to Pump.fun, targeted over 15 crypto-focused accounts, stealing nearly $500,000. Blockchain security firm SlowMist also uncovered a phishing campaign using fake Zoom meeting links to steal cryptocurrency. The scheme mimicked Zoom’s interface, which prompted many victims to download malware disguised as a meeting installation package. The malware then harvested sensitive data, including cryptocurrency wallet details, leading to losses of more than $1 million. Hackers who were found to be potentially linked to Russian-speaking operatives reportedly laundered stolen funds across exchanges like Binance and Gate.io.

With Republicans in control and new leadership at the SEC expected, the crypto industry anticipates a fresh start. Garlinghouse stresses the need for the U.S. to act decisively to maintain its global edge in cryptocurrency. As Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claims, the 119th Congress is now the most pro-crypto U.S. Congress in history, with Republicans taking control again after six long years. Pro-crypto congress brings optimism After all, this moment marked not only the victory of Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House again but also Donald Trump’s return to the White House, and the crypto community feels that their interests are going to be protected this time around. This could be a good time for an industry that has faced many challenges under the Biden administration and the SEC. Ripple is actually in a four-year lawsuit with the SEC. The SEC believes that the XRP token, issued by Ripple, is a security. Ripple claims it may alter its situation with the new Congress. Garlinghouse also explains how things are getting tough for crypto projects. On top of this, he talks about enforcement actions that are going to make so many businesses leave the United States. The cryptocurrency industry has made a massive investment in the 2024 elections, sponsoring more than 200 pro-crypto lawmakers through lobbies such as Stand With Crypto. Congress now includes many members who support innovation and investor protection, with one outspoken advocate, Representative French Hill. He has already announced that in the new session, he would pay attention to laws like the FIT21 Act and rules for stablecoins to ensure the industry is governed clearly. Garlinghouse pushes for clear U.S. crypto policies Garlinghouse noticed that both sides support cryptocurrency, but he pointed out that the rules from the Biden administration had made many people in the industry feel unwelcome. He criticized actions like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” which made banks less willing to work with crypto companies, creating more challenges for businesses in the United States. Still, he expressed hope that the new Congress will offer the industry a fresh start and a better place to grow. The new Congress will arrive at a time when China is going to spread its technology to developing markets, which increases the chances of entering those markets for them. According to Garlinghouse, the U.S. needs to move fast but smartly, not to engage in a battle. He says there needs to be clear policies that can make it easier for the U.S. to stay on top of the crypto and blockchain movement. This is the outset of a new age in cryptocurrency. With a new Congress and with expected staff changes at the SEC, many are expecting America to once again take the lead on crypto innovation. It is one of those moments in time that affords someone like Garlinghouse, as well as others of his contemporaries, a singular opportunity to drive for clarity in regulations, greater innovation, and for America to continue to be at the forefront.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 21:37:00

Here Are the 5 Best Tokens to Do It By March 2025,https://timestabloid.com/want-to-grow-your-500-portfolio-20x-here-are-the-5-best-tokens/,"Becoming twenty times richer through investments in three months may sound impossible. However, anything is possible—loss or gain—in the crypto market. For investors looking to make $10,000 by March 2025 from $500, we will discuss the five best tokens to make this dream achievable. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance uses an innovative approach to finance management to solve problems in traditional finance. These problems include high cost, illiquidity, lack of transparency, and global inaccessibility. Rexas Finance uses asset tokenization to turn real-world assets into tokens, solving these issues. Rexas Finance began its presale in September 2024 and has since gained significant attention. The project is currently in the eleventh stage of its presale and has raised over $34 million. The quick sales of the RXS tokens show that investors are confident in the project. Currently, each token is being sold for $0.175. Rexas Finance offers various tools, including the Rexas Token Builder for creating custom tokens, Rexas Estate for real estate tokenization, and Rexas GenAI for generating AI-driven NFTs. The project has undergone a CertiK Audit to prove its security. It is also listed on websites like CoinGecko and CoinmarketCap, where traders can get real-time updates about the token. Additionally, RXS will launch on major exchanges, increasing its reach and further boosting its price growth. With its remarkable presale success, innovative features, and clear vision, Rexas Finance is set to lead the asset tokenization space. RXS started at $0.03 and is now worth over 480% more. However, experts say this is only the beginning of its growth. RXS is poised to witness a 20X increase post-launch until March. Thus, it is an exciting option for investors who aim for substantial growth by March 2025. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera has collaborated with top companies like Nvidia, Intel, and ChainLink, which has resulted in significant coin growth and positioned it at the forefront of AI integration and decentralized finance (DeFi). RedSwan CRE’s tokenization of real estate assets and the introduction of a physically backed Hedera HBAR Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) in Europe further bolster the token’s adoption. While short-term market challenges have impacted HBAR, the formation of a bullish flag pattern and positive market sentiment suggest a potential rally. Analysts speculate that HBAR could reach $1 and higher by 2025, with factors like institutional adoption and regulatory advantages causing it to grow. Dogecoin (DOGE) Trader Tardigrade predicts DOGE could surpass $4 by January 2025, replicating the explosive gains during its 2021 bull run. Historical price movements show Dogecoin consolidating before sharp breakouts, and current charts suggest a similar setup is underway.Meanwhile, crypto analyst Javon Marks foresees a 570% surge, potentially reaching $2.28, if DOGE continues to align with its cyclical patterns. The coin’s history of exponential fourth-year gains bolsters this optimism, with some experts projecting a staggering 12,000% rally in 2025 that could push DOGE beyond $40. Despite recent struggles below its 50 EMA, Dogecoin’s resilience remains promising. Key support levels near $0.28 could provide a springboard for recovery. With momentum building and historical trends in its favor, DOGE presents a compelling case for exponential portfolio growth. Binance Coin (BNB) Based on technical indices, Binance Coin will likely retest its all-time high of $793.86. BNB recently witnessed a 5.21% price surge and a 29.39% increase in trading volume to $1.6 billion, reflecting growing market enthusiasm. On-chain data also shows that many investors are interested in the coin. Currently, BNB faces a key resistance at $705.06, which could temporarily limit gains. However, if this level is cleared, the asset may continue its upward trajectory, supported by robust market sentiment and strong buying interest. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $696. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 has skyrocketed nearly 13,000% this year, capturing attention with its goal to challenge traditional financial indices like the S&P 500. With a playful slogan that “6900 is greater than 500,” SPX has positioned itself as more than a meme—it’s a movement. A significant catalyst for SPX6900’s growth was its Kraken listing on December 11, which amplified its visibility and trading activity. Adding to its momentum, Binance introduced a SPXUSDT Perpetual Contract with up to 75x leverage, signaling strong confidence in its potential. This high-leverage feature, combined with a maximum financing rate of ±2.00%, has attracted a surge in trading volume and liquidity. Whales have also taken notice, swapping millions from other meme coins like BONK and WIF to accumulate SPX. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, SPX is well-positioned for sustained growth as retail and institutional interest builds. As meme coins gain mainstream traction, SPX6900 could outpace competitors like Shiba Inu, making it a promising candidate to multiply your portfolio by March 2025. Conclusion These five tokens are the top tokens to add to your portfolio if you want to multiply your investment by 20 times in March 2025. Rexas Finance is a new entry into the crypto market with the potential to skyrocket after its launch. You also have the chance to win $50,000 in its giveaway offer if you are lucky!

Despite the stablecoin’s young age, it has printed a sustained growth track to beat Paypal’s PYUSD and Circle’s EURC tokens. This milestone comes despite Ripple USD showcasing a much smaller market capitalization than the duo. RLUSD Stablecoin and the Performance Metrics Per data from CoinMarketCap, the Ripple stablecoin boasts a self-reported market cap of $53.1 million. Atop this, the stablecoin saw its trading volume jump by 1,566% in 24 hours to $607.58 million. This unexpected boost contrasts sharply with Paypal’s PYUSD with a $491.72 million capitalization and a 24 hour volume of $19.74 million. Also, Circle’s EURC, a MiCA-compliant token with market cap of $82.38 million and $10.55 million volume. While it remains unclear the reasons for the RLUSD stablecoin growth, uptickthe current outlook positions it as the 3rd most traded token after Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. A related growth is seen across the board for Ripple coin per data insights from XPMarkets. At the moment, the token has a total user of 7,600, up from the 1000 it recorded 24 hours after Ripple launched the stablecoin in December, 2024. With the RLUSD stablecoin’s growth trend, it is now the 13th largest asset on the XRP Ledger by market capitalization. The token’s growth also hinges on its expansion on top trading platforms globally. As reported earlier by Coingape, it launched on Bullish on Christmas Eve after it made its global debut on Uphold and Bitso. These listings helped boost its liquidity and accessibility by users. Ripple, XRP Ledger and RWA Agenda Beyond its direct role in facilitating payments, Ripple Labs has a bigger plan for the RLUSD stablecoin. The firm is making ambitious move in the Real World Tokenization (RWA) world through its partnership with Archax. Ultimately, the firm hopes to integrate the stablecoin as a primary liquidity layer in driving this use case. The firm recently launched its first tokenized money market fund on XRP Ledger lately, establishing its foothold in this industry. Ripple executives have reiterated how the stablecoin, XRP Ledger and XRP will form a complementary bond across its product suite. The liquidity boost of the stablecoin might account for the latest rally in the price of XRP as reported earlier by Coingape. As of writing, the coin was changing hands for $2.432, up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. In an earlier XRP price analysis , the coin is projected to hit Should the broad Ripple plans work out, analysts are projecting a potential push to $3.5.

In 2027, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $10,120 and $13,127, with an average expected price of $11,886. In 2031, ETH could trade between $23,172 and $26,740, with an average price of $25,166. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,333 Market Cap $401.64B Trading Volume $18.58B Circulating Supply 120.46M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,419 24 Low $3,340 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.96% (High) 50-day SMA $ 3,508.91 200-day SMA $ 3,046 Sentiment BULLISH Fear and Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-Day price chart On December 4, the 1-day Ethereum chart currently shows a price of $3,638.8, with resistance near the upper Bollinger Band at $3,848.2 and support at the lower band around $3,108.2. The middle band at $3,478.2 acts as a pivotal level, currently breached to the upside. RSI is at 56.72, signaling increasing bullish momentum but still below overbought levels. The price is increasing after consolidating near the lower Bollinger Band in December. A breakout above $3,848.2 could signal further upward momentum toward the $4,000 region, while a rejection near current levels might lead to a retest of $3,478.2 as support. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour Ethereum chart shows a current price of $3,642.8. The upper Bollinger Band at $3,700 acts as immediate resistance, and the lower band at $3,316.4 serves as support. The middle band at $3,508.2 represents a pivotal level for further price action. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.96 indicates strong bullish momentum, supported by the MACD, which displays a widening bullish crossover with the MACD line at 65.1 above the signal line at 52.8. If ETH breaches $3,700, it could continue toward $3,800. A rejection may see it testing $3,508.2 for support before further moves.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour Ethereum charts, ETH shows bullish potential with the price climbing to $3,642.8. On the daily chart, RSI at 56.72 signals positive momentum, with the next resistance at $3,848.2. The 4-hour chart complements this with a bullish MACD crossover and strong Balance of Power (0.96), suggesting continued upward pressure. A break above $3,700 could lead ETH to test $3,848.2 and potentially $4,000. However, consolidation or rejection at resistance may result in a pullback to the 4-hour middle Bollinger Band at $3,508.2 or the daily support near $3,478.2 before resuming its trend. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Despite rising in the last quarter of the year, Shiba Inu has been struggling to break through key levels and maintain investor interest. This price resistance is stifling upward momentum, pushing investors to seek greener pastures. Enter RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin with a game-changing feature: real-world asset (RWA) integration. With this feature, RCOF is bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto, garnering a lot of attention from SHIB investors who are looking to move away from speculative assets like Shiba Inu. What’s Causing The Shiba Inu Price Resistance While Shiba Inu captured investor interest with its impressive 2021 surge, this recent price action shows it’s facing significant resistance that is slowing down upward movements. These are some of the reasons for the headwinds facing the Shiba Inu price. One of the biggest factors affecting the Shiba Inu price is the token’s limited real-world utility. While the Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded with projects like ShibaSwap and Shibarium, their adoption is slow and hasn’t generated significant real-world use cases. This limited utility means Shiba Inu still has to rely on speculative interest to drive price action. This overreliance on speculative hype leaves the Shiba Inu price susceptible to swaying market sentences, resulting in this slowed progress. Another factor affecting Shiba Inu is market saturation and the stiff competition it faces because the memecoin market has become saturated. This competition is reducing Shiba Inu’s market share, making it harder to attract new investors or maintain existing ones. As these memecoins draw speculative capital away from SHIB, the Shiba Inu price fails to grow. From a technical analysis perspective, Shiba Inu has encountered resistance at several key price levels, notably at approximately $0.000026 and $0.000033. These levels have historically acted as barriers to upward movement, suggesting that significant buying pressure is required to break through them. Now trading at around $0.00002072, the Shiba Inu price is well below these resistance levels, showing a strong lack of momentum. RCO Finance: The AI Altcoin With RWA Integration Drawing Investor Attention While the Shiba Inu price continues to struggle, investors are shifting to RCO Finance because of its game-changing features that blend utility and innovation. RCOF is an AI altcoin that is revolutionizing how investors interact with traditional and digital assets. By integrating AI and RWA tokenization, RCOF seeks to create a more accessible and transparent financial ecosystem. RCOF offers access to over 120,000 tradable assets, including RWAs like ETFs, commodities, FX, stocks and more. By tokenizing these assets, this AI altcoin is democratizing access to them and making it easier for users to buy fractionalized shares of these assets. RCOF also allows users to buy RWAs directly using crypto instead of first converting it to fiat currency. By connecting RWAs to the blockchain, RCOF opens up new investment opportunities for financial inclusion and portfolio diversification all from one platform. RWA integration positions RCOF as a trailblazer in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance, attracting institutional interest and boosting mainstream appeal. Another stand-out feature of this AI altcoin is the robo-advisor. This AI-powered tool serves as your trading assistant, customizing its support to fit your preferences. For instance, it offers personalized investment plans tailored to your goals and risk tolerance. It analyzes vast amounts of data to provide actionable insights that help you make smarter choices. With these insights, you can avoid emotional trading and remain rational, especially during extreme market volatility. The robo-advisor also offers automated trading and portfolio management. This feature allows it to execute trades and adjust your portfolio autonomously. This allows you to capitalize on new opportunities and mitigate risks as they rise. This AI altcoin relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning to carry out its operations. As such, security is a top priority. To ensure its smart contracts and codebase are up to standard, RCOF has undergone a thorough SolidProof audit, which shows that the platform is secure and reliable. Make the Smart Shift to RCOF The Shiba Inu price resistance has signaled a need for investors to explore alternatives with stronger fundamentals and real-world applications. With its AI capabilities and RWA integration, RCO Finance stands out as a strong contender. Bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance, this AI altcoin is set to become a market leader. The RCOF presale is underway, offering savvy investors the chance to get in early and secure their stake while prices are still low. Currently, in the 4th stage, tokens are going for $0.077, and early adopters also get a 25% bonus. If you invest $1000, instead of getting 12870 tokens, you get 16,096 tokens. With an anticipated listing price of anywhere between $0.4 and $0.6, your $1000 could grow into anywhere between $6,438.40 and $9,657.60. Make the smart shift and join RCOF today.

In the case of Solana, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has hit the bullish nail with his recent prediction that Solana could see a staggering 1,800% price surge and reach $4,000 very soon. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Daily Downtrend – Analyst Expects New ATH Soon In a post on social media platform X, Martinez highlighted a developing “cup and handle” chart pattern, which he claims is signaling a massive bullish breakout for Solana. He backed his analysis with insights from charting expert Thomas N. Bulkowski. Solana’s Road To $4,000 Martinez’s take on Solana is based on the monthly timeframe for the cryptocurrency’s price action. As he pointed out, Solana’s price action over the past few years most likely looks like that of a cup and handle pattern. This formation cuts across the 2022 bear market, the 2023 consolidation plus recovery, and the 2024 bull market. In terms of formation period, the cup part of the pattern was formed throughout 2022, 2023, and early 2024, when Solana broke above the resistance trendline for the first time. The handle formation was formed by Solana’s up-and-down movement around the $200 price level for most of 2024, which eventually culminated in a breakout to a new all-time high of $263 in November. As shown in the chart below, the cup and handle formation seems to have been completed already, and the only thing left is to wait and see how much Solana surges to the upside. In terms of a price target, Martinez made use of the Fibonacci extension indicator, projecting it from the 2022 bear market low of $9.96. The target is around the 2.00 Fib extension level, which puts the projected target around $4,000. Understanding The Cup And Handle: A Proven Bullish Formation The cup-and-handle pattern is a classic technical indicator often associated with bullish market behavior. It consists of a rounded “cup” that represents a period of consolidation and recovery, followed by a smaller “handle,” indicating a brief consolidation before a breakout. According to Thomas N. Bulkowski, who Martinez also highlighted in his analysis, the cup-and-handle ranks as the third most effective bullish pattern, with a 61% likelihood of achieving its projected target. Considering the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies, the odds this pattern presents is quite notable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $215 and is up by 3% and 16% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This price increase comes alongside a surge in activity, with Solana witnessing a 16% trading volume increase in the past 24 hours. If Solana were to reach $4,000, it would translate to a return of about 1,800% from the current price.

The latest update points to an impressive $5 surge for this meme coin. But this seemingly great news about the Dogecoin price pales in comparison to what a cheap AI altcoin named WallitIQ (WLTQ) is offering. This AI altcoin is projected to gain 30,000%, a jaw-breaking surge that will change the story for many crypto investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Outpace The Dogecoin Price Surge With 30,000% Returns The Dogecoin price has seen fair ups in 2024. Compared to its 2023 price, the Dogecoin price saw a general increase of over 250%. However, experts predict that the Dogecoin price will do far better in 2025, rising from its current price of $0.31 to a massive $5. These predictions are partly based on the Dogecoin price history of hitting a surge at the end of every cycle. The Dogecoin price saw massive increases in 2017 and 2021, and now, another cycle will end in 2025. Driven by these past trends and the anticipated bullish crypto market, experts say the Dogecoin price could hit $5 next year. However, this is not the biggest surge to expect in the crypto market. Analysts speak of a cheap AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), that will do better than the Dogecoin price. This AI altcoin is currently priced at $0.0420 only, but experts predict a 30,000% rally next year. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents groundbreaking opportunities, such as allowing investors to trade over 1500 cryptocurrencies directly on the platform. Such impressive features have generated rapid adoption of the AI altcoin, as is evident from the presale results. The previous WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale phases generated over $5 million as investors bought more than 300 million WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens. The current stage launched recently, yet close to 300,000 tokens have been bought, generating over $11,000. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has a definite supply of 1 billion tokens, which is well allocated to support a 30,000% rally. Experts predict that this AI altcoin will take over the $700 billion crypto wallet and AI market, effortlessly generating $5 million in monthly revenue. Therefore, investors should not sleep on this opportunity. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is offering gains that will exceed the Dogecoin price and other major players. The best move for any investor today is to join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin’s rally nears $100k, the crypto market turns bullish, making now the perfect time to explore top altcoins like XRP, DOGE, SUI, and rising stars like Rollblock (RBLK). Bitcoin is on its way back up to $100k again, and the crypto market is turning bullish in response. Traditionally, where Bitcoin leads, altcoins follow, but what are the best altcoins to buy now? In this article, we’ll look at four different alts, from legacy crypto XRP to meme coin DOGE and see how they will perform as older altcoins. We’ll also take a look at newer cryptos, such as Rollblock (RBLK) , whose presale has caught the attention of the crypto market at large. Looking at the SUI price, it could be that this relatively new crypto is enjoying its first bull market, too. Read on to examine the potential of these four altcoins. As the 2025 Bull market gathers pace, is Rollblock one of the altcoins to buy now? With the 2025 bull market starting up, savvy investors are seeking the best altcoins to buy now, and Rollblock’s successful and ongoing presale has captured their attention. This GambleFi platform combines cutting-edge features like Revenue Sharing and deflationary tokenomics, with everything you’d expect from an online gambling platform. Its presale has already raised $8 million, and with the token price soaring over 340%, it signals confidence in Rollblock’s potential to tap into the $500 billion online gambling industry. Investors aren’t merely attracted to price speculation but to the real-world utility of its token. RBLK token holders benefit from passive income through revenue sharing, and with a 30% APY for staking, it’s using the best of DeFi to attract long term investment. DOGE corrects heavy after Q4 exponential rise DOGE has faced a significant correction after its impressive Q4 rally. Despite this pullback of the DOGE price, the broader crypto bull market is gaining momentum, which is where meme coins like DOGE often thrive. As the expected 2025 bull market gains pace, DOGE could emerge as one of the best altcoins to buy now. SUI price reaches ATH before slight correction SUI recently reached a new all-time high (ATH), and although a slight correction followed, the SUI price remains robust as sentiment among crypto investors grows bullish. SUI’s performance indicates a solid foundation, and analysts speculate the SUI price could continue its upward trajectory in 2025, especially given that it is SUI‘s first cycle. Up 5X in November, what is next for XRP? XRP surged an impressive 5x in November after strong links with the Trump administration. With the bull market of 2025 approaching, and of course, Trump taking office this month, analysts believe XRP could reach a new ATH, which would only be a 50% increase in the XRP price. Of course, nothing is clear from Trump, even though he seems to be pro crypto, XRP’s strong performance suggests that of all the legacy cryptos, it’s one of the best altcoins to buy now. So what are the best altcoins to buy now? With a new pro-crypto US government, this year is expected to be extremely bullish, so which altcoins to buy now? XRP ran wildly in November and looks well positioned with the government. The SUI price also looks primed to take off, and you should never write off DOGE in a bull market. But it’s the newest cryptos that bring in the biggest gains, and if Rollblock’s presale success is a signal, then 2025 could belong to RBLK.

This marks a significant expansion beyond cryptocurrency. This new feature lets crypto exchange users buy, sell, and transfer stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) via the Crypto.com App. Zero-commission Trades and Bonus Offering These services are now available to users in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Washington, and Arizona. Soon, the exchange plans to roll out these services nationwide. For now, the selected US users are entitled to zero-commission trades and a 3% bonus when they utilize the Crypto.com App for securities transfers. Noteworthy, the 3% bonus, which will only last for a while, is to promote the new service. After the promotional period, the bonus could be reduced or eliminated. Crypto.com users in the regions mentioned above can also gain access to fractional shares, further providing investors flexibility. The exchange is keen on integrating the Traditional Finance (TradFi) ecosystem and the crypto sector. Crypto.com introduced a few other services besides these new stock and ETF trading options in the last few months. Before the Christmas holiday, it introduced a pioneering sports prediction trading platform for US customers. Users are presented with simple yes/no decisions on sports events with potential $100 rewards per correct prediction. This new product focuses on enabling users to predict the outcome of a sports event, including basketball and the Super Bowl. Recall that Crypto.com signed a multi-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League in August. Unlike the latest milestone available to only a few US states, the sports events trading is designed to be accessible to all states in America. Crypto.com’s launch of this service also redirected new utilities to Cronos (CRO), a Layer-1 project focused on democratizing smart contracts. Crypto.com Withdraws Lawsuit Against SEC In October, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over claims that some of its business dealings are investment contracts. In the exchange’s opinion, the SEC has adopted a regulation-by-enforcement campaign instead of providing clear regulatory guidelines. Shortly after a meeting between Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek and President-elect Donald Trump, the company suddenly decided to drop the suit . The incoming dispensation in the US is planning to implement crypto-friendly policies, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve.

38543769,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=637766,1736029563,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38543769.jpeg,Polymarket: 40% Chance Trump Creates U.S. Bitcoin Reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-40-chance-trump-creates-u-s/,"A recent Polymarket poll shows 40% believe President-elect Trump might create a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, stirring debates on its role in national finances. With nearly 200,000 Bitcoins already held by the government, this move could boost the U.S.’s position in the global crypto market. The concept of a Bitcoin reserve in the United States has pulled the discussion out of the cryptocurrency community and into wider circles, mainly fueled by the latest news and speculation. Polymarket Poll of U.S. Bitcoin Reserve A recent Polymarket poll discovered that 40% of respondents believed President-elect Donald Trump is going to create a national Bitcoin reserve-that alone may be the impetus for a change in the United States toward digital assets. Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market. There, users can make guesses about real-world events by buying and selling shares. Current odds on the platform indicate that many people think the Trump administration might back Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This guess is consistent with what Trump said about Bitcoin before and also has support in a positive attitude towards crypto within his administration. Proponents claim that the U.S. can gain a stronger position in the global cryptocurrency market and increase its financial plans by holding onto Bitcoin as a reserve asset. U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump Right now, the U.S. government has nearly 200,000 Bitcoins, worth billions, taken from various legal cases. Industry experts, like Alistair Milne from Altana Digital Currency Fund, suggest that even if Trump does not add more Bitcoin, he could create a “de facto” reserve just by not selling these assets. If the government keeps these Bitcoins, it will influence how much Bitcoin is available and help make its price more stable. Senator Cynthia Lummis recently proposed a bill that enables the government to purchase one million Bitcoins within five years. According to her, the reserve may help in paying off the country’s $36 trillion debt and making the U.S. dollar stronger. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve brings along very massive challenges. Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, had rejected this proposal and said the current law prohibits the Federal Reserve from owning Bitcoins. Such decisions should be taken by Congress, which would not agree with it because of the risks involved in price fluctuations and security with Bitcoins. For all the risks taken on by taxpayers, critics say there are far too many of them to entrust Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Sure, Bitcoin has spiked in value this year, but its recent history of big price changes leaves much to be desired when it comes to how dependable it may be as a long-term reserve. To top it all off, hackers will certainly break into government-issued crypto wallets. This concept of a bitcoin reserve is not something coming from America only. Bhutan and El Salvador have already placed Bitcoin in their national financial plans but on a much smaller scale. Precisely for this reason, since the U.S. holds a lot of Bitcoin and is economically very powerful, it can set a trend which other countries may adopt later on. There are many cryptocurrency supporters in Trump’s administration, which may help to create a Bitcoin reserve. This will be a huge step for Bitcoin if the plan goes through to become more of a financial tool. According to the Polymarket poll, more people are interested in knowing how digital assets influence national money policies. It is still unclear whether the U.S. accepts a Bitcoin reserve, but the discussions point out that if kept and grown by the U.S., Bitcoin is becoming very important. If Trump keeps and grows the U.S.’ Bitcoin reserves, then the cryptocurrency could be facing drastic change in status and purpose globally.

It’s got the highs, the lows, and everything in between. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned over the years, it’s this: the best opportunities often come during chaotic times. Remember the 1973 economic collapse? The markets were in tatters, but the smart folks who bought the dips back then? They set themselves up for life. Fast forward to today, meme coins are rewriting the playbook. Among the top contenders, BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its killer presale performance, a thriving community, and real utility. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Apu Apustaja are the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. Meme coins have exploded in popularity, starting with Dogecoin and branching into innovative projects that combine fun, utility, and massive ROI potential. But BTFD Coin is set to outshine them all. With its P2E game, referral program, BIG50 bonus, staking rewards and a community-powered roadmap, it’s got everything to redefine what meme coins can achieve. Let’s compare it to Neiro and Apu Apustaja to see why it’s stealing the spotlight. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin That Means Business Let’s kick things off with BTFD Coin. It’s not just another meme coin riding the wave—it’s creating its own tidal surge. The presale has been nothing short of epic, raking in over $4.9 million within its first month. Starting at a humble $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in Stage 13 at $0.000142. That’s a jaw-dropping ROI for early investors. And when the presale wraps up, BTFD will hit the market at $0.0006. Think about it—investors who got in early are looking at insane gains. Here’s how it works: you can snag BTFD Coins at a 50% bonus using the BIG50 bonus code. It’s easy as pie. Head to the presale page, connect your wallet, apply the BIG50 code, and you’re golden. But it’s not just the numbers. BTFD Coin is building a decentralised ecosystem with staking rewards , a play-to-earn game that’s got gamers hyped, and a referral program to sweeten the pot. And let’s not forget the community power. With over 7,600 holders and counting, it’s clear this project isn’t going anywhere but up. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in this weekend , this is it. Neiro: The AI-Driven Meme Coin Next up, we’ve got Neiro. While BTFD Coin rides on community and utility, Neiro brings artificial intelligence to the meme coin space. It’s positioning itself as a tech-heavy contender, claiming to use AI algorithms to predict market trends and optimise investment strategies for its holders. Sounds fancy, right? But does it hold water? Neiro’s presale numbers are decent, but they pale in comparison to BTFD Coin’s meteoric rise. The project’s AI angle is intriguing, but it’s also untested. How much of it is buzz versus real tech? That’s the million-dollar question. Investors are cautious, and rightly so. AI-driven tools are only as good as the data they’re fed. If the algorithms can’t handle the volatile nature of meme coins, it could be a recipe for disaster. Still, Neiro has its fans. The project’s presale has seen a steady influx of investors, and its focus on tech sets it apart in the meme coin world. But it lacks the same grassroots enthusiasm that’s propelling BTFD Coin. Without a strong community, it risks becoming just another tech-heavy project that fails to connect with the average investor. For Gen Z and Millennials in Australasia, who crave relatability and engagement, Neiro might feel a bit too corporate. If you’re looking for innovation, Neiro could be worth a punt. But if you want the full package—utility, community, and ROI—BTFD Coin is still the better bet. After all, AI can’t buy loyalty, and in the world of meme coins, loyalty is everything. Apu Apustaja: The Meme That Keeps on Giving Last but not least, let’s talk about Apu Apustaja. This meme coin takes its name from the infamous internet frog meme, blending nostalgia with humour to create a unique brand identity. If you’ve been around the internet for a while, you’ve probably encountered Apu’s sad-but-endearing face. But does nostalgia translate into a viable investment? Apu Apustaja relies heavily on its meme appeal. The project is big on community-driven initiatives, and its Discord and Reddit groups are buzzing. However, it lacks the utility that BTFD Coin brings to the table. There’s no play-to-earn game, no staking rewards, and no referral program. It’s fun, sure, but is it functional? That’s where it falls short. Financially, Apu Apustaja’s presale is moving along, but it’s not breaking records. Investors are drawn to the meme, but the project’s roadmap is vague, and there’s little to suggest it has the staying power of BTFD Coin. When the hype dies down, what’s left? Not much. That said, Apu Apustaja is undeniably entertaining. If you’re looking for a laugh and a small punt, it could be worth a look. But for serious investors aiming to maximise their returns, BTFD Coin remains the king of the hill. It’s got the numbers, the utility, and the community to back it up. And let’s be real—in crypto, those are the only metrics that matter. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to get in on the action? Here’s how you can join the BTFD Coin presale and secure your bonused price: Go to the presale page at BTFD.io . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or similar). Enter the bonus code BIG50 in the designated field and click “Apply.” Input the amount of $BTFD you want to purchase and review the price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. It’s as simple as that. With the BIG50 bonus code, you’re not just buying coins—you’re buying into a community-driven revolution. Conclusion: Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the ultimate choice for investors this weekend. While Neiro offers innovation and Apu Apustaja brings meme nostalgia, neither can match the utility, community power, and ROI potential of BTFD Coin . With over $4.9 million raised and 62 billion coins sold, it’s clear that this project has captured the imagination of the crypto world. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing presale. Visit presale website today , use the BIG50 bonus code, and secure your 50% bonus coins.

That’s exactly what Altura ($ALU) represents. Just as ChatGPT transformed how we interact with AI in daily life, Altura is set to redefine gaming by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain. With its cutting-edge tech and potential to change the gaming landscape, $ALU could be on the brink of a meteoric rise to $1. Here’s why Altura is attracting so much attention and why it could be your next big opportunity. What is Altura ($ALU)? Altura is like a ""ChatGPT for gaming"" because it brings smart, adaptive technology to the forefront. It’s a blockchain-based platform that enables game developers to create, distribute, and trade smart NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Unlike regular NFTs, smart NFTs can evolve based on game progress or specific conditions, making them ideal for video games. Imagine a virtual sword that becomes more powerful as your character levels up—that’s the kind of innovation Altura is bringing to gaming.The $ALU token powers this ecosystem, facilitating transactions, governance, and staking. Altura’s mission is to seamlessly blend blockchain technology with gaming, offering developers and players tools that revolutionize their experience. Why Altura is Bullish There are several compelling reasons why Altura has massive growth potential: 1. AI Integration Altura leverages artificial intelligence to create smarter, more dynamic in-game assets. This integration allows for more immersive and engaging gameplay. As AI continues to advance and become more integral to gaming, Altura’s capabilities will likely drive significant demand for the $ALU token. 2. Low Market Cap Currently, Altura has a relatively small market cap compared to other blockchain and gaming projects. This gives it substantial room for growth. Low-cap projects often experience higher returns when they gain traction, making Altura a high-potential investment. 3. Not Listed on Major Exchanges Yet Altura’s potential is further amplified by the fact that it’s not yet listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. These platforms boast a combined user base of over 300 million. Once $ALU gets listed, the increased visibility and trading accessibility could result in a significant price surge. Price Predictions for Altura Here are the key price targets for Altura based on market performance and project growth: - Base Target: With a market cap of $1.5 billion, Altura could reach approximately $1.52 per ALU. This is the lowest expected target and could be achieved even in a challenging market environment, thanks to Altura’s strong foundation and ongoing innovation. - Bullish Target: A $3 billion market cap would push $ALU to around $3.03 per token. This target is realistic given the growing excitement around AI, gaming, and blockchain, as well as favorable market conditions. Altura’s position in these thriving sectors makes it well-suited to achieve this milestone, especially during an altcoin rally. - Ultimate Ambition Target: During a cryptocurrency super cycle, Altura could hit a market cap of $5 billion to $10 billion, translating to $5.05 to $10.10 per $ALU. This would likely coincide with a broader market boom, where Bitcoin exceeds $240,000 and Ethereum surpasses $15,000. Altura’s innovative role in the AI and gaming sectors could drive unprecedented growth in such conditions. Final Thoughts Altura’s combination of AI-powered smart NFTs, a low market cap, and the potential for major exchange listings positions it as a promising project. While all investments carry risks, $ALU has the hallmarks of a game-changing opportunity in the gaming and blockchain space. If you’re looking for a high-potential project, Altura could be your next big move in crypto. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

In a press release, the DOJ says that throughout the course of a decade, it has disbursed more than $4.3 billion to 40,930 victims of a fraud scheme led by Bernard L. Madoff. Madoff is known for running a Ponzi scheme for about 17 years that defrauded investors from 127 countries out of approximately $65 billion. The perpetrator convinced people to invest in his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, by promising decent returns while maintaining a trustworthy persona. The scheme collapsed at the height of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) when investors panicked and withdrew their funds en masse only to find out that their money was being used to pay other investors. In June 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison for “running the largest fraudulent scheme in history.” He died in a prison hospital in April of 2021 at 82 years old. The DOJ says it recovered about $2.6 billion through several civil forfeiture actions against Madoff, his brother Peter B. Madoff, his co-conspirators and his clients who benefitted from the scheme including investors Carl Shapiro and Jeffry Picower. The agency also collected $1.7 billion after banking titan JPMorgan Chase settled accusations that the firm failed “to carry out its legal obligations” while serving as Madoff’s primary bank. Says Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York, “This office has never stopped at pursuing justice for victims of history’s largest Ponzi scheme… We have succeeded in compensating 40,930 victims with close to 94% of their losses. As this extraordinary effort demonstrates, this office and MLARS (Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section) are committed to protecting and assisting victims of crime, no matter how long it takes and no matter how complicated the endeavor.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Investors and market participants are preparing for the biggest period of growth and innovation yet. This excitement is fueled by changes in leadership and possibly a favorable regulatory framework on the horizon. This expected new shift in the U.S. has sparked fresh interest among crypto community members. Ripple CEO’s Vision for the Crypto In 2025 In a recent X post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse captured the moment, saying, “The journey is just beginning.” His post comes as the crypto industry celebrates major wins. Garlinghouse’s optimism reflects an industry eager for change, especially with the expected exit of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Also, the arrival of expert leaders in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and crypto sectors is fueling the excitement. These shifts suggest a more favorable regulatory environment that could bring the clarity the crypto world seeks. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which focused on whether its native token XRP is a security, has highlighted the need for clear digital asset regulations. Due to a tough regulatory framework, many crypto leaders have accused the agency of stifling innovations and growth. As the case continues, many hope the SEC’s new leadership will resolve the issue in a way that supports innovation. With Gensler’s departure, there is hope for a new approach at the SEC. A favorable outcome for Ripple could set a positive example for future regulation, helping businesses and investors. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer recently outlined six key guidelines for the SEC , urging clearer regulation of digital assets. These recommendations are part of Ripple’s ongoing effort to address the regulatory uncertainties around crypto. For Ripple, a win would solidify its crypto space leadership and encourage wider XRP adoption. The Pro-Crypto Congress and Market Momentum The arrival of the 119th Congress has been celebrated across the crypto ecosystem. This legislative body, described as the most crypto-friendly in history, represents a pivotal shift. Lawmakers with a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and digital assets will likely support policies encouraging growth and innovation. The impact of this change is already showing in market trends. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading crypto asset, has surged past $98,000, marking a strong start to the year. XRP has also seen a 15% increase since January 1. These price movements highlight the growing confidence in the market as investors expect new rules that could lead to more growth. A Call to Action for the Crypto Community Garlinghouse’s final words in his post, “Let’s get to work,” resonate as a call to action. The crypto industry is on the edge of a new era focused on teamwork, innovation, and opportunity. With a supportive Congress and clearer rules ahead, the stage is set for major progress.

With the crypto market moving in a new direction, investors have expressed confidence in predictions on the future prices of these cryptocurrencies. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Promising Contender In The Crypto-AI Market With Strong Growth Potential Prominent crypto analysts have predicted that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will touch $5 in the coming weeks due to its fast-growing presale and rapid growth potential. WalllitIQ (WLTQ) has gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts through its AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that promote financial literacy and decentralization. As a decentralized crypto wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) empowers users to have complete control over their digital assets. Confident in the platform’s potential, investors are positioning themselves for substantial returns, driven by the growing demand for its efficient and secure crypto wallet solutions. With its integration into the booming billion-dollar crypto-AI market, many analysts predict that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will reach $5 before Dogecoin and Shiba Inu achieve new all-time highs. Investors are flocking to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale in order to secure their positions in its projected $10 million revenue. In addition, early investors are entitled to several benefits, including governance participation, premium features, and early gains of up to 200% due to token price appreciation in the following presale stage. WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides its users with 24/7 access to blockchain-based activities such as yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that yield rewards of up to 180% annually.

Recently, the Dogecoin price reached a new high on the weekly chart, breaking through a critical resistance level at $0.32. This breakout serves as a strong technical indicator of sustained bullish momentum, suggesting further price gains may be on the horizon. A popular trader known as Trader Tardigrade declared on X (formerly Twitter) that the Dogecoin price had completed its final retest of the critical support level at $0.31. The analyst presented a chart predicting the Dogecoin price trajectory based on recurrent historical trends. Shiba Inu Projected Price Surge Amidst Market Volatility Although the Shiba Inu price has experienced volatility during this year, crypto analysts are projecting that the Shiba Inu price will touch $0.006 in the coming weeks. In the beginning of 2024, the Shiba Inu price was trading at approximately $0.000008. By December 30, 2024, the Shiba Inu price had risen to around $0.00002112, reflecting a substantial increase over the year. The above upward movement can be attributed to factors such as increased adoption, technological advancements, and broader market trends. However, SHIB’s price has shown both gains and corrections. As of the time of this writing, Shiba Inu is trading at a price of $0.00002112. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is still in its presale stage, offering investors a gateway to generational wealth with its native token (WLTQ) selling for a low price of $0.0420 .

Meanwhile, XRP has displayed considerable potential following an excellent year in 2024. With successes in regulatory areas and predictions of high prices, its community is looking forward to what 2025 will bring. On the other hand, Cardano is making a recovery, with experts suggesting it is ready for another upward trend after recent declines in price. Find out why these cryptos are the ones to watch in the coming year. Web3Bay Leads Decentralized E-Commerce Evolution Web3Bay is at the forefront of changing e-commerce by creating a transparent and decentralized market. This platform allows buyers and sellers to interact directly, which lowers fees and gives them complete control over their funds and personal data. Its versatile payment system accepts both cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods like PayPal, broadening its appeal to crypto enthusiasts and regular consumers alike. For merchants, particularly in areas with limited access to banks, Web3Bay provides an entry into worldwide markets without the need for traditional financial services. Now in presale stage 2 priced at $0.00345, Web3Bay has amassed over $280,000, selling upwards of 77 million 3BAY coins. Planned across 28 stages with a price increase of 15% per stage, it offers a projected ROI exceeding 6000%. This platform’s combination of secure smart contracts and low transaction fees is set to revolutionize online shopping. XRP Surges with Regulatory Approvals XRP closed 2024 on a strong note, breaking past $2, marking a 370% increase over the year. Projections for 2025 suggest it could reach as high as $6.4, $13, or even $27, propelled by positive market trends and clear regulatory standings. The XRP community has reasons to be hopeful, especially after Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD was endorsed by the New York Department of Financial Services. This endorsement cements Ripple’s role in central bank digital currencies and enhances its payment system, positioning XRP for broader acceptance. However, some analysts, like pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton, express uncertainty about XRP’s future prices, stating, “I have no idea.” Yet, the possibility for growth is substantial. Cardano (ADA) Price Trends Signal Upcoming Rally Cardano has experienced volatile price movements, including a 40% decline after a 300% surge from its lows in November. Analysts such as Michaël van de Poppe believe this correction might soon conclude, setting the stage for new gains. This recent downturn is seen as a normal market adjustment, hinting at potential long-term upward trends. ADA’s entry into a new price range between $0.96 and $1.25 suggests room for growth, with targets between $2.50 and $3.00 under the right conditions. While many are hopeful about ADA’s prospects in 2025, it’s wise to stay cautious, balancing optimistic forecasts with potential challenges. Top Crypto Projects to Consider in 2025 As we enter another significant year in crypto, Web3Bay, XRP, and Cardano are distinguished by their potential to transform their respective areas. Web3Bay’s innovative marketplace could redefine global commerce, XRP looks to brighter prospects with regulatory advancements, and Cardano’s pricing dynamics suggest a strong rebound. These projects provide diverse opportunities, from facilitating global trade to ensuring secure payments and creating decentralized environments. Strategic timing and thoughtful planning are essential—make sure you’re ready to capitalize on the next major wave in crypto .

While Dogecoin retains its place as a popular meme coin, the trader’s endorsement of PropiChain stems from its robust utility, AI-driven features, and potential to disrupt the $300 trillion real estate market. With forecasts predicting a massive 53,039% rally, this altcoin is quickly becoming the focal point for investors looking for exponential returns in the coming bull market. Dogecoin: A Veteran Meme Coin Dogecoin has remained a favorite in the crypto space since its inception in 2013. It gained traction because of its loyal community and endorsements from influencers Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed during the 2021 bull run, offering life-changing returns to early adopters. However, the coin’s speculative nature and limited utility have raised concerns about its long-term sustainability. While the Dogecoin price may rally during the next market upswing, analysts believe PropiChain offers far greater upside for serious investors. What Makes PropiChain the AI Altcoin to Watch? PropiChain is a project that combines blockchain, AI, and real estate tokenization to solve age-old problems in the property investment market. The real estate market is filled with challenges, including high capital barriers, lack of transparency, and inefficiency. PropiChain addresses these issues through: Fractional Ownership : Investors can buy tokens representing fractional shares of high-value properties, making real estate accessible to anyone. AI Integration : Advanced AI tools provide data-driven insights, automated property valuations, and tailored investment recommendations. Metaverse Integration : PropiChain uses virtual reality to offer immersive property tours and facilitate global investor networking. These features position PropiChain as a practical and profitable investment, unlike speculative coins like Dogecoin. PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap and its BlockAudit security review further enhance its credibility, reassuring investors about the project’s legitimacy. The Power of AI in PropiChain What sets PropiChain apart from other altcoins is its cutting-edge AI integration. Data-Driven Decisions : The platform’s AI tools analyze market trends, identify high-growth areas, and offer real-time property valuations. Risk Mitigation : By using predictive analytics, investors can minimize risks and maximize returns. Streamlined Investment Process : Automated filtering and valuation tools simplify the process, making property investments faster and more accessible. For example, an investor using PropiChain’s AI tools could identify an undervalued property in a high-growth market and gain significant returns without the need for extensive research. Presale Stage: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. The price will increase to $0.023 in Stage 3, making now the ideal time to invest. Investing in the presale offers the chance to acquire tokens at a steep discount before they hit major exchanges. With projections of a 53,039% rally, even a modest investment could yield life-changing returns. Practically, a $500 investment during the presale could grow to over $265,000 if the forecastforecast is true. The Future of PropiChain The roadmap for PropiChain includes partnerships with global real estate firms, further development of its AI and metaverse features, and eventual expansion into other asset classes like art and collectibles. This forward-thinking approach positions PropiChain as a long-term player in the cryptocurrency space, with the potential to outshine established projects like Dogecoin. Conclusion While Dogecoin may see another rally in the coming years, PropiChain’s utility-driven model offers unmatched growth potential. Backed by AI innovation and the booming real estate market, PropiChain is set to redefine property investments and deliver exponential returns to its investors. With its presale price at just $0.011, now’s the best time to invest in PropiChain. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to turn a modest investment into life-changing wealth. Secure your tokens today and be part of a revolution in real estate investments.

Users on the Polygon-based platform have been betting on the projects launching their airdrops in Q1 2025 since the beginning of the year. The platform requires users to bid yes or no, depending on their choice of vote. The platform also ascertains the level of votes on a project, tilting the average odds towards the preferred options. Polymarket shot to fame during the United States election, where it predicted President-elect Donald Trump as the eventual winner even before the announcement was made. The platform currently has a list of projects that may likely launch in the first quarter of 2025, with users allowed to choose the side they want to bet on. Aside from Berachain and Linea airdrops, the platform has provided users with options to bet on Jumper, Pump.fun, and Aleo airdrops among others. Polymarket odds for Berachain airdrop rise Berachain has risen to prominence in the crypto industry, becoming one of the fastest-growing projects. It has also received significant funding, raising $43 million in 2023, before raising $69 million in a funding round in March 2024. According to sources familiar with the matter, the funding round was led by Brevan Howard Digital and Framework Ventures, pushing its value above $1 billion. Berachain is a layer-1 network, housing a handful of DeFi-related applications in its ecosystem. Its native exchange BEX is also looking to rival Uniswap, allowing users to swap tokens, while its lending protocol BEND, allows users to borrow and lend tokens, just like Aave. According to on-chain data , Berachain has handled more than 500 million transactions since inception, with about 57 million taking place in the last 14 days. Berachain has also witnessed a surge in active addresses on its platform, rising from 945,000 on Dec 15 to about 3 million presently. The odds of Berachain launching an airdrop, according to Polymarket is at 90%, a figure up by 40% since the market was created. Users can bet on the ‘Yes’ option at $0.89, with the ‘No’ option currently at $0.10. The total volume of bets on the market is presently at $64,471. Linea ecosystem witness growth ahead of its airdrop Linea, on the other hand, is a layer-2 network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to supercharge the Ethereum network. It provides tough competition to other layer-2 rivals like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. According to on-chain data , Linea has handled about 241 million transactions, with around 241,000 coming in the last 14 days. Linea has a total value locked ( TVL ) of $383 million, with popular players like Mendi, ZeroLend, and Lynex in its ecosystem. Linea’s popularity can be attributed to its establishment by the popular crypto firm Consensys. Consensys raised about $450 million via firms like Softbank, ParaFi, and Third Point. The Linea airdrop will be monitored by its foundation, an organization that was created in November 2024. According to Polymarket, the odds of Berachain launching an airdrop in the first quarter of 2025 is around 88%, up 38% since the market was created. Users can bet on the ‘Yes’ option at $0.90, while they can also bet on the ‘No’ option at $0.13. The total volume of bets on the market is presently around $16,561. Notably, the increase in odds does not necessarily mean the projects will launch the airdrops in the first quarter of 2025. It means that users have seen signs that have pointed to these projects launching the airdrop, seeing that it is the bettors that shift the momentum with their picks. Meanwhile, other projects like Wormhole, Hamster Kombat, LayerZero, and Eigenlayer have launched their airdrops with mixed success. Eigenlayer, for example, has dropped 30% from its listing figure, while Wormhole dropped a disappointing 82%.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 23:03:00

This market recovery has gained massive attention from crypto enthusiasts, resulting in significant accumulation of ADA tokens. ADA Whales Accumulate 40M Tokens Recently, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that whales have accumulated over 40 million ADA tokens from exchanges in the past 48 hours. This substantial accumulation indicates that whales began accumulating after the altcoin breached the trendline and broke out from a consolidation zone on the daily timeframe. Whales bought over 40 million #Cardano $ADA in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/YMc1dxQzjd — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 The expert’s report reveals how whales are accumulating ADA and highlights an ideal buying opportunity for retail investors. It has also been observed that the asset witnessed an impressive 16% upside momentum following this purchase. Why ADA Appears Struggling? The notable upside momentum, coupled with current rumors about a healthcare crisis in China, might be the reason behind today’s price decline and ongoing correction. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $1.07 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.1% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has also been impacted, registering a drop of over 50%. This indicates lower participation and further reflects fear among traders and investors. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Despite all this activity at the international level, ADA appears bullish and poised to continue its upward momentum. According to expert technical analysis, the altcoin has already surged by an impressive 32% in the past three days and currently seems to be correcting itself for further gains. Source: Trading View ADA Price Prediction However, there is also a possibility that the market may extend ADA’s price correction for a few more days. Despite this, if the altcoin holds above the $1 mark, there is a strong chance it could soar by 25% to reach the $1.32 level in the coming days.

These incidents show the urgent need for better security, stricter rules, and more trust in digital assets. 2024 was a year for cryptocurrency, big security issues and scam projects have shown that the system needs improvement. According to SlowMist Hacked, there have been 410 security incidents reported in 2024, where huge losses account for $2.013 billion. According to SlowMist report , 2024’s losses, however, stand at 19.02% lower than in 2023, where a total of 464 incidents took place and left a loss of $2.486 billion. Major Security attack incidents of 2024 DeFi was the most vulnerable area with 82.68% of breaches. There were 339 DeFi cases, which resulted in a huge loss of $1.029 billion. This is 33.12% more than the 2023 version, which was $773 million. It shows how attractive decentralized finance has become for hackers due to weak security and flaws in smart contracts. The greatest loss was seen for Ethereum with $465 million loss. Binance Smart Chain, or BSC, followed second with the loss of $87.35 million. On May 31, some of the worst hacks occurred at the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin. There, hackers deceived users into helping them steal 4,502.9 BTC from the exchange’s official wallet by causing about $330 million in losses. It is the seventh largest hack in the history of cryptocurrencies and the largest since 2022. According to the FBI, United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, and the Japanese National Police Agency, North Korean hackers did this as part of an attack that came to be known as the Trader Traitor campaign. Another big hack involved the Indian exchange WazirX. There, a problem in the checks on multisig wallets meant more than $230 million lost. In February, hackers stole the private key of the PLA token smart contract on the PlayDapp blockchain gaming platform. With this move, they managed to mint 1.79 billion tokens with the attacker’s permission. After negotiations and an offer of a $1 million reward for white-hat hackers, the attackers were still free to create more tokens. The exchanges froze the tokens so they could not be sold in large quantities. It was a phishing email posing as a legitimate request from a partnership exchange. Around the same time, Turkey’s BtcTurk lost $90 million when hackers gained unauthorized access to its hot wallets in June, and Binance froze $5.3 million in stolen assets. Some of the biggest incidents were that of Singapore-based exchange BingX, which had reportedly suffered loss through unauthorized access to almost $45 million in September. Another was Radiant Capital in October with an estimated loss of about $50 million. Hedgey Finance is also in the list, losing about $44.7 million, and it’s because of input validation issues. Penpie lost almost $27.35 million from malicious smart contracts and flash loan attacks in the liquidity rewards. For this reason, there has to be an improvement in the security aspect for platforms. Rug pulls are where rogue teams advertise projects for cash and run off with it. Major Rug Pulls In 2024, fifty-eight cases of rug pulls happened, leading to a loss of $106 million. The largest rug pull in the zkSync system was $36.95 million. The most rug pulls occurred in the BSC system, at 28 in total. The most popular one was SHARPEI. It used images of Shar Pei dogs and celebrities to drive its price to $54 million. It was sold after this for $3.4 million, with a loss of 96% for the token. The nature of such incidents calls for proper regulation and necessary security measures over the fast-growing industry of cryptocurrency. Some proposals are for compulsory auditing of smart contracts, tightening control over KYC and AML, and also the provision of insurance pools from which an account can be withdrawn in the case of breach. Another tendency has been noted where countries begin taking collective steps to combat cyber threats at international levels. The SEC will probably play a pretty big role in the Trump administration because it’s an advocate for cryptocurrencies. As Congress is largely controlled by Republicans, it would probably focus on clear rules encouraging new ideas but at the same time protecting investors. Although there are so many problems, it is also ready to build a safer and stronger system. With the help of cryptocurrency support from the Trump administration to make security better with clearer rules, it could enter a new time of creativity in trust in digital assets. It all depends on how regulators and developers work with the community to solve problems that may arise in 2025.

This upward momentum has captured the attention of traders and investors, with many eyeing the possibility of a breakout that could propel SUI to fresh highs. The rally showcases strong bullish sentiment, driven by increasing demand and favorable technical setups. A decisive move beyond $4.98 might signal the beginning of a larger trend, positioning the token for further gains and strengthening its presence in the cryptocurrency market. As the price consolidates near this pivotal level, the focus shifts to whether the bulls can maintain their grip and push SUI into uncharted territory. With momentum on their side, the stage is set for what could be a defining moment in SUI’s price action. Analyzing SUI Path To $4.98 Milestone SUI’s rapid climb toward the $4.98 resistance level has captured the attention of traders, sparking anticipation for a potential breakthrough. The cryptocurrency has been riding a wave of bullish strength, with increasing demand and positive sentiment pushing the price higher. As it nears this critical level, the focus shifts to whether SUI can sustain its upward trajectory and break through the $4.98 barrier.

A successful break above $4.98 may unlock significant upside potential, with the possibility of reaching new all-time highs. Technical indicators like rising volume and momentum oscillators suggest that the rally may have more room to run. However, the path to $4.98 is not without its hurdles. Resistance at this price point could trigger a pullback or consolidation, leading to a test of support levels before another attempt to break through. Potential Scenarios: Breakout Or Consolidation? As SUI approaches the pivotal $4.98 resistance level, a successful breakout above this point might open the door to substantial upside potential. Breaking through this key level may lead to new highs and signify that the bullish momentum is strong enough to drive the price higher.

On the other hand, a failure to break through this key level might result in a consolidation phase, where SUI moves within a defined range as traders reassess the market conditions. During consolidation, the price may pull back to test lower support levels like the $4 mark before making another upside attempt.

He hinted at the numerous upgrades planned out for the Cardano-based light wallet platform this year. The Potential Lace Wallet Upgrades In his X post, Hoskinson suggested that Lace would make a debut on multiple platforms. This is in addition to the other new and exciting features that the wallet would welcome. Only a few days ago, the Cardano Founder voiced his optimism on the possibility for Lace Wallet to become a “powerhouse” this year. This was around the time when the wallet announced that its migration of users from Nami to Lace, was in “full swing. ” Apart from Lace, the Cardano ecosystem is also working on enhancing other solutions within the ecosystem. In November, Hoskinson engaged Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz in a technical discussion around Midnight and XRP . As a privacy-focused blockchain project, Midnight is designed to enhance secure data handling while also maintaining regulatory compliance. Hoskinson is very positive about Midnight’s potential to drive the evolution of privacy-centric Decentralized Applications (dApps) and further blockchain development. Their discussion suggests that there may be an impending collaboration between Cardano and Ripple in the near future. In the case of Voltaire, the Chang Hard Fork upgrade, which ushers this decentralized governance era launched in September. This launch put Cardano’s future in the hands of the community to govern. Consequently, Hoskinson confirmed that his last duty for the ecosystem “is to remove any roadblock for this transition.” He promised to prevent any bottleneck that will derail the plans this year. The Cardano Bitcoin DeFi Plans In addition to the different solutions designed by developers in its ecosystem, Cardano has plans to explore Bitcoin DeFi . There is currently a growing clamor for utility around the flagship cryptocurrency and recent partnerships between Cardano and BitcoinOS to create a bridge for both ecosystems. So far, the Cardano team has been saddled with the responsibility of coming up with a meaningful Bitcoin roadmap demo by May 2025. To achieve its set goals, Charles Hoskinson stated that Cardano will collaborate with Fair Gate Labs, a Multi Party Computational protocol. Notably, Cardano price is up 3.4% in 24 hours to $1.07 as investors remain hyped by its upgrades and ecosystem plans.

In a recent analysis, Marks suggested that the token could exceed $20 during the ongoing bull market cycle, a projection that represents a substantial leap from his earlier forecast of $2.28. $DOGE (Dogecoin)'s bull cycle performances, looking over the previous two, have consecutively become larger, and prices look to be well in the process of delivering yet another monumental bull showcase! Another, larger run bull this cycle could result in a more than $20 DOGE. pic.twitter.com/uNruqmBIBt — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 28, 2024 Marks attributes his prediction to historical trends, noting that the token’s performance during previous bull markets has demonstrated significant growth. In the 2017 market rally, DOGE’s value increased by 90 times, followed by an even more remarkable 306-fold increase in 2021. Based on this historical data and applying the Fibonacci expansion tool, Marks anticipates that the current rally, which began in late 2024, could see the token breaking past the $20 threshold. Skepticism Surrounding the $20 Target While Marks’ forecast has gained attention within the crypto community, it has also faced considerable skepticism. Critics highlight that for DOGE to reach $20, the cryptocurrency must achieve a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, given its current circulating supply of 147.44 billion coins. This valuation would surpass the combined market caps of leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, raising doubts about the feasibility of such a target. The digital asset currently holds a market capitalization of $47.8 billion, a far cry from the $3 trillion required to support the $20 price point. Detractors argue that the projection may not account for the practical and market-driven limitations that could hinder such an exponential rise in value. Data-Driven Optimism from Marks Despite these challenges, Marks has defended his forecast, maintaining that the historical data strongly supports his claim. He emphasizes that the token’s price movements in past bull cycles consistently surpassed the 1.618 Fibonacci level, and he expects this pattern to continue. According to Marks, dismissing the $20 target ignores the clear trend of growth seen in previous rallies.

For investors, Marks’s analysis underscores the speculative nature of meme coins like DOGE, which can experience extreme price fluctuations driven by market sentiment and historical trends. While the $20 projection remains highly contested, it reflects the optimism surrounding Dogecoin’s potential as the crypto market grows.

This Low-Cap Altcoin Could Rise 18,000x",https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-price-to-fall-below-60k-in-january-this-low-cap-altcoin-could-rise-18000x/,"The Bitcoin price has dropped 1.94% in the last 24 hours, reaching an intraday low of $93,592. This marks a 2.27% decline over the past two weeks, with Bitcoin’s market cap now at $1.85 trillion. Analysts warn that Bitcoin price may slump below $60,000 by January 20, during Donald Trump’s inauguration. On-chain data shows over 33,000 BTC, worth $3.23 billion, moved to exchanges, signaling bearish sentiment. Amid this uncertainty, a rising low-cap altcoin is gaining attention for its potential 18,000x growth signaling high ROI. Failure to Hold $95k Could Trigger a Steeper Bitcoin Price Decline Experts warn that Bitcoin price could face a major correction if it fails to hold the critical $95,000 support level. Market commentator Tone Vays suggests a drop below $95,000 could lead to a sharp decline, potentially reaching $73,000. Veteran trader Peter Brandt raised concerns that Bitcoin price might break down from a “broadening triangle,” a bearish signal that could potentially push it to $70,000. Analysts like Mark Newton and Benjamin Cohen also forecast that Bitcoin price could fall below $60,000 in the short term. Emerging Low Cap Altcoin Offers 18,000x Upside Amid Bitcoin Price Volatility PropiChain’s token presale is approaching $2 million, as this altcoin draws attention from investors who are eyeing a potential 18,000x surge. The key to this altcoin’s rising popularity lies in its AI-powered tools, designed to make real estate investment accessible to all, regardless of financial standing. PropiChain’s AI analytics analyzes vast datasets, including market trends and price shifts, to predict future real estate trends. By identifying upcoming opportunities, such as suburban areas seeing a surge in demand due to planned infrastructure projects, the altcoin empowers investors to purchase properties before prices soar. Using the AI automated valuation models (AVMs), this altcoin ensures precise property valuations based on historical sales data, market conditions, and property characteristics. These advanced tools help investors avoid overpaying or missing valuable opportunities. Moreover, this altcoin offers AI property filtering, allowing users to search for real estate based on ROI potential, market growth, and neighbourhood trends instead of just price and location. This feature caters to each investor’s specific financial goals, whether they seek consistent rental income or long-term capital appreciation. PropiChain has demonstrated its commitment to security and transparency by successfully passing a BlockAudit security audit, building investor confidence in the project’s integrity. PropiChain is also listed on CoinMarketCap , increasing its credibility and visibility within cryptocurrency. In the face of Bitcoin price volatility, this altcoin’s innovative AI solutions offer a promising alternative for those seeking reliable and scalable real estate investment opportunities backed by blockchain technology. PropiChain Token Presale Soars to New Heights As the Bitcoin price faces bearish signals, PropiChain’s token presale is gaining significant traction. Phase one raised over $1.2 million, and phase two has already exceeded $400,000. Early investors have capitalized on phase one, locking in profits. Phase two continues, offering tokens at a bargain price of $0.011, one of the lowest rates you will ever find. The price is set to rise to $0.032 by the end of the presale. With a limited supply and high demand, this altcoin is quickly becoming a sought-after asset. A $2,000 investment today could turn into over $36 million in profits by the end of the presale based on the 18,000x surge. It could continue to grow once the token officially launches. Investors can also take advantage of rewards through referrals and giveaways. This is an opportunity to tap into the future of real estate and avoid FOMO as the new year begins.

Ethereum Classic Set for a Rise & Dogecoin Could Reach $5,https://thecoinrise.com/inter-milan-partnership-boost-blockdags-push-to-600m-goal-ethereum-classic-set-for-a-rise-dogecoin-could-reach-5/,"As Bitcoin’s price climbs, the cryptocurrency market becomes optimistic, stirring excitement. Among the hot topics is the Dogecoin price prediction, hinting at a possible peak nearing $5. Discussions around the Ethereum Classic price also suggest a potential 8.53% rise by the end of 2024. In this buoyant market atmosphere, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction as a leading contender for the top crypto coins of 2025. The project is in the spotlight with its ongoing collaboration with Inter Milan, its current mainnet audit, and the widespread popularity of its X1 app miner. Its active community and strategic progress are driving it towards an ambitious $600 million presale target. Dogecoin Price Prediction Hints Surge Toward $5 Dogecoin’s recent market activities have garnered considerable interest in the crypto community. Following a consolidation period from November to mid-December, DOGE is now experiencing price movements that historically precede a significant distribution phase, potentially elevating the Dogecoin price to a new all-time high (ATH). This current trend draws strong comparisons to DOGE’s 2021 bull run. Looking ahead, predictions for 2025 suggest a robust bull market, possibly ushering in an altseason. According to Dogecoin price prediction, DOGE might climb past the $1 mark, potentially reaching between $4.5 and $5, reinforcing its status among the top crypto coins. Ethereum Classic Price Insights Ethereum Classic has faced challenges recently, with a 9.83% drop in its price last month. Despite these difficulties, the coin’s medium- and long-term outlooks are positive. It has appreciated by 30.07% over the past three months and shows a year-over-year increase of 30.17%. With the current market sentiment being somewhat bearish, the coin has proven its resilience by achieving 13 green days in the last 30 days and demonstrating a monthly volatility of 10.35%. These metrics emphasize Ethereum Classic’s potential for momentum, even in challenging market conditions. Analysts believe that the Ethereum Classic price might increase by 8.53%, reaching $30.55 by the end of December. BlockDAG’s Progress Toward a $600M Milestone with Inter Milan and X1 App BlockDAG is rapidly advancing towards its impressive $600 million presale goal, having already raised over $175.5 million and distributed 17.6 billion coins. Its standout performance is supported by key strategies including a partnership with Inter Milan , the nearing completion of its mainnet audit, and the X1 Mobile Miner app, which now boasts over 300,000 users. These developments have not only enhanced BDAG’s appeal but also positioned it as one of the top crypto coins of 2025. The presale, now at its 26th batch, has seen an exceptional 2240% ROI for early participants, with prices rising from $0.001 in the first batch to $0.0234 currently. A significant boost for BDAG’s global recognition comes from its collaboration with the prestigious Inter Milan soccer club. This partnership focuses on enhancing fan engagement through exclusive content, digital collectibles, and blockchain-based transactions, broadening BDAG’s reach to include both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s mainnet audit is approaching completion, preparing the project to offer secure, efficient, and scalable solutions. The X1 Mobile Miner app , facilitating the mining of up to 20 BDAG coins daily with minimal user effort, contributes to the project’s momentum. As the community grows and unique features continue to roll out, BlockDAG is on a clear path to achieving its $600 million target. For newcomers, the 26th batch offers BDAG at $0.0234, with an upcoming price increase to $0.0248 in the next batch. The Bottom Line With the cryptocurrency market buoyed by a stronger Bitcoin, optimism is palpable. Central topics include the Dogecoin price prediction, suggesting a potential high of $5, and the anticipated 8.53% rise in the Ethereum Classic price by year-end 2024. However, BlockDAG is capturing the most attention as it nears its $600 million crypto presale target. Its association with Inter Milan has greatly enhanced its worldwide profile, while its mainnet, currently in the final audit stage, is set to transform blockchain technology. Additionally, the widespread success of its X1 Mobile Miner app underscores the project’s accelerating progress. Clearly, BDAG is not just another crypto project; it’s a burgeoning movement poised to redefine the blockchain industry.

While traditional assets maintain their place, the dynamic crypto sector offers remarkable new prospects. Here we explore three hidden gems every investor should consider: DTX Exchange (DTX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogecoin (DOGE). The tokens stand out for their potential to deliver strong returns in crypto trading and for the innovation and utility they offer. Whether you want fairness in new crypto launches, meme coin momentum, or sustained bullish trends, these tokens are worth your consideration. Which one will dominate the 2025 crypto trading market? DTX Exchange: Where Fairness Meets Innovation for Huge Growth in Crypto Trading Imagine a token launch where fairness is not just a buzzword – it is the foundation! DTX Exchange , a new crypto project, is breaking the model of traditional token launches and ownerships that favor Venture Capital whales. Instead, its fair launch mechanism ensures everyone is on equal footing. Whether you are an experienced trader or a new investor, you are offered the same chance to participate in the presale. With incremental pricing, early investors are rewarded while avoiding the challenges of dilution or massive sell-offs in crypto trading. However, DTX Exchange is more than a fair launch mechanism. It is a technological powerhouse. Offering smooth access to stocks, forex, ETFs, and over 100,000 currency pairs, it is your all-in-one trading platform.

With live products like the VulcanX Testnet and Phoenix Wallet, DTX has already raised $11.4 million and attracted 300,000 users.

Pudgy Penguins Rallies as DTX Exchange Brings Real Utility to the Market Pudgy Penguins’ token gained 12% on January 2, 2025, hitting $0.40 before settling at $0.37. The PENGU rally aligns with a general bullish trend among Solana meme coins as the market rebounds. Market experts say PENGU could rally further to its all-time high of $0.55, marking a possible 50% gain. The market trading volume increased by 60% to $1.39 billion, supporting bullish momentum. Furthermore, PENGU’s open interest surged 20% to $222 million. Technical indicators, including the Awesome Oscillator, also indicate a continued upward momentum. DTX Exchange stands out with its fair launch mechanism, empowering all investors equally while offering an advanced platform with 100,000 TPS, 1000x leverage, and a profit-sharing rebate program. Unlike PENGU’s meme coin rally, DTX provides real utility and community governance. PENGU was valued at $0.0365 on January 3, up 2.42% in the past week. Dogecoin Breaks Out 7.9%: DTX Exchange Delivers Real Value Beyond Speculation Dogecoin gained 7.9% on January 2, 2025, to trade at $0.342 after breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. This technical formation indicates potential bullish momentum. The breakout, accompanied by a high trading volume of $2.99 billion on the same day, suggested the resolution of accumulated market pressure. Analysts forecast that DOGE might target the crucial $0.10 resistance level, with a successful break paving the way for new local highs. The price action indicates there is a clear uptrend, dominated by higher highs, hinting at sustained bullish sentiment in the market. DTX Exchange offers fairness through its unique launch mechanism, providing equal opportunities for all investors. Unlike Dogecoin’s speculative rally, DTX delivers a cutting-edge platform with 100,000 TPS, 1000x leverage, and strong community governance, ensuring long-term growth and real value. DOGE was valued at $0.341 on January 3, up 8.26% in the past week. Explore New Crypto Opportunities: DTX Exchange Outpaces PENGU and DOGE As 2025 unfolds, DTX Exchange (DTX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogecoin (DOGE) offer exciting opportunities for investors seeking high potential in the crypto trading market. Whether it’s DTX’s fair launch model and innovative platform, PENGU’s meme coin momentum, or DOGE’s sustained bullish sentiment, these assets offer unique advantages. Exploring these hidden gems now could lead to significant rewards in the cryptocurrency space. Nonetheless, DTX Exchange is the best investment due to its massive growth potential. At just $0.14 during Stage 7 of the public presale, DTX tokens are a great opportunity, with a listing price set at $0.20, a 42.86% profit.

Stellar, valued at $0.43, has analysts predicting a surge to $1.29 by 2025, driven by its role in cross-border payments and blockchain efficiency. Meanwhile, Litecoin has crossed the $100 threshold, bolstered by its capped supply and faster transaction times. However, amidst these established players, Web3Bay is quietly reshaping the decentralized e-commerce sector. Its 3BAY token, currently in presale, offers users governance rights and discounts, carving a distinct niche and providing an intriguing alternative in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Stellar (XLM): Price Predictions for 2025 and 2030 Stellar (XLM), valued at around $0.43, shows potential for significant growth. Specifically, analysts forecast a rise to $0.72 by early 2025, marking a 68% increase. Furthermore, by the end of 2025, XLM could reach $1.29 if market conditions remain favorable. Meanwhile, projections for 2030 predict a peak price of $6.19, with an average hovering near $4.60. These estimates are informed by a combination of technical indicators, market sentiment, and Stellar’s expanding use cases in cross-border payments and blockchain technology. In terms of technical analysis, current data reveals a 50-day moving average of $0.38 and a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 58.22, suggesting bullish momentum. Moreover, Stellar’s ecosystem continues to attract attention due to its efficiency and scalability, supporting its long-term growth potential. However, while optimism surrounds these predictions, the speculative nature of cryptocurrency markets necessitates a cautious approach, as external factors and market volatility could significantly influence XLM’s trajectory. Litecoin Surpasses $100 as Crypto Markets Regain Momentum Litecoin (LTC) has surged past $100, reflecting renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency market. More specifically, trading at $101.96, the asset has gained 1.28% in the past 24 hours, with a significant 22.73% rise in trading volume to $465.51 million. Additionally, its market capitalization now stands at $7.68 billion, emphasizing its continued market relevance. Often called “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin has maintained a pivotal role due to its faster transaction times and capped supply of 84 million coins. Currently, 75.36 million LTC are in circulation, enhancing its scarcity and appeal. Furthermore, its consistent performance through market cycles underscores its resilience and reliability as an investment. On the technological front, advancements have strengthened Litecoin’s scalability and privacy features, furthering its adoption. As a result, this renewed momentum is drawing investor attention as the cryptocurrency market shows signs of recovery. Thus, Litecoin’s consistent liquidity and robust performance highlight its enduring presence in the evolving digital asset ecosystem. Web3Bay Presale: Token Utility, Future Expansion, and Benefits for Early Adopters The Web3Bay presale introduces the 3BAY token, designed to redefine decentralized e-commerce. Notably, holding 3BAY tokens provides users with exclusive benefits, including transaction discounts, platform perks, and governance rights. Furthermore, token holders gain a voice in crucial decisions about the platform’s future, ensuring a community-driven ecosystem. Consequently, these utilities enhance user engagement and incentivize long-term participation, making 3BAY a unique asset in the crypto space. Looking ahead, Web3Bay’s ambitious roadmap promises transformative features aimed at reshaping online commerce. Specifically, future integrations include an NFT marketplace, enabling users to trade digital assets seamlessly. Additionally, plans for decentralized finance (DeFi) options will introduce staking and yield farming, providing additional earning opportunities. Moreover, Web3Bay aims to achieve cross-chain interoperability, connecting with major blockchain networks to ensure seamless transactions and scalability. Collectively, these innovations position Web3Bay as a forward-thinking project in the decentralized commerce domain. Currently, the presale is in stage 3, with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.0039675. Having raised over $300,000, the presale demonstrates strong investor confidence and interest in the platform’s potential. Furthermore, each subsequent stage includes a 15% price increase, offering early investors a chance to maximize returns before the token’s price escalates further. Therefore, joining at this stage secures a position in a pioneering project combining e-commerce with blockchain technology, while also capitalizing on the potential for substantial financial growth. Web3Bay offers a rare opportunity to participate in shaping the future of decentralized shopping. Final Call Stellar and Litecoin continue to demonstrate their potential as reliable assets, with promising price predictions fueled by solid use cases and market confidence. However, as these established cryptocurrencies aim to maintain their momentum, Web3Bay stands out by addressing a distinct sector: decentralized e-commerce. With its presale gaining traction and a roadmap rich in features like NFTs and DeFi integration, Web3Bay not only complements the broader crypto space but also introduces practical utility for users.

The crypto industry backs Deaton, citing stifled innovation and unfair treatment. Deaton emphasizes transparency and fair regulations for U.S. crypto growth. Attorney John Deaton, an ardent XRP holders’ advocate and a lawyer who was in direct confrontation with the SEC, presented a petition seeking a federal investigation into Operation ChokePoint 2.0, which has been reported to target cryptocurrency activity throughout the United States. John Deaton’s Fight Against Operation ChokePoint 2.0 He is willing to conduct the probe for free because, he claims, the people of America are entitled to more scrutiny and openness amid the rising intrusion of the government in the financial world. A discovery order revealed a massive coordinated effort to restrict cryptocurrency-related services. Coinbase was able to successfully gain unredacted documents from the FDIC. The exchange claims that between 2022 and 2023, the FDIC sent at least 25 letters to different banks, demanding that they either stop or scale back their services related to Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions, blockchain settlement networks, and tokenized deposit products. According to an industry expert, Nic Carter, the measures have suppressed financial innovation, thus locking out the emergence of products like Bitcoin-reward debit cards and loans collateralized by Bitcoin. He continued by saying that the actions by the FDIC were anti-consumer and anti-innovation as they halted the United States from gaining any ground in financial technology. Deaton contributes his voice in the discussion by claiming that he is afraid that Operation ChokePoint 2.0 will be very destructive. He argues that this is not just a matter of cryptocurrency but an outright attack on the free market system in America. This kind of move creates a very bad precedent as it limits financial infrastructure for legitimate businesses. Deaton further argued that unelected bureaucrats should not have the authority to determine who wins and who loses in the marketplace. He said such policies truly undermine America’s ability to remain a leading world power in innovation and economics. Custodia Bank was among the worst-hit institutions. They could not access the infrastructures of banking. However, the Custodia case was only a part of the bigger issues related to businesses that were seeking innovation in the crypto space. Calls for Accountability and Crypto-Friendly Regulations As Deaton notes, the effects of Operation ChokePoint 2.0 go far beyond immediate impacts on companies and ripple into their ability to succeed and innovate overall within the industry. He described these actions as a direct assault on the foundational principles of free market capitalism and transparency. The crypto industry has welcomed Deaton’s call for an investigation with open arms. In his appeals to Congress, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, urged earnestly that hearings be held regarding the actions of the FDIC. Nic Carter praised Coinbase’s choice to unveil the documents and advocated for prompt measures to tear down the systematic barriers that have been erected against the industry. The change in administration now to be manned by President-elect Donald Trump has also brought about a better regulatory environment. There is also a new “Crypto Czar” David Sacks who promised to take on the ChokePoint agenda, as well as Rep. French Hill who endorses reforms on fair and balanced crypto regulations. Many citizens have voiced optimism for future industry prospects, yet the sector still faces significant challenges. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has clearly stated that the Fed plans to make no investment in Bitcoin or similar initiatives. In addition, critics claim one needs to attain regulatory clarity while making sure that fair treatment of digital assets is ensured before additional barriers inhibit innovation. After all, Deaton himself recalled in a speech a call for accountability in investing which encouraged a balanced approach between innovation and investor protection. As they await the response from the new administration, the efforts of Deaton shine bright light on what is urgently needed concerning Operation ChokePoint 2.0. This interested industry people that one who took significant steps toward a long-held aspiration: a steadfast movement toward a fair and transparent system that would promote growth and innovation in the realm of digital assets. Based on the analysis of the FDIC documents and the response from the industry, it is clear that it is necessary to address these issues in a manner that the United States remains ahead of the rest of the world in the financial sphere.

Lenders are now witnessing a 14-year high in credit card defaults, reports the Financial Times. The bad credit forced lenders to collectively write off a whopping $46 billion in loans that are considered seriously delinquent in the first nine months of 2024. Based on data compiled from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the US banking industry information platform BankRegData, the figure represents a 50% year-over-year increase. According to BankRegData, Capital One customers are facing the highest credit card delinquencies, with a total delinquent amount of $7.68 billion, representing 5.36% of their credit card loans. Next is Citibank with $4.79 billion (2.93%) in delinquencies, followed by Synchrony Bank at $4.50 billion (5.02%), JPMorgan Chase at $4.10 billion (2.16%), Discover Bank at $3.9 billion (3.93%) and Bank of America at $2.56 billion (2.54%). The rapid rise in credit card loan defaults is a sign of strained consumer finances after years of high inflation and the subsequent rise in interest rates. Mark Zandi, head of Moody’s Analytics, tells FT that consumer spending power has clearly diminished in most households. “High-income households are fine, but the bottom third of US consumers are tapped out. Their savings rate right now is zero.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 00:26:00

In a recent tweet, Jones emphasized the importance of early investments and urged individuals to seize the opportunity before the token’s value increases further. She used her personal experience to illustrate the asset’s growth trajectory and its potential for long-term investors. Jones revealed that her initial investment of $100 in XRP occurred at a time when the token was priced at approximately $0.25. This allowed her to acquire 400 tokens. According to Jones, the asset last traded at that price range in January 2021, around four years ago. Since then, it has reached a peak value of $2.9 and currently trades at $2.37, reflecting a significant 275% increase over the past year. The Future Value of $100 in Investments Jones highlighted the dwindling purchasing power of $100 to XRP as the asset’s value has risen. She pointed out that the same $100 investment now would buy fewer than 50 XRP tokens. Looking ahead, she predicted that as the price continues to climb, $100 could eventually purchase only one XRP token. This projection underscores her belief that the asset is poised for substantial price growth in years to come, potentially reaching $100. Jones urged the crypto community to consider investing in XRP sooner rather than later, emphasizing the benefits of a patient, long-term investment strategy. “Don’t wait to invest, invest and wait,” she advised, adding that success in cryptocurrency often lies in holding investments over time rather than attempting to time the market. However, she clarified that her statements are personal opinions and do not constitute financial advice. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reactions From the Cryptocurrency Community Linda Jones’s prediction raised considerable discussion among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, with several agreeing on the importance of patience in achieving investment success. Rob Cunningham, host of KUWL.show, echoed Jones’s sentiments, stating that while money cannot buy patience, exercising patience in the market can lead to significant rewards. Cunningham highlighted that early investors who remain committed to their investments are often well-positioned to benefit from future growth. Other members of the crypto community also shared their experiences. An X user, Mr. Hillard, recalled his journey, noting that his initial $100 investment in the token allowed him to acquire 769 tokens. He described his satisfaction with the decision, attributing his success to thorough research and confidence in the asset’s potential. Hillard emphasized that taking informed risks early can lead to meaningful gains over time. Jones’s optimistic projection reflects her confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. While skepticism and uncertainty remain within the cryptocurrency market, her call for early investment and patience resonates with many investors.

Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Martinez identifies how Bitcoin ( BTC ) could confirm its next breakout. “BTC remains at a critical point. This might just be a retest of the 50-day MA (moving average) before a potential move lower.

According to an analyst, Litecoin’s current technical setup points to strong potential for a parabolic breakout, with the $130 price mark emerging as a critical resistance zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details Narrow Bollinger Bands To Trigger Litecoin Breakout Prominent crypto analyst Tony Severino shared a price chart on X (formerly Twitter) showing Litecoin’s price action on a bi-monthly time frame, applying Bollinger Bands as a technical indicator to measure a cryptocurrency’s price volatility. The Bollinger Bands examine market volatility by plotting an upper and lower band around a Moving Average (MA), which acts as a basis line. In Litecoin’s case, Severino has indicated that the cryptocurrency’s 2M Bollinger Band width is extremely narrow, underscoring a lack of or significantly decreased volatility. Historically, Bollinger Bands are known to expand during periods of high volatility and tighten at low volatility. Severino’s Litecoin chart displays the upper Bollinger Band marked by the red line, the basis line by a blue line, and the lower band highlighted in the green area. The analyst disclosed that Litecoin’s candlesticks are currently positioned above the basis line at $83.3, indicating potential for bullish momentum. If the price of Litecoin continues upwards and crosses the upper Bollinger band at approximately $130, Severino predicts that it could trigger heightened volatility and an explosive price breakout. Based on historical trends, an extremely narrow Bollinger Band often indicates a potential for a bullish trend reversal after a period of consolidation. Severino’s analysis has pinpointed the upper BB at $130 as a crucial resistance area for Litecoin. A sustained break above this level on a high timeframe could pave the way for more gains, potentially pushing Litecoin significantly above its current market value of around $111.5. According to CoinMarketCap, Litecoin has recorded modest gains, increasing by 6.14% in the past 24 hours. Over the past week, the prominent cryptocurrency has also experienced a higher increase of about 11.7% to its current level. To reach the critical resistance area at $130, Litecoin is required to rise by approximately 18% from its market price. Litecoin Rally Predicted, Targets 38% Upside According to crypto analyst Mike on X, Litecoin is preparing for a significant breakout to a new price high. He forecasts that the cryptocurrency will record a 38% price rally from the breakout point at $106 to reach a fresh bullish target of $146.67. Looking at the analyst’s price chart, Litecoin appears to have broken the $102 resistance level and is approaching its next significant resistance at $122.77. The chart also highlights horizontal lines indicating critical resistance areas for Litecoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Critical Support Amid Long-Term Holder Selling Pressure—Analyst Mike has pinpointed a key support zone at $99.91 that could act as a safety net for Litecoin during a downtrend.

One name making waves in the crypto world is PropiChain , a project that promises a massive 12,000% return. Offering a blend of real-world utility and innovation, PropiChain is quickly becoming the go-to choice for traders looking to diversify and maximize gains. Let’s dive into why it is stealing the spotlight and leaving meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in its wake. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Losing Their Spark? For years, Dogecoin was the poster child for community-driven cryptocurrencies, powered by memes and viral trends. But even with its cult-like following, the coin is starting to show cracks. The Dogecoin price has seen sharp declines recently, highlighting its inherent volatility and limited clear use cases. While some loyalists remain hopeful, others are growing impatient with its inability to break free from its meme status. Similarly, Shiba Inu , touted as a “Dogecoin killer,” has tried to prove its worth through initiatives like Shibarium and token burns. While these efforts have created buzz, they haven’t resolved the coin’s primary issues: an oversaturated token supply and limited real-world applications. Despite its innovative moves, Shiba Inu continues to struggle with attracting long-term investors. This has left traders wondering if meme coins are really worth their time or if they should shift their focus to projects like PropiChain , which combine innovation and practicality. PropiChain: A Fresh Alternative to Meme Coins Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PropiChain is not built on hype alone. It’s designed to offer tangible value through cutting-edge features that redefine how people interact with cryptocurrency and investments. Here’s what makes PropiChain stand out: Fractional Ownership One of PropiChain’s standout features is its approach to real estate investment. Instead of needing enormous capital to purchase properties, investors can buy fractional ownership of high-value assets. This model democratizes access to the real estate market, opening the doors for small-scale investors to earn from a market previously restricted to the elite. AI-Powered Insights PropiChain’s AI tools are here to help with navigating real estate investments. From property appraisals to market trend analysis, these tools empower investors to make smarter decisions. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rely on social media buzz to drive value, PropiChain offers real utility, making it a more attractive option for serious investors. Metaverse Real Estate The metaverse might just be the future of how we live, work, and play. PropiChain taps into this space by enabling users to invest in virtual properties. Think of it as owning a piece of the next big digital world. As the metaverse grows, so will the value of PropiChain’s ecosystem, making it a unique blend of physical and digital investment opportunities. With features like these, PropiChain is quickly gaining traction as a crypto with real potential. What’s the Opportunity for Investors? PropiChain is in its second presale stage with tokens currently priced at just $0.011. This presents the perfect entry point as prices are set to increase in the next stages. Let’s put it into perspective: an investment of $500 today could potentially grow to $60,000 if PropiChain delivers on its projected 12,000% return. And with nearly $2M already raised, it’s clear that investors are taking notice. The platform’s successful listing on CoinMarketCap and completion of a rigorous security audit only add to its credibility. PropiChain is a well-structured, secure project that’s ready to make waves in the market. Conclusion The days of relying solely on meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu for quick profits may be numbered. While they’ve brought excitement and fun to the crypto world, their limited utility is becoming increasingly evident. PropiChain , on the other hand, offers a refreshing alternative; combining innovation, security, and real-world applications. For investors looking for a project with both short-term and long-term potential, PropiChain stands out as a clear choice. With the presale heating up and tokens selling fast, now is the time to act.

Insights from Crypto Experts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, seems to be gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts as it has formed a bullish price action pattern on its daily time frame. Amid this bullish outlook, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (formerly Twitter) where they made a bold prediction that XRP could reach $11 in the coming days. $XRP is still consolidating within the pennant of a massive bull pennant pattern. Until the $2.73 resistance is broken, a pullback to $2.05 remains possible before a potential breakout to $11! pic.twitter.com/ET39FJMtAc — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 Expert Bold Prediction for XRP In a post on X, the expert noted that XRP is currently consolidating within a bullish pennant price action pattern, which appears similar to a flag and pole pattern on the daily time frame. Amid this consolidation, the price seems to be be stuck in a narrow range and is facing resistance at the $2.73 mark. The expert highlighted that before XRP breaches this resistance level, there is a strong possibility it could pull back to the $2.05 mark. Additionally, if the XRP price further breaches the resistance level and closes a daily candle above the $2.73 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar significantly to reach the $11 level in the future. Besides this bold prediction, XRP is currently trading near $2.42 and has experienced a price decline of 1.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 25%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors amid the bullish outlook. XRP Price Prediction and Upcoming Levels However, CoinPedia’s technical analysis suggests that XRP has already broken out from a bullish flag and pole price action pattern, but is currently retesting the breakout level of $2.40. Based on the recent price action, if the asset holds this level and closes a daily candle above it, it could signal further bullish momentum.

Crypto analyst Javon Marks has identified key indicators that suggest that the asset is set for a substantial rally in the coming months. As of now, the token is trading at $0.00002242, reflecting a 7.9% increase in the last 24 hours. Marks has pointed out that the token recently surpassed a major resistance trendline that had been holding back its price growth. Following this breakout, SHIB reached a seven-month high of $0.00003329 earlier in December. However, the rally was followed by a corrective phase, during which the asset retraced most of its gains. This correction saw the token revisit lows around $0.0000186, erasing much of its earlier progress. Despite this pullback, Marks noted that the asset successfully retested its breakout level as a new support zone. Since then, it has rebounded and is currently consolidating in the $0.000022 range. Marks considers this development a strong bullish signal, emphasizing that the asset’s ability to hold above the breakout level sets the stage for continued upward movement. Price Projections Javon Marks has set an optimistic price target of $0.000081 for Shiba Inu, which would represent a more than 270% increase from its current trading levels. This price point marks a critical area where SHIB faced significant resistance during its previous market cycle. Marks has consistently identified $0.000081 as a key target for the token throughout 2024 and maintains confidence that the token will eventually reclaim this level. In addition to this projection, he has suggested that Shiba Inu could reach as high as $0.000155 during the current bull market. This higher target represents an unprecedented price level for the token, signaling the potential for significant gains if market conditions remain favorable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hidden Bullish Divergence One of the factors supporting the bullish outlook for the digital asset is the presence of hidden bullish divergence on its price chart. This phenomenon occurs when the asset’s price forms higher lows while momentum indicators display lower lows, indicating underlying strength and potential for further upward movement. Marks has highlighted this divergence as a critical component of Shiba Inu’s bullish narrative. Combined with the asset’s ability to maintain its position above the key breakout level, this divergence reinforces the case for continued price growth. With Shiba Inu holding above crucial support levels and displaying robust bullish signals, analysts are optimistic about its near-term performance. Marks’s target of $0.000081 reflects significant growth potential, while his higher projection of $0.000155 suggests even greater opportunities for long-term investors.

Originally created in 2016 by blockchain entrepreneur Ned Scott and BitShares founder Dan Larimer, Steem Dollars ( SBD ) were designed to provide stability in the volatile world of cryptocurrency while powering a unique ecosystem of social media and content creation. Its market cap currently hovers just above $47.5 million. Source: CoinGecko The coin’s recent rally highlights renewed interest in the Steem ecosystem, where Steem Dollars play a central role. Pegged to the U.S. dollar, the coin offers a relatively stable cryptocurrency option — integral to the platform’s reward system. Additionally, Steem – like most cryptocurrencies – can also be used to make digital peer-to-peer payments. Users earn SBD for publishing and curating content on platforms like Steemit, a New York-based startup that touts itself as a decentralized alternative to traditional social media networks. You might also like: NFT sales drop to $132m, Pudgy Penguins loses steam Why Steem Dollars matter SBD provides liquidity for transactions within the Steem blockchain and can be used to earn interest as part of a decentralized savings account. It is also convertible to other cryptocurrencies or fiat. Additionally, Steem Dollars can be traded for STEEM tokens or Steem Power, the latter increasing influence and voting weight on the platform. The sharp price increase, however, raises questions about its stability. While the token is intended to maintain a value close to 1 USD, its market-driven price has occasionally deviated from this peg. The current surge might reflect speculative trading rather than organic growth in the ecosystem, but it nonetheless underscores the enduring relevance of Steem Dollars in the blockchain space. Looking ahead As SBD continues to climb, analysts and community members will be watching closely to see if this momentum translates into lasting growth for the Steem ecosystem. Whether the surge is a fleeting speculative event or the start of a broader renaissance, one thing is clear: Steem Dollars are once again making waves in the cryptocurrency world. Several platforms integrate stablecoins into reward ecosystems to incentivize user participation and provide stability. Examples include Hive Dollar on the Hive blockchain, offering rewards for content creators, and DAI from MakerDAO, widely used in DeFi for staking and liquidity rewards. Binance USD ( BUSD ) and USDC are commonly utilized in platforms like PancakeSwap and PoolTogether for similar purposes. Curve Finance employs stablecoins like DAI and USDT in liquidity pools, while sUSD from Synthetix powers synthetic asset trading and staking rewards. Social media platforms like Roll and Rally also incorporate stablecoins to reward creators. These ecosystems highlight the versatility of stablecoins in reducing volatility and fostering user engagement.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 01:55:00

Concurrently, the Dogecoin price forecast has attracted considerable attention due to a 40% increase in whale transaction activity. The standout event, however, is BlockDAG’s $1M New Year’s raffle. This compelling promotion has surged BDAG’s presale to an impressive $175.5 million, with $5 million gathered within just 24 hours. The raffle offers three unique prizes alongside a 200% BDAG bonus, igniting enthusiasm across the crypto community as participants hurry to claim their shares before upcoming exchange listings. With initial participants achieving returns of 2,240%, BlockDAG (BDAG) is rapidly emerging as the top crypto to buy at the moment. Future Prospects for Dogecoin: What Lies Ahead? Recent increases in whale transactions have ignited significant interest in the Dogecoin price forecast, with a notable uptick in trading suggesting a potential rise. Observers have recorded a 40% increase in large transactions within Dogecoin’s network, pushing transaction volumes above $23 billion in a single day. The anticipation around Dogecoin’s price forecast grows when considering its historical performance, which has seen significant spikes in previous cycles, such as a 90-fold increase in 2017 and a 306-fold increase in 2021. Although these historical data points suggest potential for growth, caution is advised. The future trajectory of Dogecoin’s price is poised to potentially include unexpected developments, warranting both interest and cautious scrutiny. Chainlink Whales Demonstrate Market Confidence Chainlink whales have invested approximately $76.9 million in purchasing 3.58 million LINK tokens over three days, showcasing their belief in LINK’s long-term viability despite recent price declines. This aggressive buying indicates their anticipation of potential recovery and enduring robustness in LINK’s future. As the price of Chainlink stabilizes around $21.50, these significant participants continue to accumulate LINK at reduced prices, demonstrating ongoing confidence even as the broader market undergoes corrections. Their proactive acquisitions underscore a bullish perspective on LINK’s prospects as we progress towards 2025. BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle Sparks Major Daily Gains BlockDAG, a key player in the cryptocurrency arena, is currently the center of attention with its New Year raffle, offering a chance to win up to $1 million in USDT. The raffle is structured with three ticket types—Bronze, Silver, and Gold—ranging from $250 to $1000 each. Every ticket comes with a 200% BDAG bonus, positioning it as an attractive choice for those searching for the top crypto to buy. The reaction to this raffle has been extraordinary. Enthusiasts have poured in, contributing $5 million overnight and elevating the presale to a notable $175.5 million. With just one day remaining for entry, the anticipation is tangible, drawing both individual participants and major figures eager to capitalize on this rare chance. Beyond the raffle, early participants have enjoyed a return of 2,240%, with BDAG’s value increasing from $0.001 to $0.0234. Analysts anticipate even greater returns in the future. This progress is sparking discussions about BDAG’s prospects once it is available on major exchanges. This event represents more than a mere opportunity to win substantial sums; it’s a gateway to becoming part of an expanding ecosystem set for significant advancements. With substantial daily contributions from whales, the opportunity to join this rapidly developing venture is narrowing. Identifying the Next Big Crypto Opportunity Chainlink and Dogecoin are commanding the spotlight in the crypto market for solid reasons. Chainlink whales are placing substantial bets on LINK’s hopeful rebound, while the Dogecoin price forecast is gaining momentum as transactions driven by whales increase. Each of these cryptocurrencies provides distinct prospects, capturing the interest of veteran traders and new enthusiasts alike, all keen to see what unfolds next. Yet, BlockDAG steals the show with its $1M New Year’s raffle and unprecedented presale achievements. Having amassed $175.5 million and offered a 200% BDAG bonus, it is quickly becoming the top crypto to buy . As the chance to participate dwindles, BlockDAG’s ongoing success points to a promising future, distinguishing it as a key contender in the competitive crypto market.

SUI, Solana, and Web3Bay are prime examples, each bringing distinct advantages and massive growth prospects for 2025. SUI has been making news with its notable price trends and market achievements, while Solana’s unmatched network capabilities and rising institutional interest suggest a standout year ahead. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is innovating in the e-commerce sector with its decentralized, community-driven platform. Let’s delve into why these three projects are transforming their sectors and why they might be the best investments to watch right now. SUI Price: Is it Ready to Reach $4.96? SUI has been drawing attention in the crypto sphere with its notable performance despite a recent 4.89% drop in the last 24 hours. The token has seen a significant 24.75% increase this month, indicating strong bullish momentum. Currently, SUI is trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern, hinting at a potential breakout with a target price of $4.96. Key support levels at $3.926 and the triangle’s lower boundary might provide the boost needed for further price increases. Recent on-chain data showing $26 million in SUI withdrawals from exchanges suggests a decrease in selling pressure as traders hold on for the long haul. Although it faces challenges like reduced Open Interest and trading volume, SUI’s surpassing of Shiba Inu in market cap underlines its expanding market presence. Keep an eye on SUI’s upward movement, as it could become a strong contender. Solana’s 2025 Surge: Will It Hit $330? Solana is gaining momentum as we enter 2025 with positive market signals. Despite past challenges in breaking the $160 mark, Solana has recently surged past $200, setting an optimistic outlook for the year. Projections show SOL could climb to between $274 and $330, supported by its fast transactions and efficient network relative to competitors like Ethereum. Growing institutional interest is evident as applications for a Solana ETF by major entities like Grayscale and VanEck are pending SEC approval. If greenlit, these ETFs could significantly elevate Solana’s market position by broadening its investor base. With robust on-chain data indicating a strong holding pattern among investors and ongoing market consolidation, Solana’s prospects make it an exciting watch for 2025. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce Through Blockchain Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by creating a decentralized, transparent, and efficient marketplace. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that involve intermediaries and high fees, Web3Bay uses blockchain technology to eliminate these barriers, ensuring secure and cost-effective transactions and giving users full control over their data. Currently, Web3Bay is in presale stage 3 with $0.0039675 per token, with over $303,849 already raised. So far, 90 million tokens have been sold, reflecting strong investor demand as the project gains momentum. Web3Bay’s presale spans 28 stages, with a planned 15% price increase at each stage, culminating in a final price of $0.1959. Early backers stand to gain returns of up to 6,430% , making 3BAY a promising opportunity within the evolving Web3 landscape. This not only sets Web3Bay apart but also makes it highly practical. The platform accepts both cryptocurrency and standard payment methods like PayPal, broadening its accessibility. Future plans to incorporate NFTs and DeFi elements aim to establish a comprehensive decentralized trading platform. Whether you’re a merchant aiming for worldwide exposure or an investor seeking a notable altcoin with real-world applications, Web3Bay’s innovative features and potential for significant returns make it a leading choice in the burgeoning decentralized market. Final Remarks Web3Bay, SUI, and Solana epitomize the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation, each with its potential to disrupt. SUI’s positive price direction and strong market stance suggest a bullish future, while Solana’s operational efficiency and increasing institutional focus position it for significant growth. Web3Bay, with its novel e-commerce model and solid presale strategy, is set to transform how we shop online. Together, these projects highlight the varied opportunities within the crypto sphere. Whether you’re drawn to technical innovation, financial growth, or ground-breaking applications, these three cryptos are paving the way for the future.

The token’s trading price has also surged, with analysts pointing to the recent network unlocking event, which saw the addition of 82 million SUI tokens, about 0.82% of the cumulative token supply, The SUI token sees a remarkable start to 2025 The SUI token’s value has increased by over 1312% since its lowest price level in 2023 and by 25% in the last seven days. Additionally, its market cap is now over $15.2 billion, edging out TON and Chainlink, and it is now closely approaching the $16 billion mark. Aside from its market cap, its 24-hour trading volume is also at its peak at $2.6 billion, while the token trades at $5.34, more than an 8% uptick in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, its open interest has also grown over 37% to $1.22 billion, while its total value locked stands at $2.039 billion . SUI’s network token unlocking, heightened demand, and collaborations have helped push its trading price SUI’s price rally in the last few days coincides with the network’s token unlocking, suggesting the release helped elevate trading prices. On January 1, 2025, the SUI network released roughly 82 million tokens, 0.82% of its total token supply. Moreover, the token’s increased prices could be attributed to its bulked-up demand, even with its surging trading volume close to $ 3 billion. The Sui network has also partnered with multiple firms and technologies, raising investor interest. For starters, the network is currently working with Ant Digital Technologies to expedite the adoption of real-world assets in Web3, marking the debut of tokenized assets on the platform. It is also collaborating with Wall Street companies VanEck, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton, boosting investor confidence in the L1 blockchain. The network’s recent integrations are also doing fairly well, with Deepbook V3, the network’s proprietary on-chain order, recording over $1 billion in trading volume and its DEEP token climbing to a market valuation of more than $375 million.

Adding to the excitement, a top market expert recently shared a bullish forecast for Ripple’s native crypto, predicting a potential surge to $11. However, despite the positive long-term outlook, the expert said that the crypto could witness a pullback before the strong rally. Top Expert Predicts XRP Price Rally To $11 As XRP price recorded a robust rally recently, market experts remained positive on the future trajectory of the coin. For context, crypto market expert Ali Martinez recently shared a price chart highlighting the key levels for Ripple’s native crypto. He has shared a key resistance level that the crypto should break to avoid the bearish momentum ahead. For context, the expert said that the crypto’s price action remains in focus as it consolidates within a bullish pennant pattern. In addition, he said that crypto could risk falling to $2.05 ahead “until the $2.73 resistance is broken.” However, despite the warning on the short-term performance, the analyst noted that the crypto could rally to $11 after the “pullback.” Source: Ali Martinez, X In other words, this analysis suggests that while the long-term outlook is optimistic, traders should prepare for potential short-term volatility. Historically, bull pennant patterns indicate accumulation phases, followed by significant price moves. XRP’s current technical setup aligns with this, signaling a possible retracement before achieving new highs. Meanwhile, the crypto market’s growing bullish sentiment adds further momentum to XRP. Notably, this projection reflects both the token’s strong fundamentals and renewed investor confidence in the broader crypto market. A Closer Look Into Ripple’s Native Crypto & Its Future Prospects The warning over the short-term pullback in XRP price also aligns with the current market sentiment as the US SEC’s deadline to file the opening brief in the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit is approaching. Notably, a flurry of experts believes that SEC Chair Gary Gensler would file the opening brief before leaving his chair later this month. This development, if happens, could impact the price trajectory of the token. However, despite that, the market sentiment remained high over the long-term scenario for XRP. For context, in a recent X post, a pro-XRP lawyer recently commented on the potential conclusion timeline of the ongoing XRP lawsuit. On the other hand, the anticipation over positive crypto developments under Donald Trump’s presidency and crypto-friendly SEC Chair Paul Atkins has further bolstered sentiment. Notably, XRP is one of the leading contenders among the top crypto ETF launches expected this year. Having said that, the market experts anticipate these developments to further send the XRP price to a new high, potentially to $11 as Martinez predicted. In addition, another top analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has reiterated his bullish stance on XRP, saying that the crypto is poised to hit $27 in the long run.

Since losing the $100,000 level on December 19, 2024, the premier cryptocurrency has struggled to gather any significant bullish momentum. However, the price of BTC seems to be in the recovery phase at the moment, with an almost 5% increase in the past week. According to a prominent crypto analyst on the social media platform X, the current price setup suggests that Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal juncture. Bitcoin Price Retests 50-Day MA — What Next? Popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez took to the X platform to reveal the current layout of the Bitcoin price and the potential impact on its future trajectory. According to the analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency’s price is at a “critical point.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Make $1.08 Billion Net DOGE Purchase The rationale behind this claim is Bitcoin’s action around the 50-day moving average (50MA) on the daily price chart. The 50-day MA is a common technical indicator used to track the medium-term trend of an asset’s price (Bitcoin, in this scenario). In Bitcoin’s case — from the highlighted charts, the 50-day moving average has served as significant support and resistance points in the past. It appears that the Bitcoin price successfully broke underneath the 50-day MA and has climbed back to retest the breached support. According to Martinez, the price of the premier cryptocurrency is at risk of moving to the downside once the retest is complete. However, the analyst noted that a sustained close above the 50-day moving average could invalidate the bearish projection for Bitcoin and perhaps signal the end of the ongoing price correction. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $98,358, reflecting a 1% increase in the past day. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by nearly 5% in the last seven days. Can Growing Exchange Outflows Trigger Fresh Bullish Momentum? In another post on X, Martinez revealed that significant amounts of Bitcoin have been flowing out of exchanges in the past week. Data from CryptoQuant shows that over 48,000 BTC (worth more than $4.5 billion) have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past seven days. Related Reading: XRP Surpasses USDT: Becomes 3rd Largest Crypto With $139 Billion Market Cap This funds’ movement signals a shift in sentiment, as investors are moving their coins to non-custodial wallets possibly for long-term storage. This could suggest that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the future promise of the market leader. The increased flow of coins from centralized exchanges could also indicate fresh buying activity, with investors choosing to store their newly acquired assets off the trading platforms. Ultimately, this exchange outflow could be a bullish signal for the Bitcoin price.

Simultaneously, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is making waves with its initial coin offering (ICO), rapidly gaining investor attention for its innovative AI-blockchain integration. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT), a once-dominant player in the Web3 space, appears to be losing some of its momentum as newer, more agile competitors emerge. FLOKI Rides High on Meme Coin Hype FLOKI has taken over the funny coin world, pulling in a huge group of fans and getting people to invest with its trendy ads and fun name. FLOKI is riding on the wave of past meme coins such as ͏Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, using its funny aspect to grow into NFTs and DeFi tasks. The meme coin area often counts a lot on buzz. FLOKI has shown a promise to new ideas by bringing in things like staking and use in its group. This mix of fun and use has let it stay important in a very tough market, keeping control over other meme coins. Lightchain AI’s ICO Signals Massive Potential in Blockchain Innovation While FLOKI thrives in the meme coin niche, Lightchain AI is carving out its own space with a groundbreaking approach to integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain technology. Priced at $0.0041 during its ICO, Lightchain AI has already raised over $5.7 million, reflecting significant investor confidence in its potential. Unlike speculative meme coins, Lightchain AI focuses on real-world applications. Its decentralized infrastructure supports AI-driven computations, enabling industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance to adopt blockchain-based AI solutions. This practical utility positions Lightchain AI as a high-growth asset in a market often dominated by speculative projects. The platform’s roadmap includes global adoption, developer-friendly tools, and industry partnerships, ensuring it remains a leader in innovation. With its focus on privacy-preserving AI computations and scalable solutions, Lightchain AI offers an attractive investment opportunity for those looking beyond meme coin hype. Is Polkadot Losing Its Edge? Polkadot, a blockchain platform renowned for its multi-chain framework and interoperability, has experienced both advancements and challenges in 2024. The network boasts a vibrant developer community, with approximately 2,400 monthly active developers as of July 2024, positioning it among the top blockchain networks. However, Polkadot faces significant competition from emerging platforms like Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Avalanche, all striving to enhance scalability and interoperability. Additionally, in Q3 2024, Polkadot’s market capitalization declined by 27%, and daily active addresses decreased by 26%, indicating potential challenges in user engagement and market positioning. Despite these hurdles, Polkadot continues to innovate, with developments such as the introduction of Polkadot 2.0 aiming to address scalability and cross-chain connectivity, underscoring its commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Ask anybody who bought into Solana at its presale prices or very early into its lifecycle, and you’ll know this to be the truth. The trouble is that given the glut of crypto presale opportunities, it could be a lot like finding a needle in a haystack. But like anything, the only way to find out whether an investment opportunity is a blue chip is to do your own research and see for yourself. In 2025 one crypto presale investment opportunity distinguishes itself as a real gem: Remittix , which some analysts believe could become XRP 2.0. Here’s why the smart money is taking out big positions in Remittix this year and has seen over $1 million raised in just over a week! Crypto presales: The smart money’s choice Imagine if you had the chance to buy Ethereum during its presale for a fraction of a dollar. Or Solana, BNB, or Dogecoin when they were available at their historic all-time lows. But it’s no use crying over spilled milk. Luckily, hope springs eternal in the cryptosphere’s breast and the crypto presale opportunities are abundant. The next 100x is just around the corner and the next strong candidate looks to be Remittix . Remittix: Enabling fast, secure crypto-to-fiat transactions like no other Crypto has been derided as something less than legal tender. Save for a handful of jurisdictions, most users need to sell their crypto for fiat on a third-party exchange or P2P transaction—and take on extra exchange fees—before they can use it to buy items. That is, until the arrival of Remittix. Remittix enables users to use crypto to perform direct bank-to-bank deposits in over 40 fiat currencies. This enables merchants, sellers, and buyers to perform cross-border crypto-to-fiat without exorbitant fees, long delays, and excessive paperwork. Remittix enables merchants to pay their suppliers in the latter’s native currency directly to their bank account instantaneously, without friction, and at a negligible cost. With Remittix, users don’t have to worry about the existing circuitous and impractical paradigm of having to manually go through various exchanges, P2P transactions, or swaps before they can use their crypto to pay in fiat—the receiver gets their payment in their native currency directly in their bank account. Remittix’s unique value proposition can be a real game-changer in the existing global supply chain—which could translate into massive growth for its native token $RTX. No other protocol democratizes global trade and levels the playing field like Remittix does, making it one of the hottest crypto presale investment opportunities of 2025. Missed out on 2024 gains? Don’t miss out on the Remittix crypto presale The best part about Remittix is that it’s just in its presale phase so if you’ve missed out on the gains last year, don’t miss out on one of the microcap blue chips of the 2025 bull cycle. With current token prices at just $0.0177, Remittix tokens are available at a significant discount and good value to turn in parabolic growth this year. It’s been suggested that the RTX token will launch at a minimum price of $0.135 marking a huge return for early adopters! Alongside this utility never goes out of style—and with Remittix’s ability to change the way the world conducts business, it’s all just a matter of time before it moons.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Bitcoin recently saw an increase of up to 2.9%, reaching $97,526, while alternative cryptos such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) surged by over 4%. Notably, Solana (SOL) climbed an impressive 8.2%, signaling a renewed interest in digital assets beyond the leading cryptocurrency. Altcoins And Crypto Stocks Gain Momentum In New Year Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted that investors are diversifying their portfolios as they enter 2025. “Market participants have started to allocate capital to representations of more speculative narratives,” he stated, highlighting a shift towards altcoins that may offer higher returns. This trend aligns with historical data showing that digital assets often perform well in the first quarter, adding to the optimism surrounding the current market dynamics. Related Reading: XRP Surpasses USDT: Becomes 3rd Largest Crypto With $139 Billion Market Cap The positive momentum is further supported by the notion of capital rotation into thematic sectors, which Newhouse describes as a “strong tailwind for altcoins.” Investors appear to be capitalizing on seasonal strength, coupled with improving macroeconomic conditions and an interest in narratives that extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This renewed enthusiasm isn’t limited to cryptocurrencies alone; crypto-dependent stocks are also benefiting from the market’s upswing. On the first trading day of 2025, Coinbase shares climbed as much as 5.6%, while MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings saw increases of 7.3% and over 8%, respectively, indicating a growing confidence among investors in the broader cryptocurrency sector. Optimism Grows For 2025’s Bull Market Amid Regulatory Changes Despite the gains, it’s important to note that cryptocurrency prices remain below the highs experienced in December. Some market analysts suggest this dip may be fueling current buying activity. Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at FRNT Financial Inc., remarked, “Rallies among alts like the one we are seeing today are investors following the popular crypto mantra of ‘buy the dip’ in anticipation of the bull market’s continuation.” For many crypto investors, the fundamental case for a budding bull market remains robust, despite the inherent volatility. Looking ahead, many investors are optimistic about a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in 2025, particularly with the anticipated presidency of Donald Trump. Trump’s election victory and the nomination of crypto-friendly individuals to his administration have already resulted in substantial inflows into altcoins that had previously faced scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

By 2034, AI agents are projected to replace 800 million jobs worldwide, adding $19.9 trillion to the global economy, according to McKinsey and IDC. As traditional 9-to-5 jobs face extinction, here’s everything you need to know to prepare for this seismic shift in 2025. What Are AI Agents ? AI agents are not your typical automation tools. They are autonomous systems designed to: Learn from interactions: Constantly improving with every task. Make complex decisions: Acting as independent problem solvers. Operate seamlessly: Coordinating with other AI systems in real-time. Imagine having an army of 1,000 expert employees who never sleep, never complain, and constantly get smarter. These agents can: Process 10,000 legal documents in seconds. Draft flawless reports or emails in milliseconds. Make data-driven decisions at speeds humans can’t match. It’s no wonder companies like Amazon are already exploring how multiple AI agents can work together to revolutionize operations. For instance: One agent could analyze data. Another could handle logistics. A third could oversee management. As Sam Altman predicts, AI agents may eventually run entire companies. The Job Market in Chaos The effects of AI agents are already being felt: Industries are vanishing: Sectors that seemed untouchable are now obsolete. Careers built over decades are disappearing: AI is outperforming human workers at an unprecedented pace. Job market disruption: 1 in 7 workers have already lost their jobs to AI agents. Elon Musk describes this shift as “the biggest risk to the future of civilization.” By 2030, McKinsey forecasts that AI agents will replace 70% of office work. The World Economic Forum predicts that only 5% of jobs will remain unchanged. The Skills You Need to Survive Despite the challenges, there’s a clear path forward for those who adapt. The survivors of this AI revolution will focus on skills that remain uniquely human: Strategic thinking: The ability to see the big picture and make long-term decisions. Relationship building: Fostering trust and collaboration. Emotional intelligence: Understanding and responding to human emotions. These are areas where AI cannot replace humans, no matter how advanced it becomes. Creativity, empathy, and storytelling are qualities that will be more valuable than ever. How to Prepare for the Future To thrive in this new era, consider these steps: Master AI tools: Learn how to integrate AI into your workflow to boost productivity. Develop human-centric skills: Focus on creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Build a personal brand: As AI dominates tasks, people will crave human connection. Sharing your story, insights, and experiences will set you apart. Elite entrepreneurs like Alex Hormozi believe that personal brands will thrive in the age of AI. The more AI takes over, the more people will value genuine human interaction. Conclusion The rise of AI is inevitable, but your response to it isn’t. By adapting early, mastering AI tools, and focusing on uniquely human traits, you can secure your place in the future economy. The AI revolution is both a challenge and an opportunity—those who embrace it will emerge stronger than ever.

Stellar, currently pegged at $0.43, has experts predicting a rise to $1.29 by 2025, fueled by its integral role in global payments and blockchain efficacy. Meanwhile, Litecoin has breezed past the $100 mark, its ascent backed by a finite supply and swift processing speeds. Yet, in the shadow of these giants, Web3Bay is carving out its territory in the decentralized e-commerce arena. Its 3BAY token, now up for grabs in a presale, dishes out governance rights and discounts to its holders, presenting a captivating alternative in the ever-adaptive crypto landscape. Stellar (XLM): Price Forecasts for 2025 & 2030 Stellar is making waves at around $0.43, with substantial growth on the horizon. Analysts eye a climb to $0.72 by early 2025, a robust 68% leap, and even see it reaching $1.29 by year’s end if the stars align. By 2030, Stellar might hit a high of $6.19, with an average price likely orbiting around $4.60. These projections draw from a mix of technical analyses, market vibes, and Stellar’s burgeoning roles in international payments and blockchain tech. The latest tech readings show a 50-day moving average of $0.38 and a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 58.22, signaling a strong upward trend. Stellar’s platform is gaining traction for its scalability and effectiveness, solidifying its potential for sustained growth. Yet, the unpredictable nature of crypto markets calls for a cautious eye, as outside forces and market shifts could heavily sway Stellar’s path. Litecoin Climbs Over $100 Litecoin has recently soared above $100, mirroring a broader wave of optimism sweeping through the crypto markets. Trading at $101.96, it has notched a 1.28% increase over the past 24 hours, with trading volume spiking by 22.73% to $465.51 million, bolstering its market cap to $7.68 billion. Affectionately dubbed “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin has held its ground with quicker transaction speeds and a max supply of 84 million coins, of which 75.36 million are already circulating, adding a layer of rarity and allure. Its reliable performance across varying market conditions cements its status as a solid investment. Tech advancements have also spiced up Litecoin’s features, enhancing its scalability and privacy, which in turn boosts its uptake. With the crypto market showing signs of rejuvenation, Litecoin’s consistent liquidity and strong performance are drawing investors’ eyes, underscoring its lasting relevance in the digital currency world. Web3Bay Presale: Token Utilities, Expansion Plans, & Early-Bird Perks The ongoing Web3Bay presale is making waves by introducing the 3BAY token, set to transform decentralized e-commerce. Holding these tokens not only brings transaction discounts and platform perks but also grants a say in the platform’s future decisions, promoting a community-driven approach. These benefits are designed to ramp up user engagement and encourage long-term involvement, marking 3BAY as a standout player in the crypto sphere. Web3Bay’s roadmap is chock-full of ambitious features that aim to revolutionize online shopping. Upcoming integrations include an NFT marketplace to facilitate smooth digital asset exchanges and DeFi options that offer staking and yield farming, opening up new earning avenues. Moreover, Web3Bay is targeting cross-chain interoperability, linking with major blockchain networks to ensure fluid transactions and greater scalability. Now in its third presale stage, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.0039675, with over $300,000 raised, signaling strong investor confidence. With each new stage, the price jumps by 15%, giving early investors a chance to maximize gains before prices climb further. Engaging now places you at the forefront of a trailblazing merger of e-commerce and blockchain tech, with significant growth potential. Web3Bay offers an exclusive chance to shape the future of decentralized shopping. Summing Up Stellar and Litecoin continue to prove their mettle as sturdy assets with bright futures, backed by solid use cases and market trust. Yet, as these veteran cryptos strive to keep up their pace, Web3Bay stands out by targeting a niche: decentralized e-commerce. With its presale advancing and a roadmap brimming with NFT and DeFi enhancements, Web3Bay doesn’t just add to the crypto universe—it reinvents it, providing real utility for its users.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Yellen says the government will likely reach its debt limit sometime in January, largely because of obligations related to Medicare payments – forcing the government to take “extraordinary measures” to pay its bills. The Treasury has previously used the term “extraordinary measures” to refer to suspending investments in certain entitlement programs, pausing sales of Government Series treasury securities and other accounting maneuvers to keep the government running. Says Yellen, “Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23 at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures. I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States ” At time of writing, the US national debt is currently at $36.28 trillion. The government spent nearly $1 trillion simply to service the interest on the debt in fiscal year 2024, which ended last year on September 30th, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In a recent interview at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit, Yellen expressed regret about not being able to improve the US fiscal situation. “I am concerned about fiscal sustainability, and I am sorry that we haven’t made more progress. I believe that the deficit needs to be brought down, especially now that we’re in an environment of higher interest rates. For example, over the last year the interest cost of the debt has increased by several hundred billion. It’s one of the largest items responsible for the increase in the budget deficit. And we do need to bring it down. The primary deficit excluding interest is now a little over 3% and I believe it needs to come down.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

For XRP to maintain its upward momentum, it must hold above current support levels, particularly the $2.29 mark. Keep in mind that XRP, like many major altcoins, often follows Bitcoin’s price action. If Bitcoin experiences a short-term bounce, we may see similar movements in altcoins like XRP. Possible Pullback or Minor Slowdown Ahead? Although the bearish divergence may signal a pullback, it does not always lead to a significant drop. Sometimes, it results in a minor slowdown, like the current resistance around the $2.50 mark. With XRP nearing a key resistance point and flashing this warning sign, it’s not the best time to open new long positions. In fact, it could be a good idea to take some profits from existing positions for now. Support and Resistance Levels The price is also encountering resistance at $2.70 and $2.63. Pivot points show additional resistance at $2.58 and $2.53, with some stalling observed in the 3-10 day moving average crossover and raw stochastic levels at 80% and 70%. The price crossed the 18-day moving average at $2.41, and the 38.2% retracement from the 4-week high stands at $2.41. Additional support is found at $2.40 (first support point) and $2.35 (second support point), with a 50% retracement from the 4-week high/low at $2.31. The 9-day moving average also stalled at $2.33. Further support levels appear at $2.27 and $2.19, where the price crosses the 9-day moving average.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

(COIN) will soon release its much-anticipated Q4 report. However, even before that, speculation has begun about the possible impact of this earnings report on the Coinbase stock price, as the company’s performance could significantly affect the prices. Coinbase expert CBduck has also presented some interesting insights, claiming that the COIN price could hit $400. Coinbase is one of the biggest crypto exchanges , which is gaining massive adoption worldwide. Its adoption and growth/ earnings are key factors determining the stock prices. So, let’s discuss how the Coinbase earnings could impact COIN stock price. Coinbase Stock Price Looks Promising, $400 Next Target? After a long downtrend, the Coinbase stock price chart has begun following an uptrend thanks to the upcoming Coinbase earnings announcement. As the Q4 earnings report is due, bullish sentiments have formed for COIN stock performance. More importantly, the charts show the COIN forming the famous cup and handle formation, a highly bullish price pattern. The COIN stock price currently sits around $270 and has surged nearly 5%, pulling itself out of the long consolidation phase. A breakout above the trendline could confirm the upward momentum, especially if the high trading volume accompanied the price momentum. With that, a Coinbase expert, CBduck.base.eth’s stock prediction , says the COIN stock price could hit $400. Although the Coinbase stock is showcasing a bullish trend, investors should monitor further price actions and macroeconomic events to analyze the growth potential clearly. Coinbase Earnings Forecasts Coinbase has significant positive performance in the Q4 projection, where analysts anticipate the Q4 revenue is projected to be $2.18 billion, a 128.5% increase from the same quarter in 2023. The CBDuck projected EPS (Earnings Per Share) is $6.07, up 432% year-over-year. Interestingly, these numbers are much higher than Wallet Street’s expectation, as that comes at $1.585B in revenue and only $1.13 EPS. CBDuck eventually claims that the Coinbase stock price is undervalued. He expects it to generate $6.5M in revenue and around $12 EPS in 2024. So Coinbase $COIN 4Q projection is completed. Have fun! $2.18B Rev 128.5% increase from 4Q23 $6.07 EPS 432% increase from 4Q23 Wall Street expecting $1.585B Rev and $1.13 EPS We beat by 37.5% and 437% respectively.

This stock price rally will likely be fueled by strong technical indicators, i.e., cup and handle pattern formation. Additionally, analysts like CBDuck anticipate that the crypto platform will outperform most expectations. He says it can achieve a $2.18B revenue and $6.07 EPS, much higher than Wall Street expectations. However, significant factors could become a barrier between the COIN price rally to $400, so careful planning is needed. Interestingly, further clarity is awaited, especially as the base developers are considering launching COIN on the Ethereum L2 .

With the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance soaring to $80.2 billion, nearly doubling from last year’s $39 billion, the ecosystem’s momentum is undeniable. However, this rapid expansion has brought new complexities, making it harder for users to move assets between chains and for projects to attract audiences beyond their native ecosystems. Fragmented liquidity, convoluted asset transfers, and integration challenges for developers are pressing issues. Here’s how LI.FI simplifies the DeFi landscape by addressing these pain points. The Challenges of Fragmented DeFi As DeFi evolves, four primary challenges hinder the ecosystem’s progress: 1. Scattered Liquidity Across Chains The proliferation of blockchain networks has distributed liquidity across multiple ecosystems, leading to inefficiencies like higher slippage and suboptimal trading conditions. Navigating this fragmented landscape often requires manual processes to connect to various liquidity sources, creating friction for users and developers. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI aggregates liquidity from 30+ blockchains, 18+ bridges, and 38+ decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DEX aggregators. By providing a unified platform, LI.FI ensures users and developers can access the best rates and deepest liquidity without needing multiple integrations. This results in better prices, reduced slippage, and smoother transactions. 2. Complex User Experiences in Multi-Chain Interactions For users, swapping, bridging, or transferring assets across chains can be a tedious process. With multiple steps and tools required, this complexity often discourages full participation in DeFi. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI’s Zaps streamline multi-step processes like swapping, bridging, and staking into single, seamless actions. By automating the complexities, users can perform cross-chain transactions through a single API call, ensuring a simplified and intuitive experience. This eliminates the need to understand the intricate processes happening behind the scenes. 3. Developer Hurdles in Multi-Chain Integration Developers face significant challenges when incorporating multi-chain features into their applications. Integrating multiple bridges, liquidity sources, and protocols is time-intensive and increases maintenance demands, delaying innovation. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI crypto offers flexible integration tools tailored to different development needs: APIs and SDKs: For developers seeking full customization, LI.FI provides APIs and SDKs to build cross-chain swaps, bridges, and liquidity solutions. These tools ensure optimal routing, efficient gas fee management, and minimized slippage. Widgets: For rapid deployment, LI.FI’s plug-and-play widgets allow developers to instantly integrate multi-chain capabilities with minimal effort. This flexibility empowers developers to choose the best solution for their specific use cases, saving time and reducing costs. 4. Lack of Gas Tokens on Destination Chains A frequent issue in cross-chain transactions is the absence of gas tokens on the destination chain, which can leave users stranded without the resources to complete their transactions. The LI.FI Solution: LI.FI addresses this with its gas refuel feature, ensuring users automatically have the required gas tokens for their destination chain. By eliminating the need to manually acquire gas tokens, LI.FI significantly reduces transaction failures and streamlines the user journey. Redefining DeFi Simplicity LI.FI’s comprehensive approach to solving DeFi fragmentation unlocks new opportunities for both developers and users: Developers can focus on building innovative applications rather than grappling with integration complexities. Users enjoy a frictionless experience, empowering them to engage more deeply with the DeFi ecosystem. By aggregating liquidity, simplifying multi-chain transactions, and providing developer-friendly tools, LI.FI is paving the way for a more cohesive and accessible decentralized finance landscape. Conclusion DeFi’s potential to revolutionize finance is immense, but its current fragmentation presents significant obstacles. LI.FI bridges these gaps, creating a unified, user-friendly experience that benefits all stakeholders. As DeFi continues to expand, platforms like LI.FI are essential for fostering growth, innovation, and accessibility. Whether you’re a developer building the next big application or a user exploring decentralized finance, LI.FI makes the journey smoother and more efficient. Take the next step with LI.FI and embrace the future of seamless DeFi interactions.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 04:38:57

Traditionally, the top digital assets, like Dogecoin, are subject to market analysis and price predictions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates 2024, Outperforms Gold And Major Indices – Details Galaxy Digital, a leading blockchain company, has joined the conversations and offers its price prediction for Dogecoin, the market’s leading meme coin. According to the Galaxy Digital team, Dogecoin will finally breach $1 this year and top a $100 billion market cap. In its Crypto Predictions Report, the team expects that Dogecoin’s potential performance and market cap may be affected by the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) operations, which they expect to call for cuts, impacting Dogecoin’s market capitalization. Dogecoin On Track To Hit $1 Soon? As part of this year’s wrap-up, Galaxy Digital has published its predictions for top digital assets and the industry in general. In a report published on its official website on December 31st, the company offers its team’s take on Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and meme coins like Dogecoin. According to an opinion by Alex Thorn of the Galaxy Digital team, they see the world’s top meme coin finally hitting the $1 mark and its market cap finally reaching $100 billion. The target of $100 billion as a market cap is surprising since no other meme coins have achieved this feat. In 2021, Dogecoin surged in price and, for a moment, hit $98.7 billion, but its price immediately retreated. What To Expect From Dogecoin, According To Galaxy Digital If Dogecoin’s market cap finally reaches the $100 billion valuation, the token’s price will have hit $0.678, still below its all-time high of $0.739. If Dogecoin’s price surges to $0.678 to finally hit the $100 billion mark, it means that the price will have jumped by 87%. However, the Galaxy Digital team believes that $0.678 isn’t the price peak for Dogecoin this year. According to their estimates, Dogecoin will finally surpass its current all-time high and top $1. If this scenario happens, Dogecoin’s market cap will be $147.47 billion, an increase of 176% from its current valuation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Recovery In Sight: Strong Support Hints At Bullish 2025 Galaxy Digital Team Also Offers Predictions For BTC, ETH In the same report, the Galaxy Digital team also offered their insights and price predictions for other digital assets. According to Thorn, Bitcoin will trade past $150k during the year’s first half and may test $185k by the last quarter. Thorn adds that the top digital asset will get support from increasing institutional adoption. The team expects Ethereum to trade over $5,500, adding that the second-best blockchain will benefit from favorable regulatory conditions for staking and DeFi. Ethereum will also benefit from the growing number of companies that will test their Layer 2 networks using Ethereum’s technology.

The start of the year has been impressive for ADA, as it surged through the $0.9 level after staying calm for over a week. That brought a halt in the four-week correction, and as we can see on the price chart, the bulls are slowly stepping back in their actions. Though the latest surge in volatility has yet to confirm with a break. While anticipating, the $1.3 level is an important resistance to watch on the way up. A successful break above it should trigger a massive rally. The early drop in Bitcoin’s price today was a bit worrisome as most altcoins currently paint minor loss, but ADA defied the odds as it kept rising Looking at the setup, the price remains strong on a daily scale. If ADA loses grip above $1, the price may pull back to the $0.9 level before regaining strength. A continuous breakdown from there could cause serious panic selling in the short-term. As of now, the bears are off the market. If they step back to resume correction, ADA may plummet into the $0.52 range before locating a threshold for a rebound. But currently, the bulls are taking charge. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Moving higher, ADA may encounter resistance at the $1.18 level before reclaiming the $1.32 high, where it initiated drops last month. Crossing over this high could stir a surge to the $1.5 level in no time. A sudden drop from the current trading level could send us back to the $0.9 support. Failure to bounce back may result in a dip to $0.765. The lower level to watch for drops is $0.69.

It appeared to have finished correction while the bounce indicates signs of bullish. Ending a month’s correction at the $0.32 level earlier this week, XLM mounted support above the mentioned level and the price bounced back. At first, buying pressure was low but altcoin recovery later became strong daily as the market started the new year on a bullish note. Though XLM was not left behind in the move as it saw an interesting 10% increase since yesterday. From a technical standpoint, the bulls are back in the market and without any doubt, we can anticipate a bigger price movement in the next few days. However, the $0.50 level might pose a little threat on the way up. A successful breakout of this high should signal a bigger upward movement and at the same time validate more growth on a daily scale. Looking at the price actions, there’s currently no room for a drop. However, if the bears show up again, we may see a slight reduction before rising back. But as it stands, the bulls appear to have the upper hand. For this reason, bigger growth should be expected in the next few days. XLM’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential obstacle for the bulls right now is a minor $0.51 resistance, followed by $0.63. If the price breaks higher, the next resistance level may surface around $7 in the near term. A drop from the current trading level could allow a retest at $0.414.

This puts the asset on the top-gainer spot, leading the daily altcoins recovery. SUI’s overall market structure remains bullish on the daily timeframe following a higher high and higher low formation in the past months. But during the mid-December crash, it took a short break in buying and pulled back to crucial rising trendline, which has been serving as support since August. Though the drop was not much compared to other large cap altcoins that corrected by over 50%. Respecting this support line, the price bounced back this week and broke higher following an impressive gain in the 24 hours. The latest breakout indicates a fresh buying phase, and as we can see on the daily chart, the bulls are set to claim more highs from a technical perspective. The only condition for bearish right now lies in a rejection of the latest move, which could bring a little slowdown in the bullish move. Looking back from where the price started to pick up in August 2024, SUI is up by over 10x ever since. More growth should be expected! SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview There is no major resistance for SUI at the moment. The potential level to consider for a test is $6. Higher levels to watch above it are $7 and $8. Aside from the ascending trendline that provided support, the $4 level is a crucial horizontal support to watch for a drop. If the price dips below it, the lower level to keep in mind is $2.973, followed by $2.37.

A successful breakup could set the asset for another major rally. The last quarter of 2024 saw Dogecoin through its highest buying period in two years as it rallied 3x to a peak of $0.48 in December in early. But it later ended the year in a correction mode after making a double-top. Following a quick recovery from the $0.263 level, the volatility dropped and the price traded sideways for almost a week before initiating a buy in the mid-week. This led to a surge and it reclaimed a three-week high. Staging a new rally on the daily chart, Doge’s bulls are back in actions but the $0.4 level has been posing threat over the past hours. Pushing through it could bring us back to the recent peak with a potential surge. If the bulls fail to push higher, we may see a slight pullback to the $0.35 level before rising back. An increase in this volume should set the price up for a strong surge in volatility. Currently, the daily volume indicator is still in a downward range. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The latest buying is aimed at retaking the previously lost $0.48 peak. Breaking above it could result in a serious rally to $0.6 and $0.75 in the near future. If Doge drops below the holding $0.365 support, it may pulled back into the $0.31 level for a rebound. While the ongoing surge is supported by the $0.262 level, a drop below it could plummet the price to $0.22 and even $0.18.

According to CoinMarketCap , Tron recorded over 130% growth in value within 2024, its highest year-to-year increase so far. In the process, the token reached an all-time price value of $0.44 on Dec 4th. Despite seeing a significant retracement in bullish momentum, Tron’s price has maintained a positive growth trajectory. Its value increased 12% in the last month, which flipped Bitcoin in percentage growth within the same timeframe. While trading at $0.25, Tron could lay claim on the $1 price target in Q1 if it can establish support above the $0.40 mark before the end of January. At the current trajectory, achieving that support level is a strong possibility. Moreover, the TON blockchain has witnessed a recent surge in activity, exceeding 20 million transactions . With over 2.5 million active addresses recorded in mid-December and an impressive 52.7 million transactions processed in the same timeframe, the Tron coin is one of the altcoins to watch in 2025. Analysts Bullish on Cardano’s Imminent Breakout After more than 27% decline in price value for Cardano in the past 30 days, the positive sentiment surrounding the token is inevitably fading. However, several notable analysts are confident that the Cardano token is on the verge of a bullish breakout. TheMoonCarl on X set a bullish target for Cardano at $1.77, noting that the token’s bullish rally is imminent. Another analyst, Ali_Charts , reported a buy signal for Cardano crypto stemming from his TD sequential indicator analysis. The Cardano price chart from CoinMarketCap also points toward the start of an uptrend, given the token’s 10% price increase within the last 7 days and the rising Cardano trading volume . A rally continuation will see the ADA token rise beyond the $1 mark toward a possible target of $1.77. This puts Cardano among the top altcoins on investors’ watchlists. Increased Momentum for Lunex Network (LNEX) as Project Targets 100x Value Growth The Lunex Network (LNEX) project is growing into a massive presale movement as thousands of investors join the presale ahead of potential high-end ROIs. So far, over 2.4 billion LNEX tokens have been sold in presale, and early investors have already recorded over 333% ROI from the token. Lunex Network’s presale trajectory has set it on the path toward becoming the next blue-chip DeFi project. Thanks to its unique utility and contribution to a better DeFi ecosystem , the momentum and high-growth potential could see Lunex Network record 100x in Q1. For context, Lunex Network is a web3 multi-chain bridge protocol that will facilitate cross-chain transactions while offering secure, fast, and reliable crypto transactions. With Lunex Network, members can trade over 50,000 crypto pairs using the project’s DEX exchange , unlocking a series of trading opportunities that will increase investors’ chances of making profits. Businesses can also utilize the non-custodial B2B payment gateway to receive payments from customers and convert them to fiat. These use cases and high growth potential make the LNEX native token a top crypto coin to invest in now that it is still in the presale phase. LNEX offers a low price entry advantage at $0.0052, allowing investors to accumulate the DeFi coin without breaking the bank. As smart investors know, early investment in high-potential projects is where significant gains are made. Final Verdict: Top Investment Option in 2025 Lunex Network stands out as a viable crypto investment alternative given its early entry advantage, low price value, and exponential growth potential. While Tron and Cardano harbor fair growth potential, Lunex Network represents a gem poised for high-end growth in 2025.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 05:33:00

Let’s examine their growth potential, features, and the factors driving their success. IntelMarkets: Revolutionizing Trading with Real-World Utility and Unmatched Opportunities IntelMarkets is raising the bar in crypto trading, offering practical solutions. The platform prioritizes real-world utility, price stability, and advanced trading capabilities to accommodate traders at any level. The dual-chain functionality of IntelMarkets, operating on Ethereum and Solana, ensures flexibility and speed. Ethereum’s expansive ecosystem connects to DeFi applications, while Solana delivers unmatched scalability and low costs. Traders can pick the blockchain that best supports their strategy, ensuring optimal efficiency. This approach ensures stable prices even in volatile markets, making INTL a standout among rivals. Enhanced liquidity is another hallmark of IntelMarkets, enabling easy transactions and quick access to capital. Whether it’s trading major asset pairs or niche tokens, the platform’s diverse offerings empower users to explore a wide array of opportunities. With IntelMarkets’ 1000x leverage, traders can amplify their positions, unlocking the potential to turn $200 into $2,000. Such leverage allows even small movements in the market to yield significant results. By blending innovation with user-centric features, IntelMarkets positions itself as a leader in the realm of promising altcoins. This is fueling intense demand in its ongoing presale which has raised over $5.2 million. Dogecoin’s Real-World Adoption Could Transform $200 into $2,000 Elon Musk has reignited interest in Dogecoin by supporting the idea of the Texas Institute of Technology and Science (TITS). Initially shared by Katherine Boyle, a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, this proposal received Musk’s endorsement on the X platform. Musk hinted at Dogecoin potentially being used for tuition payments, which aligns with his previous vision of integrating DOGE into real-world systems. This development could solidify Dogecoin’s position among promising altcoins. Musk’s humor aside, the possibility of a university accepting DOGE presents a groundbreaking use case. Such moves strengthen Dogecoin’s utility and adoption, boosting its potential for long-term growth. Despite recent turbulence in December 2024, during which its price dropped from $0.46 to $0.28, DOGE demonstrated resilience by stabilizing at $0.30. If its real-world applications expand, Dogecoin might see a surge in demand. For investors, the opportunity to turn $200 into $2,000 with Dogecoin no longer seems far-fetched. PENGU’s Meteoric Rise: $2.27 Billion Market Cap and Growing The Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) token has taken the Solana blockchain by storm, captivating the market. Since its launch in December 2024, PENGU’s market capitalization has surged reaching $2.27 billion. This growth has made PENGU the 56th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Despite crypto’s inherent volatility, PENGU has steadily built a strong holder base. Its price has grown from $0.0049 to $0.0365, fueled by major exchange listings on Binance and OKX. These partnerships, alongside MoonPay’s support, have boosted PENGU’s liquidity and accessibility. Forecasts suggest PENGU could reach $0.139 by 2025, increasing its allure. This growth trajectory solidifies PENGU’s position as one of the promising altcoins in the market. This makes the chances of turning $200 into $2,000 with PENGU appear increasingly plausible. INTL, DOGE, and PENGU: Unlock Your $200 Potential with These Promising Altcoins IntelMarkets, Dogecoin, and PENGU are leading the charge in reshaping the crypto landscape for 2025. IntelMarkets essentially stands out with its dual-chain architecture, solving real-world trading challenges while offering significant profit potential. Currently, in Stage 8 of its public presale, INTL is at $0.07. With the token’s growing momentum backed by its innovative platform, experts predict a 100x increase post-launch, further emphasizing INTL’s profit potential.

Furthermore, this accumulation suggests that whales are positioning themselves for 2025, ensuring they don’t miss out on any substantial upside momentum. However, it has been observed that this notable acquisition has led to a 22% price rally during the same period and is continuing to drive upward momentum. LINK Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, LINK appears to be consolidating within a tight range between $23 and $24 and is poised for a breakout. Since the beginning of 2025, LINK has consolidated twice on the four-hour time frame before experiencing upward momentum. Source: Trading View Experts and analysts speculate a similar upside rally to what was observed in the past four days.

38558269,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=27716,1736058055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,MicroStrategy Eyes $2 Billion Raise for More Bitcoin Purchases,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/microstrategy-eyes-2-billion-raise-for-more-bitcoin-purchases/,"MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, plans to raise $2 billion through a perpetual preferred stock offering to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions, expanding its ambitious “21/21” strategy. The offering could involve converting MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, paying cash dividends, redeeming shares, or a combination of these, the company explained in a Jan. 3 statement. This move is separate from MicroStrategy’s ongoing effort to raise $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income instruments, a strategy it has executed recently through senior convertible notes and debt to fuel its Bitcoin purchases. The perpetual preferred stock offering aims to bolster the company’s balance sheet and finance more Bitcoin acquisitions. It is expected to take place this quarter, although MicroStrategy emphasized, “The decision whether to proceed with and consummate the Offering is in MicroStrategy’s sole discretion and is subject to market and other conditions. MicroStrategy may choose not to proceed with or consummate the Offering at all.” Unlike class A common stock, the perpetual preferred stock is “senior,” giving holders priority in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. MicroStrategy’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy currently owns 446,400 Bitcoin worth $43.9 billion, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. In 2024, the firm purchased 257,250 Bitcoin, marking its largest annual acquisition to date. The company’s Bitcoin has been acquired at an average price of $62,500, leaving it up 57.2% on its investment. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the architect of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, has been pivotal in promoting corporate Bitcoin adoption globally. The strategy has significantly boosted MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), which rose 13.2% on Jan. 3 to $339.6, representing a 438% increase compared to last year. Following the announcement of the perpetual preferred stock offering, MSTR shares fell slightly by 0.19% in after-hours trading.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 06:20:55
38558379,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=671031,1736058345,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/38558379.jpeg,Top 5 Cryptos to Buy In Early 2025 for Maximum Gains,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/top-5-cryptos-to-buy-in-early-2025-for-maximum-gains/,"2025 is all set to be an exciting year for crypto. With Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential elections and promising to support cryptocurrency and rally behind the increasing interest of retail investors, this could be one of the most transformative years for the industry ever. Great transformations often bring mind-boggling rewards, so now is undoubtedly a great time to invest in crypto tokens that might just turn out to be multi-baggers of monumental proportions. The cream of the crop, as per our analysis and market sentiments, is $WEPE, which recently hit a record-breaking presale revenue of $40 million. Keep reading to find out four other tokens that are equally promising and worth investing in 2025. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is one of the most trending meme coins at the moment. Its presale started in November 2024 and has so far raised more than $40 million. The $WEPE presale is expected to end in February, so there’s still plenty of time for its presale collection to reach record-breaking heights. The biggest reason behind such tremendous performance is the uniqueness of the project. It provides community members with unique insights into the market so that they can make better decisions. It’s important to note that until now, retail investors have had a hard time making big in the crypto space because they were mostly controlled by “crypto whales.” However, $WEPE has broken down barriers and made it easier for smaller investors to access the same information and opportunities as the big shots. $WEPE is currently available for purchase at $0.00036641 per coin – and future annual yields are currently estimated to be just over 150%. ChatGPT’s predictions for $WEPE are even more ambitious. It says that returns could vary between 10x and 100x. Well, that’s a huge range, and it’s too soon to know whether $WEPE can be the next 100x coin. However, one thing’s almost certain: you have a winner at hand. With the price increasing every few days, there’s no time like the present to hop in. 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) $MEMEX represents the Meme Index, an interesting new project that lets you invest in a diverse basket of crypto tokens. It works a lot like mutual funds. Instead of spending all your money on one token, you get a basket of tokens so that even if one token performs poorly, you still have a chance of turning a profit with the cumulative positive results of other tokens. Currently, there are four indices (baskets) to choose from: the Titan Index, the Moonshot Index, the Midcap Index, and the Frenzy Index. Each of these offers a unique advantage over the others, and you can choose one as per your goals and preferences. For instance, if you want to be able to aim for high rewards, the Frenzy Index might be for you. However, do note that it also comes with high risk. Check out how Meme Index sorts meme coins . Coming back to the token, it went into presale in early December 2024. However, unlike $SOLX or $WEPE, $MEMEX’s presale has been a little slow, but we’re expecting better performance as the year progresses. Currently, the token is priced at $0.0149234, but experts say it can hit $0.0172 by the final quarter of the year. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) $SOLX is also one of the hottest tokens available right now. It represents Soldex, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Solana blockchain that allows investors to make direct transactions, without any middlemen. The token is currently in presale and has already raised over $8.3 million. At the time of writing, the token is priced at $0.00159, but experts are predicting that by the end of 2025, the prices might jump to $0.00879, which is a staggering 550% increase from its current value. Unlike some of its competitors that are expected to lose value after this year, Solaxy will likely keep growing well into 2026, too, and hopefully till 2030 before finally coming to halt at approximately $0.0340. Some experts also believe that $SOLX has the potential to be the next 100x token. This is primarily because of two reasons. First, the platform is offering investors staking rewards, which means they can earn passive income from their investment. This is quite an incentive for them to not sell the token immediately after listing. Secondly, SOLX will be used in transactions on the Solaxy Layer 2. So, traders who are planning to use the platform will hold onto their SOLX tokens instead of selling them. These two factors will not only prevent the price of the token from dropping but might also encourage steady growth. 4. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) PENGU isn’t just any other meme coin. It’s the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, which consists of over 8,888 unique cartoons of adorable penguins. For those unaware, the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection is an Ethereum project that was launched in July 2021 and quickly grew into one of the biggest NFT projects in the industry. Coming back to PENGU, it was launched on the Solana blockchain and soon managed to overtake BONK (the former largest meme coin on Solana). PENGU has allowed Pudgy Penguins to expand beyond its NFT origins and establish itself in the web3 ecosystem. PENGU launched on December 17 for $0.003375. After hitting a record high of $0.0684, it quickly hit a record low of $0.0114. However, after the first couple of days of roller coaster action, it has nicely settled on a steady upward curve and is currently priced at $0.041. For the rest of the year, the token is expected to maintain an average price of $0.045 with the maximum potential of reaching around $0.068. 5. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) Fartcoin is a new meme token created on the Solana blockchain on October 18, 2024. It allows users to claim free tokens by submitting fart jokes. Initially after its launch, investors didn’t think it had much potential. It all started out as a joke. Basically, it was a suggestion by the Truth Terminal crypto AI chatbot to create a token based on Elon Musk’s alleged amusement with fart jokes. Naturally, no one had any expectations from this token. However, soon the token defied all predictions and went viral, even soaring past Dogecoin. Today, its global capital stands at more than $1.5 billion. It’s hard to say what exactly contributed to Fartcoin’s massive growth. Perhaps the absurdity of the whole project is what made it unique. Plus, there’s a “Gas Fee” feature that emits a fart sound every time a transaction is made, which, again, is quite amusing. Regardless of its start, though, Fartcoin is now expected to keep growing. Currently priced at $1.34, experts suggest it’ll hit its peak in July 2025, when it’ll be priced around $1.8165801. Bottom Line All the tokens on the list have the potential to churn out a handsome return on your investment, but as you can clearly see, the potential for $WEPE and $SOLX is much bigger. Regardless of the token(s) you choose, we recommend doing your own research, which will give you the required confidence in your investment. Needless to say, cryptos are highly volatile, and the picture that we have right now might not be the same a few days, let alone weeks, down the line.",Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-05 06:25:45

Deaton shared his views after Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto, provided bullish predictions for several cryptocurrencies while excluding XRP from his analysis. In a recent interview, Chung predicted that Bitcoin could reach $210,000, Solana might climb to $1,000, and Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin could increase from 0.03 to 0.05 by the end of 2025. However, XRP’s absence from his forecasts raised questions, especially considering the token’s notable achievements in recent months. Deaton Highlights the Token’s Strong Performance Reacting to the omission, Deaton emphasized XRP’s growing significance in the cryptocurrency market. He noted that the asset is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins. He also pointed out that the token closed 2024 with significant gains, building optimism for its future performance. Deaton referenced an article from Barron’s that highlighted the token’s remarkable rally last year. According to the report, the token’s price surged from $0.55 on November 5 to $2.86 by December 3, marking a substantial increase. Diverse Predictions for Future Performance Several industry leaders have shared their predictions for XRP in 2025, with varying levels of optimism. Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BinPay, suggested that the token could trade between $5 and $7 in the early part of the year, citing Ripple’s technological developments and the favorable market conditions following the U.S. presidential election. Hani Abuagla, a crypto analyst at XTB, provided a broader forecast, suggesting that the token’s price could range from a conservative $5 to an ambitious $100. Abuagla believes regulatory developments, particularly under a potential Trump administration, could help shape the token’s future. Ryan Lee, a researcher at Bitget, offered a balanced outlook. He predicted that XRP could trade within an average range of $1.8 to $8.4. He also expressed optimism that the token might surpass $10 if favorable conditions persist throughout the year.

While some analysts remain optimistic about the asset’s potential, others argue that its recent rally to $2.86 in December may have marked a peak. Deaton refrained from offering his forecast but underscored the importance of the token’s current market performance. Currently trading at $2.39, the asset reflects a 3.76% increase over the past 24 hours. It has solidified its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a market value of $137.26 billion. The token’s absence from Presto’s predictions has reignited discussions about its potential in the cryptocurrency market. While forecasts vary, the token’s strong 2024 performance has left many investors and analysts optimistic about what lies ahead in 2025.

Despite this price gain, the Ethereum Spot ETFs recorded a net weekly outflow of $38.20 million, ending a five-week positive streak. Interestingly, the underperformance coincided with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs managing a return to the green track as they recorded their lowest positive inflows in the last five months. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs Witness Unbroken 16-Day Inflow Streak: New ETH ATH Soon? Ethereum Spot ETFs Open 2025 On Negative Note Following the US elections in November, the Ethereum Spot ETFs alongside other crypto-related markets registered a massive level of investor interest tied to the expectations of a pro-crypto government led by President-elect Donald Trump. Despite a significant wide-scale crypto price correction in which ETH price dropped by 23%, interest in the Ethereum Spot ETFs remained strong with an estimated $2.11 billion recorded in net inflows over the month. However, data from SoSoValue shows these Ethereum ETFs have now experienced a net outflow of 38.20 million in the first trading week of 2025, indicating a change in US institutional investors’ sentiments. Bitwise’s ETHE accounted for the largest outflows valued at $56.11 million, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE, which recorded around $51.62 million in withdrawals. Franklin Tempton’s EZET also registered outflows to the tune of $3.11 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FETH experienced the largest inflows in the past week with investments of $38.42 million as BlackRock’s ETHA emerged second with $33.88 million in new deposits. Grayscale’s ETH witnessed modest inflows of 1.10 million as 21 Shares’ CETH and VanEck’s ETHV saw no market flows at all. At press time, BlackRock’s ETHA remains the most attractive Ethereum Spot ETF with total cumulative inflows of $3.56 billion. However, Grayscale’s ETHE maintains market dominance with net assets of $5.07 billion. Despite the recent weekly net outflows, the Ethereum Spot ETFs have experienced remarkable growth in the past few months resulting in a current total net assets of $13.03 billion representing 3% of the Ethereum market cap.

Total net assets in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market is now valued at $111.46 billion with the BlackRock’s IBIT asserting a 48.68% market dominance.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 06:53:00

This transaction drew attention in the crypto community due to its significance. SHIB Market Struggled in December December has proven challenging for Shiba Inu, with the token recording a 25% decline over the month. Despite a recent increase, SHIB has struggled to recover from prolonged downward pressure. While there’s a 6.4% increase in the past 7 days, a two-week analysis shows a 7.7% decline, reflecting ongoing volatility. These market challenges have coincided with heightened whale activity and substantial outflows from centralized exchanges like Binance. Dormant Whale Reactivates with Major Withdrawal Blockchain data from Lookonchain identified the reactivation of a Shiba Inu whale wallet. The wallet withdrew 220 billion SHIB from Binance after five months of dormancy. A whale withdrew 220B $SHIB ($4.63M) from #Binance 2 hours ago after being dormant for 5 months. https://t.co/vHHs25C754 pic.twitter.com/r0sFEXMyEC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 1, 2025 Previous transactions tied to the same wallet include notable inflows of 65.28 billion and 64.52 billion SHIB, recorded 146 and 151 days ago, respectively. These earlier inflows were followed by minor outgoing transactions, making the recent withdrawal the largest activity from this address. Distribution Patterns Raise Concerns Further insights from IntoTheBlock have highlighted a significant rise in outflows from large holders, reflecting a possible shift in confidence among major stakeholders. Over the past week, outflows surged by 627.85%, suggesting increased distribution of SHIB tokens by influential wallets. Monthly data indicates a 121.61% rise in large outflows, while the 90-day trend points to a consistent increase of 108.23%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The growing frequency of substantial withdrawals and redistributions may signal declining confidence in the token or strategic reallocation of funds by whales. Such outflows often contribute to heightened selling pressure, which can negatively impact token prices. Shiba Inu Community Advances Token Burn Initiatives While whale activity has raised concerns, the community has made progress in its token burn initiatives, achieving a notable milestone in 2024. Data from Shibburn reveals that 44.6 billion SHIB tokens were burned over the year, representing a value of approximately $1,014,740.75 based on current market prices. The burn efforts, executed at varying price levels, have sought to reduce the token’s circulating supply and support its long-term value. In December alone, 2.67 billion SHIB were destroyed through 143 separate transactions. This underscores the community’s consistent commitment to reducing supply despite the token’s ongoing market challenges. The recent withdrawal by a dormant whale and the sustained outflow trends from large holders highlight potential shifts in the ecosystem. While these activities raise questions about market confidence, the community’s dedication to token burns demonstrates a counterbalancing effort to stabilize and enhance the token’s long-term prospects.

Compare that to US stocks’ performance over the same time period, and the original and most secure cryptocurrency massively over-indexed for investor profits: Over the same span, the S&P 500 Index, the broad benchmark for US stocks, gained 45% . Meanwhile, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite jumped by 55% , according to data from Yahoo Finance. What makes Bitcoin’s feat in 2023 especially remarkable is that it was a landmark record year for stocks. However, key analysts among the crypto X community and in traditional finance companies are expecting a repeat of the cryptocurrency sector in 2025. Below are six key factors pouring rocket fuel on the Bitcoin economy. 1. Crashing CX Balance to Bitcoin Price Ratio Based on the simple economics of supply and demand, one of the most bullish portents of 2025 for Bitcoin is the vanishing supply of BTC on crypto exchanges. That decreases the available supply of Bitcoin for sale. The remaining supply is becoming radically more precious and thus commands a higher price. Moreover, the flight of BTC from exchanges signals the intention of owners to hold their stashes long-term. That entails sustained support for Bitcoin’s price at its current levels. The balance of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges crashed over the New Year holiday to a low unseen since Feb. 2018, according to Coinglass data. Meanwhile, BTC’s price is soaring near record highs. 2. Corporations, Governments Join Roaring ’20s The anticipated entry of the US government into the BTC race is another sure sign of massive and lasting price support to come for Bitcoin. In addition to the incoming Trump Administration, which plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a volley of publicly traded corporations are jumping into the fray. The Donald Trump Administration plans to hold onto its current stockpile of 198,000 BTC, mostly seized from criminal operations, instead of continuing to sell it off at auction. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) proposes going further and accumulating one million BTC. She’s taking its disruptive changes to global finance in the Internet era very seriously. Japanese venture capital firm MetaPlanet’s CEO said on New Year’s Eve that he expects other governments in the Asia Pacific region to follow after the US and establish national reserves. Meanwhile, several publicly traded companies, such as MetaPlanet, VA-based MicroStrategy, and CA-based Semler Scientific, are hoarding Bitcoin to bolster their finances and profit from its historic market gains. Plus, there’s the voracious demand on Wall Street for Bitcoin ETFs. 3. Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score: Screaming Bull Signal MVRV stands for market value to realized value. Z-score is a term from statistics that means the average of the differences between a set of values and their average value. This is the ratio of Bitcoin’s market cap to the total of all the BTC calculated at its average market price the last time it moved wallets. A recent article that appeared in Forbes explains why this is important: “By factoring out short-term price fluctuations, realized value offers a clearer view of Bitcoin’s “fair” long-term valuation.” In past cycles, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio flagged the market top within two weeks when the ratio reached 7. On Jan. 1, the MVRV for Bitcoin was under 3, signaling plenty of upside left. In fact, it’s strongly suggestive that Bitcoin’s price could still double from here by the end of the cycle. 4. Bitcoin Hash Rate Tops New All-Time Highs BTC hash rate charted new records through December on a steep upward historical trend line for 2025. The Bitcoin hash rate is a measure of the number of computer cycles BTC mining machines are running to secure the network and keep an accurate, up-to-date copy of the blockchain. When it rises, that’s a bullish sign for Bitcoin’s price because miners must use electricity and tie up computer cycles that could be used for something else to run the cryptocurrency’s core software. They’re doing that to get the blockchain reward for helping to maintain Bitcoin, which is paid out in new BTC. So, a rising hash rate indicates optimism about a rising BTC price going forward from some of the most well-informed stakeholders in the entire enterprise. 5. Macro Rate Cuts and US Federal Deficit Here’s your real Trump bump for crypto assets. On top of an administration that will be friendly to the blockchain sector, Trump’s plans for the federal government over his next term will melt up the federal budget deficit. Fiscal year 2024 was the third largest deficit in history at $1.833 trillion. However, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump’s plans will do this four more times each year he’s in office. That macro tide is certain to boost inflation across the economy and most dramatically in financial markets like the NYSE, NASDAQ, and Bitcoin exchange markets. 6. Urgent Bitcoin Chart Technical Indicator Bitcoin’s price appeared to be already breaking out of a classic 15-day bullish falling wedge pattern with declining volume on Dec. 31, according to data compiled by CoinGecko. Traders may have to act fast to take this ride up. The year began with a rally from under $93,000 to over $97,000.

What does this mean for XRP’s prices, given the fact that the asset is already up by around 20% in 2025? The end of the year and the beginning of the new one are typically sluggish days for the cryptocurrency markets as traders tend to stay away and spend their time with other activities. This was evident during the past few weeks as well, as the trading volumes for almost all digital assets slumped, including XRP’s, on December 31. However, the landscape changed in a different direction on the next day. Ali Martinez outlined a massive milestone for XRP, showing that the transaction volume skyrocketed to over $7 billion on January 1. This was the highest level in at least a month, as the days prior and after that date saw a lot less activity. $XRP recently experienced a spike in transaction volume, surpassing $7 billion! pic.twitter.com/Mm82HzpctC — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 In terms of XRP price movements, such a development could be considered bullish if it persists. A single spike and a subsequent decline could result in immediate but brief price increases, which is actually what transpired at the start of the new year. The asset went from around $2 to $2.5 within the first few days but is down on a daily scale to $2.4. ChatGPT asserted that XRP could indeed benefit from such prolonged increases in transaction volumes but under certain conditions. These include rising demand and utility for the underlying token, the overall market sentiment, and XRP’s correlation with the broader market trends. However, the AI chatbot warned that such high transaction volumes “might temporarily inflate the price, but if driven by speculation alone, the price might correct sharply” in what is known as ‘pump-and-dump’ risks.

Expert Analyst Explains Why The inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump on January 20 is seen as a potential catalyst for cryptocurrency prices. Expectations from the new administration include more favorable cryptocurrency regulations and improved economic policies in the United States. However, Bitfinex analysts warned that the inauguration may not trigger a sudden price rally for Bitcoin: “We expect the new US administration to provide greater clarity on crypto policy, but we do not see the inauguration itself as a significant price event. On the contrary, it could pave the way for cryptocurrencies to face fewer obstacles in the United States going forward.” *This is not investment advice.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/raoul-pal-says-theyll-come-in-and-buy-xrp-anyway-heres-why/,"Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and prominent investment strategist, recently discussed XRP’s enduring popularity among general investors. Despite its association with a high-profile legal battle involving Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the asset remains one of the leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Pal offered insights into why the token continues to attract attention, even as new trends emerge in the crypto industry. I think you are midcurve in over thinking of this! Fartcoin funny. Holds attention. Ai16z not interesting to normies. They'll come in an buy XRP anyway… — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) January 2, 2025 Accessibility for New Investors In a recent post on X, Pal highlighted XRP’s broad appeal, especially for individuals new to the cryptocurrency market. According to him, the simplicity and familiarity of XRP make it a favored option for everyday investors compared to other complex or niche crypto projects. He contrasted this trend with the rise of AI agents in the crypto ecosystem. AI agents, which utilize artificial intelligence to perform autonomous blockchain transactions, have gained traction due to their potential applications in portfolio management and on-chain activities. However, Pal dismissed the enthusiasm around these technologies as a passing trend fueled by high-risk investors looking for excitement. In his post, he remarked that while these advancements attract attention from some market participants, the average individual is more likely to invest in XRP, given its reputation as a straightforward entry point into the crypto space. What Makes XRP Stand Out? Although Pal did not elaborate on the specifics, the asset’s consistent appeal to general investors can be attributed to several factors. These include its low transaction fees, straightforward use cases, and association with Ripple—a well-established company recognized for its expertise in cross-border payment solutions. These qualities position the token as a user-friendly option, especially for those seeking less complexity in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Moreover, XRP has cultivated a strong and loyal community over the years. This “cult-like” following, as Pal described in a 2024 video, continues to play a significant role in sustaining the asset’s relevance. The reputation Ripple has built, combined with the token’s ease of use, reinforces its position as a gateway cryptocurrency for newcomers. Interestingly, Pal’s current acknowledgment of XRP’s appeal contrasts with his earlier skepticism. In mid-2024, he urged investors to move away from the asset, suggesting that it lacked relevance in comparison to emerging projects that followed market trends. However, he revised his stance as the digital asset demonstrated impressive growth later that year. Between November and December 2024, the token surged by 475%, significantly outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market. The rally that followed Donald Trump’s reelection, sparked optimism regarding potential regulatory clarity under the incoming administration. This development contrasted sharply with the legal challenge s XRP faced under the SEC, which had previously sought to classify it as a security. Token’s Position Amidst Shifting Trends While new narratives, such as the rise of AI agents, continue to shape the crypto landscape, Pal’s remarks underscore the token’s enduring appeal among average investors. Its ease of use, reliability, and association with Ripple make it a consistent choice for those entering the market. Although the ongoing evolution of blockchain technology introduces new investment opportunities, the token’s ability to maintain its relevance speaks to its unique position in the industry. Pal’s acknowledgment of this dynamic offers valuable insight into how certain assets remain resilient in an environment familiar with constant change.

With the weekly close just hours away, here are the potential risks the cryptocurrency faces if it remains under this coveted level. BTC to Close Below $100K? The last couple of weeks of 2024 were quite painful for BTC as its price dumped from its latest all-time high registered on December 17 of over $108,000 to $91,300 in days. The latter came on December 30 and marked the asset’s lowest price point in over a month. However, bitcoin reacted well to this correction and now sits above $98,000. This represents a 7.5% increase since that low. On a weekly scale, BTC is up by 3.5% compared to the valuation last Sunday. Perhaps the biggest factor holding bitcoin below $100,000 now is the ‘stiff supply wall’ that appears in its current levels. This means that a lot of investors have accumulated their BTC holdings at prices between $98,000 and $100,000, which essentially turns these levels into critical resistance lines, according to Ali Martinez. #Bitcoin $BTC faces a stiff supply wall between $98,000 and $100,000 that is currently acting as resistance! pic.twitter.com/GrDNNATLgT — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 On the plus side, the same analyst outlined a highly bullish development for BTC, which occurred at the end of 2024. More than 48,000 BTC (valued at $4.7 billion at today’s prices) were withdrawn from exchanges, thus reducing the immediate sell pressure. Over 48,000 #Bitcoin $BTC have been pulled from exchanges in the past week, valued at over $4.5 billion! pic.twitter.com/V1agc0EtCe — Ali (@ali_charts) January 3, 2025 Where to Next? Martinez believes BTC might retest the 50-day moving average, which is currently at just under $97,000. Although bitcoin is currently above that level, it needs to close there, which will be “essential to signal the end of the correction and confirm bullish momentum.” #Bitcoin $BTC remains at a critical point. This might just be a retest of the 50-day MA before a potential move lower. A sustained close above the 50-day MA is essential to signal the end of the correction and confirm bullish momentum. pic.twitter.com/ppfEjfoJkc — Ali (@ali_charts) January 3, 2025 The analyst told his over 100,000 followers on X that he remains ‘cautiously bullish’ because the cryptocurrency could be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern that might lead to an even more violent decline to $78,000. In his latest post, Martinez highlighted that BTC has to close above $100,000 to invalidate this bearish setup, which is currently not the case. I’m cautiously bullish because for all we know, #Bitcoin $BTC could be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern that anticipates a correction to at least $78,000. This is why a strong close above $100,000 is crucial to invalidate this bearish setup. pic.twitter.com/2O1y3sEWgq — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 The post Bitcoin Below $100K: Key Factors Holding BTC Back and Potential Risks appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-05 07:54:06

In a January 3 post , Musk revealed plans to promote content deemed “informative” or “educational,” citing a need to reduce negativity on the platform. “Our goal is to maximize un-regretted user-seconds. Too much negativity is being pushed that technically grows user time, but not un-regretted user time.” Musk Seeks to Silence Diverse Viewpoints However, critics on X have argued that the shift risks silencing diverse viewpoints and could be used as a tool for censorship. “Mr. Musk, it’s your platform. If you want to turn it into silly cat videos and pharma-commercial people blissfully running through sunlit fields, that’s your prerogative,” one X user wrote . “We aren’t children. We don’t need to be coddled. And speaking for me, I guarantee I’ll “regret” wasting time watching stupid cat videos a LOT more than I regret “fighting” to save my country.” Hey Buddy, you OK? pic.twitter.com/TUilURfWfU — Trans(je suis Alex Cargill #PPC) (@TransSplendor) January 4, 2025 The backlash comes on the heels of Musk allegedly stripping premium features from accounts involved in a heated debate over U.S. immigration policies. The controversy began on Dec. 27, when Musk suggested reforming the immigration process to attract global talent. The proposal was met with resistance from some right-wing influencers, who argued that the U.S. should focus on reducing immigration. The online feud escalated as these influencers accused Musk of retaliatory actions, including removing monetization and premium access to their accounts. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin joined the debate , cautioning Musk to uphold free speech principles. “Respecting free speech is easy when we agree with the speech, and hard when we think it’s awful,” Buterin noted, emphasizing the long-term risks of restrictive policies. The controversy follows another high-profile clash between Musk and the Brazilian government over alleged censorship, which led to X being banned in Brazil. Germany Accuses Musk of Election Interference Last week, a German government spokesperson accused Musk of attempting to interfere with the nation’s upcoming election. According to German spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann, Musk tried to influence the outcome of the country’s upcoming national election by backing far-right group, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Musk made headlines over the weekend for endorsing the controversial political party in an opinion piece published in a German newspaper, prompting an outcry from the country’s officials. The X CEO and Tesla founder claimed that he has a right to endorse the AfD given that he operates businesses within the country, though authorities have labeled the group as suspected extremists. “After all, freedom of opinion covers the greatest nonsense,” Hoffmann claimed when addressing reporters on December 30. Musk has repeatedly backed the group on his social media platform, most recently labeling current German Chancellor Olaf Scholz a “fool.” Just over a week ago, incoming U.S. vice president JD Vance seemingly trolled pushback Musk received for his commentary supporting the AfD.

This recent bullish momentum made ADA the best-performing asset among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies in the past week. While this burst of positive price action could be linked to the improving climate of the altcoin market, it appears that the increased activity of large holders (whales) is responsible for the latest price surge. Here’s how much the ADA whales bought in recent days. Cardano Whales Purchase 40 Million ADA In 2 Days Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in a new post on the X platform that the Cardano whales have become increasingly active in the market over the last few days. This on-chain observation is based on the increase in the holdings of investors who own between 10 million and 100 million coins. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Can Break To $0.48, But This Needs To Happen First The investor cohort under review is a class of whales, which refers to entities that wield significant influence over the market due to the amount of cryptocurrencies they own. Many investors pay attention to this class of large holders, as the market often reacts to their movement. According to data from Santiment, Cardano whales acquired more than 40 million ADA tokens (worth about $42.8 million at the current market value) in 48 hours. This level of buying activity highlights the strong faith in the asset’s promise despite the sluggish market climate. As seen with the price action over the past few days, increased whale activity can have a positive impact on the price of Cardano. Hence, sustained buying activity could see the altcoin’s price to its highs of early December 2024. What Next For Cardano Price? As of this writing, the Cardano price sits just above the $1 mark, reflecting a nearly 2% decline in the past 24 hours. However, this negative performance has barely impacted the altcoin’s weekly gain, which currently stands at around 26%. In another post on X, Martinez revealed that the Cardano price is playing out like it did in the previous cycle. During the last bull cycle, the ADA token grew exponentially in less than a year, reaching the current all-time high price of $3.09. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction To $4.9: How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Drive The Next Wave The analyst believes that if the altcoin follows the recent historical pattern, a move to $4 could be imminent.

33767162,[object Object],1736064002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio Signals Rising Optimism – Is $4,000 Within Reach?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-taker-buysell-ratio-signal-rising-optimism/,"Ethereum has surged by 2.75% in the past day as the crypto market continues to experience a general price rebound in 2025. Notably, data from Ethereum investors’ activity shows a corresponding rise in bullish sentiments with anticipation of a sustained uptrend in the short term. Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio Nears 1, Bull Trend Set To Resume In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, market analyst ShayanBTC postulated the Ethereum market may experience further price growth based on the Taker Buy Sell Ratio – an important trading metric in the futures market used to measure the balance between aggressive buying and selling. The Taker Buy Sell Ratio is used to gauge market sentiment by showing whether buyers or sellers are more aggressive in market orders. A Ratio above 1 indicates that buyers are dominant, while a ratio below 1 signals greater selling pressure. Following Ethereum’s rebound from above $3,000, the ratio has recorded a significant increase in market buy orders. This development suggests that Ethereum traders are becoming increasingly expectant of a price gain in the short term. If the Ethereum bulls are able to sustain the current uptrend, the altcoin is expected to return to $4,000 at which lies its next significant resistance level. However, Shayan BTC notes that for a bullish trend to be confirmed, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio must rise above 1, indicating that buyers are taking control of the market. Altcoins Tipped To Reach $2 Trillion Valuation In Altseason In other news, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has stated that the altcoin market has recently undergone a correction reaching a crucial support level. These digital coins are now in an upward bull trend as the altseason prepares to go into full effect. With the heightened expectations surrounding the current bull cycle, van de Poppe predicts the altcoin market cap could reach $2 trillion in valuation during the altseason. As the largest altcoin by market cap, Ethereum will likely play a large role in igniting and directing the bullish momentum around the altcoin market in this period. With Ethereum holding a 29.7% dominance in the altcoin market, the token’s market cap could reach around $594 billion during the altseason if van de Poppe’s prediction holds true. For context, the altseason is a period where altcoins (i.e. other cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin) experience significant price gains and outperform Bitcoin in terms of percentage growth. At press time, Ethereum is trading at $3,652 reflecting a price gain of 1.37% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s daily trading volume has decreased by 25.76% and is valued at $16.29 billion.",Ethereum|altseason|Ethereum Taker Buy/Sell Ratio|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Michael Van de Poppe,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-05 08:00:02

The surge marks a significant reversal following two years of declining transaction volumes since 2021, according to Pierre Rochard , vice president of research at Riot Platforms. During the 2021 bull market, Bitcoin’s transaction volume peaked at $47 trillion but plummeted sharply in the subsequent years. “The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that Bitcoin is both a store of value and a medium of exchange,” Rochard said. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bolster Bitcoin Performance Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 was bolstered by key milestones, including the approval of a U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the April 2024 halving event, and a record-breaking price of approximately $108,000. The network’s security also reached unprecedented levels. On January 3, 2024, Bitcoin’s hashrate — a measure of the computing power securing the network — hit an all-time high of 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s). While it later stabilized around 775 EH/s, the increase underscores the growing commitment of miners worldwide. The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that bitcoin is both a store-of-value and a medium-of-exchange. pic.twitter.com/NqPI8Db1We — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) January 4, 2025 Despite the geographic concentration of some mining pools, accurately determining hashrate dominance remains challenging. The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin mining means that many miners contribute anonymously or via virtual private networks (VPNs), masking their true locations. Bitcoin’s resurgence in transaction volume, alongside its growing hashrate and global adoption, reinforces its role as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. US Dominates Bitcoin Mining At the close of 2024, the United States solidified its position as a leader in Bitcoin mining, accounting for over 40% of the global hashrate — the total computing power securing the Bitcoin network. U.S.-based mining pools Foundry USA and MARA Pool played a significant role, collectively mining more than 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks. Foundry USA increased its hashrate from 157 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the beginning of the year to approximately 280 EH/s by December. Despite these advancements, China-based mining pools remain influential, controlling 55% of the global hashrate as of September 2024, according to CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju. The dominance persists despite a 2021 ban on cryptocurrency mining in China, with miners circumventing restrictions through virtual private networks (VPNs) and peer-to-peer apps that bypass the national firewall. Last month, Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain announced the expansion of its production operations to the United States, citing a strategic goal of improving supply chain efficiency. The move came amid escalating trade tensions between China and the US, highlighting the growing need for companies to adapt to geopolitical challenges. As reported, Jack Dorsey’s Block has also announced plans to ramp up investments in its Bitcoin mining initiative and self-custody Bitcoin wallet. At the time, the company said it would reallocate resources from its canceled “Web5” project, TBD, and cut investments in the music-streaming service, Tidal, to support this move.

Pseudonymous trader The Crypto Dog tells his 853,00 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the market will not regain bullish momentum until President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. The analyst believes that Trump’s inauguration on January 20th will act as a strong catalyst that sends Bitcoin and altcoins to greater heights. “The inauguration likely acts just the same as election day – it’s going to pin us down until it’s over. We’re not exactly bearish, but we’re probably not going higher until Trump is in office. Just had a bunch of people excited longing the highs, they probably get rinsed now.” Looking at historical data, The Crypto Dog notes that Bitcoin rallied in 2021 after President Joe Biden took over the White House. “You can see how we behaved Jan 2021… Downtrend until inauguration then ripped +100% afterward.” Source: The Crypto Dog/X The analyst also notes that the same behavior can be seen during the 2017 cycle. “2017 breakout happened pretty much right on inauguration.” Source: The Crypto Dog/X While the analyst says historical trends call for more consolidation, he notes that his stance will be invalidated if the S&P 500 continues to show strength. “Looks like post-election January is pretty much up only for equities. Since the [launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds] we’ve been pretty lockstep so up only makes plenty of sense.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $98,219.

Deaton made his offer in a Jan. 4 post on X , addressing President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other members of the incoming administration. “If these actions go unchallenged, it creates a dangerous precedent where regulatory bodies can quietly suppress entire industries they disfavor, stifling innovation, competition, and economic opportunity,” Deaton stated. Deaton Calls Operation Chokepoint 2.0 More Than a Crypto Issue He framed the initiative as more than a crypto issue, calling it a fight against “the erosion of institutional integrity and the unchecked power of unelected bureaucrats.” Deaton, who gained prominence through his involvement in Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, pledged to undertake the task without salary. “The American people deserve the truth a hell of a lot more than I or anyone else needs another taxpayer-funded paycheck,” he added. The initiative follows a recent legal breakthrough, with a court permitting Coinbase to access unredacted Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) documents. These files could provide insights into the role of federal agencies in the alleged Operation Chokepoint 2.0. As a former prosecutor and Special Assistant United States Attorney I am very serious about volunteering to help lead a federal investigation into ChokePoint 2.0. I would accept the task without salary. The American people deserve the truth a hell of a lot more than I or anyone… https://t.co/LFdhpCixnr — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 4, 2025 Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, commented on the filings, noting evidence of “a coordinated effort to stop a wide variety of crypto activity — from basic BTC transactions to more complex offerings.” The alleged architect of the initiative, former FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg, resigned in November, months after the collapses of Silvergate and Signature Bank left crypto exchanges like Binance without U.S. banking partners. Deaton’s proposal comes on the heels of his unsuccessful bid for a Massachusetts Senate seat against crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren. During the campaign, Deaton accused Warren of prioritizing her “anti-crypto army” over addressing issues affecting working-class Americans. US Crypto Owners Expect Less Regulation Cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump. Scott Hartman, co-chief of the securities and commodities task force at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, revealed that fewer resources will be allocated to policing cryptocurrency crimes. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. As reported, the Republican Party is preparing to introduce a comprehensive crypto market structure bill within the first 100 days of the upcoming legislative session, according to Representative French Hill.

Technical indicators give out a bullish verdict regarding the ongoing market events. Similarly, the price charts continue to present a positive outlook in regard to the market inclinations. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price increased by 50% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a correction cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1.47. Why is EOS up? EOS is in ascent, with bullish pressure affecting its price action. The coin has increased to $0.9034 in the past 24 hours, and bulls have made all efforts. EOS will increase further if insufficient support from the buyers is experienced. Will EOS Recover? EOS is currently trading in its lower historical price envelope. The coin enjoyed some bullish action from late October 2023 until March 2024 and then again in December, but that did not match the price levels it had previously seen. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price will remain low. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach the $2 level by the middle of 2026 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2030. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $6 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. In January 2025, EOS is trading near the $0.82 level.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-05 08:07:00

The token has shown a significant rebound, catching the attention of investors and analysts alike. XRP Rising Influence in South Korea Jaime Rogozinksi, the founder of WallStreetBets, recently highlighted XRP’s remarkable performance in South Korea. In a statement on January 2, he said the token has consistently outperformed popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin. This observation aligns with data showing the token leading trading volumes across South Korea’s major cryptocurrency exchanges over the past 24 hours. On Upbit, the country’s largest exchange, XRP’s trading volume surpassed $606 million, nearly tripling Bitcoin’s $246 million during the same period. Dogecoin followed with approximately $210 million in volume, further underscoring the token’s dominance. Similar patterns are evident on prominent South Korean exchanges, including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. The strong demand for XRP highlights the significant interest in the asset within South Korea’s retail-driven crypto market. This market has been a historically critical driver of rallies in leading cryptocurrencies. Recent Price Movements and Market Impact The token’s resurgence has been accompanied by a substantial price increase lately, positioning it as a leader among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. After dipping below $2, the asset rallied by 24% to approach the $2.50 mark. This rebound follows nearly a month of price correction after the token reached a seven-year high of $2.90. Analysts suggest that the correction phase may be concluding, with indications that the asset is gearing up for another upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Predictions and Market Sentiment The recent price recovery has sparked optimism among analysts. A market expert known as “Dark Defender” projected that XRP might be preparing for further gains, setting potential targets at $4.11 and $5.85. These predictions reflect the growing confidence in the token’s performance among investors. Jaime Rogozinksi also expressed a bullish outlook for the token, suggesting it could achieve an $8 valuation by year-end, provided the global cryptocurrency market reaches a $5 trillion market cap. His optimistic stance aligns with the digital asset’s increasing popularity and ability to maintain a significant position in the market. The token’s dominance in South Korea underscores its appeal in one of the world’s most influential cryptocurrency markets. With trading volumes outpacing major competitors and analysts forecasting higher price targets, the asset appears well-positioned for continued growth.

Most altcoins are also quite sluggish today, but the weekly scale shows massive recoveries from the likes of ADA, DOGE, AVAX, and others. BTC at $98K The business week started on the wrong foot for BTC. The asset struggled to remain above $94,000 during the previous weekend but lost that resistance and slumped hard on Monday. As reported at the time, the cryptocurrency dumped by roughly three grand and fell to a monthly low of $91,300. Many started to anticipate that the correction will endure and drive BTC to under $90,000, but the bulls intercepted the move and didn’t allow another such retracement. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to regain value and go through substantial fluctuations but overall managed to get out of its dire situation. It spiked to $99,000 on Friday but was stopped there and pushed south to $98,000. It has remained in a relatively tight range over the weekend and now stands just inches above $98,000 after gaining 3.3% on a weekly scale. Its market capitalization has risen to almost $1.950 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is down by over 1% in a week to 53.1%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 5.1.2025. Source: TradingView Alts in Weekly Recovery Most altcoins are well in the green on a weekly scale. Ethereum has regained more than 6% of value and sits above $3,600. Ripple’s native token is around $2.4 after a 9% weekly surge. The biggest gainers from the larger-cap altcoins come from Cardano and Dogecoin. Both assets are up by double digits, with ADA leading the way following a 22% surge. Other notable gainers include SUI, which registered a new all-time high, XLM, and AVAX. In contrast, TON and BNB are slightly in the red on a weekly scale. The total crypto market cap has jumped to $3.660 trillion on CG after bottoming at under $3.4 trillion earlier this week.

Many users have reported issues such as failed INR withdrawals and delays in resolving their support tickets, with some claiming their withdrawal requests have been pending for weeks. This has led to growing frustration among users. The confusion surrounding CoinDCX’s withdrawal policies has raised questions about the platform’s Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. Users are concerned about inconsistent rules, with some speculating that the sudden changes to withdrawal processes could indicate potential issues with the exchange’s regulatory compliance. As the complaints continue to mount, CoinDCX faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of user funds and policies. As reported by Analytical Insights, CoinDCX co-founder Sumit Gupta addressed the ongoing withdrawal issues, explaining that relaxing withdrawal restrictions could pose a risk to the exchange, as authorities might freeze bank accounts. Gupta clarified that crypto withdrawals on CoinDCX currently operate on an opt-in basis, with the process being carried out in stages. However, he did not provide a specific timeline for when these withdrawals would be fully available to all users. WazirX Scare Looms On July 18, a devastating hack on WazirX, India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, resulted in the theft of $230 million, affecting 15 million users. Despite the platform’s strong security measures, cybercriminals breached one of its main trading wallets, siphoning off over 50% of the exchange’s assets, which amounted to more than $230 million. The stolen funds have led to significant financial loss for investors, with the stolen assets laundered and uncertainties surrounding the legal and financial repercussions. As a response to the breach, WazirX froze all trading and withdrawals, a measure that remains in effect as the company continues to investigate and recover from the hack.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-05 08:14:20

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 08:25:00

Experts have compressed a list of three coins that can turn $100 into $10,000 shortly. These top DeFi coins are: Ripple (XRP), Curve DAO (CRV), and FXGuys ($FXG). Additionally, XRP and CRV are targeting to break the $2.90 and $1.30 resistance levels. Meanwhile, crypto experts said $FXG is the best crypto coin to buy now as it can offer 100x by 2025. Its staking and other use cases have increased the demand in the crypto market. Let’s dig these coins that could turn $100 into $10,000 quickly! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Ripple’s XRP Faces Key Resistance at $2.90 Amid RLUSD Launch In mid-December 2024, Ripple launched its stablecoin–RLUSD on global exchanges . Ripple aims to meet a wide range of needs like instant global payments and on-off ramps payment with RLUSD. Reports suggest RLUSD also allows users to access value in real-world assets. However, Ripple’s XRP wasn’t impacted by this news and dropped over 6% since December 24 and was trading around $2.10 on December 30. Yet, analysts say that if XRP breaks the resistance at $2.90, it will have a great upward rally. They believe XRP along with $FXG and CRV are the best coin in 2025 to turn $100 into $10,000. DeFi Coin CRV Gains 400% and Targets $2.50 Next Since early August 2024, Curve DAO’s CRV rose over 400% from its all-time low of $0.18. In late December, CRV traded around $0.97 with a monthly gain of 79.40%. Yet, this DeFi coin is down around 98% from its all-time high. According to analyst The Mental Trader , Curve DAO’s CRV is now trading above the 21 EMA, which signals a return of bullish control. It must break above the resistance of $1.30 to move toward $2.50. If Curve DAO’s CRV reaches this new level it could target $3.50. As a result, the analyst thinks that this DeFi coin is the best crypto coin to buy now for a huge ROI. In addition, $FXG and XRP could also join this rally. FXGuys Is a User-Centric Ecosystem for Traders and Investors $FXG is another top DeFi coin to turn your $100 into $10,000.

Among the predictors is Grok, X’s (formerly Twitter) advanced AI tool, which has provided insights into SHIB’s potential trajectory for January 31, 2025. While Grok’s analysis is rooted in available data and market trends, it highlights the uncertainty and volatility characteristic of cryptocurrencies. Grok’s Analysis of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Predictions Grok consolidates insights from various sources, including technical analysis, historical trends, and speculative opinions on X. The predictions for SHIB’s price at the end of January 2025 diverge widely, reflecting the cryptocurrency market’s unpredictable nature. Conservative and Technical Estimates According to CoinCodex , SHIB is expected to experience a significant short-term surge. They project a 103.29% increase by January 8, 2025, reaching $0.00004592. While this suggests a strong bullish trend for early January, their prediction for February 2, 2025, estimates a price of $0.00002287, only a modest 1.25% gain from the current levels. Similarly, LongForecast offers a more tempered outlook for January 2025. They predict a high of $0.00002175 and a low of $0.00001258, with an average price of $0.00001717. Their projection of $0.00001353 by the end of January implies a -35.0% change, indicating potential bearish trends later in the month. Optimistic Scenarios For Shiba Inu (SHIB) Some analysts and community posts on X lean towards more optimistic scenarios. Gov.Capital, for example, predicts SHIB could reach $0.000271 by late 2025. This suggests that if the bullish momentum sustains, SHIB could reach similar levels by the end of January. On X, speculative posts often predict much higher prices, including $0.0001 by February 2025 or even $0.01 by the year’s end. While these projections generate excitement, they are less grounded in rigorous analysis and more reliant on community-driven enthusiasm. Moderate Predictions Crypto.News presents a middle-ground forecast, citing analysts who predict a 234% surge for SHIB in 2025, targeting $0.000081. While this would mark a substantial increase, it is still far from the speculative highs floated by some community members. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Influencing SHIB’s Price Grok underscores the importance of considering external factors that could sway SHIB’s price: Market Sentiment: Shiba Inu’s community, known for its strong social media presence, can help to drive price trends. Regulatory Developments: Any changes in cryptocurrency regulations could support or suppress SHIB’s performance. Ecosystem Growth: The development of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, including projects like Shibarium , could boost investor confidence. Macro Trends: Broader market trends, including Bitcoin’s performance, often dictate the direction of altcoins like SHIB. While Grok has aggregated diverse predictions for SHIB’s price on January 31, 2025, the disparity between these forecasts illustrates the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. Conservative estimates suggest modest growth or even a decline, while optimistic projections envision exponential gains.

While there are no concrete plans at the moment, Pollak’s comments hint that the platform has ambitions to expand its offerings to US citizens in 2025. “We are in the exploratory phase and working to understand what needs to be unlocked from a regulatory perspective to bring assets like COIN to Base in a secure, compliant, and future-proof way,” Pollak wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). He acknowledged that integrating COIN into the network “will be a huge undertaking.” Related News: Is Gold or Bitcoin the Real Currency? Expert Analyst Explains Why For now, COIN is accessible to non-US residents through platforms like Backed, a tokenization project for real-world assets (RWA). However, Pollak noted that clearer regulations are needed before such offerings can be widely used. “We need regulatory clarity and improvements that embrace on-chain transactions as an open platform to make this available to everyone,” Pollak added. *This is not investment advice.

The lending platform founder, Stani Kulechov, disclosed this in a post on X, stating, “Fee switch incoming.” The statement follows a report that the Aave treasury, excluding its AAVE tokens, has surpassed $75 million, a sign of the protocol’s robust performance. Talks of a fee switch for Aave are not new, with the Aave DAO having a temperature check on the issue in 2024. With many people supporting it at the time, the platform appears ready for the final governance proposal to be implemented. A fee switch returns value to the protocol users by allowing the platform to distribute parts of its revenue to its ecosystem participants. Unsurprisingly, the idea of a fee switch is something many people endorse as they believe it would make holding the AAVE token even more beneficial. At the time of the temperature check, Aave Chan Initiative founder Marc Zeller noted that the proposal to enable a fee switch could initiate restaking on the Aave protocol. With the fee switch now looking more likely than ever, many crypto enthusiasts believe it would be great for Aave and DeFi. Interestingly, other leading DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, have considered enabling the same mechanism. Aave net deposits increased by $25 billion in 2024 Meanwhile, Aave’s decision to opt for a fee switch is unsurprising, given how successful the protocol has been. The lending platform is one of the best-performing DeFi protocols based on several metrics, including its total value locked (TVL). DeFiLlama data shows it has $21.63 billion in TVL, which has increased by 5.5% in the last seven days. However, Aave’s net deposits stand out. The protocol saw its net deposits increase by $25 billion within 2024, going from $10 billion as of 2023 to $35 billion by the end of last year. According to Token Terminal , its net deposit has surpassed $36 billion, making it the largest DeFi protocol. Part of Aave’s success has been due to the struggles of other leading DeFi protocols, such as Curve, with its massive outflows, and Sky, formerly Maker, with its complex restructuring plans. Still, Aave had to compete with several other lending protocols, such as Morpho Labs, Compound, and Spark. Beyond its net deposits, the protocol also has the largest active loans, at $14.99 billion, and has collected around $500 million in total fees over the last 12 months. What is next for Aave Despite the news that Aave will enable a fee switch, the AAVE token did not see any sizable changes in its price. This indicates that the market has not yet priced in the announcement. Still, the token has been highflying in recent weeks, gaining more than 35% in the last 30 days to reach $352. It is currently among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and many believe that it could see more substantial growth in 2025. This is highly likely, given the protocol’s planned expansions. Currently, Aave has 13 markets across 11 chains. In 2025, it plans to add six new chains, including Mantle, Aptos, Sonic Linea, BOB, and Spider Chain. It is also planning to expand its GHO stablecoin, which currently has a market cap of around $150 million, to the Avalanche and Base Layer 2 networks to boost its usage. The protocol is now targeting the development of the Aave V4 as part of its Aave 2030 plan. The V4 will offer improved modularity, capital efficiency, and more innovations.

Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, highlighted the milestone, noting that Bitcoin’s transaction volume peaked at $47 trillion during the 2021 bull market before declining sharply in 2022 and 2023. Rochard stated, “The Bitcoin network finalized more than $19 trillion worth of BTC transactions in 2024, decisively proving that Bitcoin is both a store of value and a medium of exchange.” Bitcoin’s notable achievements in 2024 included the launch of a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, the April 2024 halving event, and a new all-time high price of approximately $108,000. Bitcoin Hashrate Reaches New Records in 2025 The hashrate of the Bitcoin network, which measures the total computing power securing the protocol, hit a record high of 1,000 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Jan. 3, 2025. However, it has since decreased to around 775 EH/s, according to data from CryptoQuant. In 2024, over 40% of the global Bitcoin hashrate was contributed by U.S.-based mining pools. Foundry USA and MARA Pool, two major U.S. mining pools, collectively accounted for 38.5% of all blocks mined during the year, according to TheMinerMag. Despite the rising influence of U.S.-based pools, China-based mining pools continue to control a majority of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate. Accurately measuring hashrate dominance remains challenging due to Bitcoin mining’s decentralized and pseudonymous nature. Mining companies may operate in one country while sourcing computing power from miners worldwide. Additionally, VPNs allow miners to obscure their geographic locations, further complicating efforts to determine true hashrate distribution.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 09:27:00

Currently trading near $98,000, speculation is mounting about whether Bitcoin has exited its correction phase, with high expectations of an impending bull market. Related Reading: Short-Term Bitcoin Holders See 10% Profit – Potential Impact On Price? Strong Bitcoin Support Zone Emerges Between $95,090-$96,531 In an X post on January 4, digital asset analysis platform More Crypto Online shared an insight on the present state of the Bitcoin market. With the application of the Elliott Wave Theory, these analysts deduced that Bitcoin’s price may have developed a potential 5-wave pattern which can be indicative of a bullish movement. For context, the Elliott Wave Theory works on the basis that financial markets move in predictable patterns due to investor psychology and natural market rhythms. The 5-wave pattern also known as the impulsive wave pattern generally moves in the direction of the larger trend. With Bitcoin still in a bullish shape despite recent corrections, the completion of the 5-wave pattern to the upward direction indicates a strong price rally i.e. BTC is out of correction with a focus on new highs. However, in order to solidify this notion of impending new all-time highs, Bitcoin must break above the December 26th price peak of $99,900 which represents a major resistance level. In the advent of any rejections/retracements amidst this bullish charge, the crypto analysts at More Crypto Online have pinpointed a significant support zone between $95,090 – $96,531 capable of acting as a cushion for retest. Albeit, if there is an overwhelming selling pressure, Bitcoin could slide as low as $92,950 representing a potential 5.5% fall from its current market price.

As crypto enthusiasts search for the best altcoins to join this weekend, Qubetics is already making waves, and it could be your ticket to the next big thing. Qubetics: A Tokenized Marketplace Ready to Change the Game Let’s talk about Qubetics. This project is no small player—it’s making waves with its tokenized marketplace. What does that mean? Simply put, it’s a platform where users can trade tokenized assets in a decentralized and secure manner, without having to rely on intermediaries. Whether it’s NFTs, digital real estate, or even traditional assets, Qubetics is creating a marketplace where everything can be tokenized, making transactions smoother and more secure. (qubetics.com) The kicker? Analysts are projecting that the value of $TICS, Qubetics’ native token, could skyrocket to $10-15 after the mainnet launch. Imagine investing $1,000 today and reaping the rewards when the token’s price increases. With this level of growth potential, Qubetics is definitely one of the best altcoins to join this weekend. It’s an exciting time for those who want to get in early before this project takes off. What makes Qubetics stand out even more is its focus on user control and security. With its non-custodial wallet and in-app, feeless $TICS transfers, users can enjoy seamless and secure transactions without the usual headaches of high fees or middlemen. Whether you’re buying or selling tokenized assets, the platform is designed to keep things simple and user-friendly. But it doesn’t stop there—Qubetics is also working on integrating debit and virtual cards for real-world purchases, making it even easier for users to spend their crypto. (qubetics.com) The tokenized marketplace is something we haven’t seen done in quite this way before, and the analysts are definitely taking notice. Early investors are looking at major potential, with many predicting a price surge as high as $10-15 per $TICS after the mainnet launch. That’s a serious return on investment, and it’s why Qubetics is one of the best altcoins to join this weekend. To learn more about Qubetics and this revolutionary project, check out this video. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts and DeFi Now, let’s talk about Ethereum. When you think of smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum is still the name that comes to mind. Ethereum’s smart contract platform has powered countless projects and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. It’s the backbone of so much of what we see in the blockchain space, and its network upgrade, Ethereum 2.0, promises to make it even more scalable and eco-friendly. Ethereum has faced its fair share of criticism due to its high gas fees, but with the shift to Ethereum 2.0, the hope is that these issues will become a thing of the past. The network upgrade is designed to improve scalability, reduce fees, and make Ethereum more accessible to the average user. Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities make it one of the best altcoins to join this weekend if you’re looking to invest in a stable, reliable platform with real-world applications. For those who are looking to make an investment in Ethereum, the potential for growth is still very real. Even though it’s one of the most established cryptocurrencies out there, Ethereum continues to be a dominant force in the market. With DeFi protocols and NFTs taking off, the use cases for Ethereum are expanding, and it shows no signs of slowing down. Ethereum has proven its resilience, and with the transition to Ethereum 2.0, it’s positioned to stay at the forefront of the crypto revolution. Celestia: A Modular Blockchain That’s Changing the Way We Think About Scaling Last but certainly not least, we have Celestia. This new project is taking a fresh approach to scaling and modularity. While most blockchains try to do everything in one package, Celestia is focusing on doing one thing really well—modular blockchain infrastructure. The idea is to separate the consensus layer from the execution layer, which allows developers to build their own blockchains that can scale as needed. This modular approach is a game-changer for developers. Instead of relying on one monolithic blockchain, Celestia offers the flexibility to create customized blockchains with their own rules and governance. This is a big deal because it opens up possibilities for more innovative solutions to real-world problems, particularly when it comes to scalability. Celestia is already gaining traction in the blockchain space, and it’s quickly becoming one of the best altcoins to join this weekend for anyone interested in next-gen blockchain technology. The real potential of Celestia lies in its ability to support massive scalability without sacrificing security. By decoupling the consensus and execution layers, Celestia offers a scalable, modular solution that can adapt to the needs of different applications. This level of flexibility is something we haven’t seen before, and it’s why so many people are excited about Celestia’s future. Final Thoughts As we wrap up, it’s clear that Qubetics is making waves with its tokenized marketplace and non-custodial wallet. With analysts predicting that $TICS could see a significant price increase after the mainnet launch, now is the time to consider getting in on the action. If you’re looking for the best altcoins to join this weekend, Qubetics is certainly one to watch. With its focus on security, user control, and seamless transactions, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the crypto space. While Ethereum continues to dominate the world of smart contracts and DeFi, and Celestia is pushing the envelope with its modular blockchain, Qubetics is carving out its own niche with a unique platform that’s set to change the game. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started, Qubetics’ innovative tokenized marketplace could be the next big thing in crypto. So, don’t miss out—take a closer look at Qubetics today and see why it’s quickly becoming one of the best altcoins to join this weekend!

Is that good?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microstrategys-stock-feels-like-gamestop/,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) has turned into a Wall Street circus act, and its stock feels like it’s auditioning for a meme stock reboot. One so iconic, it’d put Roaring Kitty to shame. Investors are glued to this suburban Virginia-based company, not because it’s a leader in data analytics (does anyone even care about that anymore?), but because it’s become a walking, talking Bitcoin experiment. Thanks to its relentless Bitcoin-buying spree, MicroStrategy is now treated like a crypto ETF with a sprinkle of retail investor frenzy. The numbers? Wild. MSTR soared by 358% in 2024, even making its way into the Nasdaq-100 club. But as Bitcoin cooled off in December, MicroStrategy gave back 25% of its gains. Still, a yearly performance like that is the kind of stuff that gets the nerds crazy. But is this company a genius for riding the Bitcoin wave or just another potential victim of hype-fueled chaos? Let’s dig in. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin obsession Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman, is the guy who turned this ship into a Bitcoin casino. His playbook? Buy Bitcoin. Then buy more Bitcoin. And when in doubt, raise billions in debt to—surprise—buy even more Bitcoin. Yes, he is a very special guy. The company started its crypto journey in 2020, calling it a “defensive” strategy to preserve shareholder value. By 2024, defense turned offense, and MicroStrategy just couldn’t stop. During the year alone, these guys bought Bitcoin 18 times, and eight of those were after the November presidential election. MicroStrategy now holds a jaw-dropping 446,400 Bitcoin, or about 2% of the entire global supply. Saylor calls this the “forever” strategy, comparing Bitcoin to Manhattan real estate. “We’ll keep buying the top forever,” he has declared , leaning on the fact that Bitcoin’s price has never been lower over a five-year period. That’s impressive, sure, but it comes with a side of risk. Bitcoin is famously volatile, with historic drawdowns of 30% or more, even in bullish markets. Yet MicroStrategy’s strategy hinges on long-term gains. Its debt doesn’t come due until 2029, and analysts argue that the odds of Bitcoin’s value being lower by then are slim. The meme stock parallels Saylor has fully embraced meme culture, plastering his social media with rocket ship emojis and Bitcoin memes that make him look like the pope of the crypto church. He plays around with AI and makes fun images of himself with Bitcoin. Thinking about Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/aV42LzSjBp — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) January 4, 2025 Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Co., says this behavior makes sense. “What Michael Saylor has done over the past few years is draw attention to what MicroStrategy is doing by embracing social media and meme culture,” he explained . “He hasn’t shied away from over-the-top promotion.” This approach has worked to some extent, as MicroStrategy has cultivated a crypto-native cheering section. But it’s also invited skepticism. Meme stocks like GameStop and AMC have taught us that hype-driven investing can collapse just as fast as it rises. And while Bitcoin has a lot more substance than Reddit-fueled stock plays, the volatility remains real. MicroStrategy’s stock moves almost in sync with Bitcoin, which means any crypto dip hits its shares hard. In 2022, during a Bitcoin bear market, the company’s stock plunged 74% while Bitcoin itself fell 64%. Despite the carnage, MicroStrategy survived. The company emerged from the rubble and doubled down on Bitcoin, becoming even more aggressive in 2024. What’s next for MicroStrategy? MicroStrategy isn’t ever slowing down. Earlier this week, the company announced plans to raise $2 billion through perpetual preferred stock offerings. This is part of its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” which plans to raise $42 billion over three years—half through equity, half through fixed-income instruments—all to buy more Bitcoin. But wait, there’s more. The company is asking shareholders to approve a proposal to increase its authorized common stock from 330 million to 10.3 billion shares. If that sounds like a dilution nightmare, it is. However, Michael Saylor controls 46.8% of the company’s voting power, so this plan is likely to pass. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself is flirting with $100,000 again, and analysts are throwing out wild predictions. A report from H.C. Wainwright, a 156-year-old investment bank, predicts Bitcoin would hit $225,000 this year, thanks to growing institutional adoption and ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump.

Trump’s Pet Doge (TRUMDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Pet Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Pet Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Pet Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Pet Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Pet Doge by entering its contract address – 6e6jZxV1zG7GGLF5MoJZf8nY4u17x8dceDatSWiTE573 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-05 09:53:00
