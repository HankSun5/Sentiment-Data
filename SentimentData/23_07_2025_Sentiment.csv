In a recent social media post, he warned that many investors may one day regret failing to recognize XRP’s long-term potential. Calls for Financial Reevaluation Coach JV encouraged his audience to reconsider how they allocate their financial resources, contrasting consumer spending with investment behavior. According to him, it is common for individuals to spend large sums, sometimes over $100,000, on luxury goods and lifestyle choices intended to signal status, while hesitating to place even a modest amount into emerging technologies or digital assets such as XRP. He argues that this disconnect is not a question of affordability, but one of priority. In his view, the reluctance to invest in potentially transformative assets stems from a lack of financial discipline or foresight rather than a lack of means. XRP will be the greatest missed opportunity of our lifetime. Men will drop $100,000 on a lifted truck to impress strangers… But won’t invest $1,000 into an asset that could change their family’s future. America doesn’t have a money problem. We have a priority problem. — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) July 19, 2025 XRP’s Long-Term Potential Within his commentary, Coach JV emphasized that XRP still offers significant upside, even after recent price gains. At the time of his comments, XRP had climbed to over $3.50. Despite this, he and other supporters maintain that the token is still trading below its perceived value, particularly when measured against Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. The argument among XRP advocates is that the token could play a central role in the future of cross-border payments and financial infrastructure, and that this utility could eventually be reflected in its market valuation. Coach JV also pointed to his earlier predictions as evidence of XRP’s growth. He recalled sharing similar views in 2020 when XRP was significantly cheaper. Since then, he noted, the token has multiplied in value, and he expects those who dismissed it at the time may now regret not taking action. Moving forward, he believes XRP could deliver further returns over the coming years. Mixed Views from the Crypto Community Reactions to Coach JV’s message have varied. Some crypto users, such as X commentator Schultzy, agreed with his underlying point about the lack of financial literacy. Schultzy highlighted that many people are never taught how to manage or grow wealth, either in school or at home, which leads to missed opportunities.

Some respondents argued that while the message about investing wisely is valid, placing too much faith in a single cryptocurrency may be risky. He addressed the skepticism by reaffirming his stance. He maintains that history will favor those who invest in XRP now, suggesting that the long-term outlook will prove its value and silence critics by the end of the decade. Coach JV’s remarks reflect a broader conversation within the crypto investment space around risk, timing, and financial priorities. While XRP continues to spark debate, his statements underscore the importance of informed decision-making and strategic investment in emerging technologies. Whether or not XRP lives up to the expectations of its most vocal supporters, the discussion highlights the tension between short-term consumption and long-term wealth building.

A recent statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a significant US Japan trade deal has captured headlines, promising a new era of economic partnership and, controversially, reciprocal tariffs. What does this proposed agreement entail, and how might it reshape the economic ties between two of the world’s largest economies? Unpacking the Proposed US Japan Trade Deal: What Did Trump Announce? Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently took to his Truth Social platform to reveal what he described as a “new deal” with Japan. This announcement, delivered directly to his followers, outlined two primary components that could significantly alter the existing trade framework between the United States and Japan. Firstly, Trump stated that Japan would be subject to a 15% reciprocal tariff on goods it exports to the U.S. This implies a symmetrical application, where U.S. goods exported to Japan would also face a similar tariff, though the specifics were not fully detailed in his initial post. Such a move would mark a notable shift from current trade arrangements. Secondly, and perhaps even more striking, Trump claimed that this arrangement includes a staggering $550 billion in Japanese investment in the U.S. economy. This figure, if realized, would represent a massive influx of capital, potentially fueling job creation, infrastructure development, and technological advancements across various American sectors. The announcement, while concise, immediately sparked widespread discussion among economists, policymakers, and business leaders keen to understand the full implications of such a monumental agreement. The details surrounding the implementation and scope of both the tariffs and the investment remain subjects of intense scrutiny and anticipation. Reciprocal Tariffs: A New Chapter for Japanese Exports to the U.S.? The concept of a “reciprocal tariff” is central to Trump’s recent announcement regarding the US Japan trade deal . Essentially, a reciprocal tariff implies that if one country imposes a tariff on goods from another, the second country can impose an equivalent tariff on goods from the first. In this case, Trump’s statement suggests that Japanese goods entering the U.S. would face a 15% levy, with the expectation that U.S. goods entering Japan would face a similar rate. This approach is often touted as a way to ensure fairness and balance in trade relations. For Japan, a 15% tariff on its exports to the U.S. could present significant challenges. The U.S. is a crucial market for many Japanese industries, particularly in sectors such as: Automobiles: Japanese car manufacturers have a substantial presence in the U.S. market. Increased tariffs could raise costs or force companies to rethink supply chains. Electronics: Japan is a leading exporter of high-tech electronics. A 15% tariff could make these products less competitive against domestic or other international alternatives. The direct consequence could be higher prices for American consumers on Japanese goods, or reduced profit margins for Japanese companies, potentially leading to shifts in manufacturing locations or export strategies. The precise impact would depend on how these tariffs are applied and whether exceptions or phase-ins are part of the eventual agreement. The Promise of $550 Billion: A Potential Boost for the U.S. Economy? Beyond the tariffs, the most eye-catching element of Trump’s announcement about the US Japan trade deal is the claimed $550 billion in Japanese investment into the U.S. economy. This figure, if substantiated and materialized, would represent an enormous financial commitment, dwarfing many previous foreign direct investment initiatives. Such a substantial investment could have profound and far-reaching positive effects across various sectors of the American economy. Where might this colossal sum be directed? Historically, Japanese investment in the U.S. has focused on manufacturing, technology, and finance. A $550 billion pledge could potentially expand these areas significantly, leading to: Job Creation: New facilities and expanded operations would necessitate a substantial increase in the workforce. Infrastructure Development: Parts of this investment could be channeled into modernizing U.S. infrastructure. Technological Advancement: Japanese companies are at the forefront of various technologies; investment could spur innovation and technology transfer. Economic Stimulus: The sheer volume of capital injection would act as a significant stimulus, boosting economic activity and GDP growth. While the prospect of such a massive investment is exciting, the specifics of its allocation, timeline, and the mechanisms for its realization would be critical details. The commitment of this scale would likely involve long-term planning and collaboration between governments and private sectors, making it a key element to watch in the evolving economic relationship between the two nations. Is This Truly a “New Deal” or a Continuation of Trade Dialogues? The framing of this announcement as a “new deal” by Donald Trump raises questions about its relationship to existing trade agreements and ongoing dialogues between the U.S. and Japan. Historically, trade relations between the two countries have been complex. The U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) under the Trump administration, and subsequently, the U.S. and Japan entered into the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA) and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement in 2020. These agreements addressed specific areas but did not encompass all aspects of a broad free trade agreement. So, is this a genuinely fresh start for the US Japan trade deal , or a re-negotiation and expansion of previous understandings? Trump’s rhetoric often emphasizes breaking from the past and forging entirely new agreements. However, international trade negotiations are typically incremental. The details of this “new deal” would need to clarify how it interacts with or supersedes the USJTA and other bilateral arrangements. It could represent an ambitious push to address areas not fully covered by previous agreements, or a political declaration of intent that sets the stage for future, more formal negotiations. The announcement underscores the political narrative surrounding trade, where leaders often seek to demonstrate strength and secure perceived advantages for their domestic economies. Navigating the Economic Currents: Potential Benefits, Challenges, and Global Implications of the US Japan Trade Deal Any significant shift in international trade policy, such as the proposed US Japan trade deal , creates a ripple effect of both potential benefits and considerable challenges for the economies involved and the global market at large. Analyzing these aspects is crucial for understanding the full scope of Trump’s announcement. Potential Benefits for the U.S.: Reduced Trade Deficit: If tariffs are effective, they could make Japanese imports less attractive, potentially encouraging U.S. consumers to opt for domestically produced goods. Domestic Industry Growth: The promised $550 billion investment could directly stimulate growth in various U.S. industries, leading to new facilities and stronger domestic supply chains. Increased Economic Leverage: An assertive trade stance, coupled with significant investment pledges, could provide the U.S. with greater leverage in future trade negotiations. Potential Challenges for Japan: Export Competitiveness: A 15% tariff on goods entering the U.S. could severely impact the competitiveness of Japanese products, forcing companies to absorb costs or reduce profit margins. Supply Chain Disruptions: Industries with complex global supply chains might face significant disruptions as companies seek to reconfigure their production networks. Risk of Retaliation: Such tariffs could be perceived negatively by other trading partners, potentially leading to a broader escalation of protectionist measures globally. Broader Implications for Global Markets: The announcement could also influence global trade dynamics, potentially signaling a renewed focus on bilateral trade agreements over multilateral ones, leading to a more fragmented global trading system. The tariffs could trigger concerns about protectionism, potentially leading to a ‘tariff war’ scenario that stifles global economic growth. From an investment perspective, a massive Japanese investment in the U.S. could divert capital that might otherwise have flowed to other regions. The stability and predictability of international trade relations are crucial for investor confidence, and any perceived instability could lead to market volatility. While not directly linked to daily cryptocurrency price movements, significant shifts in global trade policy and economic sentiment can indirectly influence the broader financial markets, including the sentiment towards digital assets as alternative investments or safe havens. Concluding Thoughts: The Evolving Landscape of US-Japan Economic Ties Donald Trump’s announcement of a new US Japan trade deal , featuring 15% reciprocal tariffs and a monumental $550 billion Japanese investment, marks a potentially transformative moment in the economic relationship between these two powerful nations. While the specifics of the agreement and its implementation remain to be fully detailed, the broad strokes paint a picture of an assertive U.S. trade policy aimed at rebalancing economic flows and securing significant foreign capital. The coming months will be critical as details emerge regarding the precise scope of the tariffs, the allocation and timeline of the promised investment, and how these new terms will integrate with or supersede existing trade agreements. For businesses, consumers, and investors alike, understanding these developments will be paramount. The deal has the potential to reshape supply chains, influence consumer prices, and significantly impact job markets in both countries. Beyond the bilateral relationship, this announcement could also serve as a blueprint or a cautionary tale for future international trade negotiations, underscoring the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of global economic diplomacy.

Insiders say xAI has partnered with Valor Equity Partners, led by Antonio Gracias, to structure a potential $12 billion capital raise to support its expansion as per a WSJ report. Following a $10 billion raise earlier, these future funds would buy a large batch of high-end Nvidia GPUs. xAI plans to lease them to build and run a huge data center for training and powering Grok. Musk recently posted on X, “xAI’s goal is to deploy 50 million H100‑equivalent compute units (with much better power efficiency) within five years.” Facing well‑funded competitors, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, Grok has struggled to find a foothold and recently sparked backlash when it shared racist and controversial posts on X. xAI has since issued an apology for “horrific behavior.” To strengthen xAI’s strained balance sheet, Musk has reallocated capital across his businesses. SpaceX invested $2 billion in xAI, and last month xAI used Grok’s IP to secure $5 billion in debt. Analysts warn that xAI will likely require additional capital in the near term, due to the steep expenses of large‑scale model training. Rather than tapping third‑party cloud platforms like OpenAI and Anthropic do, xAI is opting to develop and manage its own hardware backbone. xAI faces massive burn rate but minimal revenue xAI is spending nearly all of its income, about $13 billion burned in 2025. However, it is still unprofitable with very little revenue so far. The proposal to finance GPUs via a structured lease‑financing arrangement could trim billions from initial capital outlays, but at the expense of ongoing payment obligations. Despite the risks, investors remain confident in Musk’s track record with SpaceX and Tesla, recalling how he’s rewarded them before. Some even anticipate he’d tap other ventures to strengthen xAI if necessary. In only 122 days, xAI built its first huge data center, Colossus in Memphis, Tennessee, equipping it with 100,000 Nvidia GPUs. 92 days later, capacity was boosted to 200,000 units. Last year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it “superhuman” and said, “Elon is singular in his understanding of engineering and construction and large systems and marshalling resources.” xAI has outlined ambitions for a million‑GPUs powering Grok. For the next phase, Colossus 2, it’s again engaging Valor, whose capital has previously flowed into SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity, The Boring Company, and Neuralink. The structure calls for Valor, alongside other buyout firms set up a fund that borrows billions to buy GPUs. xAI would then make lease payments or risk having the hardware taken back. What happens if xAI can’t pay its debts? Valor is negotiating with various private‑credit pools, aiming to finalize terms shortly, though insiders caution the arrangement could still fall apart. Creditors are worried about how big the loan is and how long it lasts. They want it paid back in three years with borrowing limits, since AI chips lose value fast as newer models appear and demand shifts. During its latest $5 billion debt placement , xAI raised money with bonds and loans backed by its data centers, GPU inventory, and the Grok IP. They offered a 12.5% yield, showing investors demanded a big premium for the risk. Should xAI default, creditors could rent Colossus’ infrastructure to alternative AI operators and seize rights to the Grok model, which underpins several of Musk’s projects. Moreover, that financing arrangement limits xAI’s future borrowing at $5 billion, aside from any new GPU leases. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Its portfolio has now grown to 360,807 ETH. SharpLink Gaming launched its Ethereum strategy in early June 2025. SharpLink Gaming, the world's largest corporate holder of Ethereum, announced that its holdings reached 360,807 ETH as of July 20, 2025, up 29% from the previous week. According to the weekly report, the company purchased 79,949 ETH at an average price of $3,238, marking the largest weekly purchase volume in its history. Since the launch of its digital treasury strategy on June 2, 2025, SharpLink has also received 567 ETH in staking rewards. It is worth noting that in June, SharpLink acquired more than 176,000 ETH for $463 million and became the largest public owner of Ethereum. At the same time, $96.6 million received under the At-The-Market (ATM) program has not yet been used for purchases and will be deployed to further increase crypto reserves. “We continue to strategically use our ATM facility to grow Ethereum reserves as part of our long-term growth objectives. The asset’s strong position and our ability to purchase large volumes at favorable prices support our goal of increasing Ethereum concentration and shareholder value through disciplined execution of our treasury strategy,” said SharpLink Chairman Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO. Additionally, SharpLink expressed its appreciation for the recent signing by US President Donald Trump of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS Act), which establishes a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the US. Let us recall that Trump recently signed the corresponding law. “The GENIUS Act opens a new era for the digital asset industry. We believe that the regulatory uncertainty that has held back innovation in the crypto space will now disappear. This creates an enabling environment for companies like SharpLink that are leveraging the benefits of Ethereum—including security, scalability, and smart contract functionality—to transform the global digital economy,” Lubin added. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading at $3,691, according to TradingView at the time of writing.

On the other hand, the United States will cut its proposed tariffs on Indonesian imports from 32% to 19%. This agreement is under the deal described in the release as an “ Agreement on Reciprocal Trade .” Trump hails landmark trade deal as boost for American jobs and exports President Donald Trump celebrated the deal as a major victory for American industries. “A huge win for our Automakers, Tech Companies, Workers, Farmers, Ranchers, and Manufacturers,” he posted on Truth Social. A joint statement and a White House fact sheet detailed the accord’s framework, noting that negotiators will finalize the full agreement in the coming weeks. “The United States of America and the Republic of Indonesia agreed to a framework… which will provide both countries’ exporters unprecedented access to each other’s markets,” the statement read. During this period, they will also “prepare the agreement for signature and complete domestic procedures required for it to enter into force,” the statement said. The newly released framework closely reflects the terms Trump outlined last week on social media, when he claimed to have “finalized” a deal with Indonesia following a conversation with its president, Prabowo Subianto. Deal includes $18B in commercial agreements and major policy shifts Tuesday’s formal statement revealed that the framework includes a series of upcoming commercial agreements between the United States and Indonesia, such as a $3.2 billion aircraft purchase and approximately $15 billion in energy product deals. The agreement also outlines plans to tackle various non-tariff barriers and other challenges American companies face in accessing Indonesia’s markets. According to the Commerce Department, Indonesia ranks among the top 25 US trading partners, with over $38 billion in goods exchanged in 2024. The US trade deficit with Indonesia stood at $17.9 billion last year. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer noted that today’s announcement shows that America can defend its domestic production while obtaining expansive market access with its trading partners. The agreement is one of the few completed by the Trump administration before the August 1 deadline for planned tariff hikes. The new US tariff rate for Indonesia—Southeast Asia’s largest economy—now matches the 19% rate set for the Philippines, while Vietnam faces a 20% rate . However, the countries involved have yet to confirm the terms the White House outlined officially officially. Meanwhile, Trump has issued letters to major US trade partners warning of significant tariff hikes set to take effect on August 1. Indonesia will drop plans to levy tariffs on internet data flows as part of the deal. It supports the renewal of the World Trade Organization’s moratorium on e-commerce duties. The country will also remove pre-shipment inspections and verifications that hindered US agricultural exports, which officials say could help restore a previously held surplus in American farm goods. In a boost for the US auto industry, Indonesia has agreed to accept US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for vehicles exported to its market of 280 million people. Additionally, Indonesia will lift export restrictions on industrial commodities, including critical minerals, and eliminate local content requirements for products containing those materials when shipped to the US. The agreement also commits Indonesia to removing import restrictions and licensing requirements on US remanufactured goods and parts. It has further agreed to join the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity and take action to address global oversupply in the steel sector. The joint statement noted that the US could identify certain commodities not naturally available or produced domestically for further tariff reductions. Both countries also plan to negotiate rules of origin to ensure that the deal’s benefits are limited to US and Indonesian producers, and not extended to third-party nations.

He is the latest high-profile figure to board Jeff Bezos’ New Shepard rocket. Sun won the first New Shepard seat in a 2021 auction with a $28 million bid that funded 19 space-focused charities, but couldn’t attend the July 2021 flight due to a scheduling conflict. He will fly alongside real estate investor Arvi Bahal, Turkish businessman Gökhan Erdem, Puerto Rican meteorologist Deborah Martorell, UK-born nonprofit founder Lionel Pitchford, and venture capitalist J.D. Russell on the NS-34 mission. Another Billionaire Heads to Space In its official press release, Blue Origin revealed that this will be the 14th human flight for its New Shepard program and the 34th in its overall flight history, with the launch date to be announced. The mission will add six more individuals to the 70 people Blue Origin has flown past the Kármán line, the internationally recognized boundary of space. Sun was featured on Forbes’ April 2025 cover as one of crypto’s most outspoken figures. He joins a growing roster of entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and celebrities who have flown with Blue Origin, which has included William Shatner, Michael Strahan, Katy Perry, and Gayle King in previous missions. From Sculpture Disputes to Eating a $5M Banana Earlier this year, Sun filed a lawsuit against music mogul David Geffen in Manhattan federal court to reclaim or receive up to $80 million in damages for an Alberto Giacometti sculpture he claims was stolen and sold without his consent. The Tron founder alleged that a former aide, Xiong Zihan Sydney, forged documents and used a fake lawyer to execute the sale of the Le Nez sculpture, and swapped it for Geffen’s art and cash worth around $65.5 million. Geffen’s legal team, however, called the lawsuit “bizarre and baseless,” while rejecting Sun’s claims and denying any wrongdoing in the dispute. Last November, Sun bought one of three limited edition rights to Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian – the 2019 artwork showing a banana duct-taped to a wall at a New York auction for $5.2 million. Not long after the purchase, he publicly ate the banana on stage. He also pledged to buy 100,000 bananas from the New York street vendor who had initially provided the fruit for the artwork.

48757025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=771889,1753228603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48757025.jpeg,Why betting on Bitcoin as the dollar collapses could wreck small investors,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dollar-crash-bet-on-bitcoin-could-backfire/,"The value of the US dollar is dropping as inflation rises, making it difficult for people to afford basic needs more and more each day. As a result, experts say individuals are now turning to Bitcoin (BTC) as a safe place to store money because it has a limited supply that no government or bank can control. In the same way, prominent investors like Tim Draper now promote BTC as the future of money and say its value will continue to grow steadily for years to come as more people lose trust in traditional banks and fiat currencies. Draper and other cryptocurrency leaders further claim that people will have no choice but to adopt a decentralized, digital alternative like BTC. This is because the dollar will eventually collapse under the weight of endless printing and poor financial policies. The situation raises a serious question that every ordinary person should ask themselves before putting their limited savings into Bitcoin: Does digital currency hide dangers that could destroy the wealth people are trying to save? Bitcoin looks safe for several reasons People think BTC can’t suffer from inflation like normal money because it’s designed so that only 21 million coins will ever exist, so no governments, banks, or creators can produce more. They also think that powerful organizations cannot freeze, steal, or manipulate their money, as transactions happen on a blockchain public ledger without any bank or official approval. On top of this, people want to escape the traditional banking system after seeing economic crises where large companies got bailouts while ordinary people lost their homes and savings. Tim Draper predicts BTC will become the new standard for saving and spending money in a digital world within the next 10 to 20 years, after the US dollar completely disappears as a trusted global currency. All these factors convince people that buying BTC is necessary to protect their money and secure their future in a world where they feel the old financial rules no longer work in their favor. Bitcoin price swings hurt small investors Most people only hear about times when Bitcoin’s price hits a new record and forget that in between those records are massive crashes where the value can drop by 50%, 80%, or even more in just a few weeks or months. Large investors have enough money to hold their BTC for years and wait for a recovery when the price crashes suddenly. However, small investors don’t have that luxury because they need their small savings for daily expenses, emergencies, or life plans like school fees and medical bills. Faced with this challenge, they must sell during the downturn, locking in heavy losses that can destroy their financial stability for years. There are also no safety nets with cryptocurrencies to protect small investors when hackers steal their BTC, lose due to forgotten passwords, or are trapped in a platform that shuts down suddenly (as has happened many times). Because of this, small investors who lack the technical skills to keep their BTC safe or who trust unreliable online platforms to store their coins without realizing the risks involved lose all their money permanently without any chance of getting it back. Small investors also struggle to sell their coins fast enough to avoid losses when Bitcoin’s price drops sharply. This is because trading platforms slow down, and the markets get overwhelmed by millions of people trying to sell simultaneously. Finally, a psychological effect known as FOMO, or “fear of missing out,” caused by the hype and stories of people becoming millionaires overnight, pushes small investors to buy Bitcoin at exactly the wrong moment when prices are at their highest and everyone else is rushing to buy. The same investors experience fear and panic, and sell their Bitcoin at a much lower price just to avoid losing more when prices start falling quickly. Bitcoin offers no short-term financial security Many famous investors say that Bitcoin could one day reach prices like $250,000 or even more, and get people excited, especially those worried about losing their money because of inflation and unstable economies. Many small investors do not realize that their predictions do not help people who need short-term financial security or cannot afford to leave their money tied up in Bitcoin for years without using it. Ordinary people think the price will quickly go up and solve their money problems when they put their limited savings into Bitcoin, but the coin causes short-term pain due to its high price volatility and unpredictable cycles of booms and crashes. Bitcoin’s price history clearly shows that after each big rise, there can be long periods (sometimes months or even years) when the price remains low or falls further, forcing investors to wait for a recovery that may take much longer than expected. Small investors who need access to their money for daily living will have to sell their Bitcoin at a loss just to meet their basic needs. Experts also base long-term forecasts about Bitcoin on assumptions that may not come true. Bitcoin’s future depends on many factors that ordinary people cannot control or predict, like government regulations, technical failures, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and changes in investor behavior. Small investors gamble their limited savings on a future that may or may not arrive and suffer the most because they cannot afford to wait and recover like wealthier investors can. Scammers steal from small investors in crypto markets Criminals create fake coins with professional-looking websites, fake celebrity endorsements, and promises of fast returns to lure small investors who do not have the time or experience to investigate whether the coins are real. These tokens disappear overnight once the scammers have collected enough money from their victims. Criminals also create fake websites or send fake emails that look like real exchanges or wallet providers to get small investors to enter their passwords or wallet keys, so they can steal that information and use it to take all the Bitcoin or crypto from the investors’ accounts. Most small investors have no way to trace the criminals or get any help from the authorities because many governments lack clear rules or systems to protect people in these situations. Small investors are easy targets for these scams because there are no strong rules or safety nets to protect them from the fake platforms that operate with little or no oversight. On the other hand, big investors, such as hedge funds and wealthy individuals, usually have teams of lawyers, financial advisors, and cybersecurity experts to help them avoid scams and navigate the complex world of crypto safely. Scammers specifically target small investors because they know these people are desperate to protect their money from inflation and financial uncertainty, and they exploit that fear by promising safety and quick profits. Bitcoin may rise later, but small investors suffer now Small investors must understand that the present reality of investing in Bitcoin is filled with serious risks. This means they could easily wipe out their limited savings long before they can benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Bitcoin brings dangers that are often ignored or hidden in all the excitement, even though it is true that the dollar is losing value and people are understandably looking for safer alternatives to protect their money. Small investors should step back and understand that protecting their savings is more important than chasing future profits. Instead of rushing into Bitcoin because of bold predictions or social media hype. The path to Bitcoin’s future victory could be filled with painful losses for people not financially prepared for its dangerous ups and downs today. In simple words, Bitcoin might win in the long run, but small investors could lose everything on the way there.

While Solana (SOL) cools off after its recent surge and Chainlink (LINK) struggles to push key on-chain metrics despite big partnerships, a different kind of momentum is quietly building around MAGACOIN FINANCE , a meme-powered community altcoin attracting traders looking beyond technical charts. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Strong Investment While other big cryptocurrencies are struggling to stay steady, MAGACOIN FINANCE is grabbing attention as one of the profitable crypto investments this year , pulling in both everyday investors and even some institutional interest at a growing pace. The presale is moving fast. Earlier rounds sold out quickly as buyers rushed in, hoping to catch rare early-stage gains that aren’t easy to find in today’s market. With a limited total supply of 170 billion tokens and a decentralized design that helps protect against inflation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built to hold long-term value. Its smart contract has also been fully audited by HashEx , adding an extra layer of trust and security for investors. Those who join during early stages can also earn high APY rewards through staking. Analysts are becoming more positive on MAGACOIN FINANCE by the day, pointing to its solid fundamentals, limited supply, and the huge interest it’s already seeing in the current market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining the Spotlight as Solana Cools and Chainlink Falters As Solana’s weekly momentum eases and Chainlink battles to sustain price levels, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its zero-tax transaction system . Unlike many meme and micro-cap altcoins that charge buyers and sellers hefty taxes on every swap, MAGACOIN FINANCE lets investors trade freely — a key reason liquidity is building faster and traders are taking notice. Chainlink’s on-chain data shows rising exchange outflows (a bullish sign), but it has struggled to convert that into sustained price rallies. Meanwhile, social activity around MAGACOIN FINANCE is steadily increasing With Solana dominated by ETF headlines and Chainlink tied to banking integrations, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something different: a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin that actively invites its community to shape the project’s evolution. Solana Strong but Cooling; Chainlink Fails Key Levels Solana (SOL) continues to show impressive fundamentals even as its price cools slightly after the ETF-driven surge. SOL is booming in stablecoin growth (up 156% YTD to $13 billion ) and a 25% monthly jump in DeFi TVL to $7.65 billion , making it the #2 blockchain by locked value. With over 26 million active addresses in a week , Solana leads the field in user activity. Technically, it’s consolidating in a bull flag , with analysts aiming for an year-end target above $300. Chainlink (LINK) , despite landing major partnerships with Mastercard, JPMorgan, Sony, and new integrations across Hedera, Astar, and Solv Protocol, has struggled to reflect this in price action. LINK is still down ~40% from yearly highs , and remains stuck under key resistance even with bullish signs like $66 million in outflows from exchanges suggesting investor accumulation. While the SEC’s new smart contract guidance could fast-track institutional use of Chainlink’s CCIP, for now, LINK price stays range-bound until it can decisively break above its technical barriers. Final Thoughts Solana is still looking strong under the hood, backed by steady ETF inflows, a booming stablecoin market, and more active addresses than any other blockchain. Its weekly chart shows signs of cooling off, but the overall setup suggests more upside could be ahead if it holds key support levels. Chainlink, on the other hand, keeps landing big partnerships and integrations, yet hasn’t managed to turn that momentum into a lasting price breakout, staying stuck below resistance even with all the major adoption news. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building momentum and is gaining attention from Solana and Chainlink investors. It’s shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025.

His comments were made during an interview on The Good Morning Crypto show, where he outlined a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that he believes could drive such an increase. Macroeconomic Pressures and Regulatory Shifts Claver’s projection rests on the assumption that major structural changes in the global financial system will occur. One such factor is the potential unwinding of the reverse carry trade, a financial strategy involving borrowing at low interest rates in one currency to invest in assets with higher returns elsewhere. He believes a reversal in this strategy could shift liquidity in favor of digital assets like XRP. Another key point in his analysis involves regulatory developments surrounding stablecoins. Claver speculated that Tether, a widely used stablecoin, may come under increased scrutiny. He suggested that a joint investigation or hearing could take place involving the SEC, CFTC, and Department of Justice, potentially triggered by the recent passage of the GENIUS Act . In his view, any negative findings related to Tether could affect market stability and cause investors to seek safer, more transparent assets. Additionally, Claver mentioned that ongoing legal disclosures related to the Jeffrey Epstein case could have a knock-on effect within the financial sector. Though he did not draw a direct connection, he implied that any unexpected revelations involving crypto firms might impact investor trust and market behavior. Liquidity Concerns and XRP’s Use in Settlement Claver also referenced a long-debated theory originally put forward by Shane Ellis. The theory claims that liquidity shortages on crypto exchanges, such as Bitfinex, could cause XRP’s price to surge unexpectedly, an argument previously used to justify high price predictions like the $589 figure. Expanding on XRP’s practical use, Claver argued that the token is well-suited for solving settlement inefficiencies in traditional finance. While stock trades typically settle after one business day, digital asset settlements, including XRP, can be completed within 20 to 40 minutes. He highlighted the importance of real-time settlement, particularly during periods when traditional markets are closed, such as weekends or holidays. He also pointed to Project ION, a blockchain-based settlement platform developed through a collaboration between R3 and the DTCC, as an example of infrastructure that could benefit from a neutral and liquid bridge asset. According to Claver, XRP could serve that purpose, enabling cross-platform financial connectivity when needed most. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rising oil prices, possibly driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, were also cited as a contributing factor that could accelerate financial instability and push more investors toward alternative assets like XRP. Evaluating the Feasibility of a $2,000 Price Target Despite the elaborate framework behind Claver’s prediction, his targets remain extraordinary by current market standards. With XRP trading near $3.45 at the time of his remarks, reaching $1,500 would require an increase of over 43,000%, while a $2,000 price point would mark a rise of more than 57,000%. Such prices would also result in unprecedented market capitalizations. At $1,500, XRP’s total market cap would surpass $90 trillion, roughly four times the current value of the global gold market. At $2,000, XRP would be valued at $120 trillion, exceeding the estimated global M2 money supply. Though the likelihood of reaching these figures is widely debated, Claver’s outlook has sparked interest for its boldness. Under this scenario, a modest holding of 1,000 XRP , currently valued around $3,450, could grow into a portfolio worth $1.5 to $2 million, depending on which target is reached. Jake Claver’s forecast represents one of the more aggressive XRP price predictions in recent memory. While his rationale draws from legitimate economic and regulatory trends, the projected valuations are ambitious and have generated both curiosity and skepticism.

His prediction comes as SHIB surpasses Litecoin to climb into the 18th spot on the list of largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Shiba Inu Eyes Explosive 126% Rally In a TradingView post, Maddox predicted that Shiba Inu could record a 126% rally to $0.0003579 from its current price level. The analyst noted that SHIB has printed confirmed weekly bullish divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The top meme coin is now attempting to overcome the weekly 200EMA resistance. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breakout Programmed: Diamond Hands Are Up 783%, SHIB Burn Rate Explodes 1,784% The analyst further revealed that a High Volume Node lies just above, and a close above this level will signal a bullish trend. Based on this bullish trend, Shiba Inu could move to the initial target of the weekly pivot at $0.00001774 before it then moves to the $0.0000579 High Volume Node. Meanwhile, Maddox noted that the Shiba Inu price has completed its retracement to the ‘alt-coin’ golden pocket 0.786 Fibonacci retracement. He added that a bearish divergence is currently growing on the weekly RSI but that this will be diverted with a thrust high. The analyst is confident in SHIB’s potential, suggesting that this is a MEME season. He noted that the Dogecoin price looks ready to go. As such, Shiba Inu is also expected to follow suit, given the correlation between these meme coins, which are the largest ones by market cap. DOGE is up over 38% in the last seven days. Shiba Inu has followed and is up over 16% during this period. Thanks to the current uptrend, SHIB has surpassed LTC to become the 18th largest crypto by market cap. The meme coin currently boasts a market cap of $8.89 billion. SHIB Ready To Run To The $0.000032 Levels Crypto analyst Javon Marks had earlier shared a similar prediction to Maddox’s. In an X post, he declared that in the nearer term and by confirmed data, the $0.000032s are levels to come for Shiba Inu in response to a bullish divergence. He added that this 135% move could only be the start of a larger bullish reversal for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could See 180% Explosion As This Indicator Flashes Bullish Divergence Crypto analyst Friedrich suggested that Shiba Inu could reach its all-time high (ATH) as part of this larger bullish reversal. In an X post, the analyst declared that SHIB is about to blast. He added that with Ethereum ripping, the meme coin will go for a retest of its ATH of $0.00008845 for sure. His accompanying chart showed that SHIB could at least reach $0.00008032. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.0000151, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

An unnamed politically appointed official with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) believes the agency’s efforts to kill in court an open banking rule enacted under former US President Biden may be giving JPMorgan Chase the opportunity to charge the fees, reports Bloomberg. The same official is discussing the issue with concerned fintech firms, according to multiple sources who asked to remain anonymous to talk about the controversial matter. The CFPB open banking rule, which was finalized last year, prevents banks from imposing charges on third parties such as Coinbase, Venmo and PayPal to access customers’ deposit and credit card account information as a way to ensure competition. However, CFPB’s Acting Director Russell Vought is now asking a federal judge to vacate the rule on several grounds, arguing that Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act “does not authorize the Bureau to prohibit banks from charging any fees for maintaining and providing access through the required developer interfaces.” Critics of JPMorgan Chase’s fee proposal say it could stifle the fintech sector. Graham Steele, the former assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions in the Biden administration, says the Trump administration’s efforts to shutter the CFPB and delete Biden-related policies are wreaking havoc in the fintech industry. “By repealing the rule without fully thinking it through, they have caused a lot of problems in the marketplace and for consumers.” The CFPB did not respond to the media’s request for comment at time of publication. Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon defended the fee proposal during the bank’s second-quarter earnings call. “It just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system protection.” Critics of the bank fees include cryptocurrency companies and investors. Says Alex Rampell, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, “Make no mistake: this isn’t about a new revenue stream. It’s about strangling competition. And if they get away with this, every bank will follow.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to people familiar with the matter, Microsoft has attracted at least 24 AI specialists from DeepMind alone since early 2025. The move is part of a strategic talent push by Microsoft as Big Tech groups race to outpace each other in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and commercial AI applications. Microsoft recruits AI talent with attractive compensation Microsoft’s recruiting spree is part of a strategy led by Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, who joined Microsoft in March after the company acquired most of the staff and IP from his AI startup Inflection for $650 million. The fierce battle for AI talent has pushed salaries for elite engineers and scientists into the stratosphere. Recent reports estimate that top AI researchers now command total compensation packages upwards of $10 million to $20 million annually, comparable to star athletes and hedge fund managers. In a public spat earlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticized Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg for encouraging “mercenary” hiring practices after the Facebook parent offered $100 million sign-on bonuses to lure developers from rival labs. Subramanya’s departure, alongside fellow Gemini engineering co-lead Mat Velloso, who has since joined Meta, has prompted a leadership reshuffle within Google’s AI operations. The company is now under pressure to retain top-tier engineers as it continues to trail OpenAI and Anthropic in public adoption of its Gemini model, which lags behind ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of monthly users, according to recent court filings. Google responds, but concerns linger In response to Microsoft’s aggressive hiring, Google maintains that DeepMind’s attrition rates remain below the industry average and claims to have recruited a comparable number of AI staff from rivals. However, the company has also taken steps to stem the outflow. According to a recent Business Insider report, DeepMind has quietly implemented stricter non-compete clauses for key AI staff, in some cases restricting employees from joining competitors for up to 12 months after departure. Critics argue such measures may prove legally flawed under U.S. labor laws, especially in California, where non-compete clauses are not enforceable. Also, critics argue that it could hamper collaboration in the research community. With Suleyman now in charge of Microsoft’s AI for consumer products, the company is betting heavily on its ability to outbuild Google and Meta in the next wave of smart assistants, productivity tools, and health applications. Google, while still dominant in search and advertising, faces a growing perception that it has stumbled in translating its foundational research into breakthrough products. The growing exodus of talent to Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI may signal deeper concerns about culture, vision, or agility inside Google’s AI ranks.

Not Bitcoin. Not Ether. Stablecoins. As Trump prepares to flood the system with credit to prop up defense production, Arthur argues that the buyers of this new wave of debt won’t be boomers or Wall Street, it’ll be stablecoin issuers like Tether, quietly buying up Treasury bills with crypto inflows. To understand this mess, you need to understand where the new money is coming from. According to Arthur, it’s not about GDP, taxes. Trump is copying China’s model where the state guarantees profits for “critical industries” like semiconductors, rare earths, and weapons. That forces banks to lend because profit is guaranteed. And with credit flowing, the U.S. ramps up military production at scale. MP Materials shows how Trump’s fascist credit plan works The first test case is MP Materials. They got a $1 billion loan backed by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to build a rare earth processing plant. Why’d the banks agree? Because the Department of Defense stepped in and guaranteed a floor price for the minerals, double the Chinese market rate. Oh, and the Pentagon’s now the company’s biggest shareholder. The deal looks like this: MP borrows $1,000, which creates $1,000 in fresh fiat. That money is used to build the plant and pay workers. Those workers spend money, create more deposits, and keep the cycle going. Meanwhile, the government buys the rare earths from MP, financed by fresh Treasury debt. The banks convert MP’s loan into reserves at the Fed and use those reserves to buy the debt. Net result? The banking system, the government, and the company all get richer. The fiat supply grows. Welcome to QE for Poor People, as Arthur humorously calls it. Source: Arthur Hayes This method doesn’t need Congress. Trump’s Pentagon can sign off on procurement deals directly. Banks will line up to fund anything tagged “critical.” Politicians will fight to get contracts into their own districts. It’s the perfect engine for growth, and inflation. That’s the catch. As Arthur points out, credit creation outpaces actual production. Labor and materials don’t grow magically. Fiat does. So inflation comes next, and wages go up, goods get expensive, and people who aren’t plugged into the government-banking loop get screwed. But Arthur says there’s a way to mask the pain: blow a financial bubble. If you inflate an asset class fast enough, the public forgets they’re broke, as long as they feel richer. China did it with housing. The U.S. is going to do it with crypto. Credit growth will drive a crypto bubble, and stablecoins will buy the debt As the U.S. turns up the credit tap, Arthur says crypto will moon. He built an index combining U.S. bank reserves and liabilities, and mapped it to Bitcoin. When credit doubled, Bitcoin rose 15x. The more fiat the U.S. creates, the more crypto soars. The Trump team knows this too. That’s why they’ve “orange-pilled” themselves, as Arthur puts it. It’s strategic. More poor, young, and minority Americans own crypto than stocks. That means when crypto pumps, a broader slice of the population feels richer. Politically, that’s gold. Especially when paired with new policies like allowing 401(k) plans to hold crypto, a pool of $8.7 trillion. And Trump’s new proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on crypto? That’s the final rocket booster. But folks, the masterstroke isn’t the pump, it’s the recycling. When crypto market cap rises, some of that cash goes into stablecoins. Arthur estimates 9% of total crypto value ends up in stablecoins. These stablecoins invest in short-term T-bills for yield; safe, short-dated, liquid. The more the market rises, the more stablecoin AUC grows, and the more Treasury bills get bought. If the crypto market hits $100 trillion by 2028, Arthur estimates $9 trillion will flow into stablecoins, which means $9 trillion of Treasury demand. “That would be a 25x rise from current levels,” he says. That demand will be used to fund all of Trump’s military contracts, rare earth guarantees, and production subsidies. It’s not new. The U.S. did the same thing during World War II, they issued short-term bills instead of long-term bonds to fund the war. Back then it was war bonds and patriotism. Now it’s stablecoins and yield. So now the circle is closed. Trump triggers a wartime economy. The Fed doesn’t print, commercial banks do. They’re incentivized to lend by government guarantees. Credit booms. That credit pushes crypto higher. People pile into stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers buy T-bills. The government gets endless liquidity to fund its military-industrial complex. So if you’re still sitting on the sidelines, sipping light beer and watching the club go nuts without you, don’t. This is the Trump credit cycle. And if Arthur is right, stablecoins are the new war bonds.

48757713,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=771900,1753229591,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48757713.jpeg,"Trump seals trade deal with Japan, comes with economically bizarre conditions",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-seals-trade-deal-with-japan/,"Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States and Japan had finalized what he described as the “largest Deal ever,” a sweeping trade agreement that includes new 15% reciprocal tariffs on all Japanese exports to the U.S. The news, of course shared by Trump on Truth Social, followed a weeks-long tariff threat campaign and came with a long list of unusual financial promises. According to Trump, Japan will inject $550 billion into the U.S. economy under this new agreement. He also claimed the U.S. would “receive 90% of the Profits.” The announcement, made from Washington, comes just days after Trump sent a formal tariff notice to Japan, warning that starting August 1, exports to the U.S. would be hit with a 25% tariff if no agreement was reached. That letter followed an earlier move on April 2, when Trump first revealed a 24% rate during what he called “Liberation Day” tariffs. The goal was clear: pressure Japan into offering more trade concessions or face even higher penalties. Trump’s statement on Tuesday confirmed that those tariffs would now instead be set at 15%, as part of a “reciprocal” deal. Markets respond, tech earnings and housing data next Trump also said Japan had agreed to open up its markets “to Trade including Cars and Trucks, Rice and certain other Agricultural Products, and other things.” He added that the deal would lead to the creation of “Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs.” But no timeline or breakdown was provided for either the investment or the projected jobs. The White House has not released any official documentation detailing how the $550 billion investment will be managed or how the profit-sharing model will work. The auto sector is one of Japan’s key export engines. In 2024, Japanese car shipments made up 28.3% of the country’s total exports. Under current rules, Japanese automobiles shipped into the U.S. already face a 25% tariff, the same applied to all other countries. Trump’s new deal doesn’t remove that number but repackages it under a broader reciprocal framework. Market reaction was immediate. Futures for the Nikkei 225 in Chicago jumped to 40,185, compared to the index’s last close at 39,774.92. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 futures climbed to 8,681, slightly above the previous close of 8,677.20. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng futures also edged up to 25,321, improving from 25,130.03. In the U.S., S&P 500 futures moved up 0.2% by Tuesday evening after the news broke. Dow Jones futures rose 99 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. The broader investor reaction reflected interest, not celebration. That’s because everyone’s eyes are on the earnings calendar. Alphabet and Tesla are expected to report on Wednesday after the market closes. These will be the first major updates from megacap tech companies this earnings season. Traders are watching closely, since tech has led the rally for years. Ahead of that, Hasbro is expected to report before the bell, followed later by Chipotle Mexican Grill and Mattel. The earnings flow is heavy this week, and so far, about 17% of S&P 500 firms have reported—with 85% beating expectations. Beyond corporate earnings, economic data is also on the docket. Traders are looking ahead to existing home sales data due Wednesday morning, which could offer a clearer view of the housing market’s direction, which is now more unaffordable than ever, as Cryptopolitan reported .

What's that about?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jim-cramer-does-a-full-180-on-meme-stocks/,"Wall Street’s Jim Cramer just flipped the script after years of bashing meme stocks like GameStop and AMC, by suddenly telling everyone on Tuesday night to stop shorting Kohl’s. Yeah, Kohl’s. The same department store chain that most people forgot even existed. “The shorts have clearly overstepped their boundaries with Kohl’s. They’ve run into a buzz-saw of their own creation,” Jim said. “Even now, I think they’d be wise to cover their short and move on before they have another GameStop on their hands.” That statement came right after Kohl’s stock went nuts. Trading was so volatile on Tuesday that it had to be temporarily halted. Once the dust settled, shares ended the day up a massive 37.62%. According to FactSet, roughly 50% of Kohl’s outstanding shares were sold short, making it a prime target for a squeeze. Cramer calls out short sellers over Kohl’s stock surge Let’s be clear. Jim wasn’t praising Kohl’s actual business. He straight-up said that the company’s partnerships with Sephora or Amazon weren’t driving the stock’s movement. Instead, he argued that the stock was being bought because of how heavily it was shorted. According to Jim, this was purely a momentum play built around short interest. He pointed out that Kohl’s had been discussed on the WallStreetBets subreddit, the same place that sparked the infamous 2021 short squeeze. He said the playbook looked identical. Back in 2021, the GameStop squeeze cost hedge funds close to $20 billion, driven by retail traders banding together online to force short sellers into panic-buying shares to close their positions. And here’s the weirdest part: Jim used to hate this kind of stuff. He was one of the loudest voices calling out meme stocks as hype machines. He regularly said names like GameStop and AMC were being driven by emotion, not numbers. He dismissed the POTUS’ Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) as “overvalued” and said the moves weren’t backed by revenue or profits. Just a few years ago, Jim sided with the short sellers. He tried hard to talk down retail investor excitement during the GameStop frenzy. His 2021 take? Sell GameStop at $400. That got him roasted so badly online that a new meme was born: Inverse Cramer. Retail traders started doing the exact opposite of what he recommended. It became a whole thing. He was mocked all over Reddit, especially in the r/WallStreetBets community, for being the poster child of outdated investment thinking. So for him to now say hedge funds should “cover and move on” feels like a full reversal. He believes the short position doesn’t match Kohl’s fundamentals, or retail power. There’s debt, and sales are slipping, but the company isn’t falling apart. And that’s his issue. He doesn’t think the target makes sense if you’re betting on total collapse. Jim also called out hedge funds directly, saying they should’ve closed their shorts earlier this year when the stock dipped after Wall Street panicked about President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. That spring sell-off, according to him, was the time to exit. Not now. “In the end, the short sellers have the wrong target,” Jim said. “A company with declining sales and a lot of debt, but not one that’s about to fall apart, which is what you need if you were still shorting Kohl’s down here in the single digits.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-23 00:22:48

The first one is to introduce its own customized stablecoin, or accept a revenue-sharing deal with Circle based on the amount of USDC held on the platform. According to reports, Polymarket’s main drive for launching its stablecoin is to earn yield from the reserves that currently benefit Circle. By issuing a native token, the platform could keep that revenue in-house. Polymarket considering its own stablecoin. Stablecoin entry could enhance liquidity in prediction markets, providing native economic incentives. If executed well, this move could expand Polymarket's ecosystem and increase retention by creating new DeFi opportunities. pic.twitter.com/qheRiixv0Q — OnlyCalls (@0xOnlyCalls) July 22, 2025 Stablecoins have become the main beneficiaries of Polymarket’s rising activity. All transactions on the platform settle in USDC on the Polygon network. This ensures a steady transaction flow and sustained demand for the token. A deal with Circle or customize its stablecoin? Legislation around stablecoins passed in the US last week makes issuing a stablecoin an attractive business proposition for crypto native firms and more traditional finance players alike. To that end, launching a stablecoin is hard for many companies. For instance, Circle, the company that created USDC, is known to be ending revenue-sharing deals with exchanges, payment companies, and other fintechs. The reason behind this is to stay competitive in a field that is changing so quickly. A Polymarket representative said no decision has yet been made on the stablecoin question. However, of the two options, for Polymarket, issuing its own stablecoin is a much easier lift from a regulatory standpoint. According to a person familiar with the matter, “In the case of Polymarket, it’s a closed ecosystem and all they really need to do is to be able to exchange USDC or USDT into whatever their custom stablecoin is. They don’t have to worry about the last mile on ramp and off ramp. That’s a very simple thing to build, and easy to secure and control.” In addition, Polymarket has grown in popularity. According to SimilarWeb, over $8 billion in bets were placed during last year’s US election cycle, and the site saw nearly 16 million visits in May. Also, Polymarket announced plans to overhaul its reward and oracle-resolution system. The new framework, part of its 2028 Election Holding Rewards program, will offer more accurate pricing and easier migration for users. Meanwhile, Polymarket wants to buy QCEX, a CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse, in a $112 million deal that clears the path for regulated operations in the world’s largest financial market. It is based in the US. This follows the closure of civil and criminal investigations into its allowing US-based customers to place bets on its platform. Polymarket has handled more than $14 billion in trades since its launch. It had more than $1 billion in monthly volume in May alone, with 20,000 to 30,000 active daily traders. After Trump’s re-election in November 2024, the platform moved $2.5 billion in a single month, making it one of its busiest times. During that surge, there were a lot of USDC transfers and more action on the bridges to move money around.

A significant transfer involving a substantial amount of PENDLE token has caught the eye of market observers, particularly given its potential link to a prominent digital asset investment firm. This move, which saw millions of dollars worth of PENDLE tokens shifting to a major exchange, underscores the dynamic nature of crypto investments and the strategic maneuvers employed by large players. What Just Happened with the PENDLE Token Transfer? In a development that quickly circulated through crypto communities, an address believed to be associated with Arca, a well-known digital asset investment firm, executed a notable transfer of PENDLE tokens. According to on-chain analytics shared by @EmberCN on X , approximately 2.183 million PENDLE tokens, valued at an impressive $10.44 million, were moved to the Kraken exchange just a few hours ago. This kind of large-scale movement often signals strategic intent, whether it’s for liquidity provision, portfolio rebalancing, or, as speculated in this case, profit-taking. Let’s break down the key details of this transaction: Token Transferred: PENDLE token Amount: 2.183 million PENDLE Approximate Value: $10.44 million Recipient Exchange: Kraken Suspected Origin: Arca-linked address Estimated Profit (at current prices): $2.13 million Such transfers are meticulously tracked by analysts because they can offer insights into the strategies of major holders, often referred to as ‘whales’ in the crypto space. When an entity like Arca, known for its deep research and strategic investments, makes such a move, it naturally draws attention from the broader market. Who is Arca, and Why Does This PENDLE Token Move Matter? Arca is a leading digital asset investment firm that focuses on providing institutional-grade products and services in the cryptocurrency market. They are known for their active management strategies, deep dives into crypto projects, and their ability to identify promising opportunities within the evolving digital asset landscape. Their portfolio often includes innovative DeFi protocols and emerging tokens, making their movements particularly noteworthy. The significance of Arca’s potential involvement in this PENDLE token transfer lies in several factors: Institutional Confidence: A move by a reputable firm like Arca can be interpreted as a validation of the PENDLE token’s potential or a strategic decision to capitalize on its performance. Market Impact: Large transfers to exchanges can sometimes precede significant price action, either due to increased selling pressure if the tokens are offloaded, or a strategic re-entry if the firm is preparing for future moves. Transparency in DeFi: While the address is ‘suspected’ to be linked, the very nature of blockchain allows for the tracking of these large movements, providing a degree of transparency that is unique to the crypto market. Arca’s investment thesis often revolves around yield-generating assets and innovative financial primitives, which aligns well with PENDLE’s core functionality. PENDLE is a DeFi protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield, essentially creating a market for future interest rates on various crypto assets. This unique value proposition has made it an attractive asset for sophisticated investors. Decoding the Profit Potential: A Closer Look at the PENDLE Token Gain One of the most compelling aspects of this specific PENDLE token transfer is the estimated profit it represents. If the tokens were indeed acquired at a lower price and are now being moved to an exchange for sale, the estimated profit of $2.13 million is substantial. This figure highlights the significant returns that can be achieved in the volatile yet rewarding cryptocurrency market. How is this profit estimated? Typically, on-chain analysts trace the acquisition cost of the tokens. If an address acquired 2.183 million PENDLE tokens at an average price significantly lower than the current market price of approximately $4.78 (at the time of the transfer), the difference constitutes the unrealized or realized profit. This suggests that Arca or the linked entity had a long-term or well-timed investment in PENDLE, demonstrating successful asset management. This profit realization could serve multiple purposes for Arca: Capital Reallocation: Freeing up capital for new investment opportunities within the crypto space. Fund Management: Distributing returns to investors or rebalancing fund portfolios. Risk Management: Taking profits off the table to reduce exposure to a single asset, especially after a significant price run. The ability to secure such a substantial profit underscores the expertise required to navigate the complexities of decentralized finance and identify high-growth potential assets like the PENDLE token. The Wider Implications: What Does This PENDLE Token Activity Mean for the Market? A transfer of this magnitude, especially one linked to a prominent institutional player, can have ripple effects across the market. While not a definitive signal for immediate price action, it contributes to the overall market sentiment and liquidity dynamics of the PENDLE token. Here are some potential implications: Increased Liquidity on Kraken: Moving PENDLE tokens to Kraken increases the supply available for trading on that exchange, potentially facilitating larger buy or sell orders. Market Sentiment: Depending on how the market interprets the move (profit-taking vs. rebalancing), it can influence investor confidence. Some might see it as a bearish signal if they believe a sell-off is imminent, while others might view it as healthy profit-taking by a smart money entity. On-Chain Analytics Interest: This event will undoubtedly lead more analysts to scrutinize PENDLE’s on-chain data, looking for further insights into large holder behavior and potential future movements. Attention to PENDLE Protocol: Such high-profile transfers bring increased attention to the PENDLE protocol itself, potentially drawing new investors or developers to explore its unique yield-trading capabilities. It’s crucial for individual investors to remember that while tracking ‘whale’ movements can be insightful, these are just one piece of the puzzle. Institutional strategies are complex and often involve hedging, diversification, and long-term outlooks that differ from those of retail investors. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Actionable Insights from PENDLE Token Movements For investors looking to make sense of these large transfers and improve their own strategies, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analytics accounts and news sources. Understanding the flow of funds is a vital part of crypto market analysis. Understand the Asset: Before investing, thoroughly research the PENDLE token and its underlying protocol. What problem does it solve? What is its utility? What are its tokenomics? Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Even successful institutional investors like Arca diversify their holdings. Practice Risk Management: Set stop-losses, take profits strategically, and only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While large transfers provide data points, they should not be the sole basis for your investment decisions. Always conduct your own thorough due diligence. The crypto market rewards those who are diligent, patient, and adaptable. Observing the moves of entities like Arca can provide valuable context, but ultimately, a well-informed and disciplined approach is key to long-term success. The transfer of $10.44 million in PENDLE tokens from an Arca-linked address to Kraken is more than just a large transaction; it’s a window into the strategic thinking of institutional players in the digital asset space. With an estimated profit of $2.13 million, this move highlights the lucrative opportunities within the DeFi sector, particularly for innovative protocols like PENDLE. While the immediate market impact remains to be seen, this event serves as a reminder of the constant flow of capital, the importance of on-chain analytics, and the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. As the market matures, understanding these high-value transfers becomes increasingly vital for both seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike.

On one side, we see XRP and DOGE hitting resistance levels and struggling to push higher. On the other, a new player – MAGACOIN FINANCE – is drawing attention thanks to a booming presale, a passionate community, and speculation about potential listings on centralized exchanges. Source: CoinGecko MAGACOIN FINANCE: More Than Just a Meme MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaking up the meme coin scene. It’s not just another viral token, it’s politically inspired and driven by its community. Unlike many meme-based projects, it’s got some serious structure: no taxes on transactions, audited smart contracts, and a fixed supply model. Plus, there’s no venture capital backing, which has helped it gain trust among grassroots investors. Inspired by the “Make America Great Again” movement, this coin has carved out a niche as a political statement wrapped in blockchain technology. Interest is rising quickly, with site traffic hitting new highs and over 20,000 members now chatting in its Telegram groups. There’s even quiet talk about potential listings on bigger platforms, which could bring more eyes and capital its way. Challenging the Old Guard While XRP enjoys backing from institutional players and DOGE maintains its pop culture clout (thanks in part to Elon Musk and government buzz), MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving its own lane. It merges meme-driven virality with solid tokenomics, and that combo could be enough to disrupt the current hierarchy. Where XRP and DOGE have already cemented their legacy, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the hunger of a new generation of crypto investors—tech-savvy, politically tuned-in, and ready to back a mission. Buzz Backed by Real Momentum There’s genuine excitement behind this project. Its social footprint is growing fast, with more people jumping into the conversation daily. Analysts are starting to draw parallels to the early days of SHIBA and DOGE . And it’s not just talk—the presale numbers and online engagement speak volumes. With a zero-tax model and clear plans for DeFi integration, this isn’t just a meme play, it’s a serious contender. The Telegram community is buzzing around the clock, and the project’s online visibility keeps trending upward. Why It’s One to Watch in 2025 XRP and DOGE aren’t going anywhere but they’re also not moving much right now. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is all about momentum. It’s building a community, generating organic interest, and offering a fresh approach to meme-driven crypto. If you’re scanning the horizon for what’s next, this rising altcoin deserves a closer look.

At its heart, investor sentiment can swing wildly between euphoria and despair, influencing price movements and market trends. This is where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index steps in, offering a crucial barometer for understanding the prevailing mood among crypto participants. As of July 23, this insightful index, provided by the software development platform Alternative, has climbed to a notable 74, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This upward movement, a two-point jump from the previous day, signals a palpable shift towards optimism and confidence in the digital asset space. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Your Market Mood Ring The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a sophisticated tool designed to capture the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it paints a vivid picture: a score of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ indicating widespread panic, selling pressure, and a general lack of confidence. Conversely, a score of 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ suggesting that investors are overly optimistic, potentially leading to irrational exuberance and speculative buying. This index serves as a valuable counter-indicator for many seasoned traders. The adage ‘be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful’ perfectly encapsulates its philosophy. When the market is gripped by extreme fear, it might present a buying opportunity for those brave enough to go against the crowd. Conversely, a period of extreme greed could signal a time for caution or even profit-taking, as markets tend to overextend. Decoding the Current 74 ‘Greed’ Score: What Does it Mean? A reading of 74 places the Crypto Fear & Greed Index squarely within the ‘Greed’ zone, just shy of ‘Extreme Greed.’ This indicates a strong positive sentiment dominating the market. Investors are feeling confident, perhaps buoyed by recent price gains, positive news, or a general sense of stability returning to the crypto ecosystem. This level of ‘Greed’ suggests: Increased Buying Pressure: More participants are looking to enter or increase their positions, expecting further price appreciation. Reduced Volatility (for now): While greed can lead to eventual volatility, the current state might reflect a period of sustained upward momentum without extreme panic selling. Market Optimism: A belief that the worst is over and that a bullish trend is either underway or imminent. Potential for FOMO: The Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) can become a significant driver at these levels, as people see others profiting and want to join in. While optimism is generally a good sign, a high ‘Greed’ score also warrants a degree of caution. History shows that prolonged periods of high greed can often precede market corrections, as irrational exuberance gives way to profit-taking or a sudden shift in sentiment. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? A Transparent Look The strength of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach to sentiment analysis. Alternative, the platform behind the index, meticulously aggregates data from six distinct factors, each weighted differently to contribute to the final score. Understanding these components is key to appreciating the index’s comprehensive nature: Factor Weighting How it Influences the Index Volatility 25% Measures current Bitcoin volatility and max drawdowns. High volatility often signals fear; low volatility can suggest complacency or stability. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes current volume and market momentum compared to average values. High buying volume and strong upward momentum indicate greed. Social Media 15% Scans various social media platforms (e.g., Twitter) for crypto-related hashtags, sentiment analysis, and interaction rates. Increased positive sentiment and engagement suggest greed. Surveys 15% Polls investors on their current market sentiment. ( Note: Currently paused due to data collection challenges and ensuring reliability. ) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Examines Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. Rising dominance can indicate fear (as investors flee altcoins to ‘safer’ Bitcoin) or greed (as Bitcoin leads a bull run). Google Trends 10% Analyzes search query trends for terms related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Spikes in ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might indicate fear, while ‘buy Bitcoin’ could suggest greed. Each of these factors provides a unique lens through which to view market psychology, and their combined weight offers a holistic picture of prevailing sentiment. The temporary pausing of surveys highlights the index provider’s commitment to data integrity, ensuring that only reliable and robust information contributes to the final score. Why Does Market Sentiment Matter for Crypto Investors? Understanding market sentiment, as illuminated by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , is paramount for any investor navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. It’s not just about knowing whether prices are going up or down; it’s about grasping the underlying psychological forces that often dictate those movements. Here’s why sentiment holds such significant sway: Behavioral Economics in Action: Human emotions like fear and greed are powerful drivers. Fear can lead to panic selling, driving prices down irrationally, while greed can fuel speculative bubbles, pushing prices far beyond fundamental value. The index helps visualize these collective emotional states. Amplifying Price Movements: Positive sentiment (greed) can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, attracting more buyers and accelerating price increases. Conversely, negative sentiment (fear) can trigger a domino effect of selling, exacerbating downturns. Identifying Contrarian Opportunities: For savvy investors, the index is a key tool for contrarian investing. When extreme fear grips the market, it often presents an opportune moment to accumulate assets at lower prices. Conversely, when extreme greed is rampant, it might be a signal to consider taking profits or exercising extreme caution. Avoiding Emotional Traps: By providing an objective measure of market sentiment, the index helps investors detach from their own emotions. It encourages a more rational approach, preventing impulsive decisions driven by FOMO during bull runs or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) during corrections. Complementing Fundamental and Technical Analysis: While fundamental analysis (project utility, team, technology) and technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) provide insights into value and price action, sentiment analysis adds a crucial layer by explaining the ‘why’ behind market movements from a psychological perspective. Ignoring sentiment is like trying to sail without knowing which way the wind is blowing. It’s a critical component of a well-rounded investment strategy. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Actionable Insights for Smart Investors The current ‘Greed’ reading of 74 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. How should a prudent investor react when optimism is high? Benefits of a Greed-Driven Market: Potential for Further Gains: Strong positive sentiment can sustain upward momentum, allowing existing holdings to appreciate further. Confirmation of Trends: A rising index in conjunction with rising prices can confirm a healthy, albeit potentially overheated, bullish trend. Increased Liquidity: Higher participation often means more trading volume, making it easier to enter and exit positions. Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility Ahead: Markets in a ‘Greed’ phase are prone to sharp corrections as profit-taking sets in or a minor negative catalyst triggers a cascade. Irrational Exuberance: High greed can lead to speculative bubbles where assets trade far above their intrinsic value, making them vulnerable to significant price drops. FOMO-Induced Mistakes: The fear of missing out can compel investors to buy at peak prices, leading to substantial losses if a correction occurs. Actionable Insights for Your Strategy: While the market is currently riding a wave of optimism, a balanced approach is key: Consider Prudent Profit-Taking: If you’ve seen significant gains, it might be wise to take some profits off the table. Rebalancing your portfolio can help lock in gains and reduce risk. Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with the increased risk that comes with a ‘greedy’ market? Ensure your position sizes align with your risk appetite. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital by setting stop-loss orders. This automates selling if prices fall below a certain point, limiting potential losses. Avoid Over-Leveraging: Resist the temptation to use excessive leverage during periods of high greed. While it can amplify gains, it dramatically increases your risk of liquidation during a sudden downturn. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and even traditional assets can cushion the impact of a market correction. Focus on Fundamentals: Don’t let sentiment overshadow fundamental analysis. Invest in projects with strong technology, clear use cases, and solid teams, rather than just chasing hype. Stay Informed, Not Emotional: Continuously monitor news, regulatory developments, and broader economic indicators. Use the index as a tool, not as your sole decision-maker. Beyond the Index: Complementary Market Indicators to Watch While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides invaluable insight into market psychology, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. A truly comprehensive investment strategy incorporates several other key indicators to gain a holistic view of the market’s health and direction: Trading Volume: High trading volume accompanying price movements indicates strong conviction. If prices are rising on low volume, it might be a less sustainable trend. On-Chain Metrics: Data directly from blockchain networks can reveal deep insights. This includes active addresses, transaction counts, whale movements (large holders), exchange inflows/outflows, and mining difficulty. These metrics can often provide a clearer picture of fundamental network health and adoption. Market Capitalization: Monitoring the total market cap of individual cryptocurrencies and the overall crypto market provides a sense of scale and growth. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Developments: New regulations or enforcement actions can have a profound effect on market sentiment and asset prices. Staying updated on legislative changes is crucial. Technical Analysis: Studying price charts, patterns, and indicators (like moving averages, RSI, MACD) can help identify potential support and resistance levels, trend reversals, and entry/exit points. By combining the psychological insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with these additional data points, investors can build a more robust and resilient strategy, making decisions based on a well-rounded understanding of market dynamics. The Future of Crypto Sentiment: What’s Next? The cryptocurrency market is notoriously dynamic, and sentiment can shift rapidly. While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently basks in the glow of ‘Greed,’ this state is rarely permanent. Several factors could influence its future trajectory: Major Regulatory Announcements: Positive or negative news regarding crypto regulation in major economies could significantly swing sentiment. Significant Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology or successful network upgrades could fuel further optimism. Global Economic Climate: A worsening global economic outlook, rising inflation, or interest rate hikes could push investors towards safer assets, leading to fear in crypto. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events like major exchange hacks, project failures, or geopolitical crises can quickly trigger widespread fear. Institutional Adoption: Continued influx of institutional money and traditional finance integration could sustain or even elevate the ‘Greed’ levels. Monitoring these external factors, in conjunction with the daily readings of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , will provide the most comprehensive outlook for what lies ahead in the crypto market. It’s a continuous dance between data, news, and human emotion. Conclusion: Mastering Your Emotions in the Crypto Market The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74, signaling a strong ‘Greed’ sentiment, is a testament to the renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency market. This index offers an invaluable lens through which to view the collective emotional state of investors, helping us understand the psychological undercurrents that drive price action. While a period of ‘Greed’ can be exciting and potentially profitable, it’s also a time for heightened awareness and strategic decision-making. By understanding how the index is calculated and what its current reading implies, investors can better navigate the market’s volatile swings. Remember, the goal isn’t to blindly follow the crowd, but to use tools like the index to make informed, disciplined choices, always prioritizing a well-thought-out strategy over impulsive emotional reactions.

News of an impending update on the Europe trade deal , as announced by former U.S. President Donald Trump, has certainly piqued the interest of investors and analysts alike. What might seem like a distant political maneuver often has tangible effects, influencing everything from investor sentiment to capital flows, which in turn can impact the volatile yet fascinating world of digital assets. Understanding the Significance of a Europe Trade Deal When we talk about a Europe trade deal , we’re referring to the intricate economic relationship between the United States and the European Union. These two economic giants represent a substantial portion of global GDP and trade. Historically, their trade relations have been complex, marked by periods of cooperation and tension over various issues, including tariffs, subsidies, and regulatory standards. An update, especially one coming from a figure like Donald Trump, signals potential shifts that could redefine these dynamics. Why is this significant? Consider these points: Economic Interdependence: The U.S. and EU are major trading partners. Changes in their trade agreements can affect supply chains, manufacturing, and consumer prices globally. Market Stability: Trade certainty (or uncertainty) directly influences investor confidence. A stable trade environment generally fosters growth, while disputes can lead to market volatility. Currency Fluctuations: Trade policies can impact the strength of the dollar and the euro, which in turn affects international investment and commodity prices. The original report, as cited by South Korean news outlet Edaily, simply stated that an update on a trade deal with Europe would be announced. This brief statement, however, opens up a world of speculation and anticipation about what specific details might be revealed and how they could shape the future of international commerce. What Could an Update to the Europe Trade Deal Entail? Given the history of U.S.-EU trade relations, an ‘update’ could cover a wide spectrum of possibilities. It might range from minor adjustments to existing agreements to more substantial shifts in policy. Here are some potential areas an announcement could touch upon: Tariffs and Trade Barriers One of the most common points of contention in trade negotiations revolves around tariffs. During his presidency, Donald Trump often utilized tariffs as a negotiating tool. An update could signify: New Tariffs: The imposition of new tariffs on specific European goods, aiming to protect domestic industries. This could lead to retaliatory tariffs from the EU. Reduced Tariffs: A move towards reducing or eliminating existing tariffs, signaling a more cooperative approach and potentially boosting trade volumes. Non-Tariff Barriers: Discussions might extend to non-tariff barriers, such as regulatory alignment, technical standards, or sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which can also impede trade. Sector-Specific Agreements Trade deals are often granular, focusing on specific sectors. An update on the Europe trade deal might highlight progress or changes in areas like: Agriculture: A historically sensitive area, with differing standards and subsidies. Automotive Industry: A major sector where tariffs have been a recurring threat. Digital Services: The burgeoning digital economy and data privacy regulations are increasingly becoming focal points in international trade discussions. Energy: Cooperation or competition in energy markets, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Dispute Resolution Mechanisms A crucial part of any trade agreement is how disputes are resolved. An update might address modifications to existing mechanisms or propose new ones to ensure smoother trade relations and prevent prolonged conflicts. How Does a Europe Trade Deal Impact the Crypto Market? At first glance, a trade deal might seem far removed from Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the cryptocurrency market, while often driven by its own unique narratives and technological advancements, is not immune to macroeconomic forces. Global economic stability, investor sentiment, and the flow of capital all play a role in its trajectory. Here’s how an update to the Europe trade deal could indirectly influence the crypto space: Investor Sentiment and Risk Appetite When global trade relations are uncertain or tense, traditional markets tend to become more volatile. This often leads investors to reduce their exposure to ‘risk-on’ assets, which can include cryptocurrencies. Conversely, positive trade news that fosters economic stability can increase investor confidence, potentially leading to greater allocation towards digital assets. Currency Fluctuations and Capital Flows Major trade agreements can strengthen or weaken national currencies. A stronger dollar or euro, influenced by favorable trade terms, might impact the attractiveness of alternative assets like crypto. Furthermore, capital flows—money moving between countries—can be altered by trade policies, influencing liquidity in various markets, including crypto exchanges. Inflationary and Deflationary Pressures Tariffs can lead to increased costs for consumers and businesses, potentially contributing to inflation. Conversely, free trade can lower prices. Inflationary environments can sometimes make assets with fixed supplies, like Bitcoin, more attractive as a hedge, while deflationary pressures might encourage a flight to safety in more traditional assets. Economic Growth and Innovation Ultimately, stable and fair trade promotes economic growth. A thriving global economy, spurred by a beneficial Europe trade deal , often leads to increased innovation and investment across various sectors, including technology and fintech, which can indirectly benefit the crypto ecosystem through wider adoption and development. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts While we await the specific details of this significant announcement, staying informed and prepared is key. For those invested in or interested in cryptocurrencies, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic News: Keep an eye on global economic indicators, central bank policies, and major geopolitical events. These often provide context for crypto market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. A diversified crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with market volatility. Understand the Interconnectedness: Recognize that while crypto has unique drivers, it’s increasingly integrated into the broader financial system. Major economic shifts will likely have some impact. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Reacting purely to headlines can be risky. Take time to understand the nuances of announcements and their potential long-term implications before making investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market thrives on information and sentiment. Understanding the broader economic currents, such as those influenced by a potential Europe trade deal , allows for a more informed and strategic approach to digital asset investments. Concluding Thoughts: Awaiting Clarity on the Europe Trade Deal The announcement of an update on the Europe trade deal from Donald Trump, while brief, carries substantial weight for global economics. Its implications, though indirect, are certainly relevant to the cryptocurrency market, which is increasingly sensitive to traditional financial market movements and investor sentiment. Whether it signals a period of renewed cooperation or heightened trade tensions, the details will undoubtedly shape economic narratives for the foreseeable future. As the crypto community continues to mature, its understanding of macroeconomic factors becomes ever more crucial. Keeping a keen eye on developments like this Europe trade deal update isn’t just about traditional finance; it’s about recognizing the intricate web of influences that can steer the course of digital asset adoption, innovation, and value. The coming announcement will offer valuable insights into the path forward for global trade, and by extension, for the markets that depend on its stability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a trade deal and why is it important? A trade deal is an agreement between two or more countries regarding the terms of their trade. It’s important because it sets rules for imports and exports, impacting economic growth, jobs, prices, and the competitiveness of industries. A well-structured Europe trade deal , for instance, can foster economic stability and growth for all parties involved. Q2: How do trade deals typically affect global markets? Trade deals can significantly affect global markets by influencing tariffs, currency exchange rates, supply chains, and investor confidence. Positive deals can boost market sentiment and economic activity, while negative developments can lead to volatility and uncertainty. The specifics of any Europe trade deal update will determine its market reaction. Q3: Is the cryptocurrency market directly impacted by trade deals? While not directly impacted in the same way as traditional equities or currencies, the cryptocurrency market is indirectly affected by major trade deals. This influence primarily comes through shifts in overall investor sentiment, risk appetite, and macroeconomic conditions that influence capital flows and liquidity across all asset classes, including digital ones. Q4: What should crypto investors look for in the upcoming Europe trade deal announcement? Crypto investors should pay attention to how the announcement is perceived by traditional financial markets. Look for signs of increased or decreased economic certainty, potential impacts on inflation, and overall investor confidence. These broader trends can often provide clues about potential shifts in the cryptocurrency market’s short-to-medium term trajectory. Q5: Where can I find reliable information about global trade agreements? Reliable information about global trade agreements can be found from official government sources (e.g., USTR for the U.S., European Commission for the EU), reputable financial news outlets, and international organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO). Always cross-reference information from multiple credible sources. Did you find this analysis helpful?

For a brief, exhilarating moment, BNB touched an astounding $799, setting a new all-time high. This remarkable ascent has captivated investors and analysts alike, showcasing the token’s robust performance and the growing strength of its underlying ecosystem. Last seen trading at $797.10 against USDT on Binance, this impressive surge of 3.57% over the past 24 hours underscores a significant period of growth and confidence in the asset. Understanding the Rise of BNB : A Foundation of Utility To truly appreciate BNB ‘s recent all-time high, it is essential to understand its foundational role and utility within the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Initially launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB transitioned to its own native blockchain, the Binance Chain, in 2019, and later became central to the expanded BNB Chain ecosystem (which includes the high-performance BNB Smart Chain, BSC). It is far more than just a trading asset; it is the backbone of one of the largest and most diverse blockchain ecosystems in the world. Reduced Trading Fees: One of BNB ‘s primary utilities is offering discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, a significant incentive for active traders. Participation in Token Sales: Holders can use BNB to participate in token sales on Binance Launchpad, providing early access to promising new projects. Staking and Governance: BNB can be staked on the BNB Chain for network security and governance participation, allowing holders to vote on key proposals. Ecosystem Utility: It powers countless decentralized applications (dApps), games, and DeFi protocols built on the BNB Chain, facilitating transactions and smart contract interactions. What Propelled BNB ‘s Ascent to $799? Several converging factors contributed to BNB ‘s impressive rally, culminating in its new all-time high. This surge isn’t merely speculative; it reflects fundamental strengths and positive market dynamics. 1. Robust Ecosystem Growth: The BNB Chain continues to expand at an astonishing pace. Its low transaction fees and high throughput have attracted a vast array of developers and users, leading to a thriving ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and Web3 gaming projects. This organic growth directly translates into increased demand and utility for BNB . 2. Strategic Token Burns: Binance regularly conducts BNB token burns, a process that permanently removes a portion of BNB from circulation. These burns are designed to reduce the total supply of BNB , making the remaining tokens more scarce and, theoretically, more valuable. This deflationary mechanism is a significant long-term price driver. 3. Positive Market Sentiment: The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced renewed optimism, driven by factors like Bitcoin’s halving event, growing institutional adoption, and clearer regulatory frameworks in some regions. As a blue-chip altcoin and the native token of the world’s largest exchange, BNB often benefits significantly from this positive sentiment. 4. Binance’s Continued Innovation: Binance, as a company, consistently introduces new products, services, and partnerships that integrate BNB . From new trading pairs to innovative financial products, these developments enhance BNB ‘s utility and appeal to a wider audience. The Significance of BNB ‘s All-Time High Reaching an all-time high is more than just a number; it is a powerful indicator of market confidence and a testament to the project’s resilience and growth potential. For BNB , hitting $799 signifies several key points: Investor Confidence: It reflects strong investor confidence in Binance’s ecosystem and the long-term viability of BNB as an asset. Market Dominance: It reinforces BNB ‘s position as one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, cementing its status as a major player alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ecosystem Validation: The new high validates the ongoing development and adoption of the BNB Chain, proving that its utility is recognized and valued by the market. Momentum for Future Growth: An all-time high often generates further interest and momentum, potentially attracting new investors and developers to the ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations for BNB While the recent all-time high is certainly cause for celebration, it is crucial to approach cryptocurrency investments with a balanced perspective. Like all digital assets, BNB is subject to certain challenges and risks: Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance, as a centralized exchange, faces ongoing regulatory challenges across various jurisdictions. Any adverse regulatory actions could impact BNB ‘s price. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. While BNB has shown strong performance, sharp corrections can occur, and investors should be prepared for price fluctuations. Competition: The blockchain space is highly competitive. While BNB Chain is robust, it faces competition from other Layer 1 blockchains and emerging ecosystems vying for developer and user adoption. Centralization Concerns: Despite efforts towards decentralization, some critics point to the perceived centralization of the BNB Chain due to Binance’s significant influence. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of BNB The future outlook for BNB appears promising, underpinned by continuous innovation and a commitment to ecosystem expansion. Binance’s strategic initiatives, coupled with the ongoing development of the BNB Chain, are likely to drive further utility and adoption. The roadmap for BNB includes enhancements to scalability, security, and decentralization of the BNB Chain. Furthermore, Binance’s ventures into new markets, integration with traditional finance, and focus on user-friendly Web3 solutions could significantly broaden BNB ‘s reach and use cases. As the digital economy evolves, BNB is strategically positioned to remain a pivotal asset, bridging the gap between centralized services and decentralized innovation. Actionable Insights for Investors For those looking to engage with BNB or other cryptocurrencies, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly research any cryptocurrency before investing. Understand its utility, technology, team, and market dynamics. Understand the Ecosystem: For BNB , this means familiarizing yourself with Binance’s services and the BNB Chain’s various dApps and projects. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk, high-reward assets. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements that could impact BNB and the broader crypto space. Consider Long-Term Potential: While short-term gains are enticing, assess BNB ‘s long-term potential based on its fundamental utility and ecosystem growth. Conclusion: A New Era for BNB BNB ‘s incredible journey to an all-time high of $799 is a powerful testament to its enduring strength and the vibrant ecosystem it supports. This milestone not only signifies a significant financial achievement but also reinforces BNB ‘s critical role in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. As the Binance ecosystem continues to innovate and expand, BNB stands poised for continued relevance and potential growth. While the crypto market always carries inherent risks, BNB ‘s foundational utility and strategic development position it as a key player to watch in the years to come, offering both exciting opportunities and important lessons in market dynamics.

Imagine a publicly traded company that not only provides essential healthcare services but also holds a substantial treasury of Bitcoin. This isn’t a futuristic dream; it’s becoming a reality. The recent definitive merger statement filed by KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings with the U.S. SEC signals the imminent creation of a unique Bitcoin treasury vehicle , promising to be a game-changer in both traditional and decentralized markets. What is a Bitcoin Treasury Vehicle and Why Does it Matter? At its core, a Bitcoin treasury vehicle is a publicly traded entity whose primary or significant asset holding is Bitcoin. Think of it as a new breed of company that offers investors direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional stock markets, without the complexities of directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. This innovative structure aims to bridge the gap between institutional finance and the volatile, yet lucrative, world of digital assets. Here’s why this concept is gaining traction: Institutional Access: It provides a regulated and familiar pathway for large institutions, pension funds, and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Liquidity and Transparency: Being publicly traded, these vehicles offer enhanced liquidity compared to private investments and operate under the scrutiny of financial regulators like the SEC, promoting transparency. Diversification: For companies like KindlyMD, integrating a Bitcoin treasury can serve as a strategic diversification of assets, potentially hedging against inflation or traditional market downturns. The merger between KindlyMD, an integrated healthcare provider, and Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin-focused company, is particularly intriguing. It represents a bold step, marrying the stability and essential nature of healthcare with the growth potential of digital assets, creating a hybrid entity unlike any other currently on the market. The Journey So Far: Key Milestones in this Bitcoin Merger The path to creating this innovative Bitcoin treasury vehicle has been marked by significant milestones, demonstrating the commitment of both KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings to this pioneering venture. On July 22, both companies officially announced via a Business Wire release that they had submitted their definitive information statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for their planned merger. This filing is a crucial regulatory step, signaling that the companies have provided all necessary details about the transaction, their financial health, and the future structure of the combined entity to the SEC and their shareholders. Key dates and developments: May Announcement: The merger agreement was first publicly announced in May. At that time, the vision to create a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury vehicle was unveiled, capturing the attention of investors and industry observers alike. Significant Financing Secured: A major vote of confidence in this venture came with the disclosure that the combined entity had secured a substantial $710 million in financing. This capital infusion is vital for supporting the operational needs of the merged company and, crucially, for building its Bitcoin treasury. Expected Completion: The companies anticipate completing the transaction around August 11. This timeline suggests a swift progression, indicating that both parties are eager to finalize the merger and begin operating as the new combined entity. This systematic approach, adhering to regulatory requirements and securing substantial funding, underscores the serious intent behind this ambitious Bitcoin merger . Who are the Visionaries Behind this Crypto Innovation ? Understanding the entities and individuals driving this merger provides valuable context for its potential impact. This isn’t just a simple corporate acquisition; it’s a strategic alliance aiming for significant crypto innovation . KindlyMD (NASDAQ: NAKA): An integrated healthcare provider, KindlyMD brings an established operational framework and a NASDAQ listing to the table. Their involvement adds an interesting layer to the merger, suggesting a diversification strategy that leverages their existing public market presence. It raises questions about how their healthcare operations will synergize with a Bitcoin treasury, perhaps aiming for long-term financial stability or even exploring blockchain applications within healthcare. Nakamoto Holdings: This is the Bitcoin-focused holding company at the heart of the digital asset strategy. Their expertise lies in the cryptocurrency space, particularly in managing Bitcoin assets. The company was founded by David Bailey, a notable figure who previously served as a crypto adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Bailey’s background suggests a deep understanding of both the political and financial landscapes surrounding digital currencies, positioning Nakamoto Holdings as a key driver in establishing the Bitcoin treasury vehicle . The combined expertise of KindlyMD’s public market presence and healthcare operations, alongside Nakamoto Holdings’ Bitcoin specialization and leadership, forms a formidable team poised to navigate the complexities of this pioneering merger. Potential Benefits and Challenges of this Unique Bitcoin Treasury Vehicle While the creation of a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury vehicle presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with its own set of challenges. It’s crucial for investors and observers to weigh both sides of the coin. Potential Benefits: This merger could unlock several advantages for investors and the broader market: Enhanced Market Accessibility: As mentioned, it simplifies Bitcoin investment for traditional investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges. Diversified Portfolio: For KindlyMD, it offers a pathway to diversify its corporate treasury beyond traditional assets, potentially capitalizing on Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Pioneering Model: This merger could set a precedent for other traditional companies looking to integrate digital assets into their core strategy, fostering further crypto innovation . Increased Transparency: Operating as a public company under SEC oversight means more regular reporting and scrutiny, which can build investor confidence in the digital asset holdings. Potential Challenges: However, the journey won’t be without its hurdles: Bitcoin Volatility: The inherent price volatility of Bitcoin means the value of the company’s treasury could fluctuate significantly, impacting its overall financial performance and stock price. Regulatory Landscape: While SEC-regulated, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in policy could impact the company’s operations or the perception of its Bitcoin holdings. Integration Complexities: Merging two distinct corporate cultures and operational models – healthcare and crypto finance – can be complex, requiring careful management to ensure seamless integration and operational efficiency. Market Perception: How will the market react to a healthcare provider with a significant Bitcoin treasury? It’s an untested model, and investor sentiment could be unpredictable. Navigating these challenges will be key to the long-term success of this ambitious Bitcoin treasury vehicle . What Does This Mean for the Future of Public Companies and Crypto? The KindlyMD and Nakamoto merger is more than just a corporate transaction; it’s a bold experiment in how traditional industries can integrate with the burgeoning digital asset space. If successful, this Bitcoin treasury vehicle could pave the way for a new era of public companies that actively manage digital assets as a core part of their financial strategy. It challenges the conventional wisdom of corporate finance and highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and investment asset. This development underscores a broader trend: the convergence of traditional finance with the decentralized world. It suggests a future where companies from diverse sectors might consider holding digital assets, not just as speculative investments, but as integral components of their treasury management, offering new avenues for growth and diversification in an ever-evolving global economy. Concluding Thoughts: A New Horizon for Investment The impending merger between KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings marks a truly significant moment in the financial landscape. By creating a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury vehicle , these companies are not just merging; they are pioneering a new investment model that combines the stability of traditional public markets with the dynamic potential of digital assets. This bold move could inspire other companies to explore similar strategies, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a corporate asset and opening up exciting new opportunities for investors seeking exposure to the digital economy. As the August 11 completion date approaches, all eyes will be on this unique entity, watching to see how it navigates the future and potentially redefines corporate treasury management for the digital age.

In contrast, Cardano (ADA)—once a top altcoin by market cap—is facing mounting market pressure and technical resistance, leading to a loss of momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Presale Contender Amid the Bitcoin ETF boom, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-potential project in the crypto presale space. The project features: Audited smart contracts ERC-20 compatibility with wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet A mission focused on financial empowerment, decentralization, and community ownership Notably, a majority of the token supply is allocated to presale participants, reinforcing a community-first tokenomics model. Its tiered pricing structure encourages early investment, with price increases at each completed stage, creating both scarcity and momentum. Thanks to these fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage successes like Solana and is positioning itself as one of 2025’s standout altcoins. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Fuel Market Interest BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, launched in early 2024, now accounts for more than 55% of all U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows. It currently holds 696,874 BTC worth over $75 billion out of the total 1.247 million BTC held by U.S. ETFs. Despite being smaller in size than BlackRock’s flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which manages $624 billion, IBIT generates more annual fee revenue: $187.2 million vs. $187.1 million. Fidelity’s competing ETF holds 201,346 BTC (around $21.7 billion), but since March 2024, BlackRock has more than doubled its holdings. Essentially, institutional and sovereign adoption continues to rise. U.S. ETFs now collectively manage $153.86 billion in Bitcoin. Public companies hold 856,029 BTC, private firms hold 421,641 BTC, and governments control 529,705 BTC, worth about $57.1 billion. With Bitcoin now trading above $110,000, speculation is growing that BTC could eventually reach $1 million per coin. Cardano Faces Regulatory and Market Challenges Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.6035, up 7.6% in the last 24 hours. Still, the project faces regulatory and technical challenges. The SEC has paused approval of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap (GDLC) fund, which includes ADA, injecting uncertainty into its short-term outlook. Despite that, derivatives data shows cautious optimism. Long-to-short ratio reached 1.10, its highest in over a month. Open interest rose over 7% to $861 million, indicating growing trader engagement. Technically, ADA is forming a falling wedge pattern, which is typically a bullish signal if it breaks upward. A confirmed breakout above $0.58 could push ADA toward $0.73, the June high. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains subdued at 45 and sustained upward movement hinges on improving technical strength. What Investors Should Watch The contrasting narratives highlight a market increasingly favoring straightforward Bitcoin exposure via ETFs and innovative, community-focused presale tokens, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. While established altcoins like Cardano maintain solid fundamentals, regulatory uncertainties and technical hurdles may temper their short-term performance. For investors seeking the next high-upside opportunity in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s combination of security, transparency, and compelling presale economics makes it a standout project to watch closely.

Bitcoin On-Chain Data Shows Mixed Outlook According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Chairman Lee, BTC exchange reserves have risen noticeably since late June. This sharp uptick suggests increased profit-taking activity, which could weigh on BTC in the short-term. Large holders and miners have also been ramping up their deposits since July 18. However, overall inflows to centralized exchanges remain relatively low compared to the levels observed during major market tops earlier this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets Meanwhile, the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) count continues to decline – a trend often interpreted as a sign of long-term accumulation. Investors appear to be consolidating their coins, reducing active transactions and indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. For context, a declining UTXO count typically reflects reduced short-term selling pressure as holders move BTC into fewer wallets rather than trading them. This behavior is commonly associated with an overall bullish market outlook. Chairman Lee also pointed out that institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows remain robust. Year-to-date (YTD), nearly $50 billion has flowed into Bitcoin investment products despite temporary pauses due to profit-taking. Data from SoSoValue shows that US-listed spot BTC ETFs have recorded four consecutive months of positive inflows, with more than $18 billion added since April 2025. Similarly, total net assets held by these ETFs now exceed $151.6 billion. Can BTC Still Eye $180,000 Target? From a technical standpoint, Chairman Lee highlighted the $116,400 area as the immediate support zone. The analyst remarked: A breakdown below this level could extend the correction toward $112K–$110K. On the upside, holding above $116K keeps the structure intact for another push toward $124K–$130K. The analyst emphasized that as long as Bitcoin defends the $110,000 level, the broader bullish trend will remain intact. Moreover, if ETF and institutional inflows gain further momentum, BTC could still reach the ambitious year-end target of $180,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Soar?

On-chain data indicates that long-term holders are accelerating distribution, while short-term investors are entering the market in hopes of benefitting from further upside – behavior that has historically preceded local tops. On the contrary, the Bitcoin short-term holder Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) suggests that there may still be room for further growth in BTC’s price. At press time, BTC trades at $119,241, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

People familiar with the situation anticipate that the odds of the regulators approving these updates are high. Following Apple’s updates on fees for its App Store, developers will now be required to pay a 20% service fee, a reduction from the initial 30% it had set earlier. Moreover, the fee will be reduced to at least 13% for its small business initiative. The tech company announced a reduced fee range of 5% to 15% for developers, directing its clients to deliver payments away from the App Store. Additionally, they could access links they need to help users find other suitable ways to make their payments. Apple updates its App Store fees and rules to avoid large daily fines In April, the EU antitrust regulators took legal measures against Apple for violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA). They alleged that the iPhone maker had set limitations for developers who were helping users find cheaper payment alternatives apart from the App Store. Apple was subjected to a 500 million euro fine worth $586.7 million. After receiving the fine, the tech giant had 60 days to change its restrictions to abide by the DMA’s regulations. Notably, the DMA is a European Union regulation designed for Big Tech companies to ensure fairness and competition in the market. According to the individuals who know the situation, the EU Commission will approve the changes in the next few weeks. However, this timing could change due to unavoidable circumstances. The EU watchdog stated that all options are still available. This came after they mentioned that they are still evaluating Apple’s proposed changes. As the iPhone maker made the changes to avoid large daily fines, it expressed disapproval of the EU regulators’ action of interfering with its App Store operations. Concerning the daily fine, it could have been subjected to a 5% fine on its average daily revenue in its global operations. This is about 50 million euros in a day. Apple disproves the EU Commission’s action against it On July 7, Apple took an initiative to go to Europe’s second-highest court after being fined, challenging the EU watchdog. The giant tech company vowed to pursue legal action against the regulators as it did not agree with the action they took against it. In a statement, the iPhone maker stated that they had submitted their appeal, arguing that the decision the EU Commission arrived at and the fine they had set against it were more than what is stated in the law. According to Apple, they made the changes only to prevent daily fines, and they will present the facts to the court. Otherwise, the regulator’s action pushes business rules that cause confusion among developers and greatly affect its clients, the company said. It further pointed out that their appeal demonstrated the regulator’s act of controlling its business operations. While the situation becomes uncertain as days pass, people await the regulator’s decision to approve or request more adjustments.

In the rapidly evolving realm where traditional finance meets digital assets, every regulatory pronouncement sends significant ripples. Recently, a pivotal development from South Korea has captured the attention of investors, asset managers, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts worldwide, particularly those keenly observing the burgeoning South Korea Crypto ETF market. This move underscores a persistent cautious approach from regulators, signaling potential shifts in how asset managers interact with the volatile yet lucrative cryptocurrency space. South Korea, a nation known for its technological prowess and robust financial markets, has consistently maintained a cautious stance on digital assets. This latest guidance from its financial watchdog is not merely an advisory; it’s a strong reinforcement of a long-standing policy, designed to protect investors and maintain financial stability. Understanding the nuances of this development is crucial for anyone involved in or considering investments within the digital asset ecosystem. What’s the Urgent Warning for South Korea Crypto ETF Managers? South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), the nation’s principal financial watchdog, has issued significant verbal guidance advising domestic asset managers to drastically limit their exposure to crypto-related companies within their exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This isn’t just a suggestion; it’s a clear directive reported by Herald Business, aiming to curb what the FSS perceives as excessive risk. The guidance specifically targets prominent crypto-linked firms such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, which are often included in broader tech or innovation-focused ETFs due to their significant market capitalization and association with digital trends. This move is particularly impactful because it targets indirect exposure. While direct investment in digital assets by regulated firms has been prohibited since 2017, many asset managers have found ways to gain exposure through publicly traded companies whose fortunes are tied to the crypto market. The FSS’s latest intervention is designed to close this perceived loophole, ensuring that the spirit of their initial prohibition is maintained across all investment vehicles, especially those accessible to retail investors. The implications for the entire South Korea Crypto ETF ecosystem are profound, as asset managers must now meticulously review and potentially overhaul their portfolios. The FSS’s caution stems from a deep-seated belief that the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies pose significant risks if integrated too closely with traditional financial products. This verbal guidance serves as a critical reminder that regulatory bodies are actively monitoring and adjusting their stances to mitigate potential systemic risks and safeguard investor interests amidst the rapid evolution of the digital asset space. Why is South Korea Reinforcing its Stance on Digital Assets? This recent guidance from the FSS is not an isolated event but rather a direct reinforcement of a foundational regulatory policy established in 2017. At that time, South Korea implemented a stringent prohibition that explicitly forbids regulated financial firms from directly holding, purchasing, collateralizing, or investing in digital assets. This long-standing stance reflects a deeply conservative regulatory philosophy, primarily driven by several key concerns: Investor Protection: The FSS prioritizes safeguarding individual investors from the extreme volatility and speculative nature often associated with cryptocurrencies. By limiting institutional exposure, they aim to mitigate potential losses for ordinary citizens invested in these funds. Financial Stability: Regulators are wary of the potential for systemic risk if traditional financial institutions become overly exposed to a highly volatile and largely unregulated asset class. This caution aims to prevent a contagion effect in times of crypto market downturns, ensuring the resilience of the broader financial system. Market Integrity: Concerns about illicit activities, market manipulation, and the lack of robust regulatory frameworks in the broader crypto space also play a significant role. By maintaining a clear separation, the FSS seeks to protect the integrity of the traditional financial system from potential vulnerabilities introduced by digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: By reiterating and expanding on the 2017 policy, the FSS provides clearer boundaries for asset managers, reducing ambiguity regarding acceptable levels of crypto-related exposure. The FSS’s latest move concerning South Korea Crypto ETF exposure reiterates their unwavering commitment to these principles. It underscores their belief that while digital assets may offer innovative opportunities, their integration into mainstream finance must proceed with extreme caution and under strict oversight to protect the broader economy. How Does This Impact Existing South Korea Crypto ETF Portfolios? The FSS’s verbal guidance has immediate and tangible implications for numerous existing ETFs in South Korea. Many local ETFs, particularly those categorized as ‘innovation’ or ‘growth’ funds, have over time accumulated significant exposure to crypto-related firms, often exceeding the newly emphasized, albeit verbally communicated, 10% threshold. This situation necessitates a rapid and comprehensive re-evaluation of current holdings. A prominent example highlighted in reports is Korea Investment Management’s ACE U.S. Stock Bestseller ETF, which reportedly holds a substantial 14.59% weighting in Coinbase. This scenario is not unique; it mirrors the portfolios of several other funds that have invested in companies like MicroStrategy, which holds significant Bitcoin reserves, or chipmakers that supply the crypto mining industry. For these asset managers, the guidance means: Mandatory Rebalancing: Funds exceeding the implied 10% limit will be compelled to reduce their exposure, likely through selling off portions of their crypto-linked stock holdings. This process can incur transaction costs and may need to be executed carefully to avoid adverse market impacts. Potential Market Impact: Depending on the scale of rebalancing required across the industry, there could be temporary selling pressure on these specific crypto-related stocks within the South Korean market, although the overall global market impact might be limited. Strategic Shifts: Asset managers will need to rethink their investment strategies for future ETFs, carefully considering the regulatory appetite for indirect crypto exposure and prioritizing compliance over potentially higher-risk, crypto-adjacent allocations. Client Communication: Firms will also face the challenge of clearly communicating these portfolio changes and the underlying regulatory reasons to their clients, ensuring transparency and maintaining trust. This development undeniably reshapes the investment landscape for South Korea Crypto ETF s, forcing firms to divest or significantly reduce their allocations in companies that derive a substantial portion of their business or value from digital assets. Navigating the Challenges: What’s Next for Asset Managers? For asset managers in South Korea, navigating this newly clarified regulatory environment presents a unique set of challenges and demands swift strategic responses. The verbal guidance, despite its informal nature, carries significant weight due to the FSS’s authority and oversight capabilities. Firms that currently exceed the recommended exposure limits must now devise practical strategies for compliance. These strategies could include: Portfolio Divestment and Restructuring: The most direct approach involves selling off portions of their holdings in crypto-linked stocks to bring exposure below the 10% threshold. This requires careful execution to minimize market disruption and optimize returns, potentially leading to a broader restructuring of certain fund mandates. Enhanced Due Diligence: Asset managers will likely implement more rigorous due diligence processes for new investments, specifically assessing the extent of a company’s crypto exposure before inclusion in an ETF. Diversification into Non-Crypto Assets: Firms might look to reallocate capital into other sectors or companies that do not have significant crypto exposure, thereby maintaining diversification within their portfolios while adhering to the FSS’s guidance. This could spur growth in other thematic ETFs. Engagement with Regulators: Some firms might seek clearer written guidance or engage in dialogue with the FSS to understand the precise parameters and timelines for compliance, especially given the verbal nature of the initial advisory. This proactive approach can help shape future regulatory interpretations. Innovation within Constraints: The challenge will be to continue offering competitive and attractive investment products while operating within these stricter boundaries. This might spur innovation in other asset classes or thematic ETFs that avoid crypto-linked assets entirely. This situation also sends a clear message to global crypto firms hoping to attract significant institutional investment from South Korea; the path to integration with traditional finance remains tightly controlled. The long-term implications for the evolution of the South Korea Crypto ETF market will depend heavily on how these asset managers adapt and innovate within these new constraints, potentially setting a precedent for other cautious jurisdictions. South Korea’s Stance vs. Global Trends: A Unique Path for Crypto ETFs? While some major economies have shown increasing openness to cryptocurrency investment vehicles, South Korea appears to be charting a more conservative and distinct course. The FSS’s guidance stands in contrast to recent developments in other parts of the world, highlighting a divergence in regulatory philosophies: United States: The U.S. has seen the recent approval and successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant step towards mainstream crypto adoption. While these are regulated products, they represent a willingness to integrate direct crypto exposure into traditional financial markets, albeit with stringent oversight and investor protection measures. Europe: European markets have long had a variety of crypto ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) available, offering investors regulated access to digital assets. These products, however, often fall under different regulatory frameworks than traditional ETFs, and their structure can vary significantly by country. Canada: Canada was an early adopter, approving Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs years ago, providing regulated access to these digital assets for investors and setting a precedent for North American markets. Singapore: Like South Korea, Singapore has adopted a cautious, albeit progressive, stance, focusing on robust regulation for crypto service providers rather than broad retail access to speculative products. South Korea’s approach, however, reinforces a national regulatory philosophy that prioritizes financial stability and investor protection above rapid integration of novel, high-volatility assets into traditional financial products. This creates a distinct trajectory for the South Korea Crypto ETF market compared to, for instance, the more open approach observed in North America or parts of Europe. This divergence highlights the varied global perspectives on how cryptocurrencies should be integrated, if at all, into mainstream investment vehicles, underscoring South Korea’s unique and somewhat stringent regulatory posture. It emphasizes that regulatory frameworks are not uniform and that each nation approaches this new asset class based on its own risk assessment and policy priorities, often shaped by past experiences and domestic market conditions. Investor Outlook: What Does This Mean for You? For both retail and institutional investors in South Korea, this FSS guidance introduces an important layer of consideration. If you are currently invested in ETFs that have exposure to crypto-related companies, it’s prudent to: Review Your Holdings: Take the time to understand the underlying assets of your ETFs and their specific exposure to firms like Coinbase or MicroStrategy. Fund prospectuses and fact sheets are key resources. Monitor Fund Changes: Keep a close eye on announcements from your asset managers regarding any portfolio adjustments or rebalancing necessitated by the FSS guidance. These changes could affect the fund’s risk profile and performance. Understand the Risks: This move highlights the regulatory risks associated with crypto investments, even indirect ones. Regulatory shifts can significantly impact the value and composition of your investments, emphasizing the need for ongoing vigilance. Consider Diversification: Ensure your overall investment portfolio remains diversified across various asset classes and sectors, reducing over-reliance on any single area, especially one subject to evolving regulations. While this guidance might seem restrictive, it’s ultimately aimed at fostering a more stable and secure investment environment. For those looking to gain exposure to digital assets, it underscores the importance of direct research into regulated crypto exchanges or exploring other compliant investment avenues that align with your risk tolerance and the evolving regulatory landscape of the South Korea Crypto ETF market. The Road Ahead: Future Outlook for South Korea’s Crypto Landscape The FSS’s latest verbal guidance is likely just one piece of a larger, evolving regulatory puzzle in South Korea. While the immediate focus is on existing ETF exposures, this move could signal a broader trend towards tighter controls on any form of crypto-related investment within the traditional financial system. We might see: Formalized Guidelines: The verbal guidance could eventually be followed by more formal, written regulations or amendments to existing laws, providing clearer parameters for compliance and potentially setting specific limits for indirect crypto exposure. Increased Scrutiny: Other financial products and investment vehicles that offer indirect crypto exposure, such as certain equity funds or even derivatives, might come under similar scrutiny, leading to a more comprehensive regulatory framework. Industry Adaptation: South Korean asset managers will be forced to innovate within these constraints, potentially leading to new types of ETFs that avoid crypto-linked assets entirely or focus on other emerging technologies that align with regulatory comfort levels. Continued Dialogue: The financial industry will likely continue to engage with regulators to seek clarity and potentially advocate for frameworks that balance innovation with risk management. Ultimately, South Korea’s consistent caution serves as a powerful reminder that the journey of digital assets into mainstream finance is not a uniform sprint but a series of measured, jurisdiction-specific steps. The nation’s approach to the South Korea Crypto ETF market will continue to be a fascinating case study for global regulators grappling with the challenges and opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the paramount importance of investor protection and financial stability. The recent verbal guidance from South Korea’s FSS marks a pivotal moment for the nation’s asset management industry and the broader cryptocurrency market. It’s a stark reminder that while global interest in digital assets continues to soar, regulatory bodies in some jurisdictions remain steadfast in their cautious approach. For asset managers, this means a period of re-evaluation and adjustment to ensure compliance. For investors, it highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory nuances that shape investment opportunities in different regions. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, South Korea’s measured steps will undoubtedly influence how other nations perceive and regulate the integration of crypto into traditional finance, particularly within the burgeoning South Korea Crypto ETF sector.

Recently, an address reportedly tied to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), an entity associated with the Trump family, executed a remarkable Ethereum investment, sending ripples across the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just a casual purchase; it’s a strategic accumulation that highlights growing institutional interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Unpacking the Strategic Ethereum Investment According to diligent on-chain analysis by @ai_9684xtpa on X, the address linked to WLFI recently acquired an additional 1,740 ETH, valued at approximately $6.5 million at the time of the transaction. This single purchase is part of a larger, more aggressive accumulation strategy observed over the past six days. In total, three WLFI-linked addresses have amassed a staggering 5,608.48 ETH, translating to a grand total of $19.46 million. These significant purchases were executed at an average price of $3,469.66 per ETH, showcasing a calculated entry point into the market. As of the latest reports, this substantial Ethereum investment has already yielded an unrealized profit of $1.45 million, demonstrating the potential gains inherent in well-timed crypto acquisitions. While the direct involvement of specific individuals is often subject to speculation in on-chain analysis, the association with the Trump family via WLFI adds a layer of intrigue to this massive accumulation. It underscores a broader trend where traditional financial players and influential figures are increasingly exploring and investing in digital assets, particularly in established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Why is Ethereum Attracting Such Massive Investment? Ethereum (ETH) isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s the backbone of a vast and rapidly expanding digital ecosystem. Its appeal to large-scale investors, including those making a substantial Ethereum investment, stems from several key factors: Dominant Smart Contract Platform: Ethereum remains the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its robust infrastructure supports thousands of projects and billions in locked value. Continuous Innovation: Ethereum undergoes constant development and upgrades, such as the recent Dencun upgrade, which aims to enhance scalability, reduce transaction costs, and improve overall network efficiency. These advancements solidify its long-term viability. Deflationary Mechanism: With the implementation of EIP-1559, a portion of transaction fees is burned, making ETH a deflationary asset under certain network conditions. This scarcity can contribute to its value appreciation over time. Path to Institutional Adoption: The ongoing discussions and potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in major markets signal a growing acceptance of ETH as a legitimate investment vehicle for traditional finance, paving the way for even larger capital inflows. These fundamental strengths make Ethereum an attractive proposition for those looking to diversify their portfolios into the digital asset space, especially for entities with substantial capital seeking long-term growth. The Ripple Effect: What Does Large-Scale Ethereum Investment Mean for the Market? When an entity like WLFI makes such a significant Ethereum investment, it rarely goes unnoticed. These large-scale acquisitions, often referred to as ‘whale’ movements, can have several implications for the broader crypto market: Boosted Market Confidence: Significant purchases by well-known or institutionally linked entities can signal strong confidence in the asset’s future. This can encourage other investors, both retail and institutional, to consider increasing their own exposure. Supply-Demand Dynamics: Accumulation on this scale reduces the circulating supply of ETH available on exchanges, which, if demand remains constant or increases, can exert upward pressure on prices. It’s a classic economic principle at play in the digital realm. Liquidity Impact: While large buys can temporarily reduce liquidity, they also demonstrate the market’s capacity to absorb substantial capital, reinforcing its maturity and depth. Precedent for Future Inflows: Such high-profile Ethereum investment actions can set a precedent, potentially encouraging other wealthy individuals or organizations to enter the market, viewing it as a validated asset class. It’s a delicate balance, however. While these moves can inspire optimism, the crypto market remains inherently volatile, and large entries or exits can also trigger significant price swings. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Considerations for Ethereum Investment While the recent WLFI activity highlights the lucrative potential of an Ethereum investment, it’s crucial for all investors to understand the inherent challenges and risks: Challenge/Consideration Description Market Volatility Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, are known for their rapid and often unpredictable price fluctuations. While profits can be substantial, so can losses. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations can significantly impact market sentiment and asset values. Technological Risks While robust, blockchain technology is not immune to potential vulnerabilities, network congestion, or smart contract exploits, though core protocol risks are low. Market Manipulation Large holders (whales) can, to some extent, influence market prices through their buying and selling activities, which can sometimes be perceived as manipulation. For any investor considering an Ethereum investment, thorough due diligence and a clear understanding of these risks are paramount. It’s not just about following where the big money goes, but understanding why and how it’s moving. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio: Learning from Major Ethereum Investments So, what can the average investor glean from this high-profile Ethereum investment? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never blindly follow the moves of large investors. Their risk tolerance, financial goals, and information access are likely vastly different from yours. Understand the fundamentals of Ethereum and its ecosystem before committing capital. Consider Long-Term Potential: Many large-scale crypto investments are made with a long-term horizon, focusing on the asset’s foundational technology and future growth rather than short-term price swings. Diversification is Key: While an Ethereum investment can be lucrative, it’s wise not to put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different assets and asset classes can mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. The crypto market, despite its growth, remains speculative. This event serves as a powerful reminder that institutional and high-net-worth interest in digital assets is not a fleeting trend but a growing reality that could shape the future of finance. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Ethereum and Institutional Adoption? The consistent flow of significant capital into Ethereum, exemplified by WLFI’s recent activity, paints a promising picture for the asset’s future. As regulatory clarity improves and technological advancements continue, we can anticipate even greater mainstream acceptance and institutional adoption. The potential for further institutional products, like spot Ethereum ETFs, could unlock even larger pools of capital, further cementing Ethereum’s role as a cornerstone of the digital economy. This ongoing accumulation underscores a profound shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. It’s a testament to Ethereum’s resilience, innovation, and its growing importance in the global financial landscape. While the path ahead may still have its share of volatility, the trajectory for a sustained Ethereum investment appears increasingly bullish. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is WLFI and what is its connection to the Trump family? A1: WLFI, or World Liberty Financial, is an entity that has been associated with the Trump family. While the precise nature of the association in the context of this specific crypto address is based on on-chain analysis, it signifies a connection to a high-profile, influential group. Q2: How was this Ethereum investment identified? A2: The Ethereum investment was identified through on-chain analysis, a process of tracking transactions and wallet activity on the public blockchain. On-chain analysts like @ai_9684xtpa use specialized tools to identify large movements and link them to known entities or patterns. Q3: What makes Ethereum an attractive asset for large investors? A3: Ethereum’s appeal stems from its robust ecosystem as the leading smart contract platform, its continuous technological upgrades (like Dencun), its deflationary tokenomics, and the increasing potential for mainstream institutional adoption through products like ETFs. Q4: How do large purchases like this impact the price of ETH? A4: Large purchases can positively impact ETH’s price by reducing the circulating supply on exchanges, boosting market confidence, and signaling strong demand. However, the overall market is influenced by many factors, and such buys are just one piece of the puzzle. Q5: Is this a sign that I should also make a significant Ethereum investment? A5: While large institutional investments can be a positive signal, it’s crucial to conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and assess your personal financial situation and risk tolerance. Investment decisions should align with your individual goals, not just follow the actions of others. If you found this article insightful, please share it with your network on social media!

For those deeply invested in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these broader macroeconomic currents is not just insightful, it’s crucial. A significant event poised to send ripples across various sectors, including potentially the crypto market, is the upcoming third round of US-China Trade Talks . These discussions are more than just political theater; they are fundamental to global stability and, by extension, investor confidence. The Stage is Set: Why These US-China Trade Talks Matter The global economic community is buzzing with anticipation following the announcement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Speaking on Fox Business Network’s ‘Mornings With Maria’ program, Secretary Bessent revealed that the highly anticipated third round of trade negotiations between the United States and China is scheduled to take place in Stockholm, Sweden, from July 28-29. This revelation, reported by Reuters, marks a critical juncture in the ongoing economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies. The choice of Stockholm, a neutral ground, underscores the sensitive nature of these discussions. It provides a setting removed from the direct political pressures of Washington D.C. or Beijing, potentially fostering an environment conducive to more open and productive dialogue. The stakes are undeniably high. The outcomes of these US-China Trade Talks could either pave the way for a more stable and predictable global trade environment or exacerbate existing tensions, leading to further economic uncertainties. For investors, particularly those in volatile markets like cryptocurrency, clarity and stability are often preferred over prolonged ambiguity. Decoding the Agenda: What’s on the Table for US-China Trade Talks? While specific details of the agenda for this round of US-China Trade Talks are often kept under wraps until closer to the date, historical patterns and ongoing points of contention offer strong indications of what will likely be discussed. Typically, these high-level negotiations encompass a range of complex issues designed to address trade imbalances and establish fairer economic practices. Key areas of focus often include: Tariffs and Trade Barriers: Discussions will likely revolve around the existing tariffs imposed by both nations and potential pathways to their reduction or removal, aiming to lower costs for businesses and consumers. Intellectual Property Rights: Protecting intellectual property and preventing forced technology transfers remains a significant concern for the U.S., seeking stronger enforcement mechanisms from China. Market Access and Subsidies: The U.S. often pushes for greater market access for its companies in China and addresses concerns about state subsidies that allegedly give Chinese companies an unfair advantage. Cybersecurity and Data Flow: As digital economies grow, issues related to data security, cross-border data flows, and cyber espionage are increasingly becoming part of the trade dialogue. Each of these points represents a significant hurdle, and finding common ground requires considerable diplomatic effort and a willingness from both sides to compromise. The success of these US-China Trade Talks hinges on their ability to navigate these intricate issues effectively. Historical Context: Previous Rounds of US-China Trade Talks The upcoming Stockholm summit is not occurring in a vacuum. It builds upon a complex history of economic interactions and previous rounds of US-China Trade Talks that have seen periods of both intense conflict and tentative cooperation. The trade relationship between the two giants has been marked by significant imbalances, leading to a series of trade disputes over the past decade. Earlier rounds of talks often grappled with deep-seated structural issues, resulting in partial agreements that sometimes failed to fully address core grievances. The challenges have been multifaceted, ranging from differing economic models and state intervention in markets to concerns over transparency and compliance with international trade norms. Understanding this historical backdrop is essential to appreciating the significance of the Stockholm meeting. It highlights the persistent nature of the issues at hand and the formidable task facing negotiators as they strive to forge a more equitable and sustainable trade relationship. Potential Outcomes: Navigating the Future of US-China Trade Talks As the world watches, the possible outcomes of these US-China Trade Talks are varied, each carrying distinct implications for global markets. Optimistically, a breakthrough could lead to a significant de-escalation of trade tensions, potentially resulting in the reduction of tariffs and a renewed commitment to fair trade practices. Such an outcome would likely inject a wave of confidence into global supply chains, reduce business uncertainty, and stimulate economic growth. Conversely, a stalemate or, worse, a breakdown in negotiations could see a re-escalation of trade hostilities. This might involve the imposition of new tariffs, further restrictions on technology exchange, and a deepening of economic decoupling. Such a scenario would undoubtedly trigger market volatility, disrupt supply chains, and potentially slow global economic recovery. The nuanced nature of these discussions means that even partial agreements or commitments to further dialogue could be viewed as a positive step, preventing a complete collapse of negotiations. Global Repercussions: How US-China Trade Talks Ripple Across Markets The ripple effects of the US-China Trade Talks extend far beyond the direct participants, influencing everything from manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia to commodity prices in Africa. Global supply chains, already strained by recent geopolitical events and the pandemic, are particularly sensitive to the trade climate between these two economic powerhouses. Any significant shift in trade policy could lead to reconfigurations, impacting production costs, consumer prices, and overall economic efficiency worldwide. Traditional financial markets, including equities, bonds, and currencies, react almost immediately to news from these talks. Positive developments often lead to rallies as investor confidence grows, while negative news can trigger sell-offs. For the cryptocurrency market, the connection, while sometimes indirect, is profound. A stable global economic environment, fostered by constructive trade relations, tends to create a ‘risk-on’ sentiment, encouraging investment in more speculative assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Conversely, increased trade tensions and economic uncertainty often lead investors to seek ‘safe-haven’ assets, or to reduce their exposure to volatile assets, potentially leading to downward pressure on crypto prices. Therefore, the outcomes of the US-China Trade Talks are not just about trade; they are about the fundamental health of the global economy, which underpins all financial markets, including the burgeoning digital asset space. Looking Ahead: The Road Beyond Stockholm for US-China Trade Talks The Stockholm round of US-China Trade Talks , scheduled for July 28-29, is unlikely to be the definitive conclusion to the complex trade relationship between the United States and China. Rather, it should be viewed as another crucial step in an ongoing, multi-faceted dialogue. Regardless of the immediate outcomes, the path forward will likely involve continued negotiations, perhaps at different levels and in various forums. Both nations have deeply entrenched economic interests and strategic objectives, making a swift and comprehensive resolution challenging. Future discussions may focus on the implementation of any agreements reached in Stockholm, or on tackling unresolved issues. The commitment to sustained diplomatic engagement will be key to preventing further escalation and fostering a more predictable global trade environment. The world will be watching closely to see if these talks can lay the groundwork for a more stable and cooperative future, benefiting not just the two nations involved, but the entire global economy. In conclusion, the upcoming US-China Trade Talks in Stockholm represent a significant moment for global economic stability. While the direct impact on cryptocurrencies may seem distant, the underlying health and predictability of the global economy profoundly influence investor sentiment and the broader financial landscape. A positive outcome could bolster confidence across all markets, including digital assets, while continued friction could exacerbate volatility. As always, staying informed about these critical macroeconomic developments is paramount for navigating the ever-evolving financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

However, the federal agency swiftly stopped the process before it could be completed. In a Tuesday, July 22 filing, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets took the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF through the approval process. However, after several considerations, a US SEC Assistant Secretary, Sherry R. Haywood, stopped the process , pointing out that the commission would reconsider. The SEC swiftly stops Bitwise’s crypto index fund approval process In a letter, Haywood stated that, based on Rule 431 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.431, the federal agency would reconsider Bitwise’s crypto index fund approval process. She then concluded that, following Rule 431(e), the order from July 22, 2025, is paused until the SEC decides differently. On its website , the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund revealed significant investments in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Polkadot, and others. Its investments in the digital assets are based on their market capitalization. Notably, the fund is trading with the ticker “BITW.” In the meantime, the SEC’s pause on its decision is not the first time this month. A similar scenario occurred when the commission decided whether to change the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC. Like Bitwise’s fund, this fund has also made significant investments in cryptocurrencies. It operates over the counter for qualified investors, with Bitcoin taking up around 80% of its total assets followed by Ethereum accounting for roughly 11%. In addition to the two cryptocurrencies, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund has invested in others, including SOL, ADA, and XRP, but at a very small percentage. Concerning the SEC’s decision on the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC, the commission agreed to Grayscale’s request to convert another of its closed-end funds into an ETF on an accelerated basis. Still, a day later it placed the order on hold. Grayscale has stated it continues to work with regulators to list. This occurs during Trump’s crypto stance as the SEC examines several crypto ETF proposals, including those that follow SOL and DOGE. Neither the Bitwise representative nor the SEC representative responded to a comment request. SEC’s recent delays in its decision have sparked controversy among individuals Scott Johnsson, a general partner at Van Buren Capital, and an ETF analyst, James Seyffart shared their thoughts in an X post on why the SEC implemented the halts. Based on Johnsson’s argument, the SEC was aware that Democratic Caroline Crenshaw, who has doubts about cryptocurrencies, could further complicate things, or these issues would be added to the deadlines for both proposals. He then shared an X post referring to both explanations as nonsense, arguing that they should not occur under SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Seyffart fully supported Johnsson’s argument. In an X post, he anticipated that the SEC would continue delaying things until they devised a suitable plan. Seyffart sparked hope that the SEC is considering establishing a listing standard for crypto ETFs, which would speed up the process of getting those funds listed. Under current rules, exchanges must file a 19b-4 form that initiates a review period that can take up to 240 days. However, reliable sources reveal that the suggested framework would shorten that timeline. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

And it Might Start a New Debate,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/23/asia-morning-briefing-the-first-ai-vs-btc-environmental-impact-numbers-are-here-and-it-might-start-a-new-debate,"Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Mistral AI recently offered a rare benchmark in the Artificial Intelligence industry's environmental disclosure , detailing the footprint of its flagship large language model, Mistral Large 2. Over 18 months, training and operating this model generated 20.4 kilotonnes of CO₂-equivalent emissions, consumed 281,000 cubic meters of water, and depleted 660 kilograms of antimony-equivalent materials, Mistral's report said. Notably, a single 400-token response from its chatbot, Le Chat, uses just 1.14 grams of CO₂, 45 mL of water, and 0.16 milligrams of mineral resources. But how does this compare to bitcoin's carbon footprint? After all, bitcoin's energy use has been the subject of significant debate and is often cited when establishing bans on bitcoin mining in jurisdictions . That makes AI inference seem downright frugal compared to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work engine. On average, one Bitcoin transaction emits between 600 and 700 kilograms of CO₂, consumes more than 17,000 liters of water, and generates over 130 grams of electronic waste. Zooming out, the entire Bitcoin network emitted roughly 48 million tonnes of CO₂ in 2023, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance . It also consumed over 2 billion liters of water and produced more than 20,000 tonnes of e-waste. However, the Cambridge Centre's numbers, although peer-reviewed, have been the source of considerable criticism and require important caveats. First, Bitcoin’s electricity mix is not monolithic. According to a survey of miners conducted by BTC Investment fund Batcoinz as of March 2023, Hydropower (23.1%), wind (13.9%), and solar (5%) collectively account for more than 40% of Bitcoin's energy consumption. The difference between the numbers is because surveys done by Batcoinz include off-grid generation. Nuclear energy, often considered carbon-neutral, accounts for another 7.9%. Gas and coal together represent 44%, but Bitcoin’s energy profile is more diversified than critics often assume. Second, LLMs may benefit from a cleaner grid by default. For example, nuclear energy comprises over 22% of the European Union’s electricity generation, which reduces the CO₂ emissions associated with model training and inference in EU-based data centers such as Mistral's. That advantage isn’t due to model architecture, it’s grid geography. A U.S.-based training run drawing from coal-heavy regions would present a very different environmental profile. So while the marginal footprint of using an LLM is vastly smaller than processing a BTC transaction, both operate within infrastructure landscapes that significantly shape their true environmental impact. Training frontier models like GPT-4 or Gemini can still require millions of GPU-hours and heavy water consumption, depending on location. Still, Bitcoin’s design, mining every 10 minutes regardless of demand, results in a fixed energy cost that scales with time, not usage. In contrast, AI’s marginal cost scales with the frequency of model usage. That distinction makes the emissions from a chatbot reply easier to amortize than those from a block reward. As global scrutiny increases over the environmental costs of computation, transparency initiatives like Mistral’s, provide important reference points. While proof-of-work is energy-intensive, the Bitcoin blockchain's halving mechanism steadily reduces the rate at which new coins are created, encouraging miners to become more efficient over time. Its environmental footprint should be weighed against the utility it provides in securing a decentralized, global financial network. Continued improvements in clean energy adoption and mining optimization will be key for both BTC and AI as they scale into core pillars of the digital economy. Market Movers: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $119,500, struggling to maintain momentum after last week’s all-time high of $123,100, as retail-driven sell pressure on Binance has pushed Net Taker Volume below $60 million and signaled growing bearish sentiment, according to CryptoQuant. ETH: Ether has pulled back over 3% to $3,696 after a multi-week climb toward $4,000, as technical indicators flash red and analysts question whether the rally can continue without a broader correction, despite ongoing institutional accumulation.

Recently, the spotlight has fallen on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) ecosystem, specifically due to a significant move by Trend Research. This investment firm, known for its keen focus on secondary markets and its affiliation with LD Capital, has made headlines by acquiring a substantial amount of ENS Token . This isn’t just any transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver that could signal a powerful renewed institutional interest in decentralized identity and the broader Web3 space. Let’s delve into what this acquisition means for the ENS Token and the crypto market at large, exploring the implications of such a bold move after a year-long hiatus. Understanding the Ethereum Name Service and its ENS Token Before we unpack Trend Research’s latest strategic move, it’s crucial to grasp the foundational concepts behind the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and the pivotal role its native ENS Token plays. Imagine trying to navigate the traditional internet using only complex IP addresses instead of memorable domain names like ‘google.com’ or ‘bitcoinworld.co.in’. That’s precisely the problem ENS solves for the decentralized web. What is ENS? At its core, ENS is a decentralized naming system built directly on the Ethereum blockchain. It translates those long, complex, and often intimidating cryptocurrency addresses (like 0xAbc123…) into human-readable, simple names such as ‘alice.eth’. This significantly enhances usability and accessibility for users interacting with dApps, sending transactions, or managing their decentralized identities. The Role of the ENS Token: The ENS Token is more than just a digital asset; it is the governance token of the Ethereum Name Service DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This means that holders of the ENS Token are empowered to vote on critical decisions, proposed upgrades, and the future strategic direction of the ENS protocol. This mechanism ensures that the project remains truly decentralized and community-driven, with its users and stakeholders directly influencing its evolution. Beyond Simple Names: The utility of ENS names extends far beyond mere address simplification. An ENS name can serve as a universal identifier across the decentralized web, linking to various Web3 resources. This includes decentralized websites, content hashes, social media profiles, and even verified identity information, effectively acting as a digital passport for the blockchain era. Trend Research’s Strategic $5.5 Million ENS Token Acquisition: A Deep Dive The core of this unfolding story revolves around Trend Research’s recent and significant purchase. According to the meticulous analysis of on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X , the investment firm executed a massive transfer, moving a staggering 203,105 ENS Token , valued at approximately $5.5 million at the time of the transaction, directly out of Binance. This substantial withdrawal occurred just hours before the news became public, underscoring the swift and decisive nature of Trend Research’s actions and their apparent conviction. What specific elements make this particular acquisition by Trend Research so remarkably noteworthy and a topic of widespread discussion within the crypto community? A Truly Sizeable Investment: A $5.5 million acquisition of any altcoin, especially one like ENS Token , is not a trivial sum. It represents a considerable allocation of capital from an institutional player, signaling a strong belief in the asset’s future potential and a significant level of conviction in the Ethereum Name Service project. The ‘First Acquisition in a Year’ Factor: Perhaps the most compelling aspect of this transaction is its timing. This marks Trend Research’s first recorded ENS Token acquisition in approximately a year. Their previous engagement with the token saw them reportedly stepping back from significant involvement. This re-entry, after a prolonged period of absence, is particularly significant. It strongly suggests a fundamental shift in their market outlook, a renewed assessment of ENS’s value proposition, or perhaps newfound confidence in its future trajectory and growth prospects. The Power of On-Chain Transparency: One of the inherent strengths of blockchain technology is its transparency. The public and immutable nature of these transactions allows dedicated on-chain analysts like @ai_9684xtpa to track, verify, and report such significant movements. This provides invaluable real-time insights into institutional investment strategies, allowing the wider market to observe where ‘smart money’ might be flowing. Why Now? Analyzing the Motives Behind the ENS Token Buy The precise timing of Trend Research’s decisive re-entry into the ENS Token market, following a year of relative inactivity, naturally prompts intriguing questions. What underlying factors might be driving this renewed and substantial interest? Several compelling possibilities emerge when analyzing the current crypto landscape and the evolving Web3 ecosystem: 1. Resurgent Optimism in Web3 and Decentralized Identity: The broader cryptocurrency market has recently demonstrated robust signs of recovery and a rekindled enthusiasm for foundational Web3 infrastructure projects. As the decentralized ecosystem continues its journey towards maturity, the critical importance of decentralized identity solutions and user-friendly interfaces, areas where ENS excels, becomes increasingly self-evident. Institutional investors, recognizing this macro trend, might be strategically positioning themselves to capitalize on an anticipated surge in mainstream Web3 adoption. By investing in core infrastructure projects like ENS, they aim to secure a stake in the fundamental building blocks of the next generation of the internet. 2. Strategic Positioning for Long-Term Growth: It’s highly probable that Trend Research has identified specific, powerful catalysts for future ENS Token growth. These could include upcoming protocol upgrades that enhance ENS’s functionality, increased integration with major decentralized applications (dApps), or a general, sustained uptick in .eth domain registrations driven by wider Web3 onboarding. Their substantial investment, particularly after a period of absence, strongly implies a long-term investment horizon. This suggests they are looking beyond short-term price fluctuations and are instead focused on the enduring, fundamental value proposition and utility that ENS offers to the decentralized digital world. 3. Attractive Valuation and Market Opportunity: Following a period of market consolidation and perhaps perceived undervaluation, it’s entirely plausible that Trend Research views the current valuation of the ENS Token as an exceptionally attractive entry point. They might believe that the token’s price does not yet fully reflect its intrinsic value or its immense potential within the Web3 space. Given Trend Research’s specialized expertise in secondary markets, their team possesses a keen eye for identifying opportune moments for large-scale, strategic acquisitions, aiming to maximize potential returns as the market evolves. Implications for the ENS Token Ecosystem and Beyond Trend Research’s substantial ENS Token acquisition is not merely an isolated event; it carries several profound potential implications, not just for the token itself but for the wider decentralized identity and broader cryptocurrency landscapes: 1. Boosting Investor Confidence and Market Sentiment: Large, well-publicized institutional buys, especially from reputable firms like Trend Research, often serve as a powerful vote of confidence. This can significantly boost the morale of existing investors and potentially attract new capital from other institutional players and retail investors who closely monitor ‘smart money’ movements. This influx of positive sentiment could lead to increased demand and positive price action for the ENS Token . Such an investment also serves as a strong validation of the utility, long-term vision, and overall viability of the Ethereum Name Service project, reinforcing its position as a critical piece of Web3 infrastructure. 2. Enhanced Liquidity and Potential Market Stability: While a large withdrawal of ENS Token from an exchange might initially reduce immediate trading liquidity on that specific platform, Trend Research’s act of holding such a significant amount of the token outside of immediate trading venues could signal a long-term commitment. This long-term holding strategy, if continued by other institutions, could contribute to greater overall market stability for the asset by reducing short-term speculative selling pressure. 3. Signalling a Broader Trend in Decentralized Identity: This bold move by Trend Research could very well be a precursor to a wider, more pronounced institutional embrace of decentralized identity solutions. As more traditional and crypto-native firms alike begin to fully recognize the paramount importance of self-sovereign identity and user-owned data in the digital age, projects like ENS are poised to garner significantly more attention and investment. 4. Potential for Future Developments and Ecosystem Growth: An increased influx of institutional capital into the ENS Token could indirectly provide additional resources and support for further development, more aggressive marketing initiatives, and broader expansion efforts by the ENS DAO. This financial backing could accelerate innovation within the ecosystem, leading to new features, partnerships, and increased utility for ENS names. Challenges and Considerations for ENS Token’s Future While the recent acquisition by Trend Research is undeniably a positive development, it’s equally important for investors and enthusiasts to maintain a balanced perspective and consider potential challenges and factors that could influence the future trajectory of ENS Token : Inherent Market Volatility: Despite growing institutional involvement, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile and susceptible to rapid price swings. Even with significant institutional backing, ENS Token prices can be subject to broad market sentiment shifts, unexpected macroeconomic factors, and regulatory news. Evolving Competition: While ENS holds a leading position in the decentralized naming space, it is not without competition. Other projects are actively exploring and developing alternative decentralized identity solutions. ENS must consistently innovate, expand its feature set, and demonstrate compelling utility to maintain and strengthen its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving landscape. Dependence on Utility Growth: The long-term fundamental value of the ENS Token is inextricably linked to the continued adoption and expanding utility of ENS names. If the growth rate of Web3 applications, dApp integrations, or .eth domain registrations were to slow significantly, it could potentially impact the token’s long-term price trajectory. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) is still in its nascent stages and is constantly evolving. Unforeseen regulatory changes or stringent new frameworks could present challenges for projects like ENS, requiring adaptability and proactive engagement. Historical Context: Trend Research’s Past with ENS Token Trend Research’s current substantial acquisition is particularly intriguing when viewed through the lens of their past relationship with the ENS Token . Reports indicate that approximately a year ago, the firm had reportedly stepped back from significant involvement or large-scale accumulation of the token. This historical context suggests that their recent re-engagement is not a casual decision but rather a strategic reassessment. This pivot likely stems from a comprehensive evaluation of current market conditions, internal proprietary analysis, or perhaps significant new developments within the ENS ecosystem that have made it an exceptionally attractive investment opportunity once more. Their prior disengagement followed by this decisive re-engagement vividly highlights the dynamic and often opportunistic nature of institutional investment in the crypto space. Firms like Trend Research are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating opportunities, shifting their positions based on exhaustive market research, evolving risk assessments, and the identification of new growth catalysts. This return to the ENS Token signifies a profound belief in its renewed potential and a calculated bet on its future. Actionable Insights for Investors in the ENS Token Ecosystem For individual investors and enthusiasts who are actively monitoring or considering involvement in the ENS Token ecosystem, Trend Research’s recent move offers several invaluable key takeaways and actionable insights: Vigilantly Monitor Institutional Flow: Make it a practice to keep a close eye on significant on-chain movements by known institutional wallets or addresses associated with major investment firms. Such transactions can often serve as powerful leading indicators, signaling shifts in market sentiment or anticipating upcoming trends. Tools used by expert on-chain analysts like @ai_9684xtpa are invaluable resources for this type of intelligence. Deep Dive into Fundamentals: Never solely ‘follow the money’. While institutional interest is a positive sign, it’s paramount to conduct your own thorough due diligence. Take the time to understand the underlying technology, the core utility, and the long-term vision of projects like ENS. The enduring strength of the Ethereum Name Service’s decentralized identity solution is its true, intrinsic value proposition. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investments, particularly those of this scale, are typically long-term strategic plays. This implies that while short-term price movements for ENS Token can certainly occur due to market fluctuations, the true realization of its value might unfold over a more extended horizon as Web3 adoption expands and ENS integrates further into the digital fabric. Prioritize Diversification and Risk Management: As is always prudent in the volatile cryptocurrency market, ensure your portfolio is well-diversified. Only invest capital that you are prepared to lose. Even highly promising projects like ENS come with inherent risks, and a balanced approach is crucial for sustainable investment. The Bigger Picture: Institutional Interest in Decentralized Identifiers Trend Research’s substantial investment in ENS Token should not be viewed as an isolated financial transaction. Instead, it fits perfectly into a broader, compelling narrative that is gaining significant momentum: the escalating institutional interest in decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions. As the digital world increasingly grapples with issues of privacy, data breaches, and centralized control, DIDs offer a compelling, user-centric alternative to traditional, often vulnerable, centralized identity systems. ENS, as a leading and established DID provider built on the robust Ethereum blockchain, stands prominently at the forefront of this crucial evolution. Institutional players are increasingly recognizing the foundational and indispensable role that ENS plays in constructing a more decentralized, secure, and user-centric internet. This burgeoning trend extends beyond just naming services to encompass other vital aspects of Web3 infrastructure, signaling a significant maturation of the cryptocurrency investment landscape and a strategic shift towards projects that underpin the future of digital identity. In conclusion, Trend Research’s significant $5.5 million acquisition of ENS Token from Binance is far more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful and unmistakable signal. It suggests a strong resurgence of institutional confidence in the Ethereum Name Service and the broader decentralized identity space. This bold move, coming after a year-long hiatus, firmly positions ENS Token as a project to watch closely in the coming months and years. As Web3 continues its inevitable evolution towards widespread adoption, the foundational utility of ENS, coupled with this renewed institutional backing, could pave the way for truly exciting developments and a dramatic increase in mainstream adoption. Keep a vigilant eye on this space; the future of decentralized identity and a more user-controlled internet might be unfolding before our very eyes.

On the other hand, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a newcomer on the block, continues to draw into its presale, while legacy layer-1 Hedera (HBAR) struggles to keep its footing. For investors timing a Q4 allocation for maximum returns, the contrast could not be clearer. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Cycle Velocity While Bitcoin consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks primed for another breakout. The political memecoin is already at Stage 3 of its rollout and each tranche keeps selling out faster than the last. According to analysts, the demand is driven by the project’s unique advantages including capped 170-billion supply, zero-tax transfers, and independently audited contract give it a scarcity plus security profile rarely seen in memecoin land. Equally important, no venture-capital carve-out means every token rests in community hands, a major fuel for the political narrative that is driving its social buzz. Analysts tracking presales frame the opportunity bluntly: if exchange listings even approach the team’s informal target of $0.007, today’s entry would translate into a double-digit-times return, far outpacing conservative upside scenarios for Bitcoin during the same window. Bitcoin: High-conviction but Mature Institutional flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have steadied Bitcoin’s floor and revived talk of a push toward a new all-time high before year-end if U.S. rate cuts materialize. While there is significant positive sentiment around the flagship asset, even the most bullish analyst knows that any new high for BTC this year will not be transformational. It is unsurprising as no one expects BTC price to double in what is left of the year even as long-term price targets believe the crypto asset could be worth half a million or more in the next few years. Hedera Struggles More Obvious as Numbers Don’t Lie By comparison, Hedera’s native HBAR trades near $0.159, but the headline price tells only part of the story. Recent deep-dive research shows protocol revenue falling 5% quarter-over-quarter, with smart-contract and token-service income down more than 40%. Liquidity is evaporating as well: stable-coin supply on Hedera has collapsed 80% since May, leaving the network with its lowest DeFi runway of the year. Those fundamentals have prompted several analysts to turn barish on HBAR despite its recent 10% in weekly gains. The market experts argue that capital is rotating toward ecosystems that can pair narrative heat with on-chain growth which Hedera presently lacks. Reading the Road to Q4 Taken together: it is clear Bitcoin offers blue-chip resilience but limited torque especially in the short term while Hedera HBAR is cheap but slipping on core metrics. By comparison, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains an early-stage opportunity with a narrative that is still gaining speed and ready to rip. Among traders hunting an outsized Q4 payoff, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name now commanding the loudest bids.

I’m just looking at the charts,” he replied, arguing that Ethereum’s narrative faces “more acknowledged competition” than Bitcoin’s digital-gold storyline. At pixel time Ether changes hands at roughly $3,650 while Bitcoin trades just above $118,000, putting the ETH/BTC ratio near 0.031—toward the lower half of its five-year range. Related Reading: Institutional Demand Surges As Ethereum Sets New Inflow Records Schiff contends the ratio’s weakness reflects a structural bear market for Ether against Bitcoin. “I think Ether is in a bear market in terms of Bitcoin, and I think it just had a bear-market rally,” he told one user who pressed him for fundamentals, concluding: “So if you want to own crypto, selling Ether to buy Bitcoin makes sense.” Not everyone was persuaded. Veteran cycle watcher TechDev responded drily, “Thank you for your service sir,” reposting Schiff’s February “party is over” call that preceded Bitcoin’s spring rally. A Familiar Refrain—And A familiar Outcome Schiff’s latest chart-based admonition follows a string of bearish milestones that have mis-timed every major leg of Bitcoin’s secular advance. On 25 February he declared, “Turn out the lights, the #Bitcoin 100K party is over… the bear market is just getting started.” Less than five months later, Bitcoin still hovers comfortably above $118,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Explodes To $28 Billion—Altcoin Rotation Begins: QCP Only a month after that February warning he predicted a full-blown crash to $10,000 once gold reaches $5,000, reasoning that Bitcoin would capitulate “95 % from its 2021 peak.” In late 2023 he ran a Twitter poll and concluded—contrary to the vote—that Bitcoin would “crash before the ETF launch.” Spot ETFs were approved in January 2024; Bitcoin never looked back. Back in November 2018, with Bitcoin trading at $3,800, he insisted it could “easily drop another 80 % from here, and at $750 it would still be expensive.” The rest is history. Now, Schiff argues that Ethereum’s smart-contract dominance is eroding as Layer-1 competitors gain mind-share and as regulators inch toward approving other altcoin spot ETFs. Whether the latest call joins the growing archive of ill-timed bearishness will turn on the ETH/BTC cross. If altcoin rotation doesn’t continue, Schiff may finally chalk up a win; if the ratio rolls over, his chart-reading case for a relative trade into Bitcoin will be vindicated even as his absolute bear thesis remains unproven. For now, the market is reserving judgment. At press time, Ether traded at $3,677.

This pivotal announcement, shared by Bithumb on its official website, places the exchange at an impressive 90th position on a list traditionally dominated by industrial giants and conglomerates. This move is not merely a bureaucratic formality; it represents a profound shift in how cryptocurrencies are perceived and regulated within one of the world’s most technologically advanced economies. For anyone tracking the maturation of the crypto market, understanding the implications of Bithumb’s large corporation status is crucial. What Does Bithumb’s Large Corporation Status Mean? The designation of Bithumb as a ‘large business group’ (상호출자제한기업집단) by the KFTC is a powerful statement about the increasing mainstream acceptance and economic influence of cryptocurrency exchanges. Historically, this list has been reserved for companies with substantial assets, complex ownership structures, and significant market power, subjecting them to stricter regulatory oversight under South Korea’s Fair Trade Act. So, what exactly does this mean for Bithumb and the broader crypto industry? Enhanced Scrutiny: As a large corporation, Bithumb will face increased scrutiny regarding its internal transactions, shareholdings, and governance. This includes tighter regulations against unfair trade practices and cross-shareholding among affiliates. Transparency Requirements: The exchange will be subject to more stringent disclosure requirements, providing greater transparency into its operations and financial health. This could build more trust with both retail and institutional investors. Anti-Monopoly Oversight: The KFTC’s primary role is to prevent market dominance and ensure fair competition. Bithumb’s inclusion means it will be closely monitored for any activities that could be deemed anti-competitive. Social Responsibility: Large corporations are often expected to uphold higher standards of social responsibility, which might include greater emphasis on consumer protection, data security, and ethical business practices. This move reflects a growing trend globally where regulators are grappling with how to integrate rapidly expanding digital asset firms into existing financial frameworks. South Korea, known for its proactive approach to technology and regulation, is setting a precedent. The Journey to Bithumb’s Large Corporation Status Bithumb’s rise to this prestigious list is a testament to its resilience and growth within the volatile cryptocurrency market. Launched in 2014, Bithumb quickly established itself as one of South Korea’s premier exchanges, facilitating a significant volume of digital asset trading. Its journey has been marked by both rapid expansion and challenges, including regulatory hurdles and security incidents, common to early pioneers in the crypto space. However, consistent efforts towards compliance, technological advancements, and user base expansion have propelled it to this significant milestone. The KFTC’s assessment for inclusion on the large business corporation list typically considers factors such as: Total Assets: Companies with assets exceeding a certain threshold (currently 10 trillion KRW or approximately $7.3 billion USD). Market Dominance: The company’s influence and share within its respective market. Affiliate Structure: The complexity and interconnectedness of its subsidiary companies. Bithumb’s successful navigation of these criteria underscores its substantial economic footprint and its transition from a niche tech startup to a mainstream financial entity. Benefits and Challenges of Being a Bithumb Large Corporation While the designation brings prestige and validation, it also comes with a dual set of benefits and challenges that Bithumb will need to navigate carefully. Benefits: Enhanced Legitimacy and Trust: Being on the KFTC’s list lends significant credibility, signaling to traditional financial institutions, institutional investors, and a broader public that Bithumb operates with a high degree of oversight and stability. This could attract new capital and users who were previously hesitant to engage with crypto. Market Leadership: It solidifies Bithumb’s position as a market leader in South Korea, potentially giving it an edge over smaller, less regulated exchanges. Policy Influence: As a recognized large corporation, Bithumb may gain a stronger voice in shaping future crypto regulations and policies in South Korea, contributing to a more favorable regulatory environment for the industry as a whole. Challenges: Increased Compliance Costs: Adhering to stricter regulatory frameworks requires significant investment in legal, compliance, and auditing teams, potentially increasing operational costs. Operational Constraints: Certain business decisions, particularly those involving mergers, acquisitions, or significant investments, may now require pre-approval or be subject to greater scrutiny, potentially slowing down agility. Public Scrutiny: Large corporations are constantly under public and media microscope. Any misstep could have amplified reputational consequences. Potential for Anti-Monopoly Measures: If Bithumb’s market share becomes too dominant, the KFTC could impose measures to promote competition, which might affect its growth strategies. Balancing these aspects will be key to Bithumb’s continued success and its role in shaping South Korea’s digital economy. South Korea’s Regulatory Landscape and the Future of Crypto South Korea has long been a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption and innovation, but also a leader in developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks. The KFTC’s decision to include Bithumb on its large corporation list is part of a broader trend of integrating crypto assets into the traditional financial system. This integration is crucial for several reasons: Investor Protection: Stronger regulations aim to protect investors from fraud, market manipulation, and the risks associated with volatile digital assets. Financial Stability: As crypto markets grow, their potential impact on broader financial stability increases. Regulating large entities like Bithumb helps mitigate systemic risks. Global Harmonization: South Korea’s proactive approach contributes to global discussions on crypto regulation, potentially influencing international standards and cooperation. This designation sets a precedent not just for Bithumb, but for other major crypto exchanges globally. It suggests that as the crypto industry matures, its largest players will increasingly be held to the same standards as traditional financial institutions, fostering a more secure and transparent ecosystem. What This Means for the Average Crypto User For the everyday user of Bithumb or other crypto exchanges, this development signals a future of greater security and reliability. While increased regulation might sometimes be viewed as stifling innovation, in this context, it primarily aims to build a safer environment for digital asset transactions. Users can expect: Improved Security: Stricter oversight often translates to enhanced security protocols and data protection measures. Greater Accountability: Bithumb will be held to a higher standard of corporate governance and accountability, potentially leading to better customer service and dispute resolution. Long-term Stability: The regulatory recognition implies a more stable and predictable operating environment for the exchange, reducing the risk of sudden disruptions. Ultimately, Bithumb’s inclusion on the large business corporation list is a positive indicator for the industry’s maturation. It marks a significant step towards bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, paving the way for greater institutional adoption and public trust. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Finance Bithumb’s designation as a South Korean large business corporation is far more than a simple administrative update; it is a landmark event that signifies a new chapter in the global acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies. By ranking 90th on a list dominated by established industrial giants, Bithumb has unequivocally demonstrated the growing economic power and mainstream relevance of digital asset exchanges. This move will undoubtedly bring increased scrutiny and operational demands, but it also confers unparalleled legitimacy, trust, and a stronger voice in shaping the future of finance. As South Korea continues to lead in integrating crypto into its economic fabric, the implications for transparency, investor protection, and market stability are profound. This development sets a powerful precedent, hinting at a future where major crypto entities are fully recognized and regulated alongside traditional financial powerhouses, fostering a more secure and robust digital economy for everyone.

A recent development has caught the eye of many in the crypto community: the deployer address associated with Pudgy Penguins PENGU , the native token of the popular NFT collection, has executed a substantial transfer. Over the past 24 hours, an astounding 226.6 million PENGU tokens, valued at approximately $9.05 million, have been deposited into multiple centralized exchanges (CEXs). This isn’t an isolated incident; since July 12, the same address has funneled a cumulative 1.81 billion PENGU , totaling roughly $54.61 million, into these platforms. What does this crucial movement signify for the future of Pudgy Penguins PENGU and its holders? What Exactly Happened with the Pudgy Penguins PENGU Deployer? According to insights shared by blockchain analytics firm @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), the designated deployer wallet for Pudgy Penguins PENGU has been actively transferring a significant portion of its holdings to CEXs. This specific activity, involving $9.05 million in PENGU over just one day, is part of a larger pattern. The cumulative figure of over $54 million since mid-July paints a picture of consistent, large-scale deposits. For context, such transfers typically indicate an intent to sell or increase liquidity on exchanges. This raises immediate questions about the deployer’s strategy and its potential impact on the token’s market dynamics. Let’s break down the key figures involved in these transfers: Recent Transfer (24 hours): 226.6 million PENGU tokens USD Value (24 hours): Approximately $9.05 million Cumulative Transfers (Since July 12): 1.81 billion PENGU tokens Cumulative USD Value: Approximately $54.61 million Destination: Multiple Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) Why Do Large Pudgy Penguins PENGU Deposits to CEXs Matter? When a significant amount of any cryptocurrency, especially from a project’s deployer or a major whale, moves to centralized exchanges, it often sends ripples through the market. Here’s why these Pudgy Penguins PENGU transfers are particularly noteworthy: Potential Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern is that these tokens are being moved to exchanges with the intention of selling. Large sell orders can increase the supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price depreciation if demand doesn’t match the increased supply. Market Liquidity: While a potential downside, these deposits can also increase market liquidity, making it easier for both buyers and sellers to execute trades without significant price slippage. However, the sheer volume suggests more than just routine market-making. Investor Confidence: Such large movements from a project’s core address can sometimes erode investor confidence. The community often looks to deployers and foundation wallets for stability and long-term commitment. Unexplained large transfers can lead to speculation about the project’s financial health or future plans. Transparency Concerns: While the transfers are publicly viewable on the blockchain, the ‘why’ behind them isn’t always immediately clear. Lack of official communication regarding such significant movements can fuel rumors and uncertainty within the community. Who are the Pudgy Penguins and Their PENGU Token? Before delving deeper into the implications, it’s essential to understand the project at hand. Pudgy Penguins is a popular collection of 8,888 unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in July 2021, the collection quickly gained traction for its distinctive art style and vibrant community. Beyond just digital collectibles, the project has expanded into various ventures, including physical toys and licensing deals, aiming to bridge the gap between digital assets and tangible products. The PENGU token is the native cryptocurrency associated with the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. While specific utility details can vary and evolve, such tokens are often designed to play a role in governance, staking, or accessing exclusive features within the project’s ecosystem. The success and perceived value of the NFT collection are often closely tied to the health and stability of its associated token. Has This Happened Before? A Look at Historical Pudgy Penguins PENGU Transfers The recent $9.05 million deposit is significant, but it’s crucial to place it within the context of previous activities. As noted, the deployer address has been depositing substantial amounts of Pudgy Penguins PENGU since July 12, with cumulative transfers reaching over $54 million. This pattern suggests a deliberate, ongoing strategy rather than a one-off event. Analyzing the timing and size of these historical transfers against PENGU ‘s price action could offer further insights. For instance, did previous large deposits correlate with price dips, indicating selling, or were they absorbed by market demand? This historical context is vital for understanding the current situation and predicting potential future impacts on Pudgy Penguins PENGU . What Are the Community’s Concerns Regarding Pudgy Penguins PENGU? Naturally, such large-scale movements by a project’s deployer can stir up a range of emotions and concerns within the community. Investors, especially those holding Pudgy Penguins PENGU , might be asking: Is the team liquidating holdings? This is a primary fear, as it could signal a lack of long-term commitment or a need for operational funds that could negatively impact token price. What is the purpose of these transfers? Without clear communication, speculation runs rampant. Are these for treasury management, market-making activities, or something else entirely? How will this impact token price? The fear of increased selling pressure leading to a price drop is a tangible concern for token holders. Does this affect the long-term vision of Pudgy Penguins? The NFT collection has a strong brand, and token activity can influence overall perception. Community sentiment plays a critical role in the success of any crypto project. Maintaining trust through transparent communication, especially during periods of significant token movements, is paramount for projects like Pudgy Penguins PENGU . What Should Pudgy Penguins PENGU Holders Do Now? Actionable Insights For current or prospective holders of Pudgy Penguins PENGU , understanding how to navigate such news is key. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Official Channels: Keep a close eye on official Pudgy Penguins announcements on platforms like X, Discord, or their official website. Any clarification from the team about these transfers would be crucial. Analyze On-Chain Data: Utilize blockchain explorers and analytics tools to track the deployer’s address and the movement of Pudgy Penguins PENGU tokens. This can provide real-time insights into whether deposits are continuing or if tokens are being withdrawn from exchanges. Assess Market Depth: Look at the order books on exchanges where PENGU is traded. If large sell walls appear, it could indicate impending selling pressure. Diversify Your Portfolio: As with any investment, never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your crypto holdings can mitigate risks associated with specific token movements. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Volatility is inherent in crypto. Assess your personal risk tolerance before making any investment decisions based on market news. The Dual Nature: Challenges and Opportunities for Pudgy Penguins PENGU While large transfers from a deployer wallet often bring challenges in the form of potential selling pressure and community concern, they can also present opportunities, albeit cautiously. The challenge lies in managing the perception and actual impact of these large volumes on the Pudgy Penguins PENGU token’s price and liquidity. Without clear communication, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) can quickly spread. However, if these transfers are part of a strategic, well-communicated plan – perhaps for legitimate market-making, treasury diversification, or funding new ecosystem developments – they could ultimately benefit the project by increasing liquidity or funding growth initiatives. The opportunity lies in the project’s ability to demonstrate transparency and strategic foresight. For investors, significant price movements, whether up or down, can create entry or exit points, depending on individual strategies and market outlook for Pudgy Penguins PENGU . Conclusion: Navigating the Waters of Pudgy Penguins PENGU Transfers The recent deposit of $9.05 million in Pudgy Penguins PENGU tokens by the deployer address into centralized exchanges, following a trend of over $54 million in cumulative transfers, is a significant event that warrants close attention. While the immediate implications point towards potential selling pressure and heightened market scrutiny, the broader impact hinges on the project’s transparency and the underlying reasons for these movements. For investors, staying informed, monitoring on-chain data, and exercising caution are paramount. The future trajectory of Pudgy Penguins PENGU will undoubtedly be shaped by how the project addresses these large transfers and maintains its community’s trust in a rapidly evolving market. This event serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of due diligence in the volatile world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘deployer address’ in cryptocurrency? A1: A deployer address is the wallet address that initially deployed the smart contract for a cryptocurrency token or NFT collection. It often holds a significant portion of the initial token supply and can be associated with the project’s development team or founders. Q2: Why are large token transfers to CEXs a concern? A2: Large transfers to Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) are often seen as a precursor to selling. If a significant volume of tokens is sold, it can increase market supply and potentially drive down the token’s price due to increased selling pressure. Q3: What is the Pudgy Penguins PENGU token used for? A3: The PENGU token is the native cryptocurrency of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. While specific utilities can evolve, it’s typically designed for governance, staking, or accessing exclusive features within the Pudgy Penguins NFT project and its expanding ventures. Q4: How can I track the Pudgy Penguins PENGU deployer’s activity? A4: You can track the deployer’s activity using blockchain explorers like Etherscan (for Ethereum-based tokens) by inputting the known deployer address. This allows you to view all incoming and outgoing transactions from that wallet. Q5: Does this mean the Pudgy Penguins project is in trouble? A5: Not necessarily. While large transfers can raise concerns, they don’t automatically mean a project is in trouble. They could be for legitimate reasons like treasury management, market-making, or funding new initiatives. The key is the lack of transparent communication, which often fuels speculation. Q6: What is the significance of the cumulative $54.61 million in transfers? A6: The cumulative figure indicates a consistent pattern of large transfers over time, suggesting a deliberate strategy rather than a one-off event. It highlights the substantial volume of tokens the deployer has moved to exchanges, emphasizing the ongoing nature of this activity.

48763637,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=181503,1753237219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48763637.jpeg,STRIKE Token’s Shocking 289% Surge Defies Delisting on Upbit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/strike-token-upbit-surge/,"BitcoinWorld STRIKE Token’s Shocking 289% Surge Defies Delisting on Upbit In the often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, certain events stand out as truly extraordinary. One such phenomenon recently captivated the market: the STRIKE token , a digital asset facing imminent delisting from major South Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, unexpectedly surged by a staggering 289%. This counter-intuitive price action has left many scratching their heads, challenging conventional wisdom and highlighting the unique dynamics at play within the crypto ecosystem. For anyone following digital asset trends, understanding this bizarre rally is crucial, as it offers insights into market behavior that defy simple explanations. What Sparked the STRIKE Token’s Unprecedented Rally? The sudden and dramatic price increase of the STRIKE token , occurring precisely when it was slated for removal from prominent trading platforms, presents a fascinating case study. Following Upbit’s delisting notice at 09:20 UTC on July 21, the token initially dipped to a low of around 7,600 won ($5.52). However, what followed was a sharp and unexpected rebound, pushing its value to 29,590 won ($21.47) on Upbit by July 23. This remarkable ascent, representing a 289% increase from its low, raises several questions about the underlying forces at play. While no single definitive reason can be pinpointed, several theories are circulating within the crypto community: Short Squeeze Dynamics: One prominent theory suggests a classic short squeeze. Traders who had anticipated a price collapse post-delisting might have opened short positions. As the price began to tick up, perhaps due to a coordinated buying effort or an unexpected influx of liquidity, these short sellers were forced to buy back the token to cover their positions, further fueling the rally. This creates a feedback loop, driving the price even higher. Low Liquidity and Market Manipulation: Delisting often leads to significantly reduced liquidity. In such an environment, even relatively small buy orders can have a disproportionately large impact on price. This low liquidity can also make the market more susceptible to manipulation by well-capitalized individuals or groups who might attempt to “pump” the price for quick gains before the final delisting date. Arbitrage Opportunities: With the token trading on multiple exchanges (even if some are delisting), price discrepancies can arise. Savvy traders might have exploited these differences, buying the token where it was cheaper and selling it where it was higher, contributing to the overall volume and upward pressure. “Dead Cat Bounce” or Last-Gasp Speculation: Sometimes, assets facing severe negative news can experience a temporary, sharp rebound before an eventual decline. This is often driven by speculative traders hoping to profit from the volatility, or by existing holders attempting to exit at a better price. The urgency created by the delisting deadline could have intensified this speculative activity. At the time of publication, the STRIKE token was trading at 26,300 won ($19.09) on Upbit, still up 44% on the day, indicating continued volatility even after the initial peak. Understanding Delisting: Why is STRIKE Token Being Removed? Delisting from a major exchange like Upbit or Bithumb is typically a significant negative event for any cryptocurrency. It often signals underlying issues with the project, reduced investor confidence, or failure to meet exchange-specific criteria. For the STRIKE token , the specific reasons for the delisting notice were not immediately detailed in the provided information, but common causes for such actions include: Low Trading Volume and Liquidity: Projects with consistently low trading volume fail to generate sufficient fees for exchanges and can make it difficult for users to buy or sell their tokens without significant price impact. Project Development Concerns: Lack of progress on the project roadmap, inactivity from the development team, or failure to meet promised milestones can lead to delisting. Regulatory or Legal Issues: Projects that face regulatory scrutiny, potential legal challenges, or operate in a manner inconsistent with local laws and regulations are often delisted to protect the exchange and its users. Technical Issues: Problems with the blockchain network, smart contract vulnerabilities, or security breaches can also trigger delisting. Failure to Meet Exchange Criteria: Exchanges periodically review listed assets against their own set of criteria, which can include market capitalization, community engagement, and transparency. Regardless of the specific reason for the STRIKE token ‘s delisting, the announcement usually implies a significant reduction in its accessibility and potential for future growth, making its subsequent surge even more puzzling. The Risky Business of Trading Delisted STRIKE Token: What Are the Challenges? While the recent surge of the STRIKE token might appear enticing to some, trading assets on the verge of delisting carries substantial risks. Investors considering engaging with such volatile situations must be acutely aware of the potential pitfalls: Challenge Description Extreme Volatility Prices can swing wildly in short periods, leading to rapid gains or devastating losses. The 289% surge is a testament to this, but equally sharp declines are possible. Low Liquidity Post-delisting, the ability to buy or sell the STRIKE token quickly at a fair price diminishes significantly. This can trap investors, making it difficult to exit positions. Price Discovery Issues With fewer participants and less volume, the true market value of the token becomes harder to determine, increasing the risk of overpaying or underselling. Potential for Zero Value Many delisted tokens eventually lose all their value, especially if the underlying project ceases development or faces insurmountable challenges. Regulatory Uncertainty Trading delisted assets, especially those with potential underlying issues, could expose traders to unforeseen regulatory risks depending on their jurisdiction. These challenges underscore why trading a token like STRIKE token in such circumstances is generally considered highly speculative and suitable only for those with a high-risk tolerance and a deep understanding of market mechanics. Actionable Insights for Navigating Volatile STRIKE Token Markets: How Can Traders Respond? For traders who are drawn to the allure of high volatility, or those who find themselves holding a STRIKE token or similar asset facing delisting, a cautious and well-informed approach is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Before making any trading decisions, research the project extensively. Understand why it’s being delisted, what its current utility is (if any), and whether there are any alternative exchanges where it might still be traded. Implement Strict Risk Management: Only allocate capital you can afford to lose. Given the extreme volatility, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, though in low-liquidity markets, these may not execute at your desired price. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): The dramatic surge of the STRIKE token can trigger FOMO, leading to impulsive decisions. Resist the urge to jump in solely based on past price performance. The highest gains are often made by those who enter early, and chasing pumps can lead to significant losses. Understand Market Mechanics: Be aware that such pumps in delisting scenarios are often short-lived and can be orchestrated. They are not typically indicative of long-term project viability or fundamental strength. Consider Exit Strategies: If you are already holding the token, develop a clear exit strategy. Decide at what price you would sell to take profits or cut losses. Do not get greedy hoping for endless gains. The key takeaway is that while opportunities for significant gains can arise, the risks associated with trading a delisted STRIKE token are equally, if not more, substantial. Prioritize capital preservation over chasing fleeting profits. Beyond the STRIKE Token: Broader Implications for Crypto Exchanges and Traders The unusual price action of the STRIKE token serves as a potent reminder of the unique characteristics of the cryptocurrency market, particularly when compared to traditional finance. This event has several broader implications: Market Efficiency Debates: It challenges the notion of efficient markets, where all information is immediately priced in. The surge post-delisting suggests that market participants either disregarded the negative news or actively sought to exploit the resulting market conditions. Role of Exchanges: It highlights the critical role exchanges play in market integrity. While delisting is a protective measure, the subsequent volatility underscores the need for clear communication and robust market surveillance to prevent manipulative practices. Investor Education: The incident emphasizes the continuous need for investor education regarding the risks of highly speculative assets and the importance of understanding liquidity and market depth. Regulatory Scrutiny: Such anomalies can attract further attention from regulators, potentially leading to calls for stricter rules regarding market manipulation and delisting procedures in the crypto space. The STRIKE token saga is a testament to the fact that even in seemingly straightforward situations like a delisting, the crypto market can produce astonishing and complex outcomes. Conclusion: Navigating the Unpredictable Currents of Crypto The STRIKE token ‘s incredible 289% surge amidst delisting notices from major exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb is a stark reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility and its capacity for unexpected turns. While such events can present short-term trading opportunities for the daring, they are fraught with extreme risk, primarily due to low liquidity and the potential for manipulative practices. This phenomenon underscores the critical importance of robust risk management, thorough due diligence, and a deep understanding of market dynamics for any participant. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, stories like that of the STRIKE token will undoubtedly continue to shape how investors perceive and interact with this fascinating, yet often perilous, financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the STRIKE token surge despite a delisting notice? A1: The surge of the STRIKE token is likely due to a combination of factors, including potential short squeezes, low liquidity making the market susceptible to manipulation, arbitrage opportunities, and speculative trading from those hoping for a “dead cat bounce” before the final delisting. Q2: What are the main risks of trading a delisted cryptocurrency like STRIKE token? A2: The primary risks include extreme price volatility, significantly reduced liquidity making it hard to sell, difficulties in accurate price discovery, and the high probability that the token could eventually become worthless, especially if the underlying project fails. Q3: Does a delisting notice mean the STRIKE token will cease to exist? A3: Not necessarily. A delisting notice means the token will no longer be traded on the specified exchange (e.g., Upbit, Bithumb). The token itself might continue to exist on its native blockchain and could potentially be traded on other, smaller exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms. However, its accessibility and perceived value typically diminish significantly. Q4: How can traders protect themselves when encountering such volatile situations? A4: Traders should prioritize thorough due diligence on the project, implement strict risk management strategies (e.g., only investing what they can afford to lose, using stop-loss orders), avoid succumbing to FOMO, and maintain a clear exit strategy. Understanding that such pumps are often short-lived is also crucial. Q5: What broader lessons can be learned from the STRIKE token’s delisting surge? A5: This event highlights the crypto market’s unique volatility, challenges the notion of market efficiency, underscores the need for robust market surveillance by exchanges, and reinforces the importance of continuous investor education regarding highly speculative assets and market manipulation risks.

The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and for those tracking the pulse of the market, recent developments in the realm of Spot Bitcoin ETFs have certainly captured attention. After a period of initial excitement and significant inflows, these investment vehicles have experienced a notable shift. On July 22, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded total net outflows of $67.94 million, marking the second consecutive day of such activity. This turn of events prompts crucial questions about market sentiment, investor behavior, and the broader implications for the crypto ecosystem. Decoding the Recent Dip: Understanding Spot Bitcoin ETFs’ Outflows The latest data, shared by market observer Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of the recent financial movements within the Spot Bitcoin ETFs landscape. While the overall sum might seem modest in the grand scheme of the multi-trillion-dollar crypto market, the consecutive nature of the outflows signals a potential shift in short-term investor sentiment or strategic rebalancing. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from July 22: Total Net Outflows: $67.94 million Leading the Withdrawals: Bitwise’s BITB saw the largest outflows, totaling $42.27 million. ARK Invest’s ARKB followed closely, with $33.18 million in withdrawals. The Exception: Grayscale’s GBTC was the only fund to defy the trend, posting net inflows of $7.51 million. This is particularly noteworthy given GBTC’s history of significant outflows following its conversion from a trust to an ETF. No Change: Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings, indicating a concentrated outflow from specific funds. This data highlights a nuanced market. While some funds experienced significant redemptions, others remained stable, and one even attracted new capital. Understanding these individual fund dynamics is key to grasping the broader narrative of Spot Bitcoin ETFs . A visual representation of money flowing out of Bitcoin ETF funds, illustrating recent market trends. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Seeing Red? Exploring the Contributing Factors When investment vehicles like Spot Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows, it’s rarely due to a single cause. A confluence of factors often plays a role, reflecting the complex interplay of macroeconomic conditions, market sentiment, and individual investor strategies. Here are some potential reasons behind the recent dip: 1. Profit-Taking and Rebalancing: Many investors who entered the market during the initial launch of these ETFs or when Bitcoin prices were lower might be taking profits, especially if they perceive the market to be nearing a local peak or if they need to rebalance their portfolios. This is a natural part of the investment cycle. 2. Broader Market Sentiment: The cryptocurrency market doesn’t operate in isolation. It’s often influenced by the performance of traditional financial markets. If there’s a general risk-off sentiment in the broader economy—perhaps due to inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions—investors might pull back from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and, by extension, Spot Bitcoin ETFs . 3. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Factors such as persistent inflation, the Federal Reserve’s stance on monetary policy, and global economic growth forecasts can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets. Uncertainty in these areas can lead to capital being reallocated from speculative investments to safer havens. 4. Investor Rotation: Some investors might be rotating out of Spot Bitcoin ETFs into other crypto assets or even back into direct Bitcoin holdings if they prefer self-custody or feel direct ownership offers more control. The GBTC inflows, for instance, could indicate a rotation within the ETF space itself, with some investors preferring Grayscale’s product for various reasons, perhaps due to its historical significance or a perception of value at current discounts/premiums. 5. Short-Term Trading Strategies: Institutional traders and sophisticated investors might use these ETFs for short-term trading strategies, leading to quick inflows and outflows based on their market outlook. These movements can contribute to daily volatility. While the exact reasons are often a mix of these elements, the current outflows suggest a period of cautiousness or strategic adjustment among some participants in the Spot Bitcoin ETFs market. Navigating the Volatility: What This Means for Your Spot Bitcoin ETF Investments Understanding these market movements is crucial for both seasoned and new investors. While outflows might sound alarming, they are a normal part of a dynamic market. Here’s what it means, along with some actionable insights: Benefits of Spot Bitcoin ETFs (Despite Outflows): Accessibility: They offer a regulated and straightforward way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Liquidity: ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity for buying and selling. Institutional Adoption: Their existence signifies a growing acceptance of Bitcoin within mainstream finance, potentially paving the way for more institutional capital. Diversification: For some, adding Bitcoin exposure via an ETF can be a part of a diversified investment portfolio. Challenges to Consider: Market Volatility: Bitcoin, and by extension its ETFs, remains a volatile asset. Price swings can be significant and rapid. Impact of Large Withdrawals: While individual outflows might be small, cumulative large withdrawals can put downward pressure on the underlying asset’s price. Regulatory Scrutiny: The crypto market is still under intense regulatory scrutiny, and policy changes can impact ETF performance. Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns over time. Examples from the Recent Data: The divergent performance of BITB, ARKB, and GBTC on July 22 serves as a prime example of how different funds can experience varying investor sentiment. BITB and ARKB, which saw significant inflows post-launch, are now experiencing profit-taking or rebalancing. GBTC’s unique position, having converted from a trust and often trading at a discount or premium to its Net Asset Value (NAV), means its inflows could be driven by investors seeking to capitalize on specific arbitrage opportunities or a belief in its long-term value proposition. Actionable Insights for Investors in Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s price history is characterized by significant volatility. A long-term investment horizon often helps weather short-term fluctuations. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of buying at a peak and averages out your purchase price over time. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and on-chain analytics. Knowledge is power in volatile markets. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that while Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer exposure to a high-growth asset, they also come with significant risk. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Balance your crypto investments with other asset classes that align with your financial goals. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The recent outflows, while notable, are a single snapshot in the dynamic journey of Spot Bitcoin ETFs . The long-term trajectory of these products will depend on several factors, including broader institutional adoption, the evolving regulatory landscape, and Bitcoin’s own price performance. Many analysts believe that the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is a net positive for the crypto market, providing a regulated on-ramp for a wider range of investors. As the market matures, it’s likely that we will see periods of both inflows and outflows, reflecting the ebb and flow of investor confidence and market cycles. The ability of these ETFs to attract and retain significant capital over time will be a key indicator of Bitcoin’s continued integration into mainstream finance. Ultimately, the performance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is intrinsically linked to the underlying asset. As Bitcoin continues to carve out its niche in the global financial system, these ETFs will remain a crucial barometer of institutional and retail interest, offering valuable insights into the ongoing maturation of the digital asset space. The recent $67.94 million net outflows from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 22, led by Bitwise’s BITB and ARK Invest’s ARKB, mark a second consecutive day of withdrawals, with Grayscale’s GBTC being the sole exception with inflows. This shift, while not catastrophic, underscores the inherent volatility and strategic rebalancing within the nascent market for these investment products. Investors are advised to maintain a long-term perspective, practice dollar-cost averaging, and stay informed about macroeconomic trends and regulatory developments. Despite short-term fluctuations, Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to play a pivotal role in mainstreaming Bitcoin exposure, offering accessibility and liquidity that contribute to the ongoing maturation of the digital asset landscape. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without having to buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why did some Spot Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows while GBTC saw inflows on July 22? Outflows from funds like BITB and ARKB could be due to profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or broader market sentiment. GBTC’s inflows are often influenced by its unique history as a converted trust, and investors might be buying in to capitalize on specific arbitrage opportunities or a belief in its value proposition relative to its Net Asset Value (NAV). Q3: Do these outflows indicate a negative long-term outlook for Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Daily or short-term outflows are a normal part of market cycles and can be attributed to various factors like profit-taking or macroeconomic conditions. The long-term outlook for Bitcoin and its ETFs depends on broader adoption, regulatory clarity, and its continued role as a digital asset. Q4: How can investors mitigate risks when investing in Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Investors can mitigate risks by adopting a long-term investment strategy, using dollar-cost averaging, diversifying their portfolios, and staying informed about market trends and their personal risk tolerance. It’s crucial to invest only what you are comfortable losing. Q5: Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs suitable for all types of investors? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are suitable for investors who seek exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a regulated financial product, without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. However, due to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, they are generally considered higher-risk investments and may not be suitable for investors with a low-risk tolerance.

This meme-powered altcoin, rooted in cultural relevance and decentralized values, is capturing early Q3 attention across Telegram, X (Twitter), and on-chain activity dashboards. While Ethereum continues to lead on the institutional front, its short-term momentum has stalled. And with Aptos falling out of favor amid reduced user growth and stalled narrative traction, capital is rotating into tokens that combine upside potential with viral energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a key beneficiary. MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts Traders in Search of Fresh Momentum Ethereum’s weakening technical indicators — particularly a declining RSI now under 50 — suggest that momentum may be fading in the near term. At the same time, Aptos has failed to capitalize on its Layer 1 positioning, with some analysts questioning its long-term competitive moat. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering what many traders are now looking for: A strong and growing community-first model Clear tokenomics with a zero-tax structure and fixed supply Rapidly increasing wallet holders and on-chain transactions A decentralized roadmap guided by grassroots sentiment rather than corporate playbooks MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just trending — it’s being actively accumulated. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Apart in Q3 2025 This isn’t just another memecoin rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being described by analysts as a hybrid narrative token — merging the cultural virality of memes with the structure of a purpose-driven altcoin. Its core features include: Decentralized governance with no insider or VC allocations A HashEx-audited smart contract , signaling credibility A community that prizes self-direction and anti-centralization A fast-growing ecosystem driven by organic social engagement Unlike Aptos, which relies heavily on institutional partnerships and technical execution, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on a bottom-up narrative — giving power and visibility to its holders. On-Chain Accumulation Reflects Market Confidence Over the past several weeks, on-chain data has shown a sharp increase in MAGACOIN FINANCE wallet growth and accumulation. Telegram groups have grown into thousands of active members. Community members are speculating about the token’s next major milestones — including potential listings — as more early adopters join the movement. This accumulation surge has coincided with waning excitement around other projects. Ethereum may still dominate long-term infrastructure, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing short-term attention — especially from retail traders who missed early cycles of DOGE, SHIBA INU, and PEPE. Final Thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Rotation As Ethereum struggles to break new highs and Aptos fades from the spotlight, investors are looking for new narratives, new communities, and new opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers all three. With a unique blend of meme culture, zero-tax mechanics, and decentralization-first messaging, it’s rapidly becoming one of Q3’s most closely watched tokens. This isn’t just a short-term pump. It’s a movement powered by conviction, community, and cultural resonance — one that many believe could define the next wave of crypto growth.

This move, announced via a blog post by Binance, is not just a headline; it represents a strategic strengthening of crypto advocacy efforts in the United States, promising to bring a powerful new voice to the table where the future of digital assets is being shaped. Binance CEO Richard Teng: A New Voice in Crypto Advocacy The appointment of Binance CEO Richard Teng to The Digital Chamber’s Advisory Board marks a crucial moment for the cryptocurrency landscape. Richard Teng, who took the helm at Binance in late 2023, brings a wealth of experience from traditional finance and regulatory bodies, including roles at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Abu Dhabi Global Market. His leadership at Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, places him at the forefront of the global digital asset economy. His involvement with The Digital Chamber is a clear signal that major industry players are increasingly committed to proactive engagement with policymakers. The Digital Chamber, often referred to as the leading U.S. crypto lobbying group, plays a vital role in advocating for sensible legislation and regulatory clarity for blockchain technology and digital assets. By bringing a figure of Teng’s stature onto its board, the Chamber gains direct insights from the operational complexities and global reach of a top-tier crypto platform. This collaboration is designed to foster a more informed dialogue between innovators and regulators, ultimately aiming to create a more robust and supportive environment for crypto innovation in the U.S. Why is the Binance CEO’s Involvement Crucial for Crypto Lobbying? You might be wondering, what makes the Binance CEO’s participation so impactful for crypto lobbying efforts? The answer lies in several key areas: Enhanced Credibility and Industry Insight: Having the chief executive of the world’s largest crypto exchange directly involved lends significant credibility to the Chamber’s advocacy. Richard Teng can offer firsthand insights into market dynamics, technological advancements, and the practical implications of proposed regulations, bridging the gap between theoretical policy and real-world industry operations. A Unified and Stronger Voice: The crypto industry has often faced challenges due to fragmented advocacy. Teng’s presence helps consolidate a powerful industry voice, enabling more cohesive and impactful lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. This unity is essential when addressing complex legislative frameworks and combating misconceptions about digital assets. Global Perspective on Local Policy: Binance operates globally, giving Teng a unique perspective on how U.S. policies can influence the international crypto landscape. This global view is invaluable in crafting regulations that support domestic innovation without isolating the U.S. from the broader digital economy. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles: The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, and so are its regulatory challenges. Teng’s experience in traditional finance and regulation equips him to navigate these complexities, advocating for frameworks that promote innovation while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. However, this involvement also comes with its challenges. The crypto industry is under intense scrutiny, and every move by a major player like Binance is closely watched. Balancing the need for advocacy with the imperative for compliance and transparency will be a continuous effort. The Digital Chamber’s Advisory Board is a formidable group of leaders from across the blockchain and traditional finance sectors.

If you’ve been watching your portfolio closely, you might have noticed a shift – a vibrant energy where various digital assets, beyond just Bitcoin, are showing impressive gains. This exciting period is often referred to as Altcoin Season , and recent data suggests we’re right in the thick of it. For many crypto enthusiasts, the arrival of Altcoin Season signifies a potentially lucrative window for growth and diversification. What Exactly is Altcoin Season , and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Altcoin Season is a specific phase in the cryptocurrency market cycle where alternative cryptocurrencies, or ‘altcoins,’ collectively outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over a sustained period. While Bitcoin often leads the market, setting the overall trend, altcoins tend to follow, sometimes experiencing explosive growth once Bitcoin’s rally cools or consolidates. This phenomenon is crucial for investors because it highlights opportunities beyond the dominant cryptocurrency. During a typical Altcoin Season , you’ll observe: Broader Market Participation: More capital flows into a wider range of digital assets, not just Bitcoin. Higher Percentage Gains: While Bitcoin might move 10-20%, some altcoins can see gains of 50%, 100%, or even more in a relatively short period. Innovation Spotlight: New and established projects in areas like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Layer-2 solutions, and gaming gain significant traction. Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is when Bitcoin significantly outperforms most altcoins, often during periods of uncertainty or when Bitcoin is establishing a new price floor or breaking new highs. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Market Compass To provide a clear, data-driven perspective on these market dynamics, platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC) track a metric known as the Altcoin Season Index. This index serves as a crucial barometer for investors, indicating whether the market sentiment favors altcoins or Bitcoin. According to CMC, the Altcoin Season Index registered 53 at 01:58 UTC on July 23. This figure, while down two points from the previous day’s report by Bitcoin World, still firmly places the market in Altcoin Season territory. But what does a score of 53 truly mean? The index operates on a straightforward principle: It compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to ensure a true representation of market sentiment towards volatile assets. For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin during the specified 90-day period. Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared if 25% or fewer altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger lean towards altcoins. A score of 53, being above the 50 mark and significantly above the 25% threshold, confirms the current Altcoin Season status. This metric is invaluable because it moves beyond anecdotal evidence, offering a quantifiable measure of market sentiment and performance trends. What Drives Altcoin Season ? The Underlying Forces Understanding the forces behind Altcoin Season can help investors anticipate and navigate these cycles more effectively. Several factors typically converge to ignite an Altcoin Season : 1. Bitcoin Dominance and Capital Rotation: Often, Altcoin Season follows a strong Bitcoin bull run. As Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs, early investors might take profits, and this capital often rotates into altcoins, seeking higher potential returns. This flow of capital from Bitcoin to altcoins is a primary catalyst. 2. Innovation and Narrative Shifts: The crypto space is constantly evolving. New technological breakthroughs (e.g., advancements in Layer 2 scaling, Web3 gaming, AI integration), compelling narratives (e.g., the rise of specific DeFi protocols or NFT collections), and strong community development can attract significant attention and investment to particular altcoins. 3. Market Sentiment and Risk Appetite: During periods of overall bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market, investors tend to have a higher risk appetite. This encourages them to venture beyond Bitcoin into smaller, more volatile altcoins with the potential for exponential gains. 4. Increased Liquidity: A general influx of liquidity into the crypto market, whether from institutional investors or new retail participants, can inflate the entire market, providing the necessary capital for altcoins to surge. 5. Retail Investor Interest: While institutional investors often favor Bitcoin and Ethereum, retail investors frequently drive the pumps in smaller altcoins. Increased retail interest, fueled by social media trends and success stories, can rapidly inflate altcoin prices. Navigating the Current Altcoin Season : Opportunities and Risks The current Altcoin Season , as indicated by the index at 53, presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks for investors. Approaching this period with a well-thought-out strategy is paramount. Opportunities: Explosive Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can offer significantly higher percentage returns compared to Bitcoin during this phase. Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins across different sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 1s, etc.) can help diversify a portfolio and potentially reduce overall risk, provided proper research is done. Exposure to Innovation: Altcoin Season often highlights promising new technologies and projects that could shape the future of the crypto landscape. Risks: High Volatility: While altcoins can rise rapidly, they can also fall just as quickly. Price swings are often more extreme than with Bitcoin. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins might have low trading volumes, making it difficult to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price significantly. Scams and Rug Pulls: The excitement of Altcoin Season can attract malicious actors, leading to an increase in fraudulent projects and ‘rug pulls’ where developers abandon a project and disappear with investor funds. Over-Speculation: The fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead investors to make irrational decisions, investing in projects without proper due diligence. Actionable Insights for Investors: To make the most of this Altcoin Season while mitigating risks, consider these strategies: Strategy Description Do Your Own Research (DYOR) Thoroughly investigate any altcoin before investing. Look at the whitepaper, team, technology, community, use case, and tokenomics. Smart Diversification Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread investments across several promising altcoins in different sectors. Risk Management Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and take profits incrementally as prices rise. Stay Informed Keep up-to-date with market news, project developments, and broader economic trends that could impact the crypto market. Understand Market Cycles Recognize that Altcoin Season is part of a larger market cycle. It won’t last forever, so have an exit strategy. Historical Context and Future Outlook for Altcoin Season Altcoin Season is not a new phenomenon. We’ve seen significant altcoin rallies in previous bull markets, notably in 2017 and 2021. Each cycle has its unique characteristics, but the underlying principle of capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins remains consistent. While the timing and duration are never perfectly predictable, historical patterns suggest that a sustained Bitcoin rally often precedes a period where altcoins play catch-up. Looking ahead, the current index score of 53 indicates a strong positive sentiment for altcoins. However, the crypto market is dynamic. Investors should continue to monitor key indicators such as Bitcoin dominance (the percentage of the total crypto market capitalization that Bitcoin holds), overall market capitalization, and the emergence of new, compelling projects. Regulatory developments and macroeconomic factors can also significantly influence the longevity and intensity of the current Altcoin Season . Conclusion: Embrace the Potential of Altcoin Season with Caution The Altcoin Season Index at 53 unequivocally signals that we are in a vibrant period where altcoins are demonstrating strong performance relative to Bitcoin. This presents a compelling landscape for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially capitalize on higher growth opportunities. However, the allure of quick gains should always be tempered with a deep understanding of the inherent risks, including high volatility and the prevalence of less legitimate projects. By leveraging data from reliable sources like CoinMarketCap, conducting thorough research, and adopting prudent risk management strategies, you can navigate this exciting Altcoin Season more effectively. Remember, informed decisions are your best asset in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Embrace the potential, but always proceed with caution and a clear strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Altcoin Season? Altcoin Season is a period in the cryptocurrency market when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) collectively outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over a sustained period, typically measured over 90 days. 2. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by CoinMarketCap, compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. If at least 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin, it signals an Altcoin Season . 3. What are the signs that Altcoin Season is ending? Signs that Altcoin Season might be ending include a significant increase in Bitcoin dominance, a slowdown in altcoin price appreciation, a shift in capital back to Bitcoin, and a decrease in the Altcoin Season Index score (especially if it falls below the 75% threshold). 4. Is Altcoin Season a good time to invest in altcoins? While Altcoin Season presents opportunities for higher gains due to increased altcoin performance, it also comes with higher risks and volatility. It’s a good time for those who have done thorough research and are prepared for potential price swings, but caution and risk management are essential. 5. What are the main risks associated with Altcoin Season investing? The main risks include high volatility, potential for significant losses, liquidity issues for smaller altcoins, and the increased prevalence of scams or ‘rug pulls’ as new projects emerge rapidly. 6. How long does Altcoin Season typically last? The duration of Altcoin Season can vary significantly. It is not fixed and depends on market sentiment, capital flows, and broader economic conditions. It can last from a few weeks to several months, often coinciding with broader bull market cycles. Did you find this article insightful?

What’s Fueling the Phenomenal Growth in Spot Ethereum ETFs? The consistent influx of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t merely a fleeting trend; it’s a robust indicator of growing confidence and increasing institutional adoption within the crypto space.

The rise of Spot Ethereum ETFs is not just a financial statistic; it’s a testament to the increasing mainstream acceptance and integration of digital assets into global investment strategies, paving the way for a more decentralized and innovative financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Spot Ethereum ETF? A: A Spot Ethereum ETF is an investment product that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without having to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. The ETF shares are traded on traditional stock exchanges, offering convenience and regulatory oversight. Q2: Why are the recent inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs significant? A: The recent inflows, particularly the $534.7 million on July 22 and the 13-day positive streak, are highly significant because they demonstrate robust institutional and retail demand for regulated crypto investment products. This indicates increasing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as an asset class and suggests a growing confidence in its long-term value and utility within the financial system. Q3: Which major firms are offering Spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S.? A: Currently, prominent firms offering U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs include BlackRock (ETHA), Grayscale (mini ETH), and Fidelity (FETH). These established financial institutions are leading the charge in attracting significant capital into these new investment vehicles. Q4: What are the main risks associated with investing in Spot Ethereum ETFs? A: The primary risks include market volatility, as Ethereum’s price can fluctuate significantly. Regulatory changes, technological risks, and the overall speculative nature of the crypto market also pose risks. While the ETF structure provides convenience, it does not eliminate the inherent risks of the underlying digital asset. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Recently, a significant indicator has emerged from one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance, shedding light on a remarkable trend: a record surge in unrealized Bitcoin profit . This development isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal about the current state of investor confidence and the potential trajectory of the market. What Does Record Unrealized Bitcoin Profit on Binance Mean? Imagine a scenario where a significant portion of Bitcoin holders on a major exchange are sitting on substantial gains, yet they haven’t sold. This is precisely what’s happening on Binance. According to a recent analysis by Darkfost, an analyst at CryptoQuant, the unrealized Bitcoin profit on Binance has soared to an unprecedented 60,000 BTC. To put this into perspective, this means that Bitcoin held by investors on Binance has appreciated significantly in value since its acquisition, but the gains haven’t been ‘realized’ by selling the assets. Darkfost’s findings highlight a critical aspect of market psychology. Unrealized profit is a strong indicator of holder conviction. When investors hold onto their assets despite significant gains, it suggests they anticipate further appreciation or are committed to a long-term strategy. This phenomenon contrasts sharply with ‘realized profit,’ which occurs when an asset is sold, locking in the gains. The sheer volume of 60,000 BTC in unrealized profit on a single exchange like Binance is a testament to a prevailing bullish sentiment among a large segment of Bitcoin holders. Decoding Binance’s Declining BTC Reserves: A Sign of Confidence? Complementing the surge in unrealized Bitcoin profit is another intriguing trend: a noticeable decline in Binance’s overall Bitcoin reserves. The exchange’s Bitcoin holdings have reportedly dropped from approximately 631,000 BTC in September 2024 to a current figure of 574,000 BTC. At first glance, a reduction in an exchange’s reserves might seem concerning, but Darkfost’s analysis suggests quite the opposite. The analyst posits that this decline in reserves may actually signal growing investor confidence. When investors move their Bitcoin off an exchange, it typically indicates a preference for self-custody or deployment in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, rather than an intent to sell. Here’s why this movement is often interpreted as a positive sign: Long-Term Holding Strategy: Moving BTC to cold storage wallets (hardware wallets) is a common practice for long-term holders (often referred to as ‘HODLers’). This signifies a commitment to holding assets through market fluctuations, rather than engaging in short-term trading. Increased Security: Self-custody reduces reliance on centralized exchanges, mitigating risks associated with potential hacks or regulatory uncertainties. Investors who prioritize security often move large holdings off exchanges. Participation in DeFi: A growing number of investors are moving their BTC to participate in decentralized finance applications, such as lending, borrowing, or yield farming, which are typically not conducted directly on centralized exchanges. Reduced Selling Pressure: When Bitcoin is moved off an exchange, it removes that supply from immediate trading liquidity, potentially reducing selling pressure and supporting price stability or upward movement. This dual observation – record unrealized profit coupled with declining exchange reserves – paints a compelling picture of a market where investors are not just holding onto their gains but are actively securing their assets for the long haul. It suggests a collective belief in Bitcoin’s future value, moving beyond mere speculation towards strategic asset management. The Broader Market Impact: What’s Next for Bitcoin Profit ? The trends observed on Binance, given its significant market share, often serve as a microcosm for the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The substantial unrealized Bitcoin profit and the shift towards off-exchange storage could have several ripple effects on the wider market: Reduced Volatility: If a large portion of the supply is being held off-exchange with no immediate intention to sell, it can lead to decreased liquidity on exchanges. While this might occasionally amplify price swings in either direction, it generally reduces the likelihood of massive sell-offs triggered by short-term traders. Potential for Further Price Appreciation: A strong holding sentiment, combined with decreasing available supply on exchanges, can create an environment conducive to price increases, especially if demand remains constant or grows. This supply-demand dynamic is fundamental to market movements. Reinforced Bullish Sentiment: News of record unrealized gains and strong holding patterns can reinforce positive sentiment among other investors, potentially attracting new capital into the market and encouraging existing holders to maintain their positions. Indicator of Market Maturity: The move towards self-custody also reflects a growing maturity in the investor base. As more individuals understand the importance of securing their own assets, it indicates a more informed and resilient market. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. While the current signals from Binance are largely positive, investors should always remain vigilant and consider a comprehensive view of the market. Navigating the Landscape: Actionable Insights for Maximizing Your Bitcoin Profit Understanding these market dynamics is one thing; leveraging them effectively is another. For both seasoned and new investors, here are some actionable insights to consider in light of the current trends: Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: The significant unrealized Bitcoin profit on Binance underscores the potential benefits of a long-term holding strategy. While short-term trading can be profitable, the most substantial gains often come from patiently holding quality assets. Prioritize Self-Custody: If you plan to hold Bitcoin for the long term, consider moving your assets off exchanges to a secure hardware wallet. This gives you full control over your private keys and significantly reduces counterparty risk. Stay Informed, But Don’t Overreact: Market analysis, like that from CryptoQuant, provides valuable insights. However, avoid making impulsive decisions based on single data points. Always conduct your own research and understand the broader context. Diversify Responsibly: While Bitcoin remains a dominant force, consider diversifying your portfolio across other promising cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and while the current signals are positive, market conditions can change rapidly. These strategies can help you navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater confidence, aligning your actions with the long-term trends observed in the market. Conclusion: A Resilient Path for Bitcoin Profit The latest data from Binance, highlighting a record 60,000 BTC in unrealized profit and a concurrent decline in exchange reserves, paints a compelling picture of robust investor confidence. Analyst Darkfost’s insights suggest that far from being a concern, the movement of Bitcoin off exchanges is a strong indicator of a long-term holding mentality among investors. This collective conviction, combined with the significant unrealized gains, underscores a potentially resilient and bullish outlook for Bitcoin. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, these fundamental shifts in investor behavior—from short-term speculation to strategic long-term holding and self-custody—are crucial indicators of its growing maturity. For those looking to capitalize on the potential for future Bitcoin profit , understanding these underlying currents is paramount. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is ‘unrealized Bitcoin profit’? A1: Unrealized Bitcoin profit refers to the gain in value of your Bitcoin holdings that you haven’t yet ‘locked in’ by selling. For example, if you bought Bitcoin at $20,000 and it’s now worth $30,000, you have an unrealized profit of $10,000 per Bitcoin until you sell it. Q2: Why are Binance’s Bitcoin reserves declining, and is it a good sign? A2: Binance’s Bitcoin reserves are declining primarily because investors are moving their BTC off the exchange. According to analysts, this is generally considered a good sign, indicating that holders are opting for self-custody or deploying their assets in DeFi, rather than preparing to sell. It suggests long-term confidence. Q3: Does moving Bitcoin off an exchange always mean confidence? A3: While often interpreted as a sign of confidence and long-term holding, moving Bitcoin off an exchange can also be for other reasons, such as transferring to another exchange or preparing for a specific transaction. However, when observed alongside high unrealized profits and sustained holding, it strongly points to confidence. Q4: How does this trend affect Bitcoin’s price? A4: A strong holding sentiment and reduced supply on exchanges (due to assets moving off-exchange) can create a scarcity effect. If demand remains constant or increases, this can put upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, potentially leading to further Bitcoin profit for holders. Q5: What is CryptoQuant, and why is their analysis important? A5: CryptoQuant is a blockchain analytics platform that provides on-chain data and insights into cryptocurrency markets. Their analysis is important because it offers a data-driven perspective on market sentiment and investor behavior, often identifying trends that are not immediately apparent from price charts alone.

Yet, few incidents have captured the public’s attention with such raw intensity as the recent development involving Haru Invest . A shocking turn of events saw a man receive a five-year prison sentence for a brazen act of violence against the CEO of a crypto firm, committed not in a dark alley, but within the confines of a South Korean courtroom during a trial. This isn’t just a headline; it’s a stark reminder of the high stakes and deep emotions often intertwined with financial disputes in the digital asset space. A Glimpse into the Haru Invest Incident: What Happened in Court? On August 28, 2024, the Seoul Southern District Court became the scene of an unprecedented attack. As reported by Yonhap News, a man identified only as Kang, in his 50s, attended a hearing as an observer. The focus of the hearing was Lee, the CEO of crypto deposit service provider Haru Invest , who was facing serious allegations of embezzling a staggering 1.4 trillion won (approximately $1.02 billion) worth of digital assets. In a shocking act, Kang allegedly stabbed Lee in the neck with a weapon during the proceedings. This violent outburst sent shockwaves through the courtroom and the broader crypto community. The immediate aftermath saw Kang apprehended, and Lee reportedly sustained injuries. The incident underscored the volatile atmosphere surrounding high-profile crypto fraud cases, where investors, often feeling wronged and desperate, can resort to extreme measures. The Legal Aftermath: Why Was the Haru Invest Sentence Upheld? Following the initial ruling, which sentenced Kang to five years in prison, an appeal was lodged. However, the Seoul High Court, after careful deliberation, upheld the original verdict. This decision reinforces the gravity with which the South Korean legal system views such acts of violence, especially within the sanctity of a courtroom. The court’s decision sends a clear message: while public sentiment regarding alleged financial misconduct can run high, resorting to violence is unacceptable and will be met with severe legal consequences. The legal process, despite its perceived slowness or frustrations for victims, remains the only legitimate avenue for seeking justice and resolution. Understanding the Context: The Haru Invest Embezzlement Allegations To fully grasp the intensity surrounding this incident, it’s crucial to understand the backdrop of the Haru Invest case itself. Haru Invest was a prominent crypto deposit service, attracting users with promises of high yields on their digital assets. However, in June 2023, the platform abruptly suspended withdrawals, citing issues with a service partner. This immediately sparked fears among its users, leading to allegations of a ‘rug pull’ or massive embezzlement. Key points regarding the embezzlement allegations include: Magnitude: The alleged embezzlement involved 1.4 trillion won, impacting a significant number of investors. Nature of Business: Haru Invest operated as a centralized crypto yield platform, taking custody of user funds and promising returns, which inherently carries risks if not managed transparently and securely. Investor Impact: Thousands of investors, many of whom had entrusted their life savings or substantial portions of their wealth to the platform, faced devastating losses. This financial ruin often fuels intense anger and frustration, leading to calls for swift justice. Legal Action: The CEO, Lee, and other executives were subsequently arrested and charged, leading to the ongoing trials that culminated in the courtroom stabbing incident. The ongoing legal proceedings against Haru Invest executives highlight the growing global scrutiny on crypto firms and the increasing demand for accountability in an industry that has, at times, operated with less regulatory oversight than traditional finance. Challenges and Lessons for the Crypto Ecosystem The Haru Invest incident, and the broader context of its alleged fraud, underscores several critical challenges facing the cryptocurrency ecosystem: 1. Investor Protection: The lack of robust regulatory frameworks in some jurisdictions leaves investors vulnerable to scams and mismanagement. While regulations are evolving, incidents like this emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive investor protection mechanisms. 2. Due Diligence: For individuals, the onus is increasingly on them to perform extensive due diligence before entrusting funds to any crypto platform. This includes scrutinizing whitepapers, team backgrounds, security audits, and regulatory compliance. 3. Emotional Impact of Financial Loss: The sheer scale of financial losses in major crypto frauds can have profound psychological and emotional impacts on victims, sometimes leading to desperate or violent reactions, as seen in the Haru Invest case. 4. Security in Legal Proceedings: High-profile financial crime trials, especially those involving significant public outrage, require enhanced security measures to protect all participants, including defendants, prosecutors, and observers. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Crypto Landscape Safely While the Haru Invest case is a grim reminder of risks, it also offers crucial lessons for both new and seasoned crypto investors: Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your funds into a single high-yield platform, regardless of how attractive the returns seem. Research Thoroughly: Before investing, research the project team, their track record, security audits, and community sentiment. Look for red flags like anonymous teams or overly aggressive marketing. Understand Custody: Be aware of whether a platform takes custody of your assets. Self-custody (using your own hardware or software wallets) reduces counterparty risk, though it comes with its own responsibilities. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep an eye on regulatory developments in your region. Stricter regulations often lead to greater investor protection. Beware of Unrealistic Returns: If an investment promises returns that seem too good to be true, they almost certainly are. High returns often come with commensurately high risks. Seek Professional Advice: For substantial investments, consider consulting with financial advisors or legal experts who specialize in digital assets. The Broader Implications for South Korea’s Crypto Future South Korea has long been a significant hub for cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. However, it has also grappled with numerous high-profile crypto-related frauds and collapses. The Haru Invest incident, coupled with the tragic courtroom attack, will undoubtedly add pressure on regulators to strengthen oversight and investor protection measures. This event could lead to: Stricter Enforcement: Increased vigilance and harsher penalties for crypto-related financial crimes. Enhanced Security Protocols: Review of security measures in courtrooms for high-profile financial cases. Public Education: Greater efforts to educate the public about the risks associated with certain types of crypto investments. Ultimately, the aim is to foster a safer and more transparent environment for legitimate crypto innovation, while simultaneously weeding out bad actors and protecting vulnerable investors. Conclusion: A Stark Warning from the Haru Invest Saga The South Korean court’s decision to uphold the five-year sentence for the man who stabbed the Haru Invest CEO is a powerful testament to the rule of law, even amidst the intense emotions stirred by financial devastation. This shocking incident serves as a stark warning about the potential human cost of large-scale crypto fraud and the critical importance of upholding legal processes. While the digital asset space continues to evolve, this case firmly reminds us that accountability, security, and adherence to legal norms are paramount for its sustainable growth. For investors, it’s a sobering call to exercise extreme caution and diligence, understanding that even in the pursuit of financial gains, personal safety and legal recourse must never be undermined by desperation or violence. The Haru Invest saga is a pivotal moment, shaping perceptions and reinforcing the need for a robust, secure, and just crypto ecosystem.

This strategic move, marked by the filing of 36 trademark applications, signals a growing interest from traditional financial institutions in embracing blockchain technology and digital currencies. But what exactly are won-based stablecoins , and why is Lotte Card’s initiative so pivotal? What are Won-Based Stablecoins and Why Do They Matter? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the South Korean Won. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to offer the benefits of blockchain technology—like speed, transparency, and lower transaction costs—without the price fluctuations. Won-based stablecoins would, therefore, be digital assets whose value is directly tied to the Korean Won, making them ideal for everyday transactions, remittances, and digital payments within the Korean economy. Stability: Their value is pegged to a fiat currency, minimizing volatility. Efficiency: Transactions can be faster and cheaper than traditional banking methods. Accessibility: Can facilitate easier access to digital finance for a broader population. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a blockchain, offering a high degree of transparency. Lotte Card’s Strategic Play: Why 36 Trademark Applications for Won-Based Stablecoins ? Lotte Card’s decision to file a staggering 36 trademark applications related to won-based stablecoins is a clear indicator of its comprehensive strategy to secure its position in this nascent market. According to Yonhap Infomax, the company has registered a mix of brand-name trademarks in Hangul (the Korean alphabet) and ticker-style trademarks. Data from the Korean Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) further reveals the specifics: 12 brand-name trademarks and 24 ticker trademarks. This extensive filing suggests Lotte Card is exploring multiple facets of the stablecoin ecosystem. They might be looking to launch various types of won-based stablecoins , each potentially serving different purposes or target audiences. For instance, some could be geared towards consumer payments, while others might focus on business-to-business transactions or cross-border remittances. Notable proposed names like ‘WONBIT,’ ‘KTOKEN,’ and ‘LOCAMONEY’ hint at a diversified approach, combining references to the Korean Won, general tokenization, and Lotte Card’s own brand identity. This move is not merely about launching a single digital currency; it’s about building an entire brand portfolio around future digital financial services. By securing these trademarks early, Lotte Card is laying the groundwork for potential future products and services, ensuring they have legal protection for their innovations in the digital asset space. The Broader Landscape: How Do Won-Based Stablecoins Fit into South Korea’s Digital Future? South Korea has long been a frontrunner in technological adoption and digital innovation. The country’s financial sector is no stranger to digital transformation, with high rates of mobile banking and digital payments. The emergence of won-based stablecoins , especially from a major player like Lotte Card, could significantly accelerate this trend. It also comes at a time when central banks globally are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), with the Bank of Korea having conducted its own CBDC pilot programs. While a CBDC would be issued and controlled by the central bank, private stablecoins like those Lotte Card is exploring could complement this ecosystem by offering more specialized use cases or by facilitating innovation in areas where a CBDC might not be as flexible. This move by Lotte Card could also spur other traditional financial institutions in South Korea to explore similar ventures, fostering a competitive environment that drives innovation and adoption of digital assets. Key Players and Potential Synergies: Banks: Other commercial banks might launch their own stablecoins or integrate Lotte Card’s. Tech Companies: Collaboration with fintech firms for payment infrastructure. Regulators: The Financial Services Commission (FSC) will play a crucial role in shaping the regulatory framework for these assets. Potential Benefits for Consumers and Businesses with Won-Based Stablecoins The widespread adoption of won-based stablecoins could unlock numerous benefits for both individual consumers and businesses in South Korea. For consumers, it could mean faster, cheaper, and more convenient ways to pay for goods and services, send money to friends and family, or even manage their savings. Imagine seamless, instant transactions for daily purchases, eliminating the need for traditional banking hours or delays. For businesses, stablecoins could significantly reduce transaction fees, streamline payment processing, and open up new avenues for digital commerce. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, could benefit from lower operational costs and enhanced financial inclusion. Furthermore, the programmability of stablecoins could enable innovative financial products, such as automated payments, escrow services, or even micro-lending platforms built on blockchain. How Could They Be Used? The potential applications of won-based stablecoins are vast: Use Case Benefit Daily Payments Instant, low-cost transactions for retail and online purchases.

While XRP continues to benefit from legal clarity and growing institutional adoption, a new name is pushing into the spotlight: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Once a quiet contender, it’s now drawing attention for its explosive community momentum, grassroots support, and early-stage accumulation. At the same time, Aptos — once seen as a rising Layer 1 — is slipping from the watchlists of retail and institutional investors alike. Its weakening DeFi activity and declining social mentions suggest the market is rotating toward tokens with clearer narratives and stronger momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming a Community Favorite Positioned as a decentralized, meme-powered altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a fresh force in the altcoin space. While it’s not tied to any political figure, it leans into the cultural and ideological themes of decentralization, anti-institutionalism, and viral digital identity. Backed by a fixed 170B supply and a zero-tax model that enables clean, transparent trading, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to the early days of tokens like Dogecoin and SHIBA INU — but with a sharper mission and a stronger foundation. Its appeal is rooted in: Community-first development Organic meme culture integration No VC or insider allocations HashEx audit adding credibility Its Telegram and social channels are seeing constant growth, filled with investor commentary and early accumulation. With no official listing yet, anticipation continues to build. XRP Holds Its Ground — With Institutional Power Behind It XRP, meanwhile, remains a pillar of the altcoin landscape. After Ripple dropped its appeal in the SEC lawsuit, analysts rated the likelihood of a spot ETF approval at 95%. Ripple’s banking license application and stablecoin ambitions signal a broader strategy to integrate more deeply into traditional finance. The XRP narrative is increasingly institutional. But that comes with a trade-off: slower price movement and tighter upside ceilings compared to newer, lower-cap tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. That contrast is what’s fueling the debate — legacy strength versus breakout momentum . Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming an ROI Contender While XRP is a known quantity with large-cap limitations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early. Its potential return profile is drawing in those looking for asymmetric plays during the 2025 bull cycle. Its differentiators are resonating with altcoin investors: Clear branding without overpromising Memetic strength with a utility-focused roadmap No central control , making it appealing to the crypto-native crowd Staking coming soon , offering long-term yield incentives It’s the kind of setup analysts often describe as “early-stage conviction meets community traction.” Final Thoughts: XRP or MAGACOIN FINANCE? As Aptos begins to lose momentum and the altcoin spotlight shifts, investors are rallying around those tokens they think will deliver the best returns in this cycle. XRP provides the strength needed after regulations if you value stability. However, if you are looking for fresh upside and viral growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the one to watch. It’s not just a meme coin. The movement is powered by momentum, theory and investor confidence.

Solana Social Dominance Has Spiked To Highest Since Early June In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the crowd has reacted to the latest rally in Solana’s price. The metric of relevance here is the “Social Dominance,” which tells us about the degree of attention that a given coin is receiving on social media relative to the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The indicator is based on another, known as the Social Volume. The Social Volume measures the unique number of posts/messages/threads on these platforms that are making mentions of the asset. Related Reading: Ethereum To $10,000? Analyst Says ETH Has To Break This Level The Social Dominance takes the Social Volume of a coin and calculates what percentage of the combined Social Volume of the hundred largest assets in the sector that it makes up for. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the indicator for Solana over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Social Dominance has just witnessed a sharp increase, indicating that interest in the asset has surged among social media users. The spike in attention toward SOL has come following a notable rally in its price, which has taken it past the $200 level for the first time since early 2025. The asset now makes up for 8.9% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions, the highest since June 6th. Though while some market interest can be positive, an excess of it has generally proven to be a bearish sign in the past. As such, the spike in the Social Dominance of the coin may be something to keep an eye on, as FOMO developing among the crowd could potentially impede the price run. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for another Solana indicator: Development Activity. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of work that the developers of the project are putting in on its public GitHub repositories. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? The indicator gauges development work in terms of ‘events,’ where an event is any action made by the developer on the repository, like the push of a commit or the creation of a fork. From the graph, it’s visible that the Development Activity of Solana has witnessed a rise recently and has climbed back above 63 events per day. This is the highest value for the metric since May 22nd. Thus, it would appear that the developers of the project are ramping up their effort alongside the price surge. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $203, up more than 27% in the last seven days.

These colossal holders of digital assets have the power to sway market sentiment with a single transaction. Recently, the crypto community witnessed a significant event that sent ripples across the blockchain: a newly identified whale address executed a massive withdrawal of 33,644 ETH, valued at an astounding $125.73 million, from the institutional trading platform FalconX. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a strategic move that could offer intriguing insights into the future outlook for Ethereum. What Exactly Happened? Decoding the Ethereum Whale’s Move According to on-chain analytics provided by Onchain Lens on X, a fresh address, previously unknown to be a major player, initiated a substantial withdrawal of 33,644 ETH, amounting to $125.73 million, from FalconX. Following this acquisition, the address now commands an impressive total of 105,977 ETH, accumulating a staggering value of approximately $396 million. Such a significant accumulation by an Ethereum whale naturally sparks curiosity and speculation within the market. This event highlights the transparency inherent in blockchain technology, where every transaction, while pseudonymized, is publicly verifiable. It allows observers to track the flow of large sums of digital assets, offering a unique window into the strategies of major players. The question on everyone’s mind is: what does this particular move signify? Why Do Ethereum Whale Movements Matter So Much? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrencies, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding exceptionally large amounts of a particular digital asset. Their actions are closely monitored because their trades, whether buying, selling, or simply moving assets, can significantly impact market liquidity and price. When an Ethereum whale makes a move, it’s akin to a large ship shifting course – it creates ripples that smaller vessels must navigate. Market Influence: Whales hold enough assets to potentially move market prices, especially in less liquid markets. Sentiment Indicator: Their actions are often seen as a proxy for the sentiment of institutional or highly informed investors. Liquidity Impact: Large withdrawals reduce the supply available on exchanges, potentially leading to price increases if demand remains constant. Trend Precursors: Historically, significant whale movements have sometimes preceded major market trends. Withdrawal vs. Deposit: Understanding the Ethereum Whale’s Strategy In the lexicon of on-chain analysis, the distinction between depositing funds to an exchange and withdrawing them is crucial. Each action generally signals a different intent, though it’s important to remember that these are interpretations, not guarantees: Deposits to Exchanges: Intent to Sell: Often, when large amounts of crypto are moved to an exchange, it’s interpreted as a prelude to selling. The assets are made readily available for trading. Liquidity Provision: Sometimes, it could be for providing liquidity to a trading pair or for arbitrage opportunities. Withdrawals from Exchanges: Holding Strategy: The most common interpretation is a long-term holding strategy. By moving assets off an exchange into a private wallet (cold storage or a personal hot wallet), the owner signals an intent to hold rather than sell in the immediate future. Staking or DeFi: The withdrawn ETH might be destined for staking on the Ethereum network (e.g., to become a validator) or for participation in various Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols to earn yield. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large withdrawals could also indicate an impending over-the-counter (OTC) transaction, where a whale sells a large block of assets directly to another party without using an open exchange, thus avoiding market impact. In this specific case, the withdrawal of such a substantial amount by an Ethereum whale strongly leans towards a holding or utility-driven strategy, suggesting confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value. FalconX: A Glimpse into the Institutional Trading Arena The fact that this withdrawal occurred from FalconX is noteworthy. FalconX is not your typical retail cryptocurrency exchange. It operates as a prime broker for institutional investors, offering a comprehensive suite of services including trading, credit, and custody solutions. Institutions, hedge funds, and sophisticated traders utilize platforms like FalconX for their large-volume transactions due to their robust infrastructure, deep liquidity pools, and personalized services. When an Ethereum whale engages with a platform like FalconX, it often implies a high level of sophistication and strategic planning behind their moves. This isn’t a casual trade; it’s a calculated decision made by a major player operating within the institutional crypto landscape. What Does This Ethereum Whale’s Action Signal for the Market? The withdrawal of $125.73 million in ETH from an institutional platform generally sends a positive signal to the market. Here’s why: Reduced Selling Pressure: By moving ETH off the exchange, the immediate supply available for sale is reduced. This can alleviate potential selling pressure, which is often a precursor to price declines. Bullish Conviction: It suggests that this particular Ethereum whale believes in the future appreciation of ETH. They are not looking to liquidate their holdings but rather to secure them, potentially for long-term gains or for participation in the Ethereum ecosystem. Institutional Confidence: The involvement of FalconX and the size of the transaction hint at institutional or sophisticated investor confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals and future prospects, such as the ongoing developments in the Ethereum roadmap (e.g., Dencun upgrade, EIP-4844 for proto-danksharding, future scalability solutions). While one whale’s action doesn’t dictate the entire market, it provides a valuable data point that market analysts and investors consider when assessing overall sentiment. It suggests a potential shift from short-term trading to long-term investment among significant holders. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights from Ethereum Whale Activity For everyday investors, understanding Ethereum whale movements can be insightful, but it’s crucial not to base investment decisions solely on them. Here are some actionable insights: Context is Key: Always view whale movements within the broader market context. Consider macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and overall crypto market trends. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Large withdrawals often indicate a long-term view. If your investment horizon is also long-term, such moves might reinforce your conviction. If you’re a short-term trader, be aware of potential market shifts. Diversify Your Information Sources: Don’t rely on a single on-chain metric. Combine whale tracking with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and news flow to form a comprehensive view. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Even seemingly bullish whale moves don’t guarantee future price action. Consider Staking & DeFi: If a whale is withdrawing for staking or DeFi, it underscores the utility and yield-generating opportunities within the Ethereum ecosystem. Research these options to see if they align with your investment goals. Understanding the ‘why’ behind a whale’s move is more important than just knowing ‘what’ they did. It’s about discerning the underlying strategy and potential implications for the market. Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of the Ethereum Whale The recent withdrawal of $125.73 million in ETH by a newly identified Ethereum whale from FalconX is a powerful reminder of the influential role large holders play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This significant move, signaling a strong inclination towards holding or strategic deployment rather than immediate sale, paints a picture of growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. While no single transaction guarantees future market direction, the actions of such formidable players provide invaluable clues about the underlying health and sentiment of the digital asset space. As the blockchain continues to evolve, tracking these ‘giants’ of the crypto world remains a fascinating and insightful endeavor for anyone looking to understand the intricate dynamics of the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale? A1: An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their substantial holdings mean their transactions can significantly influence market prices and sentiment due to the sheer volume of assets they control. Q2: Why are whale withdrawals from exchanges considered bullish? A2: Withdrawals are generally seen as bullish because they indicate an intent to hold assets for the long term, stake them, or use them in DeFi protocols, rather than selling them immediately. This reduces the supply of ETH available on exchanges, potentially leading to increased demand and price appreciation. Q3: What is FalconX and why is it relevant to this withdrawal? A3: FalconX is an institutional prime broker for digital assets, serving large investors, hedge funds, and institutions. A withdrawal from FalconX suggests that the transaction was conducted by a sophisticated or institutional player, adding weight to the strategic nature of the move. Q4: Can a single whale’s action predict the entire market’s direction? A4: While whale actions are important indicators of sentiment and potential supply/demand shifts, a single whale’s move cannot definitively predict the entire market’s direction. It’s crucial to consider broader market trends, macroeconomic factors, and other on-chain data for a comprehensive market view. Q5: How can I track Ethereum whale movements? A5: You can track Ethereum whale movements using various on-chain analytics platforms and services. Websites like Whale Alert, Etherscan, and professional on-chain data providers offer tools to monitor large transactions and wallet activities. Q6: What does ‘holding strategy’ mean for a crypto whale? A6: A holding strategy, often referred to as ‘HODLing,’ means the whale intends to retain their assets for an extended period, believing their value will increase over time. They are not looking for short-term gains but rather long-term appreciation, often moving assets off exchanges to secure them in private wallets.

The digital asset world is buzzing with news as Bitcoin, the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, has experienced a significant shift. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, a notable Bitcoin Price Drop has seen BTC fall below the crucial $119,000 mark. Specifically, it is trading at $118,983.83 on the Binance USDT market. This movement has certainly captured the attention of investors globally, prompting questions about market stability and future trajectories. Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Drop: What Just Happened? The recent Bitcoin Price Drop below $119,000 marks a moment of heightened scrutiny for many. For context, Bitcoin’s price movements are often a barometer for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When BTC experiences volatility, it frequently sends tremors across altcoins and investor sentiment alike. This specific drop highlights the inherent dynamism and unpredictability of the crypto market, reminding us that even established assets like Bitcoin are subject to rapid fluctuations. While a single price point might seem like just a number, it often represents underlying shifts in market sentiment, trading volumes, and broader economic factors. Traders and long-term holders alike are now closely watching to see if this level acts as a temporary dip or a precursor to further movements. The trading activity on platforms like Binance USDT, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, provides a real-time snapshot of this evolving situation. Why Did This Bitcoin Price Drop Occur? Unpacking the Factors A Bitcoin Price Drop is rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s often a confluence of various interconnected factors. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency investments. Here are some of the primary reasons that could contribute to such a market movement: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic indicators, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions, can significantly influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets show signs of instability, investors might withdraw capital from more speculative assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can create fear and uncertainty (FUD), leading to sell-offs. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets, and any perceived negative stance can impact prices. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can move significant amounts of BTC, which can trigger price drops. A large sell order from a whale can create a ripple effect, leading other investors to panic sell. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: Traders often rely on technical indicators and support/resistance levels. If Bitcoin breaks below a key support level, it can trigger automated sell orders and encourage further downward momentum as per technical analysis principles. Market Sentiment and News: Negative news, security breaches on exchanges, or even influential figures expressing bearish views can quickly shift market sentiment, leading to a rapid Bitcoin Price Drop . Conversely, positive news can fuel rallies. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may choose to sell a portion of their holdings to lock in profits, contributing to temporary price corrections. Is This Bitcoin Price Drop Unique? A Look at Historical Volatility For seasoned crypto enthusiasts, a Bitcoin Price Drop is not an unfamiliar sight. Bitcoin is renowned for its volatility, experiencing numerous significant price corrections throughout its history. This characteristic is part of its appeal for some traders, but also a major challenge for others. Let’s consider how the current situation compares to past events: Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by several bull runs followed by sharp corrections. For example, the massive rallies of 2017 and 2021 were both followed by substantial bear markets where prices plummeted by 70-80% from their all-time highs. These periods, while challenging for investors, often cleanse the market of speculative excesses and lay the groundwork for future growth. The current drop below $119,000, while notable, should be viewed within this broader historical context. It reinforces the idea that price fluctuations are an inherent part of the cryptocurrency market. Understanding this pattern helps investors develop a more resilient mindset and long-term perspective, rather than reacting impulsively to every dip. Navigating the Volatility: What Should Investors Do During a Bitcoin Price Drop? When faced with a sudden Bitcoin Price Drop , it’s natural for investors to feel a mix of anxiety and uncertainty. However, rather than succumbing to panic, this can be an opportune moment for strategic decision-making. Here are some actionable insights and common strategies: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any decisions, thoroughly research the underlying reasons for the price drop. Distinguish between temporary market noise and fundamental shifts. Avoid Panic Selling: One of the biggest mistakes new investors make is selling their assets at a loss during a dip. Unless your financial situation demands it, consider the long-term potential of Bitcoin. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of buying at a peak and can be particularly effective during a Bitcoin Price Drop , as you accumulate more BTC at lower prices. Rebalance Your Portfolio: A dip can be a good time to reassess your portfolio’s asset allocation. You might consider buying more Bitcoin if it aligns with your long-term strategy, or diversifying into other assets. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders if you are actively trading, or simply stick to your long-term investment plan if you are a HODLer. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: Keep up with reliable news sources, but avoid constant market monitoring which can lead to emotional decisions. Focus on key developments rather than daily fluctuations. The challenge during a significant Bitcoin Price Drop is managing emotions. The benefit, for those with a long-term outlook, can be the opportunity to acquire more assets at a reduced cost. Impact on the Broader Crypto Market: The Ripple Effect of a Bitcoin Price Drop Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency market means that its price movements often dictate the direction of altcoins. When there’s a significant Bitcoin Price Drop , it frequently triggers a similar downward trend across most other cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is known as market correlation. Altcoins, especially those with lower market capitalization, tend to be even more volatile than Bitcoin, meaning their percentage drops can be more severe during a BTC downturn. However, this correlation isn’t always absolute. Some altcoins with strong fundamentals, unique use cases, or upcoming positive developments might show resilience or even decouple from Bitcoin’s price action. Nevertheless, for the vast majority of the market, Bitcoin remains the bellwether. Understanding this relationship is vital for investors holding diversified crypto portfolios, as a move in BTC can significantly impact their overall holdings. The Road Ahead: What to Watch After a Bitcoin Price Drop? Following a Bitcoin Price Drop , investors and analysts turn their attention to several key indicators and developments to gauge the market’s next move. Observing these factors can provide valuable insights: Trading Volume: A significant increase in buying volume after a drop can signal strong demand and potential for recovery. Conversely, low volume during a price fall might indicate a lack of buying interest. Key Support Levels: Technical analysts will closely watch for Bitcoin to hold above or bounce from established support levels. Breaking below these could signal further declines. Macroeconomic Data: Continued monitoring of inflation reports, employment figures, and central bank policies will be crucial, as these directly influence global liquidity and risk appetite. Regulatory Clarity: Any positive news regarding cryptocurrency regulation, particularly from major economies, could instill confidence and attract institutional investment. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest and investment from large financial institutions and corporations can provide significant buying pressure and long-term stability for Bitcoin. The future trajectory after a Bitcoin Price Drop remains uncertain, as is the nature of financial markets. However, by staying informed and applying a disciplined investment approach, market participants can better position themselves to navigate these periods of volatility. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of the Crypto Market The recent Bitcoin Price Drop below $119,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such movements can be unsettling, they are a fundamental characteristic of a rapidly evolving asset class. For investors, understanding the underlying causes, maintaining a long-term perspective, and employing sound risk management strategies are paramount. Bitcoin’s journey has always been one of significant highs and challenging lows, and each price correction offers valuable lessons. By focusing on informed decisions rather than emotional reactions, participants can better navigate these market tides and position themselves for potential future opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What causes a sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? A sudden Bitcoin Price Drop can be caused by a combination of factors, including negative macroeconomic news (like rising inflation or interest rates), regulatory crackdowns, large sell-offs by whales, technical analysis breakdowns below key support levels, and overall negative market sentiment fueled by FUD or adverse news events. 2. Is a Bitcoin Price Drop always a bad thing for investors? Not necessarily. While a drop can lead to immediate losses for some, many long-term investors view a Bitcoin Price Drop as a buying opportunity, often referred to as ‘buying the dip.’ Strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) allow investors to acquire more Bitcoin at lower prices, potentially leading to greater returns if the price recovers. 3. How does a Bitcoin Price Drop affect altcoins? Bitcoin’s price movements typically have a significant impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. A Bitcoin Price Drop often leads to a similar downward trend in most altcoins due to market correlation. Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can experience even larger percentage drops than Bitcoin during such periods. 4. What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is losing value? If your Bitcoin investment is losing value due to a price drop, it’s important to avoid panic selling. Instead, consider your long-term investment goals. You might choose to HODL (hold on for dear life), dollar-cost average by buying more at lower prices, or rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and financial plan. Always conduct your own research before making decisions. 5. How can I protect my investments during a Bitcoin Price Drop? Protecting your investments during a Bitcoin Price Drop involves several strategies: never investing more than you can afford to lose, diversifying your portfolio, setting clear entry and exit strategies, utilizing stop-loss orders if you are an active trader, and staying informed through reliable news sources to avoid emotional reactions to market volatility.

For those deeply entrenched in futures trading, understanding market movements goes beyond simple price charts. It delves into the mechanics of leverage, risk, and, critically, crypto liquidation . Over the last 24 hours, the market witnessed significant liquidation events across major digital assets, sending ripples through trading desks globally. This breakdown offers a comprehensive look at what transpired and what it means for you. What Exactly is Crypto Liquidation? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto liquidation entails. In the simplest terms, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. Why does this occur? Usually, it’s due to significant adverse price movements against the trader’s open position. If you’re trading with borrowed funds (leverage), a small price swing can have a magnified impact on your capital, potentially wiping out your margin and triggering liquidation to prevent further losses for the exchange. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for anyone participating in perpetual futures. It’s not just about losing your initial investment; it’s about the systemic impact these large liquidations can have on market sentiment and price action. The 24-Hour Snapshot: Who Got Hit and How? The past 24 hours provided a stark reminder of the market’s unforgiving nature, with significant crypto liquidation volumes impacting major assets. Here’s a detailed look at the breakdown: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated Value Dominant Side Liquidated Percentage of Dominant Side Ethereum (ETH) $132 million Long Positions 71.13% Bitcoin (BTC) $47.62 million Short Positions 59.92% Solana (SOL) $28.45 million Long Positions 61.25% This data reveals a fascinating narrative: Ethereum (ETH) Dominance in Long Liquidations: The staggering $132 million in ETH liquidations, with over 71% being long positions, suggests that a significant number of traders were betting on ETH’s price to go up. When the price unexpectedly dipped, these leveraged long positions were swiftly closed, leading to substantial losses for these traders. This indicates a strong bullish sentiment that was caught off guard. Bitcoin (BTC) Short Liquidations: In contrast, Bitcoin saw nearly $48 million in liquidations, predominantly from short positions (59.92%). This implies that many traders were expecting BTC’s price to fall. A sudden upward movement, even a minor one, would have triggered these short liquidations, forcing them to buy back at higher prices to cover their positions. This points to a bearish sentiment that was proven wrong. Solana (SOL) Long Liquidations: Similar to Ethereum, Solana experienced significant long liquidations, indicating that bullish traders on SOL were also caught in a downward price movement. The $28.45 million in SOL liquidations, with 61.25% being long, reflects a similar pattern of over-leveraged bullish bets being unwound. Why Did These Crypto Liquidations Occur? Unpacking the Triggers Understanding the ‘why’ behind these massive crypto liquidation events is crucial for future trading decisions. Several factors can contribute to such a concentrated wave of forced closures: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Sudden news, macroeconomic shifts, or even large institutional trades can cause rapid price swings. These swings, when amplified by leverage, quickly push positions towards liquidation thresholds. Excessive Leverage: Many traders, especially in perpetual futures, use high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x). While this can magnify profits, it also means even a tiny adverse price movement can lead to total loss of margin and liquidation. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement needed to trigger liquidation. Cascading Effects: Large liquidations can themselves trigger further liquidations. When an exchange closes a large position, it often involves market selling (for long positions) or market buying (for short positions). This adds to the existing price pressure, pushing the asset further in the adverse direction, and potentially liquidating even more positions. This creates a ‘liquidation cascade.’ Technical Levels Breached: Often, liquidations occur when key support or resistance levels are broken. Traders might set stop-losses around these levels, but if the price moves sharply past them, liquidations can accelerate. The Impact of Crypto Liquidation on Traders and the Market The immediate impact of significant crypto liquidation is, of course, on the individual traders who lose their capital. For the broader market, however, the effects can be more complex: Increased Volatility: As mentioned, liquidations can fuel further price movements, leading to a more volatile trading environment. Shift in Sentiment: Large liquidations can signal a change in market sentiment. For example, massive long liquidations might indicate a temporary top or a weakening of bullish momentum. Opportunity for Astute Traders: While challenging for many, periods of high liquidation can present opportunities for experienced traders who can anticipate these movements or are prepared to enter positions at more favorable prices after a shakeout. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Futures Traders Given the ever-present risk of crypto liquidation , how can traders better protect themselves and even thrive in volatile markets? Here are some actionable insights: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: The most crucial advice. While high leverage offers tempting returns, it dramatically increases risk. Start with lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain significant experience and confidence. Always Use Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss is your best friend. It automatically closes your position when the price hits a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses and preventing full liquidation. Don’t trade without one. Understand Margin Requirements: Be aware of both initial margin and maintenance margin levels on your chosen exchange. Knowing these thresholds helps you understand how much buffer you have before liquidation. Monitor Funding Rates: In perpetual futures, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions. High positive funding rates suggest an overheated long market, potentially ripe for long liquidations, and vice-versa for negative rates. Stay Informed and Adapt: Keep an eye on market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis. The crypto market is dynamic; what worked yesterday might not work today. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the focus here is on futures, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Balance your high-risk futures positions with lower-risk spot holdings. Remember, the goal isn’t to avoid all losses, but to manage risk effectively so that no single trade, or series of liquidations, wipes out your trading capital. Conclusion: Learning from the Liquidation Landscape The past 24 hours served as a potent reminder of the inherent risks and rewards within the crypto perpetual futures market. Massive crypto liquidation events, totaling hundreds of millions across ETH, BTC, and SOL, underscore the importance of disciplined risk management and a deep understanding of market mechanics. Whether you were on the right side of the trade or experienced the sting of liquidation, these moments offer invaluable lessons. By embracing prudent leverage, utilizing stop-loss orders, and continuously educating yourself, you can navigate the turbulent waters of crypto trading with greater confidence and resilience. The market will always have its dramatic swings, but informed traders are better equipped to weather the storm and emerge stronger. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary cause of crypto liquidation? Crypto liquidation is primarily caused by significant adverse price movements against a trader’s leveraged position. When the market price moves against your open trade to a point where your margin balance falls below the exchange’s maintenance margin requirement, the position is automatically closed. Q2: What is the difference between ‘long’ and ‘short’ liquidation? A ‘long’ liquidation occurs when a trader who bet on a price increase (a long position) sees the asset’s price fall, causing their position to be closed. A ‘short’ liquidation occurs when a trader who bet on a price decrease (a short position) sees the asset’s price rise, leading to their position being closed. Q3: How can I avoid crypto liquidation when trading futures? To minimize the risk of crypto liquidation , traders should use appropriate leverage, always implement stop-loss orders, monitor their margin levels closely, and avoid over-leveraging their positions, especially during periods of high market volatility. Q4: Do liquidations impact the overall crypto market? Yes, large-scale liquidations can significantly impact the overall crypto market. They can amplify price movements, increase volatility, and sometimes trigger a ‘liquidation cascade’ where forced selling/buying by the exchange pushes prices further, leading to more liquidations. Q5: Is perpetual futures trading suitable for beginners? Perpetual futures trading involves high risk due to leverage and volatility, making it generally unsuitable for beginners. It requires a strong understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and technical analysis. It is advisable for beginners to start with spot trading and gradually learn about derivatives.

These colossal entities, holding vast sums of digital assets, have the power to ripple through markets with a single transaction. Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with news of a significant move by one such whale, stirring discussions about market sentiment and future trajectories. What happens when a long-dormant giant awakens and offloads a substantial portion of its holdings? Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating event and explore its potential implications. The Awakening of a Long-Term WBTC Whale: What Happened? Imagine holding onto a significant investment for four years, watching its value fluctuate, and then deciding the time is right to take profits. That’s precisely what a particular WBTC whale address has done, sending shockwaves through the on-chain analysis community. This address, which had meticulously accumulated 1,074 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) at an average price of approximately $10,708 four years ago, recently made a decisive move. According to diligent on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, this whale offloaded 300 WBTC, valued at an astonishing $35.62 million, in a single transaction about nine hours ago. This wasn’t an isolated event; over the past four days, the same wallet strategically divested a total of 1,000 WBTC. The result? An estimated profit of a staggering $107 million. This substantial profit highlights the immense gains possible for those with the foresight and patience to hold through market cycles, even for a colossal WBTC whale . Understanding WBTC: Bitcoin’s DeFi Bridge Before we delve deeper into the whale’s actions, it’s crucial to understand what WBTC is. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. It was created to bring Bitcoin’s liquidity to the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Here’s why it’s important: Interoperability: WBTC allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, including lending, borrowing, and yield farming, without having to sell their BTC. Liquidity: It enhances liquidity across different blockchains, bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s vast capital and Ethereum’s vibrant dApp landscape. Transparency: The reserves of WBTC are verifiable on-chain, ensuring that each WBTC is indeed backed by an equivalent amount of BTC held in audited custodians. The fact that a whale is holding and trading WBTC, rather than native BTC, suggests a sophisticated understanding of the DeFi landscape and a willingness to leverage Ethereum’s capabilities for maximizing returns or managing risk. Who Are Crypto Whales and Why Does Their WBTC Whale Activity Matter? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding exceptionally large amounts of a particular digital asset. Their movements are often seen as indicators of market sentiment and potential price shifts because their transactions are large enough to impact liquidity and supply dynamics. When a WBTC whale makes a move, especially one involving millions of dollars, the entire market takes notice. Here’s why their actions are so closely watched: Market Impact: Large sell-offs can increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to price drops if demand doesn’t absorb the sell pressure. Conversely, large accumulations can signal confidence and potentially drive prices up. Sentiment Indicator: Whale activity can reflect the confidence levels of major players. A large sale might signal a belief that prices are topping out, while significant buying could suggest an expectation of future gains. Liquidity Providers: Whales often provide significant liquidity to the market, facilitating smoother trading. However, their sudden withdrawal of liquidity can lead to increased volatility. The Anatomy of a Four-Year Hold: Patience Pays for This WBTC Whale The most striking aspect of this particular WBTC whale story is the four-year holding period. In the notoriously volatile crypto market, a four-year hold is a testament to extreme patience and a strong long-term conviction. Let’s consider what this entails: Navigating Cycles: Over four years, the crypto market has seen significant bull runs and bear markets. Holding through these cycles requires a robust psychological fortitude, resisting the urge to sell during dips or panic buy during euphoric highs. Strategic Accumulation: The whale’s average entry price of $10,708 for 1,074 WBTC suggests a strategic accumulation phase, likely during a period of lower prices or consolidation. This foresight laid the groundwork for the massive profit realized. Profit Realization: The decision to sell 1,000 WBTC at current market prices, netting $107 million, indicates a calculated move to lock in substantial gains. This could be due to reaching a specific financial target, rebalancing a portfolio, or a shift in market outlook. This long-term strategy, often dubbed ‘HODLing,’ is a common approach among successful crypto investors, but executing it on such a large scale truly sets this WBTC whale apart. Unpacking the Market Impact of This WBTC Whale Move The sale of 1,000 WBTC, equivalent to 1,000 BTC, is a significant event. While not enough to crash the entire Bitcoin market, it certainly adds selling pressure and can influence short-term sentiment. Here’s how this WBTC whale ‘s actions might impact the broader market: Potential Impact Area Explanation Short-Term Price Volatility The sudden influx of 1,000 WBTC into the market can temporarily increase supply, potentially leading to a slight price dip or increased volatility as traders react. Market Sentiment News of a large whale selling can sometimes trigger fear among smaller investors, leading to a cascade of selling if confidence wavers. Liquidity Shifts The whale’s decision to exit could free up capital that might be redeployed into other assets, or it could simply be moved off-chain. On-Chain Analysis Focus This event will undoubtedly be scrutinized by analysts, providing valuable data points on long-term holder behavior and profit-taking patterns. It’s important to note that while significant, such sales are part of a healthy market. Profit-taking by long-term holders can clear the way for new capital and new investors to enter, preventing over-concentration of wealth and promoting broader distribution. On-Chain Insights: How Analysts Track a WBTC Whale and Other Giants The ability to track such precise movements of a WBTC whale is thanks to the power of on-chain analysis. Blockchain technology provides an immutable and transparent ledger of all transactions, allowing analysts to monitor the flow of funds, identify large wallets, and deduce their strategies. Here’s how it works: Public Addresses: Every transaction on a blockchain involves public addresses. While these are pseudonymous, patterns of activity can reveal a single entity controlling multiple addresses. Transaction Volume: Tools track unusually large transactions, flagging them as potential ‘whale’ activity. Holding Periods: Analysts can see how long an asset has been held in a particular wallet, distinguishing long-term holders from short-term traders. Exchange Flows: Monitoring whether funds are moving to or from exchanges can indicate an intent to sell or buy. Analysts like @ai_9684xtpa use sophisticated software and deep understanding of blockchain data to piece together these narratives, providing invaluable insights into market dynamics that are otherwise opaque in traditional finance. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors For the average investor, the actions of a WBTC whale can be both fascinating and a source of anxiety. How should you react to such news? Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Panic Sell: While a whale sale can cause short-term dips, it rarely signifies the end of a bull market or a sustained downturn unless accompanied by other negative macroeconomic factors. Focus on Fundamentals: Bitcoin and WBTC’s long-term value is driven by adoption, network effects, and macroeconomic conditions, not solely by individual whale movements. Consider Your Own Strategy: Use whale activity as a data point, not a directive. Stick to your own investment plan, whether it’s dollar-cost averaging, long-term holding, or active trading. Learn On-Chain Basics: Understanding basic on-chain metrics can empower you to make more informed decisions rather than relying solely on news headlines. Risk Management: Always invest only what you can afford to lose and diversify your portfolio. The key is to maintain a balanced perspective and avoid emotional reactions to market news. A whale realizing profits is a natural part of the market cycle. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Power of the WBTC Whale The recent sale by a long-term WBTC whale serves as a powerful reminder of the significant influence large holders wield in the cryptocurrency market. Their strategic patience, culminating in a colossal $107 million profit, underscores the potential rewards of a disciplined, long-term investment approach in crypto. While such events can induce short-term volatility and spark intense market discussions, they are also a natural part of a maturing market, demonstrating profit-taking by early and astute investors. For the rest of us, it’s a valuable lesson in market dynamics, the importance of on-chain analysis, and the enduring power of conviction in the face of market cycles. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the movements of these giants will undoubtedly remain a key focus for investors and analysts alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a WBTC whale? A WBTC whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), typically enough to significantly influence market prices with their transactions. Their large holdings give them considerable power over market liquidity and sentiment. Q2: Why did this WBTC whale wait four years to sell? Waiting four years indicates a long-term investment strategy, often referred to as ‘HODLing.’ This allows investors to ride out market cycles, accumulate significant gains over time, and potentially sell at what they perceive as optimal price points to maximize profits. Q3: How does a WBTC whale’s sale impact the price of Bitcoin? While WBTC is distinct from native Bitcoin, its value is pegged 1:1 to BTC. Therefore, a large WBTC sale can indirectly add selling pressure to the broader Bitcoin market, potentially causing short-term price dips or increased volatility, especially if the market interprets it as a bearish signal from a major holder. Q4: Can ordinary investors track WBTC whale movements? Yes, ordinary investors can track WBTC whale movements using various on-chain analytics platforms and tools. These platforms provide data on large transactions, wallet balances, and fund flows, allowing users to monitor significant activity on the blockchain. Q5: Is a whale selling always a bad sign for the market? Not necessarily. While large sales can cause temporary price fluctuations and negative sentiment, they are a natural part of market cycles. Profit-taking by long-term holders can be healthy, allowing new capital to enter the market and preventing excessive concentration of wealth. It doesn’t always signal a sustained downturn. Q6: What should I do if I see a major WBTC whale selling? It’s important to avoid panic. Instead of reacting emotionally, use such information as one data point among many. Focus on your own investment strategy, research market fundamentals, and consider your risk tolerance. Diversifying your portfolio and sticking to a long-term plan are generally recommended over reacting to every whale movement.

This strategic purchase propels their total DigitalX Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 499.8 BTC, a milestone that underscores the growing institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies. This latest development, highlighted by crypto investor HODL15Capital on X, signals a bold commitment from DigitalX and provides a compelling insight into the evolving landscape of corporate treasury strategies in the crypto world. What Propels DigitalX’s Latest Bitcoin Acquisition? DigitalX, a pioneering force in the Australian digital asset sector, has consistently positioned itself at the forefront of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency investment. Their recent acquisition of 74.7 BTC is not merely an isolated transaction; it is a calculated step within a broader strategy to solidify their position as a major player in the global digital asset management arena. This particular acquisition brings their total Bitcoin treasury to just shy of 500 BTC, a psychological and financial benchmark that speaks volumes about their long-term vision for the asset. The decision to increase their DigitalX Bitcoin reserves reflects several key factors: Market Confidence: It signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition and its potential for future appreciation, even amidst market fluctuations. Strategic Positioning: By accumulating a substantial amount of BTC, DigitalX enhances its balance sheet strength and its capacity to participate more actively in the digital economy. Client Alignment: As a digital asset manager, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin aligns with the interests of their clients and positions them as experts in navigating the crypto market. This move is particularly noteworthy as it comes from a regulated entity operating within a mature financial market like Australia. It lends further credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. To put DigitalX’s growing commitment into perspective, consider the recent trajectory of their Bitcoin holdings: Period/Event Bitcoin Holdings (BTC) Change (BTC) Significance Previous Reported Holdings ~425.1 N/A Baseline for recent growth Latest Acquisition 74.7 +74.7 New strategic purchase Total Holdings 499.8 N/A Nearing 500 BTC milestone Why Are Leading Firms Like DigitalX Embracing Bitcoin? The trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets has gained significant momentum over the past few years, with DigitalX being a prominent example. This shift isn’t arbitrary; it’s driven by a confluence of economic factors and a re-evaluation of traditional asset allocation strategies. For many, DigitalX Bitcoin accumulation represents a forward-thinking approach to treasury management. Benefits of Bitcoin for Corporate Treasuries: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing inflation concerns and quantitative easing, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Its scarcity is often compared to digital gold. Store of Value / Digital Gold: Bitcoin has increasingly been recognized as a legitimate store of value, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Its borderless nature makes it resilient to geopolitical risks. Portfolio Diversification: For corporate treasuries heavily invested in traditional assets, Bitcoin offers a low correlation to conventional markets, providing diversification benefits and potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated unparalleled long-term growth potential. Companies investing in BTC are positioning themselves to benefit from its continued adoption and price appreciation as the digital economy matures. Challenges and Considerations: While the benefits are compelling, corporate Bitcoin adoption is not without its challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings, which can impact a company’s financial statements and require robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies must navigate complex and often ambiguous legal frameworks. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security protocols to prevent hacks or loss of private keys. Institutional-grade custody solutions are crucial. Despite these challenges, the increasing number of public companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, among others, that have added Bitcoin to their reserves, indicates a growing confidence in its long-term viability and strategic value. DigitalX’s latest move reinforces this institutional conviction. The Strategic Implications of DigitalX Bitcoin Holdings The accumulation of nearly 500 BTC by DigitalX carries significant implications, not just for the company itself but for the broader Australian and global digital asset markets. This substantial DigitalX Bitcoin treasury positions the company uniquely within the competitive landscape. Signaling Confidence: When a publicly traded, regulated entity like DigitalX makes such a pronounced investment in Bitcoin, it sends a powerful signal to the market. It suggests that despite the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, there is a strong conviction among sophisticated financial players regarding Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role in future finance. This can inspire greater confidence among retail and institutional investors alike, potentially encouraging further adoption. Balance Sheet Enhancement: Holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet. While it introduces exposure to price fluctuations, it also offers substantial upside potential. For DigitalX, this strategic holding could enhance its asset base, potentially improving its valuation and attractiveness to investors looking for exposure to the digital economy. Influence on the Australian Digital Asset Ecosystem: As a prominent Australian firm, DigitalX’s actions often set precedents within the local market. Their increased Bitcoin holdings could encourage other Australian companies, both within and outside the crypto sector, to explore similar treasury strategies. This could further legitimize Bitcoin within Australia’s financial framework and accelerate the country’s adoption of digital assets. Long-Term Vision: DigitalX’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin suggests a long-term strategic vision that transcends short-term market cycles. It indicates that they view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a foundational component of the future financial infrastructure, aligning their corporate strategy with the broader trajectory of digital transformation. Navigating the Digital Asset Frontier: Insights for Investors DigitalX’s strategic embrace of DigitalX Bitcoin provides valuable lessons for individual and institutional investors looking to navigate the dynamic world of digital assets. Understanding the rationale behind such corporate moves can inform your own investment decisions. Key Takeaways for Investors: Diversification is Crucial: While Bitcoin offers significant potential, a balanced portfolio that includes a mix of traditional and digital assets is generally recommended to mitigate risk. Research Crypto-Exposed Companies: Investing in companies like DigitalX, which actively hold and manage digital assets, can be an indirect way to gain exposure to the crypto market with the added layer of corporate governance and expertise. Understand the Long-Term Narrative: Institutional adoption of Bitcoin is often driven by a belief in its long-term fundamental value as a decentralized, scarce digital asset. Aligning with this long-term perspective can help weather short-term volatility. Assess Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance and only invest what they can afford to lose. Stay Informed: The digital asset space evolves rapidly. Continuously educating yourself on market trends, regulatory changes, and technological advancements is vital for making informed decisions. DigitalX’s latest acquisition serves as a powerful reminder that the institutional embrace of Bitcoin is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how corporations perceive and utilize digital assets within their financial frameworks. DigitalX’s strategic acquisition of an additional 74.7 BTC, bringing their total holdings to a formidable 499.8 BTC, marks a significant moment for the company and the broader digital asset market. This move reinforces the growing conviction among leading firms that Bitcoin is a vital component of a modern treasury strategy, offering a hedge against inflation, diversification benefits, and substantial long-term growth potential. While challenges such as volatility and regulatory uncertainty persist, companies like DigitalX are demonstrating a clear path forward, leveraging Bitcoin to strengthen their balance sheets and signal unwavering confidence in the future of decentralized finance. For investors, this serves as a powerful testament to the increasing legitimization of Bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset, urging a deeper understanding of its role in a diversified portfolio.

A1: DigitalX is an Australia-based digital asset manager that provides a range of services related to blockchain and digital assets, including funds management, advisory, and software development.

Navigating Early-Stage Opportunities: What Should Investors Consider with Binance Alpha Lnfi Network ? While the excitement surrounding new listings, especially on platforms like Binance Alpha, is palpable, it’s crucial for investors to approach early-stage opportunities with a balanced perspective. The potential for high rewards often comes with elevated risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Never rely solely on a listing announcement. Dive deep into Lnfi Network’s whitepaper, team background, technology, use case, tokenomics, and community activity. Understand what problem it solves and its long-term vision. Understand Volatility: Early-stage crypto projects are inherently more volatile. Be prepared for significant price fluctuations, especially shortly after listing. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider allocating a small portion of your portfolio to early-stage projects, as opposed to a large sum. Monitor Community and Development: A strong, active community and consistent development updates are positive indicators. Follow Lnfi Network’s official channels and development progress. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether your investment aligns with a long-term belief in the project’s vision or a short-term trading strategy. Both require different approaches to risk and capital management. The addition of Binance Alpha Lnfi Network presents an intriguing opportunity, but responsible investing remains paramount. Leverage the information available and make informed decisions. The Future of Binance Alpha and Emerging Projects: What’s Next?

After shattering its previous all-time highs and climbing above $3.60 in recent weeks, XRP has entered a critical zone where bulls and bears are battling for control. So, what can we expect from XRP in the next 24–48 hours? Current Market Behavior: XRP Holding Strong After Breakout Right now, XRP is trading above key support levels, particularly between $3.30 and $3.40. This zone has become important because it was once a strong resistance area, but after XRP broke above it, it has now turned into a support level. This flip from resistance to support is often seen as a bullish sign in technical analysis. XRP also retested and bounced off its previous all-time high, which adds to the strength of the ongoing uptrend. The price structure remains bullish, and unless it sees a breakdown below the $3.30 support, there’s a good chance that XRP could continue pushing higher. If XRP were to drop below $3.30, the next big support area would be between $2.75 and $3.20. This range includes key technical levels, like the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement from the recent rally. Falling below $2.65 would be a bigger concern, as that could mean the current bullish wave is ending or entering a deeper correction phase. On the flip side, if buyers continue to show strength, XRP could target $3.84 level as the next milestone, followed by $4.33 and even $4.72. How Bitcoin and Ethereum Could Impact XRP As always, it’s important to know that XRP doesn’t move in a vacuum. The overall crypto market, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, still plays a major role. If Bitcoin continues to consolidate near $118K without major dips, and if Ethereum avoids deeper corrections, XRP is likely to benefit. Another macro signal: Bitcoin dominance is declining, which means altcoins like XRP could continue to outperform in the short term.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 03:40:32

This isn’t just another corporate investment; it’s a strategic declaration of intent, signaling a profound belief in the future of digital assets. At the heart of this strategy is the filing of a substantial $500 million F-3 shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a pivotal step designed to fuel their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy . What’s Driving DDC’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy? Why would a well-established e-commerce giant like DDC pivot so strongly towards Bitcoin? The answer lies in a confluence of factors that are reshaping global financial strategies. Companies worldwide are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a robust store of value and a hedge against inflation. For DDC, this strategic shift is about future-proofing their balance sheet and diversifying their corporate treasury in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and economic uncertainty. Their goal is clear: to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of the year and solidify their position as one of the top three Bitcoin treasury companies within three years. This aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a foundational asset in the digital economy. The Mechanics Behind DDC’s $500M F-3 Shelf Registration: How It Fuels Bitcoin Holdings Understanding the financial instrument behind DDC’s monumental plan is key to grasping its potential impact. An F-3 shelf registration statement is essentially a filing with the SEC that allows a company to register securities for future issuance ‘off the shelf’ over a period of up to three years. This provides DDC with immense flexibility to raise capital through various offerings—such as common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or warrants—without having to file a new prospectus for each individual offering. Think of it as pre-approving a line of credit that can be drawn upon as needed. For DDC, this $500 million facility is specifically earmarked to accelerate their Bitcoin accumulation strategy . It provides the necessary financial muscle to execute large-scale purchases of BTC, allowing them to capitalize on market opportunities and build their digital asset reserves efficiently. This mechanism underscores a sophisticated approach to funding their ambitious crypto ventures, ensuring they have the liquidity to become a significant player in the Bitcoin treasury space. Why Aim for 10,000 BTC? DDC’s Vision for a Leading Bitcoin Treasury The target of accumulating 10,000 BTC by year-end is not arbitrary; it’s a strategic benchmark that would place DDC among the elite ranks of public companies holding substantial Bitcoin reserves. Currently, companies like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Tesla lead the pack. Company Approx. BTC Holdings (as of recent reports) Primary Business MicroStrategy ~214,400 BTC Business Intelligence Software Marathon Digital Holdings ~17,800 BTC Bitcoin Mining Tesla ~9,720 BTC Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy DDC Enterprise (Target) 10,000 BTC E-commerce Platform DDC’s ambition to join the top three Bitcoin treasury companies within three years signifies a profound belief in Bitcoin’s future as a global reserve asset. This isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it into their core financial strategy, potentially leveraging it for future growth, or even using it as collateral. This aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy demonstrates DDC’s forward-thinking approach, aiming to capture the upside potential of a decentralized digital economy while hedging against traditional financial risks. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Accumulation While DDC’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy presents immense opportunities, it also comes with its share of challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin is a primary concern. Its price can fluctuate wildly, impacting the value of DDC’s treasury holdings. However, for companies like DDC adopting a long-term ‘hodl’ strategy, short-term price swings are often viewed as temporary noise rather than fundamental threats. Another significant challenge is the evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies, which could introduce uncertainties for corporate holders. Security is paramount; safeguarding such substantial digital assets requires state-of-the-art cybersecurity measures and robust internal protocols to prevent hacks or loss. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities are compelling. Holding Bitcoin can offer: Diversification: Moving away from traditional assets and currencies. Inflation Hedge: Protecting purchasing power against fiat currency devaluation. Growth Potential: Tapping into the potential appreciation of a scarce digital asset. Enhanced Brand Image: Positioning DDC as an innovative, forward-thinking company in the digital age. DDC’s strategic move is a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin, despite its inherent risks. Their well-defined Bitcoin accumulation strategy indicates a calculated risk-reward assessment. What Does DDC’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Mean for the Market? DDC Enterprise’s bold step is more than just a company-specific event; it has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency market and corporate finance. Firstly, it adds another significant voice to the chorus of institutional adoption. Each major company that publicly embraces Bitcoin as a treasury asset lends further legitimacy and stability to the digital asset class. This can encourage other corporations, especially those in the tech and e-commerce sectors, to explore similar strategies. Secondly, the sheer scale of DDC’s planned Bitcoin accumulation strategy —targeting 10,000 BTC—suggests a sustained demand pressure on Bitcoin’s supply. While individual corporate purchases might not immediately trigger massive price spikes, a trend of multiple companies executing similar strategies could have a cumulative positive effect on Bitcoin’s long-term valuation. For investors, DDC’s move offers a compelling case study. It highlights how companies are adapting to a changing financial world and integrating digital assets into their core operations. It also underscores the importance of researching companies not just on their primary business, but also on their treasury management strategies in the digital age. This ongoing institutional interest is a key driver for Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream acceptance. DDC Enterprise’s filing of a $500 million F-3 shelf registration statement to bolster its Bitcoin accumulation strategy marks a pivotal moment for the company and the broader digital asset landscape. Their ambitious goal of acquiring 10,000 BTC and becoming a top-tier Bitcoin treasury company within three years is a powerful testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and strategic importance. This move not only positions DDC at the forefront of corporate crypto adoption but also signals a deeper integration of digital assets into traditional finance. As the lines between conventional and digital economies continue to blur, DDC’s proactive and well-defined Bitcoin accumulation strategy serves as a compelling blueprint for other enterprises looking to navigate the evolving financial frontier. It’s a clear indicator that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not as a fringe asset, but as a foundational element of a modern, resilient corporate treasury. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an F-3 shelf registration statement? An F-3 shelf registration statement is a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows a company to register securities for future issuance ‘off the shelf’ over a period of up to three years. It provides flexibility for a company to raise capital quickly without needing to file a new prospectus for each individual offering. 2. Why is DDC accumulating Bitcoin? DDC is accumulating Bitcoin as part of a strategic corporate treasury management plan. This move is driven by a belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value, an inflation hedge, and a way to diversify their balance sheet in a rapidly evolving global economy. 3. How much Bitcoin does DDC aim to hold? DDC Enterprise aims to increase its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of the current year, with the long-term goal of becoming one of the top three Bitcoin treasury companies within three years. 4. What are the risks associated with DDC’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy? Key risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, potential changes in cryptocurrency regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect significant digital asset holdings from theft or loss. 5. How does DDC compare to other companies holding Bitcoin? If DDC achieves its target of 10,000 BTC, it would place them among significant corporate holders like Tesla, though still behind leaders like MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital Holdings. Their strategy aims to position them in the top tier of Bitcoin treasury companies. 6. What does this mean for the future of corporate crypto adoption? DDC’s bold move signals increasing institutional confidence in Bitcoin and other digital assets. It could encourage more corporations, particularly in tech and e-commerce, to explore similar treasury strategies, further legitimizing cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance.

The crypto move announced on Tuesday said that PNC will also offer “best-in-class” banking services to Coinbase. The PNC-Coinbase deal comes amid growing demand for regulated crypto offerings. “This collaboration enables us to meet growing demand for secure and streamlined access to digital assets on PNC’s trusted platform,” said William S. Demchak, CEO of PNC Bank. PNC Bank has become one of the largest American banks to launch crypto services at large. Following years of cautious approach, US banks are increasingly embracing crypto, signalling steps toward deeper integration of digital assets in mainstream portfolios. “Traditional finance is slowly waking up to crypto’s call and is vying for a piece of the pie,” Gadi Chait, Xapo Bank’s Investment Manager, told Cryptonews. PNC Bank did not disclose the timeline for its crypto launch. Newfound Token Enthusiasm Among US Banks US banks are seeking deeper ties with crypto firms to avoid missing out on deals spurred by a more relaxed regime under Trump.

From sky-high targets to cautious forecasts, everyone wants to know where Bitcoin is headed next. While many enthusiasts dream of a rapid surge past previous all-time highs, a leading voice from the analytics firm Glassnode offers a more grounded perspective on the ambitious Bitcoin price prediction of reaching $200,000 in the near future. This nuanced view invites us to look beyond the hype and understand the intricate market dynamics at play. Glassnode’s Cautious Outlook on Bitcoin Price Prediction James Check, a prominent lead analyst at Glassnode, recently shared insights that temper the widespread optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s immediate price trajectory. In an interview on the YouTube channel “Less Noise More Signal,” cited by Cointelegraph, Check articulated why a rapid ascent to the $200,000 mark in 2025 appears unlikely based on current market conditions. His analysis highlights a critical factor: the existing buying volume simply isn’t robust enough to sustain such a monumental rally. This isn’t a bearish call but rather a realistic assessment of the market’s current momentum. Check’s perspective emphasizes that reaching specific price points is only half the battle. Establishing firm and stable support at these levels is equally, if not more, important. He specifically pointed to several key milestones that Bitcoin must not only touch but also consolidate above: $130,000: A significant psychological and technical barrier. $140,000: Building on the momentum from the previous level. $150,000: A crucial test of sustained buying pressure and investor confidence. The analyst’s warning is clear: without strong, stable support built at these intermediate levels, any swift price increase could be followed by an equally sharp and potentially damaging decline. This underscores the difference between a speculative spike and a sustainable, healthy market trend. Understanding this nuance is vital for anyone interested in the future of Bitcoin price prediction . Understanding the Mechanics Behind Bitcoin Price Prediction What exactly does “weak buying volume” signify in the context of Bitcoin price prediction ? In simple terms, it means that while there might be interest in Bitcoin, the collective purchasing power and conviction of buyers are not strong enough to absorb potential selling pressure at higher price points. This can lead to a lack of momentum and makes it difficult for Bitcoin to break through significant resistance levels convincingly. Several factors contribute to robust or weak buying volume, helping demystify market movements: Retail vs. Institutional Demand: While retail investors contribute, large institutional players often provide the necessary capital for sustained rallies. Their current appetite significantly impacts overall volume. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events can influence investor risk appetite, diverting capital. Market Liquidity: High liquidity means plenty of buyers and sellers, easing large trades without drastic price impact. Weak volume often correlates with lower liquidity. On-Chain Metrics: Glassnode tracks blockchain data like active addresses, transaction volume, and exchange flows, providing deep insights into genuine market activity versus speculative noise. The emphasis on “establishing firm footing” highlights the importance of consolidation phases. These periods allow for price discovery, accumulation by strong hands, and the building of support zones. Without them, a rapid pump often results in a rapid dump, leaving many investors caught off guard. This is a crucial lesson for anyone looking at long-term Bitcoin price prediction models. Navigating Key Milestones on Bitcoin’s Journey: A Practical Bitcoin Price Prediction Approach The levels of $130,000, $140,000, and $150,000 are not arbitrary figures. They represent significant psychological barriers and potential resistance points that Bitcoin has not yet confidently overcome. For Bitcoin to truly embark on a sustained journey towards $200,000 and beyond, it needs to demonstrate its ability to not only touch these levels but to hold them, turning old resistance into new support. This process involves: Testing Resistance: Price approaches a key level, and sellers emerge, pushing the price back down. Breaking Through: Strong buying pressure overcomes the selling pressure, and the price moves above the resistance. Re-testing Support: The price often pulls back to the newly breached level, which now acts as support. If it holds, it confirms the strength of the move. Consolidation: The price trades within a relatively narrow range above the new support, allowing for further accumulation and preparing for the next leg up. This methodical approach, as advocated by Glassnode’s analysis, is a hallmark of healthy market cycles. Ignoring these steps in favor of a purely speculative surge often leads to unsustainable pumps. Therefore, when evaluating any Bitcoin price prediction , it’s essential to consider the journey, not just the destination. Challenges and Opportunities for Bitcoin’s Growth and Bitcoin Price Prediction While Glassnode’s analysis presents a cautious short-to-medium term Bitcoin price prediction , it doesn’t negate Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, influenced by a confluence of factors. Understanding these challenges and opportunities provides a more holistic view: Challenges: Regulatory Headwinds: Increased scrutiny and potential regulations from governments worldwide could impact adoption and market sentiment. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Persistent inflation, interest rate hikes, or a global recession could reduce investor appetite for risk assets. Competition: The rise of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could divert attention and capital from Bitcoin. Opportunities: Institutional Adoption: Continued inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and increased corporate treasury adoption could provide significant buying pressure. Halving Event Impact: The supply shock from Bitcoin’s halving events historically precedes bull runs, though the effect might be more muted over time. Technological Advancements: Innovations like the Lightning Network continue to enhance Bitcoin’s utility, making it faster and cheaper for everyday transactions. The interplay of these factors will ultimately determine the trajectory of Bitcoin price prediction . A cautious approach, balancing optimism with realistic market assessment, remains key. Actionable Insights for Navigating Bitcoin Price Prediction Given the insights from Glassnode and a broader understanding of market dynamics, what can investors and enthusiasts do? Here are some actionable insights: Insight Category Actionable Advice Diversification Do not put all your capital into one asset. Diversify your crypto portfolio and consider traditional assets too. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps average out your purchase price over time. Risk Management Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders or pre-defined exit strategies to protect your capital. Stay Informed Follow reputable analysts like James Check from Glassnode, and reliable news sources. Understand on-chain metrics and macroeconomic trends. Long-Term Vision While short-term price movements can be volatile, Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition as a decentralized, scarce digital asset remains strong for the long term. Adopting a disciplined and informed approach, rather than succumbing to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), is crucial for navigating the unpredictable waters of Bitcoin price prediction . Beyond Glassnode: A Spectrum of Bitcoin Price Prediction Views It’s important to remember that Glassnode’s perspective, while highly respected, is one among many. The world of Bitcoin price prediction is filled with diverse opinions, ranging from ultra-bullish to outright skeptical. Some analysts foresee Bitcoin reaching well over $500,000 in the coming years, citing factors like increasing institutional adoption, diminishing supply post-halving, and its growing acceptance as a global reserve asset. Others remain bearish, pointing to regulatory risks, environmental concerns, and inherent market volatility. The key takeaway is to synthesize information from various credible sources, understand the underlying reasoning behind different forecasts, and form your own informed opinion. No single analyst or firm holds a crystal ball, and the market is constantly evolving. What Glassnode offers is a data-driven, on-chain perspective that provides valuable insights into the actual activity occurring on the Bitcoin network, which can be a more reliable indicator than purely speculative models. In conclusion, while the allure of Bitcoin reaching $200,000 or even higher remains a compelling narrative, Glassnode’s lead analyst James Check provides a necessary dose of realism. His insights underscore that a sustainable ascent requires more than just speculative interest; it demands robust buying volume and the methodical establishment of strong support levels at key milestones like $130,000, $140,000, and $150,000. This expert perspective highlights the importance of market fundamentals and healthy consolidation phases over rapid, unsupported pumps. For investors and enthusiasts, this isn’t a signal to abandon hope but rather an encouragement to approach Bitcoin price prediction with patience, diligence, and a keen eye on on-chain data and broader market dynamics. The journey to new highs for Bitcoin is likely to be a marathon, not a sprint, paved by consistent demand and structural support. Staying informed and adopting a long-term strategy will be paramount in navigating Bitcoin’s exciting, yet challenging, future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding Bitcoin’s price trajectory and market analysis: Q: Why is Glassnode’s analysis considered important for Bitcoin price prediction? A: Glassnode is a leading on-chain analytics firm. They provide data directly from the blockchain, offering insights into genuine market activity, investor behavior, and network health, which can be more reliable than traditional market indicators. Q: What does “weak buying volume” mean for Bitcoin’s price? A: Weak buying volume suggests that there isn’t enough sustained purchasing power to push the price significantly higher and maintain those gains. It indicates a lack of strong conviction from buyers, making the asset vulnerable to pullbacks. Q: Are the $130,000, $140,000, and $150,000 levels critical for Bitcoin? A: Yes, according to Glassnode’s analyst, these are key resistance levels. Bitcoin needs to not only reach these prices but also establish firm support above them through consolidation to ensure a sustainable upward trend towards higher targets. Q: Does this mean Bitcoin will never reach $200,000? A: Not necessarily. Glassnode’s analysis suggests it’s unlikely to happen in 2025 under current conditions. It emphasizes that a sustainable path to $200,000 requires stronger market fundamentals and consolidation, rather than just a rapid speculative surge. Q: What factors could help Bitcoin reach higher price targets? A: Factors include increased institutional adoption (e.g., Bitcoin ETF inflows), favorable macroeconomic conditions, sustained retail interest, positive regulatory developments, and a healthy on-chain accumulation trend.

Recently, the PUMP token has found itself at the center of such a shift, with data indicating a significant exodus among its early supporters. What does it mean when the very investors who got in on the ground floor decide to jump ship? Let’s dive deep into the recent movements surrounding the PUMP token and understand the implications of this alarming trend. Understanding the PUMP Token Private Sale Landscape Every new cryptocurrency project often begins with a private sale, a crucial phase where early investors, often referred to as ‘whales’ or venture capitalists, acquire tokens at a discounted rate before they hit the broader public market. For the PUMP token , this initial price was set at $0.004. This phase is designed to raise initial capital, build a foundational community, and reward early belief in the project’s vision. However, the real test of a token’s stability and investor confidence comes when it launches publicly and its price begins to fluctuate. For PUMP token , the price dipping below its private sale threshold of $0.004 has triggered a wave of reactions from its earliest backers. This scenario is not uncommon in the volatile crypto space, but the scale of the response offers critical insights into investor psychology and market dynamics. The Alarming Exodus: Who’s Selling Their PUMP Token? Recent data from blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain, shared on X (formerly Twitter), paints a stark picture of the current sentiment among PUMP token private sale investors. The findings reveal a dramatic shift in holdings, indicating a lack of long-term conviction from the majority of these early participants. Here’s a breakdown of the investor actions: Only 12.7% Remain Holding: A tiny fraction of the original private sale investors are still holding onto their PUMP token holdings. This suggests that the vast majority have either realized losses, taken profits (if they sold above the private sale price initially), or moved their assets for other reasons. 31.6% Sold on DEXs: Nearly a third of private sale investors have actively sold their PUMP token holdings on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This direct selling pressure contributes significantly to price depreciation and signals a clear intent to exit their positions. 2.7% Bought More: A very small, albeit resilient, group of investors has chosen to ‘buy the dip,’ increasing their PUMP token holdings. This indicates a strong belief in the project’s long-term potential, or perhaps an attempt to average down their cost basis. 53% Moved to New Wallets (Including CEXs): The largest segment of private sale investors, over half, have moved their PUMP token to new wallet addresses. While some of these moves might be for security or portfolio restructuring, a significant portion likely involves depositing tokens to centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the intent of selling. Moving to a CEX often precedes a large sell-off due to better liquidity and easier fiat off-ramps. This distribution of actions highlights a clear pattern: the dominant sentiment among PUMP token ‘s earliest supporters is one of divestment, not accumulation. The data underscores the fragility of early investor commitment when a token’s price dips below its initial private sale valuation. Why Are PUMP Token Investors Bailing Out? The decision to sell, especially at a loss, is rarely made lightly. Several factors likely contribute to why PUMP token private sale investors are choosing to exit their positions: Price Performance Below Private Sale Threshold The most immediate and obvious reason is the PUMP token ‘s current market price falling below its private sale price of $0.004. For early investors, this means their investment is currently underwater. Holding onto a losing asset, especially in a volatile market, can be psychologically taxing and lead to decisions to cut losses. Lack of Perceived Momentum or Development While the initial private sale might have been based on strong promises and a compelling roadmap, a lack of visible progress, delayed milestones, or waning community engagement post-launch can erode investor confidence. If investors don’t see tangible reasons for the price to recover, they are more likely to exit. Broader Market Conditions The overall cryptocurrency market sentiment plays a crucial role. During bear markets or periods of high uncertainty, even promising projects can struggle to maintain investor interest. A general risk-off sentiment can prompt investors to de-risk their portfolios, starting with more speculative or underperforming assets like PUMP token . Liquidity Needs or Reallocation Some private sale investors are institutional entities or large individual players who need to manage their capital strategically. They might reallocate funds to more promising ventures, cover operational costs, or simply cash out if they perceive better opportunities elsewhere in the market. What Does This Mean for the Future of PUMP Token? An exodus of private sale investors is a significant event for any cryptocurrency project. It presents both challenges and, potentially, opportunities for the PUMP token project and its community: Challenges: Increased Selling Pressure: The ongoing selling by early investors creates downward pressure on the price, making it harder for the token to recover and attract new buyers. Damaged Reputation: A high rate of private sale investor sell-offs can signal a lack of confidence in the project, deterring new investors and partners. Concentrated Holdings: If the remaining holdings become highly concentrated among a few whales, it could lead to concerns about market manipulation or centralized control. Opportunities: Redistribution of Supply: As early investors sell, the token supply becomes more decentralized, potentially leading to a healthier distribution among a broader base of retail investors. New Investor Base: A lower price point might attract new investors who missed the private sale and see value at the current levels, especially if the project shows signs of renewed development or positive news. Community Resilience: Projects that survive early investor dumps often emerge with a stronger, more committed community of true believers who are in it for the long haul. Navigating Volatility: Lessons for PUMP Token Holders and Beyond For current or prospective PUMP token holders, understanding these dynamics is crucial. This situation serves as a powerful reminder of several key principles in crypto investing: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on the participation of early investors. Thoroughly research the project’s fundamentals, team, technology, and roadmap. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Private sales are inherently high-risk, high-reward ventures. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Understand your investment horizon. Are you looking for quick gains, or do you believe in the project’s long-term vision? Early investor behavior often reflects a short-term profit-taking strategy. Market Sentiment Matters: Be aware of the broader market trends. Even strong projects can struggle in a bearish environment. The PUMP token saga is a microcosm of the broader crypto market’s volatility and the complex interplay of price action, investor psychology, and project development. While the immediate outlook for PUMP token might seem challenging given the private sale investor exodus, the future will depend on the project’s ability to innovate, deliver on its promises, and rebuild trust with a new, potentially more resilient, investor base. Conclusion: The significant sell-off and transfer of holdings by PUMP token private sale investors highlight the precarious nature of early-stage crypto investments and the critical importance of sustained project development. With only a small percentage of initial investors retaining their positions, the PUMP token project faces a pivotal moment. Its ability to navigate this period of skepticism, attract new capital, and demonstrate tangible progress will determine its long-term viability. For investors, this serves as a potent reminder that even early access does not guarantee success, and diligence remains paramount in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a private sale in cryptocurrency? A private sale is an early funding round for a cryptocurrency project where tokens are sold to a select group of investors (e.g., venture capitalists, institutional investors, or high-net-worth individuals) at a discounted price before the public launch. It helps projects raise initial capital and establish a foundational investor base. Q2: Why did most PUMP token private sale investors sell their holdings? The primary reason cited is the PUMP token ‘s price dropping below its private sale price of $0.004, leading many early investors to cut losses or reallocate capital. Other factors could include perceived lack of project progress, broader market downturns, or strategic portfolio management. Q3: What does it mean if investors move their tokens to new wallet addresses, including CEXs? Moving tokens to new wallet addresses can have various reasons, but when it includes centralized exchanges (CEXs), it often indicates an intention to sell. CEXs provide better liquidity and easier pathways to convert crypto to fiat currency, making them preferred platforms for large sell-offs. Q4: Is it common for private sale investors to sell off quickly? While not universally true, it’s a common phenomenon, especially for projects that don’t immediately gain traction or whose prices dip below initial investment levels. Early investors often have a shorter investment horizon or are focused on quick returns, making them more prone to selling when conditions are unfavorable. Q5: What are the potential implications for the PUMP token’s future? The exodus creates significant selling pressure and can damage the project’s reputation. However, it also presents an opportunity for supply redistribution and the attraction of a new, potentially more committed, investor base at a lower price point. The project’s future largely depends on its ability to deliver on its roadmap and regain investor confidence. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

Analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex say the asset’s structural strength remains intact; however, the bull market is entering a more delicate and reactive phase. According to the weekly Bitfinex Alpha report , the market is seeing a natural rotation between bitcoin holder cohorts. While this capital rotation reflects a maturing cycle, BTC faces the risk of near-term fragility, especially if demand weakens. Bitcoin Faces Near-term Fragility For the first time since early 2024, long-term bitcoin holders have begun to distribute their holdings and lock in profits. This cohort of investors has already started to send more BTC to exchanges and newer wallets. As they sell their assets, newer market participants, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutional buyers, and retail investors, are buying and absorbing the supply. Bitfinex said ETFs and bitcoin treasury companies account for a significant portion of the purchases. This rotation from long-term to short-term holders is a common feature of every bull cycle. However, the strength of spot demand will determine whether BTC will enter a cooling period or experience another rally. Currently, on-chain data shows that the majority of the BTC supply is now held in profit. Bitcoin’s spot price has climbed above the 95th percentile level, indicating a sharp increase in the number of investors sitting on unrealized profits. Such dynamics often trigger high profit-taking from short-term holders and opportunistic investors. Subsequently, the market sees a redistribution of supply to new buyers at higher prices. This could drive a short-term bitcoin uptrend, but weaken the market structure and increase the cost basis. Bitfinex insists that sharp price drops could lead to broader declines in such environments. This increases the risk of volatility and corrective phases, especially if buyer momentum fades. Altcoins Are Surging With bitcoin cooling off now, altcoins are witnessing what analysts called “an aggressive catch-up rally.” Investors are now reallocating their capital from BTC to large-cap altcoins in pursuit of additional gains. Many major altcoins are outperforming BTC for the first time since November 2024, with ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) leading the charge. The Others Index, a metric that tracks the performance of cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and the top 10 assets by market capitalization, has surged by at least 35% in two weeks, adding almost $85 billion. Additionally, bitcoin’s dominance has declined by 6.9%, marking seven consecutive daily declines for the first time since December 2023.

Two names stand out: Solana (SOL) and MAGACOIN FINANCE , the fast-rising altcoin shaking up the low-cap market. Meanwhile, more established tokens like Chainlink (LINK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are struggling with weakening volume and limited price action. MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight in Crypto Presale Scene MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as one of the most talked-about low-cap tokens of 2025. The token is attracting early investors with its presale model, explosive upside potential, and community-driven vision. Currently in Chapter 1 – Stage 3 of its presale, MAGACOIN is priced attractively with an expected listing price that presents a compelling growth opportunity for early buyers. Notably, MAGACOIN is backed by audited smart contracts and is compatible with major ERC-20 wallets, including MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Its core mission is to deliver financial empowerment through decentralization, transparency, and open participation. Additionally, the token’s presale allocation prioritizes community ownership. As each new stage sells out, the price automatically increases, creating urgency for investors who don’t want to miss the next major crypto presale breakout. Solana Sets $280–$300 Target After Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) has also captured investor interest with a confirmed cup-and-handle breakout above the $150 level. Analysts, including Alek Carter, now project a rally toward $280 to $300. He cited the break of a long-term descending trendline and strong support from Fibonacci levels. As of this press time, Solana is hovering above at $150, a 4% increase in the past day. The technical strength is further validated by rising on-chain demand. According to data from June 28, the number of wallets holding more than 0.1 SOL reached a record 11.44 million. Notably, a whale recently spent $1.24 million to acquire Solana-based tokens. Chainlink and Dogecoin Struggle with Volume and Resistance While Solana and MAGACOIN trend upward, Chainlink (LINK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are showing signs of fatigue. LINK is trading at $14, reflecting a 5.7% drop over the past 24 hours. Despite daily volume hitting $490.24 million, the token has been unable to break past the $14.50 resistance. The resistance between $13.7–$14.20 remains crucial, with analysts, including Altwolf, watching for a possible drop toward $12.00 if momentum doesn’t return. However, a MACD crossover on the hourly chart suggests possible accumulation if support holds. Meanwhile, DOGE is currently at $0.174, up 7.8% on the day. But indicators such as RSI (52.13) and ATR (0.00178) suggest a neutral to slightly bullish trend. The price remains above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages but lacks the breakout momentum seen in SOL or MAGACOIN. Conclusion As altcoin markets search for the next big mover, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a strong contender among low-cap opportunities. Its presale-driven tokenomics and aggressive upside potential put it in a similar league with breakout stars like Solana. For investors scouting the best crypto presale of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one name quickly rising to the top of the radar. With a potential 3400% surge from the listing price, this is the best time to invest in the token.

Some altcoins are moving sideways, but others are flashing major upside potential. With momentum shifting fast, technical signals are starting to matter more. Right now, Chainlink and Toncoin are pulling in attention. The LINK price pattern is showing a clear double-bottom setup and could form a golden cross soon. At the same time, TON technical analysis confirms a breakout from a long-term triangle pattern, pointing to a possible run toward $3.80. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is already moving. Its X1 app and X10 miner are working together to generate 200 BDAG daily. This setup, paired with the NO VESTING PASS and fixed $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price, brings real-time earnings and full early access together. LINK Price Pattern Could Lead to a Big Jump The current LINK price prediction is heating up. A double-bottom at $10.87 and a possible golden cross, with the 50-day and 200-day WMAs about to align, are key signals. If LINK breaks above the $17.84 neckline, it could climb 85% to $30, its highest level this year. Other signals are backing this LINK price pattern too. RSI and ADX show strong momentum. Whale wallets have raised their LINK holdings by 20% in 90 days, reaching 2.85 million. Meanwhile, exchange supply is down to 201 million, the lowest since mid-June. This mix points to rising demand and shrinking sell pressure. TON Technical Analysis Aims at $3.80 Target Recent TON technical analysis shows Toncoin broke above a key triangle pattern, reaching $3.23, its top level since early May. The 20, 50, and 100-day EMAs are all moving upward between $2.97 and $3.14, confirming a strong trend. RSI sits at 67.39, showing momentum is strong but not overheated. The next major hurdle is near $3.63, close to the 200-day EMA. Even with a $733,000 outflow on July 17, the bullish setup stays in play if TON holds above $3.20. TON technical analysis now points to $3.80 as a possible target, with dips to $2.95–$3.00 looking like normal pauses in the trend. BlockDAG’s X1 and X10 Set to Boost Daily BDAG Rewards BlockDAG is bringing crypto mining to the next level with its X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware device. This week’s live demo will show how both tools work together to turn simple user activity into real daily BDAG earnings. What makes the X10 stand out is how easy it is to use. It’s the size of a Wi-Fi extender and supports plug-and-play setup with Wi-Fi and Ethernet options. When connected to the X1 app, it can boost mining rewards by up to 10 times, reaching up to 200 BDAG per day. The X10 links to the app through Bluetooth, helping increase output using BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Engagement algorithm. It’s designed for anyone, from first-time users to experienced miners, offering solid results in a compact device. As buzz builds around the demo, BlockDAG’s top offer is still available. The NO VESTING PASS gives users full access to their BDAG at launch, with no lockups like other presales. BDAG remains priced at $0.0016 for a short time as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With $348 million raised and 24.1 billion coins sold already, the clock is ticking. For anyone checking the market for the best crypto to buy today, BlockDAG mixes real rewards with rare early access, letting everyday users earn daily from their devices. The Bottom Line The LINK price pattern and TON technical analysis both point toward strong upside potential. LINK shows a clear double-bottom along with a golden cross setup that could lead to an 85% breakout. Whale wallets are loading up, and exchange supply is falling fast. TON has already pushed through a triangle formation, and with momentum building above key EMAs, the $3.80 target is getting closer. While LINK and TON continue their upward moves, BlockDAG is standing out by making mining rewards easy and accessible. Its X1 and X10 pair offers a 10x reward boost and gives full BDAG access at launch through the NO VESTING PASS. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release price ending on August 11, skipping this could mean missing out on the best crypto to buy today .

That future is increasingly becoming our present, especially when it comes to Ethereum. Recent data from Strategic Ethereum Reserve reveals a monumental milestone: institutional Ethereum holdings have officially surpassed an astonishing $7 billion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal, representing 1.87 million ETH, or approximately 1.55% of the total ETH supply. This significant accumulation by large-scale investors speaks volumes about the growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value and its pivotal role in the evolving digital economy. What’s Behind the Remarkable Growth in Institutional Ethereum Holdings? So, what exactly is attracting these financial giants to Ethereum? It’s a combination of factors that highlight Ethereum’s unique position in the blockchain ecosystem. Understanding these drivers helps us appreciate the depth of this institutional commitment: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Appeal: Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s the foundational layer for a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps), including the booming sectors of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Institutions recognize the immense potential of this programmable blockchain, seeing it as the internet’s next evolution rather than just a digital currency. The Merge and Staking Rewards: The successful transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, often referred to as ‘The Merge,’ was a game-changer. It made Ethereum more energy-efficient and, crucially, introduced staking. Institutions can now stake their ETH to earn yield, offering a predictable revenue stream that aligns with traditional investment strategies. This yield-generating capability makes institutional Ethereum holdings far more attractive than simply holding a non-productive asset. Maturing Regulatory Landscape: While still evolving, the regulatory environment around cryptocurrencies is slowly but surely gaining clarity. As more jurisdictions develop frameworks for digital assets, institutional investors find it easier to navigate the compliance challenges, reducing perceived risks associated with large-scale crypto investments. Diversification from Bitcoin: For a long time, Bitcoin was the sole focus for institutional crypto adoption. However, as the market matures, institutions are looking to diversify their digital asset portfolios. Ethereum, with its distinct use cases and economic model, offers a compelling alternative and complement to Bitcoin, making it a natural choice for expanding their institutional Ethereum holdings . The Market Impact: How Institutional Ethereum Holdings Reshape the Crypto Landscape The influx of institutional capital into Ethereum isn’t just good news for ETH holders; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto market. This trend signifies a profound shift, moving cryptocurrencies from the fringes of finance to a more central position. Increased Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: When large financial institutions commit billions to an asset, it sends a powerful message. It signals that Ethereum is a serious, legitimate asset class, capable of being integrated into traditional financial portfolios. This helps to erode skepticism and builds broader public and corporate trust. Enhanced Liquidity and Reduced Volatility: Institutional investors typically trade in large volumes, which can significantly increase market liquidity. Greater liquidity often leads to reduced price volatility, making Ethereum a more stable and attractive asset for a wider range of investors, both retail and institutional. Potential for New Financial Products: The growing interest in institutional Ethereum holdings could pave the way for more regulated financial products like Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) in various jurisdictions. These products would further lower barriers to entry for traditional investors, funneling even more capital into the ecosystem. Shift in Market Dynamics: Historically, the crypto market has been heavily influenced by retail sentiment. While retail remains crucial, the increasing presence of institutions means market dynamics will likely become more aligned with traditional financial markets, where fundamental analysis and long-term strategies play a more dominant role. Benefits and Challenges of Institutional Ethereum Adoption While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge the potential challenges that come with such significant institutional involvement: Benefits Challenges Market Stability: Large holdings can absorb volatility. Centralization Concerns: Risk of concentration of power. Increased Liquidity: Easier and more efficient trading. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased pressure for compliance. Enhanced Legitimacy: Boosts crypto’s reputation. Market Manipulation Risk: Potential for large players to influence prices. Innovation & Development: Funding for ecosystem growth. Yield Compression: Increased competition for staking rewards. Delving Deeper: The Significance of 1.55% of Total ETH Supply in Institutional Ethereum Holdings While $7 billion is an impressive figure, understanding its proportion to the total supply provides crucial context. The fact that 1.87 million ETH, representing 1.55% of the total supply, is now held by institutions underscores a deliberate, strategic positioning rather than speculative trading. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it suggests a long-term conviction in Ethereum’s utility and growth trajectory. To put this into perspective, consider Bitcoin’s journey. Early institutional adoption of Bitcoin started with similar percentages, gradually growing over time. The accumulation of institutional Ethereum holdings could be seen as an early indicator of a similar, if not faster, adoption curve for ETH, given its unique technological advantages and a more diverse range of use cases beyond just a store of value. This percentage also indicates that institutions are not just buying for short-term gains but are likely integrating ETH into their core investment strategies, possibly holding it for staking rewards, participating in DeFi protocols, or even using it for enterprise blockchain solutions. It signifies a belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value and its potential to be a cornerstone of future financial infrastructure. Charting the Course: Opportunities and Hurdles for Institutional Ethereum Holdings The path forward for institutional Ethereum holdings is filled with both exciting opportunities and formidable hurdles. The narrative is one of continuous evolution and adaptation. Opportunities: Further Product Innovation: The increasing institutional comfort with ETH will likely spur the creation of more sophisticated financial products, making it easier for a broader range of investors to gain exposure. Enterprise Adoption: As Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency improve, we could see more enterprises directly utilizing the network for supply chain management, digital identity, and other business-critical applications, further cementing its value proposition. Global Expansion: As regulatory clarity spreads across different nations, institutional adoption of Ethereum is likely to become a global phenomenon, unlocking new markets and capital pools. Hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainties: Despite progress, a unified global regulatory framework for digital assets is still a distant dream. Shifting regulations in key markets could pose challenges for institutions. Scalability Challenges: While Ethereum has made significant strides with upgrades, the network’s ability to handle massive transaction volumes efficiently remains a key area of development. Future scalability solutions will be crucial for sustained institutional confidence. Competition: The blockchain space is dynamic, with new layer-1 solutions constantly emerging. Ethereum must continue to innovate to maintain its dominant position and attract further institutional investment. For individual investors, monitoring these trends offers valuable insights. The growth of institutional Ethereum holdings suggests a maturation of the asset class, potentially leading to less volatile and more predictable market movements in the long run. It underscores the importance of understanding Ethereum’s fundamentals, its technological roadmap, and its role in the broader decentralized ecosystem. The remarkable surge in institutional Ethereum holdings past the $7 billion mark is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to Ethereum’s undeniable growing influence in the global financial landscape. This significant accumulation by major players underscores a profound shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. It highlights Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its innovative technological advancements like The Merge, and its potential to deliver long-term value. While challenges remain, the clear trend of increasing institutional confidence positions Ethereum as a cornerstone of the future digital economy, signaling a new era of mainstream adoption and integration for blockchain technology. This milestone is not just about the money; it’s about the legitimization and long-term strategic positioning of Ethereum as a critical asset class.

A significant announcement from South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has caught the attention of CORE token holders worldwide. Bithumb is set to implement a temporary CORE token suspension for deposits and withdrawals, a move that directly impacts users of the popular blockchain asset. This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a standard procedure designed to support the upcoming Core’s network upgrade, ensuring the long-term health and efficiency of the network. What Exactly is This CORE Token Suspension on Bithumb? Bithumb, a prominent player in the South Korean crypto market, made an official announcement on its website regarding the upcoming halt. Starting at 01:00 UTC on July 31 , users will temporarily be unable to deposit or withdraw their CORE tokens. This planned interruption is a direct measure to facilitate the seamless execution of the Core network’s anticipated upgrade. Date and Time: The suspension begins at July 31, 01:00 UTC. It’s crucial for users to note this specific timestamp to manage their transactions accordingly. Affected Services: Only deposits and withdrawals of CORE tokens are impacted. Trading of CORE tokens on Bithumb is typically unaffected by such suspensions, allowing users to continue trading if they wish, but it’s always wise to confirm this directly with Bithumb’s official announcements. Reason: The primary reason for this temporary halt is to support the Core network’s upcoming upgrade. This is a crucial step for any blockchain, as it allows for improvements, bug fixes, and new feature integrations. Understanding the specifics of this CORE token suspension is vital for users to manage their assets effectively and avoid any potential inconvenience. It’s a proactive step by the exchange to safeguard user funds and ensure compatibility with the upgraded network, reflecting a commitment to operational integrity and user protection. Why Are Network Upgrades Necessary, and What Does it Mean for CORE? Blockchain networks, much like traditional software or operating systems, require periodic upgrades to improve performance, enhance security, introduce new features, or fix existing bugs. These upgrades are essential for the network’s long-term viability, scalability, and competitiveness in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. For the Core network, this upcoming upgrade signifies a commitment to progress and innovation, ensuring it remains robust and efficient. When a blockchain undergoes an upgrade, it often involves changes to its underlying protocol or consensus mechanisms. Exchanges like Bithumb must ensure their systems are fully compatible with these changes before resuming normal operations. Failure to do so could lead to a range of critical issues, including: Loss of Funds: Transactions sent during an incompatible period might be lost, stuck, or irrecoverable, leading to significant financial loss for users. Transaction Errors: Deposits or withdrawals might fail repeatedly, be delayed indefinitely, or even result in incorrect amounts being processed. Security Vulnerabilities: Unpatched or incompatible systems could become exposed to new exploits or attacks that target the differences between the old and new network versions. Network Instability: Incompatible operations could contribute to network congestion or instability, affecting all users. Therefore, a temporary CORE token suspension is not merely a convenience but a protective and necessary measure. It allows Bithumb to halt operations, conduct necessary technical adjustments, thoroughly test their systems against the upgraded Core network, and then resume services once everything is confirmed to be stable, secure, and fully compatible. This meticulous approach minimizes risks for users and maintains the integrity of the exchange’s operations. How Should CORE Token Holders Prepare for the Suspension? For individuals holding CORE tokens on Bithumb, preparation is key to navigating this temporary service interruption smoothly. While the suspension is a routine and temporary measure, being aware of the timeline and potential implications can prevent unnecessary stress and ensure your assets are managed effectively. Here are some actionable insights and best practices for CORE token holders: Plan Ahead: If you anticipate needing to deposit or withdraw CORE tokens around July 31, it is highly recommended that you complete these transactions well in advance of the 01:00 UTC deadline. This foresight will help you avoid any last-minute rush or potential inconvenience. Monitor Bithumb Announcements: Keep a close eye on Bithumb’s official website, their social media channels, and any email announcements. Exchanges are typically very proactive in communicating updates regarding such suspensions, including the exact duration and when services are expected to resume. Rely only on official sources to avoid misinformation. Consider Off-Exchange Wallets: For long-term storage of your CORE tokens, or if you anticipate needing immediate access to your funds during the suspension period, consider moving them to a private, non-custodial wallet that you control. This offers greater autonomy and direct access to your assets, but it also comes with the significant responsibility of securing your private keys. Understand Trading Status: While deposits and withdrawals are suspended, trading of CORE tokens on Bithumb might remain active. If you plan to trade CORE during this period, confirm the specific trading status directly with Bithumb’s official announcement. Do not assume trading will be unaffected. Stay Calm and Patient: These suspensions are standard operational procedures in the crypto world. They are implemented for the safety and benefit of users and the network. Patience during the upgrade period is advisable. This period of CORE token suspension is designed for the network’s benefit and your asset’s security. By taking these simple, proactive steps, users can navigate it smoothly and confidently. What Are the Broader Implications of Exchange Suspensions for Crypto Users? The Bithumb CORE token suspension is not an isolated event; rather, it is a common occurrence across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Such temporary halts are a reflection of the dynamic and constantly evolving nature of blockchain technology. They serve as important reminders for all crypto users about the operational realities of centralized exchanges and the underlying networks they support. Benefits of such suspensions for the ecosystem and users: Enhanced Security: By pausing operations, exchanges can ensure their systems are fully up-to-date with the latest network protocols, significantly reducing vulnerability to potential attacks or exploits that might arise from protocol changes. Improved Performance: Upgrades often bring improvements to the underlying blockchain, which can lead to faster transaction speeds, lower transaction fees, and overall better network efficiency once the suspension is lifted. New Features: Suspensions facilitate the seamless integration of new functionalities introduced by the network upgrade, allowing users to benefit from advanced capabilities. Fund Safety: This is paramount. By preventing transactions during a period of potential incompatibility, exchanges actively protect user assets from being lost or corrupted. Challenges these suspensions can pose for users: Limited Liquidity: The inability to move funds can impact immediate trading strategies, prevent users from capitalizing on short-term market movements, or hinder urgent financial needs if funds are locked on the exchange. Uncertainty: While usually communicated, the exact duration of a suspension can sometimes be unpredictable, leading to anxiety or frustration for users who need access to their funds. Missed Opportunities: Users might miss out on significant price movements if they cannot deposit or withdraw funds to react to market changes. These events underscore the importance of diversified asset management, the use of private wallets for long-term holdings, and not relying solely on a single exchange for all crypto activities. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any seasoned crypto investor. How Does Bithumb Ensure User Trust During a CORE Token Suspension? Reputable exchanges like Bithumb understand that transparency and clear communication are paramount, especially during periods of service interruption. Their official announcement on the CORE token suspension is a testament to their commitment to keeping users informed and maintaining trust within their user base. Bithumb, being a major South Korean exchange, operates under a regulated environment, which often necessitates strict adherence to operational guidelines and security protocols. When they announce a suspension for a network upgrade, it signifies several key aspects of their operational integrity: Proactive Risk Management: Rather than waiting for problems to arise, Bithumb is taking proactive steps to prevent potential issues, demonstrating a responsible approach to platform management. Technical Due Diligence: The suspension allows their technical teams to conduct thorough due diligence, preparing their infrastructure to seamlessly integrate with the upgraded Core network without compromising security or functionality. User Protection as a Priority: The primary goal of such a suspension is to ensure the safety and integrity of user assets during the transition period, minimizing any potential risks associated with network changes. Regulatory Compliance: Operating in a regulated market, Bithumb’s actions often align with best practices for maintaining a secure and compliant trading environment, which includes careful management of network upgrades. Users should always refer to Bithumb’s official channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the suspension and its eventual lifting. This builds trust and ensures users are not left in the dark, reinforcing the exchange’s commitment to its community. The upcoming CORE token suspension on Bithumb, scheduled for July 31, is a routine yet crucial step in the ongoing evolution of the Core blockchain network.

There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $3.480 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $3.350 zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Increase XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $3.350 level, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $3.50 resistance level. The bulls remained in action and the price gained pace for a move above $3.550 barrier. Finally, the price tested the $3.650 zone.

While the actual legal process moves at a careful, measured pace, social media has turned the case into a battleground of predictions and wishful thinking. The Latest Rumor: A Settlement by August 15? The latest rumor claims that there’s a 70–90% chance of a settlement between Ripple and the SEC by August 15, 2025. Supporters believe Judge Analisa Torres’ earlier rulings are making it tough for the SEC to push forward. According to this version of events, the only thing left is the SEC’s final status report. Understanding the Real Process Behind a Dismissal Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel stepped in to clear the air and explained how things actually work behind the scenes at the SEC. After Judge Torres’ June 26 ruling, the SEC needs time to prepare an enforcement recommendation. According to Fagel, this process typically takes 1 to 2 months. Once ready, that recommendation is sent to the SEC commissioners, who must vote before any action, like dismissing the case, can be taken. The odds of a $50m penalty and no injunction are 0%. The court has already resolved that. Sorry. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 22, 2025 He also clarified an important detail: dismissing a pending case requires a commissioner vote, but closing an investigation that hasn’t led to a filed case doesn’t. No Deadlines, Just Status Updates There’s no strict deadline for Ripple or the SEC to dismiss their appeals. However, both sides are required to file a status update with the court by around August 15. If they do agree to settle or end the appeals, they’ll file dismissal papers publicly. The SEC might also issue a public announcement, though that’s not guaranteed. When Will It Happen? It’s Still Just Speculation As for when the dismissal or settlement might actually happen? Fagel says plainly: “It’s all speculation.” It could happen within the next few weeks, or take longer. It depends entirely on how fast the SEC’s internal process moves. He stressed that the Ripple case isn’t facing any unusual delay. There’s no conspiracy, no cover-up, and nothing out of the ordinary happening.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 04:09:22

Every hour brings more action: fees climb, token launches multiply, and trading activity spikes. Charts light up like fireworks. It’s no longer just hype. It’s numbers. In the past 24 hours alone, @bonk_fun’s core metrics jumped 33.7%. Meanwhile, $MEMECOIN, one of its standout launches, skyrocketed 3,173.5%. The message is clear: BonkFun is having a moment. Yesterday, BonkFun raked in $1.84 million in platform fees, surpassing even Solana, Jito, and Binance Staked ETH on the daily fee leaderboard. This signals more than a spike— it’s launchpad dominance. And the ripple effect is bullish for $BONK, which now trades at $0.000037 with a $2.96B market cap, ranking #39 on CoinMarketCap. Burn to Earn: BONK’s Deflationary Edge Here’s where it gets even more interesting: 50% of BonkFun’s platform fees go toward buying and burning BONK. That cuts supply. That increases scarcity. That applies price pressure. Traders? They’re paying attention. As the broader Solana launchpad space begins to rebound, BonkFun is leading the charge. After a sluggish Q2, daily launchpad revenue just hit a two-month high—a strong reversal from the cycle’s low. To put that in perspective: January’s weekly peak: $143.1M March low: $37.7M June slump: $45.3M Today? Climbing again, with BonkFun at the front of the pack. $SOL : Launchpad Revenues Rebounding on @bonk_fun – Launchpad led revenue boosts Solana; BonkFun led surge takes daily launchpad revenue to 2-month high, despite broader YTD declines. – Total launchpad revenue down ~68% from January’s peak of $143.1m to $45.3m in June; March… pic.twitter.com/dOqsiheyyk — Deep Value Memetics (@DV_Memetics) July 22, 2025 From Underdog, Now Bonkfun Command Market Lead BonkFun now commands $9.6M in weekly Solana launchpad revenues, dwarfing PumpFun’s $3.6M. And here’s the kicker—just eight weeks ago, BonkFun was trailing at $490K. The growth is no fluke. Over 80% of BonkFun’s volume leverages RaydiumProtocol’s LaunchLab SDK. That’s a powerful combination of deep liquidity and developer-first tooling. In the past week alone, BonkFun facilitated 160,000 token launches, Generated $10.4M in platform volume, Saw 1,500 “graduations” (tokens reaching advanced stages). Also, it then produced 41 tokens that crossed the $1M market-cap threshold. Those numbers point to real depth, demand, and quality output—not just meme-fueled froth. Competitor Snapshot: PumpFun and BelieveApp PumpFun posted $3.5M from 674 launches, with a 0.88% graduation rate and 285 tokens crossing $1M caps. That suggests higher capital density, but a smaller overall ecosystem. BelieveApp once stole the spotlight in May, posting $12M in revenue, topping PumpFun and BonkFun. But its momentum fizzled. Today, BonkFun resurges. Builders are shifting focus. What’s Driving the Shift? Three things: Ease of use – Devs favor BonkFun’s SDK stack Burn mechanisms – 50% fee-to-burn means long-term upside Community energy – Traders and creators are aligned Expect the next phase to focus on stronger SDK integrations, launch quality filters, and real-time analytics. BonkFun appears ready to filter out noise and elevate serious projects. The chatter is real on X (formerly Twitter) with keywords such as: “BonkFun’s metrics break records.”, “SDK ease wins builders.”, “Watch the next token cohort: high‑quality launches incoming.” and many more others. A month ago, BonkFun was the challenger. Today, it’s the category leader. It’s pulling capital, redefining standards, and rewriting expectations. The next few weeks will be a test of sustainability: Can it maintain its fee trajectory? Will burn pressure keep $BONK deflationary? Will quality launches continue to graduate above 0.9%? For now, though, the launchpad roars. Fees feed burns. Traders chase gains. Builders pour in. And $BONK’s chart tells the story—steady ascent, growing conviction.

This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a testament to the power of community, brand building, and strategic innovation within the Web3 space.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.7861 Market Cap $1.37B Trading Volume $334.46M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.8117 24-hour Low $0.7362 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.48% 50-Day SMA $0.6292 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 22/30 (73%) 200-Day SMA $0.9844 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP faces critical resistance at $0.80-$0.81 with declining momentum. Daily uptrend remains intact above $0.669 SMA. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP strong uptrend with potential reversal warning The daily OP/USDT chart for July 23 displays a powerful uptrend that lifted the token to $0.784, representing a substantial 42% gain over the past three weeks. The price has been moving with a clear ascending trendline, with each pullback finding support. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The 20-day simple moving average at $0.669 continues to provide dynamic support, sitting well below current price action and confirming the bullish momentum. However, the MACD indicator presents mixed signals as the blue line trades above the signal line, though the momentum appears to be flattening near recent highs. The most concerning development is the formation of two consecutive red candles at the $0.80 resistance zone, suggesting sellers are stepping in at these levels and potentially marking a short-term peak. Optimism 4-hour price chart: Short-term indicators signal consolidation as volatility contracts The 4-hour chart reveals OP trading within a tight consolidation pattern around $0.784, with the Bollinger Bands showing significant compression that typically precedes major price movements.

OP is likely heading for sideways action or a pullback after failing to hold above $0.80 multiple times. The Bollinger Band squeeze hints at downward pressure toward $0.75-$0.76 support. If the daily trendline and $0.669 support break, we could see a drop to $0.60-$0.65. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

A prominent whale investor, known on X as @Jason60704294, has reportedly initiated a colossal Bitcoin short position, valued at over $200 million. This isn’t just a casual trade; it’s a high-stakes maneuver that has captivated the attention of traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. With a substantial margin of $36.2 million, an entry price of $119,425.23, and a liquidation price set at $133,678.54, this daring bet against Bitcoin’s immediate upward trajectory has opened up a fascinating discussion about market sentiment, risk, and the immense power of whale activity. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Short , Anyway? Before diving deeper into the implications of such a massive trade, it’s crucial to understand the mechanics behind a Bitcoin short position. In essence, short selling is a trading strategy where an investor speculates on the decline in an asset’s price. It’s the opposite of the more common ‘long’ position, where investors buy an asset hoping its price will rise. Borrow and Sell: When you short an asset like Bitcoin, you first borrow it from a broker. You then immediately sell that borrowed Bitcoin at the current market price. Buy Back and Return: The goal is to buy back the same amount of Bitcoin later at a lower price. Once bought, you return the borrowed Bitcoin to the broker, pocketing the difference between the initial selling price and the lower repurchase price. Margin Trading: This particular Bitcoin short involves margin. Margin trading allows traders to borrow funds from a broker to increase their trading capital, amplifying potential profits (and losses). The $36.2 million margin acts as collateral for the $200 million position, indicating a significant leverage ratio. Liquidation Price: The liquidation price ($133,678.54 in this case) is a critical threshold. If Bitcoin’s price rises to this level, the investor’s position will be automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses that exceed their margin. This means the initial margin collateral would be lost. This strategy is inherently risky because, unlike going long (where losses are limited to your initial investment), potential losses on a short position are theoretically unlimited. If Bitcoin’s price were to skyrocket indefinitely, the short seller would continue to lose money. Why Would a Whale Place Such a Large Bitcoin Short Bet? The decision by a whale to open a multi-million dollar Bitcoin short isn’t made lightly. Such a move usually stems from a strong conviction about the asset’s future price action. Several factors could motivate such a significant bearish bet: Bearish Market Outlook: The most straightforward reason is a belief that Bitcoin’s price is due for a significant correction or sustained downtrend. This could be based on technical analysis, fundamental shifts in the crypto landscape, or broader macroeconomic concerns. Hedging Strategy: It’s possible the whale holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin in their long-term portfolio and is using this short position as a hedge. A hedge is like an insurance policy; if the price of their existing Bitcoin holdings drops, the profits from the short position could offset those losses. Anticipation of Negative News: Whales often have access to information or insights before it becomes public. They might be anticipating regulatory crackdowns, major exchange hacks, or other negative news that could depress Bitcoin’s value. Exploiting Market Weakness: If the whale perceives a lack of strong buying pressure or an overextended market, they might see an opportunity to profit from a downward move. They might believe that current prices are unsustainable. Liquidity Play: In some cases, very large players might open positions to influence market sentiment or liquidity, though this treads into complex and sometimes regulated territory. Regardless of the specific motivation, this whale is betting big on a decline from Bitcoin’s current high valuation, expecting it to fall significantly from its $119,425.23 entry point. How Does Whale Activity Influence the Bitcoin Market ? The actions of ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding massive amounts of cryptocurrency – are closely watched in the crypto market. Their large trades can create significant price movements and influence market sentiment. When a whale opens a substantial Bitcoin short , it can have several effects: Immediate Market Reaction: Increased Volatility: The sheer size of a $200 million position can inject volatility into the market. Other traders might react by adjusting their own positions, leading to rapid price swings. Sentiment Shift: News of a major short can spark bearish sentiment. If other investors believe a whale with deep pockets and potential insights is betting against Bitcoin, they might follow suit, leading to a cascade of selling pressure. Liquidation Cascades: If the price moves against the whale’s short position, forcing a liquidation, it could trigger a ‘short squeeze.’ This happens when forced buy-backs by short sellers push the price up rapidly, potentially liquidating other short positions and creating a chain reaction. Conversely, if the price drops, liquidations of long positions could accelerate the decline. Longer-Term Implications: Testing Support Levels: A large short can test the resilience of Bitcoin’s support levels. If the market absorbs the selling pressure, it might indicate underlying strength. If it breaks, further declines could follow. Market Efficiency: Whale trades, while impactful, are also part of the market’s natural price discovery mechanism. They contribute to the dynamic interplay of supply and demand. It’s important to remember that while whales have significant influence, they are not infallible. Many large positions, both long and short, have resulted in substantial losses for the whales themselves. The market is complex and influenced by countless factors beyond any single player. What Are the Risks for This Bitcoin Short Position? While the potential profits from a successful Bitcoin short of this magnitude are enormous, the risks are equally substantial, if not greater. This whale is navigating a treacherous path in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Key Risks Include: Unlimited Loss Potential: Unlike going long, where your maximum loss is your initial investment, a short position’s loss potential is theoretically unlimited. If Bitcoin were to continue its ascent past the liquidation price, the whale’s losses could far exceed their $36.2 million margin. Given Bitcoin’s history of parabolic rallies, this is a very real concern. Volatility and Short Squeezes: Bitcoin is notorious for its extreme price swings. A sudden positive news event, a large institutional buy, or a wave of retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) could trigger a rapid price increase, leading to a devastating short squeeze that liquidates the position quickly. Funding Rates: On perpetual futures contracts (often used for shorting), traders pay or receive funding rates. If the market is predominantly long, short sellers typically pay a funding fee, which can erode profits over time, especially for a position held for an extended period. Regulatory Changes: Unexpected regulatory announcements from major economies could either benefit or harm Bitcoin’s price, creating unforeseen volatility that could jeopardize the short. Market Manipulation: While difficult to prove, the possibility of other large entities attempting to ‘squeeze’ a massive short position by aggressively buying Bitcoin exists, particularly if they are aware of its liquidation levels. The liquidation price of $133,678.54 serves as a stark reminder of the precise point at which this high-stakes gamble could turn into a significant loss for the whale. Every price movement towards that level will be a moment of increasing tension. What Should Average Investors Learn from This Bitcoin Short ? For the everyday crypto investor, the news of a whale’s multi-million dollar Bitcoin short can be intimidating or even confusing. However, there are crucial lessons to extract from such high-profile events: Do Not Blindly Follow: It’s tempting to mimic the trades of large, seemingly well-informed investors. However, whales operate with vastly different capital, risk tolerance, and access to information than retail traders. Their strategies may involve complex hedges or market manipulation tactics that are not applicable or beneficial to smaller portfolios. Understand Risk Management: This whale’s position highlights the importance of setting clear entry and exit points, as well as understanding liquidation levels. For your own investments, always define your risk tolerance and use tools like stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Focus on Your Own Research: While market sentiment is a factor, base your investment decisions on your own thorough research (DYOR). Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its technology, adoption trends, and long-term potential, rather than reacting impulsively to single large trades. Volatility is Inherent: This event underscores Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. Be prepared for significant price swings and avoid investing more than you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment in a revolutionary technology. Short-term price fluctuations, even those caused by large whale movements, may not impact the long-term thesis for holding BTC. This event serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market is a dynamic arena where fortunes can be made and lost rapidly. It reinforces the need for caution, education, and a well-thought-out investment strategy. Navigating the Waves: The Future of This Bitcoin Short As the crypto community watches closely, the fate of this colossal Bitcoin short position hangs in the balance. Will @Jason60704294’s audacious bet pay off, cementing their status as a prescient market mover? Or will Bitcoin’s relentless upward momentum, fueled by adoption and institutional interest, prove too strong, leading to a dramatic liquidation? The coming days and weeks will be telling. This single trade, while significant, is but one data point in a vast and interconnected global market. It underscores the high stakes involved in cryptocurrency trading and the constant battle between bullish and bearish forces. For investors, it’s a powerful lesson in risk, reward, and the unpredictable nature of digital assets. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Bet with Market-Wide Implications The $200 million Bitcoin short opened by @Jason60704294 is more than just a massive trade; it’s a litmus test for current market sentiment and a vivid illustration of the risks and rewards inherent in high-leverage cryptocurrency positions. While the outcome remains uncertain, this event provides invaluable insights into whale behavior, market dynamics, and the critical importance of robust risk management. As Bitcoin continues its journey, such bold maneuvers will undoubtedly continue to shape its narrative and challenge perceptions of its future trajectory. Stay informed, stay cautious, and always prioritize your financial well-being in this exhilarating market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Bitcoin Short Positions Q1: What does it mean to ‘short’ Bitcoin? A1: To ‘short’ Bitcoin means to bet that its price will fall. Traders borrow Bitcoin, sell it at the current price, and hope to buy it back later at a lower price to return it, profiting from the price difference. Q2: What is ‘margin’ in the context of a Bitcoin short ? A2: Margin is collateral (your own funds) that you put up to borrow a larger amount of money or assets from a broker to open a larger trading position. It amplifies both potential gains and losses. Q3: What is a ‘liquidation price’ and why is it important for a Bitcoin short ? A3: A liquidation price is the point at which an exchange will automatically close a leveraged position to prevent further losses when the market moves against the trader. For a Bitcoin short , if BTC’s price rises to this level, the short position is closed, and the trader’s margin is lost. Q4: Can a single whale’s Bitcoin short really impact the entire market? A4: While no single trade guarantees market direction, a very large position like a $200 million Bitcoin short can certainly influence market sentiment, increase volatility, and potentially trigger cascading effects due to its size and the psychological impact on other traders. Q5: What are the biggest risks of opening a Bitcoin short ? A5: The primary risks include theoretically unlimited losses if the price rises significantly, the high volatility of Bitcoin which can lead to rapid liquidations (short squeezes), and the costs associated with funding rates on perpetual contracts. Q6: Should I consider opening a Bitcoin short based on this news? A6: No. Retail investors should exercise extreme caution. Whale trades are often part of complex strategies, and attempting to mimic them without sufficient capital, experience, and risk management can lead to significant financial losses.

Among the most challenging hurdles faced by affected individuals, particularly for FTX creditors , has been the complex issue of jurisdiction. For months, the specter of exclusion loomed large for users in certain regions, threatening to cut them off from any potential restitution. However, recent developments from the ongoing FTX bankruptcy hearing have cast a powerful new light of hope on this grim situation. What’s the Latest Breakthrough for FTX Creditors? The crypto community, especially the beleaguered FTX creditors , has been closely following every update from the bankruptcy proceedings. A significant turning point emerged from a recent post on X by @historian_ftx, an account widely believed to be an FTX creditor themselves, providing crucial insights from the latest hearing. This update signals a potentially game-changing shift for those previously left in limbo due to their geographical location. At the heart of this breakthrough is an updated motion that aims to significantly scale back or even entirely remove a contentious clause. This clause previously allowed for the immediate forfeiture of claims based solely on a creditor’s jurisdiction at the time of the exchange’s collapse. Imagine the relief for thousands of FTX creditors who might have believed their claims were effectively nullified by an accident of geography. The implications are profound: Flexibility in Location: Creditors who completed their Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements in what are now considered restricted countries (such as China or potentially Russia) may no longer be permanently barred from receiving distributions. Relocation Option: Crucially, these FTX creditors may now be permitted to relocate to non-restricted jurisdictions, like the crypto-friendly hubs of Singapore or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and still qualify for their rightful distributions. Dynamic Jurisdiction: This clarifies a vital point: jurisdiction is not irrevocably locked at the moment of a snapshot or initial claim filing. Instead, it can be updated and verified closer to the actual distribution phase. This offers a lifeline to users who, for instance, might have been traveling or residing elsewhere but used a restricted country’s address for their initial KYC. This positive development directly addresses concerns that arose after a July 2 court filing in the FTX bankruptcy case, which listed 49 countries and regions where users might be excluded from compensation. For many FTX creditors , this felt like an unjust punishment for circumstances beyond their control. The new motion offers a path forward, prioritizing restitution over rigid geographical constraints. How Will This Impact FTX Creditors in Restricted Regions? The news is a beacon for thousands of FTX creditors who felt their claims were dead in the water. For those in countries like China, where crypto activities face stringent regulations, or Russia, grappling with international sanctions, this update offers a tangible path to recovery. Let’s explore the multifaceted impact this development is expected to have: Benefits for Affected FTX Creditors: Access to Distributions: The most immediate and significant benefit is the potential for previously excluded users to finally access their share of the recovered funds. This is a fundamental step towards fairness and equity in the bankruptcy process. Increased Flexibility: It provides much-needed flexibility for individuals whose residency or citizenship status might have changed since the FTX collapse, or for those who initially registered with an address in a restricted country but primarily reside elsewhere. Reduced Legal Uncertainty: By clarifying the dynamic nature of jurisdiction, the new motion helps reduce the immense legal uncertainty that has plagued many FTX creditors . It provides a clearer framework for qualification. Potential for Higher Recovery Rates: While counterintuitive, allowing more claimants to participate can sometimes lead to a more efficient and less litigious distribution process overall, potentially speeding up recoveries for all FTX creditors . Challenges and Considerations for FTX Creditors: While the news is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial for FTX creditors to understand that the path forward still involves complexities. Relocating to a new jurisdiction, even for the purpose of claiming funds, is not a trivial undertaking. Consider the following: Logistical Hurdles: Establishing residency in a new country involves significant logistical planning, including visa applications, housing, and potentially new bank accounts. This can be time-consuming and costly. Legal and Tax Implications: Different jurisdictions have varying tax laws regarding crypto assets and bankruptcy distributions. FTX creditors should seek expert legal and financial advice to understand the tax implications of receiving funds in a new country. Verification Process: The process of verifying new residency and ensuring compliance with KYC/AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations in the new jurisdiction will be critical and may require significant documentation. Timing: While the motion offers hope, the exact timeline for distributions remains uncertain. FTX creditors will need patience as the legal proceedings unfold. This development underscores the importance of staying informed and being prepared for proactive steps, rather than passively waiting for resolutions. What Steps Should FTX Creditors Take Now? With this promising update, many FTX creditors are undoubtedly wondering what their next move should be. While the details of the implementation will emerge over time, there are several actionable insights and preparatory steps you can consider: 1. Stay Informed Through Official Channels: Regularly check the official FTX bankruptcy website and court filings for the most accurate and up-to-date information. Follow reputable crypto news outlets and legal analysts who are closely tracking the proceedings. Be wary of unverified information circulating on social media. 2. Review Your Documentation and KYC Details: Gather all records related to your FTX account, including your initial KYC documents, transaction history, and any communication with FTX. If you are an FTX creditor who completed KYC in a restricted jurisdiction but reside elsewhere, begin compiling proof of your current residency. 3. Consult Legal and Financial Advisors: This is perhaps the most crucial step. Seek advice from legal professionals specializing in international law, bankruptcy, or crypto, especially if you are considering relocation. A financial advisor can help you understand the tax implications of receiving distributions in a new jurisdiction and plan accordingly. 4. Evaluate Relocation Options (If Applicable): If you are an FTX creditor in a restricted region and relocation is a viable option for you, research countries known for their clear crypto regulations and ease of residency for foreign nationals, such as Singapore or the UAE. Understand the costs, time commitments, and requirements associated with such a move. 5. Exercise Patience and Prudence: While the news is encouraging, the bankruptcy process is inherently slow and complex. Avoid making hasty decisions based on speculation. Protect yourself from scams. No legitimate entity will ask for your private keys or demand upfront fees to facilitate your claim. Taking these proactive steps can empower FTX creditors to navigate the evolving landscape more effectively and increase their chances of a successful recovery. Beyond Jurisdiction: What Else Matters for FTX Creditors? While the jurisdiction breakthrough is monumental, it’s just one piece of the intricate puzzle for FTX creditors . The ultimate recovery will depend on several other critical factors that continue to unfold in the bankruptcy proceedings. Understanding these elements is essential for a complete picture: Overall Recovery Percentage: The key question for all FTX creditors remains: what percentage of their lost assets will ultimately be recovered? This depends on the total value of assets recovered by the bankruptcy estate versus the total verified claims. Recent reports suggest a potential for significant recovery, possibly even 100% for some claims, but this is not yet guaranteed. Asset Valuation Date: The date at which the recovered crypto assets are valued for distribution purposes is crucial. Will it be their value at the time of FTX’s collapse, or their current market value? This decision can significantly impact the final payout for FTX creditors , especially given the volatility of crypto markets. Claims Process Details: The specifics of how claims are filed, verified, and reconciled will continue to be a focus. FTX creditors must ensure their claims are accurately submitted and supported by documentation. Ongoing Legal Proceedings and Appeals: The bankruptcy case is dynamic, with various parties involved in legal battles. Outcomes of these appeals or new legal challenges could still influence the timeline and terms of distribution. Operational Costs of Bankruptcy: The fees and expenses incurred during the bankruptcy process itself can reduce the total pool of funds available for distribution to FTX creditors . The court aims to minimize these, but they are an unavoidable part of the process. These factors collectively shape the final outcome for every FTX creditor , making it imperative to monitor not just jurisdiction news, but the broader bankruptcy proceedings as a whole. The journey for FTX creditors has been a testament to resilience in the face of unprecedented financial upheaval. The recent update regarding jurisdiction offers a powerful glimmer of hope, signaling a shift towards a more equitable and inclusive distribution process. While challenges remain, particularly for those considering relocation, the newfound flexibility represents a significant victory for fairness. This development reaffirms the commitment of the bankruptcy estate to maximize recoveries for all affected parties, regardless of their initial geographical constraints. As the proceedings continue to unfold, proactive engagement, informed decision-making, and expert consultation will be paramount for FTX creditors aiming to navigate this complex path towards restitution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for FTX Creditors Q1: What does the updated motion regarding jurisdiction mean for FTX creditors? The updated motion indicates that the clause allowing immediate forfeiture of claims based on jurisdiction may be scaled back or removed. This means FTX creditors in previously restricted regions may now be able to receive distributions, potentially by relocating to a non-restricted jurisdiction before funds are disbursed. Q2: Which jurisdictions were previously considered ‘restricted’ for FTX creditors? A July 2 court filing listed 49 countries and regions where users might be excluded from compensation. Examples of countries often cited include China and potentially Russia, due to their strict regulations or international sanctions. Q3: Do I have to relocate to receive my funds if I’m in a restricted jurisdiction? The updated motion suggests that relocation to a non-restricted jurisdiction (like Singapore or UAE) may be a viable path for FTX creditors to become eligible for distributions. While not explicitly mandatory for all, it appears to be a key mechanism for those otherwise excluded. Q4: What steps should FTX creditors in restricted areas take now? It’s crucial to stay updated on official announcements, review your KYC documentation, and strongly consider consulting with legal and financial advisors. If relocation is an option, begin researching the requirements and implications of moving to a new jurisdiction. Q5: When can FTX creditors expect to receive distributions? While this update is positive, the exact timeline for distributions remains uncertain. Bankruptcy proceedings are lengthy and complex, and further court approvals and logistical arrangements are required before funds can be disbursed to FTX creditors . Q6: Will all FTX creditors receive 100% of their funds back? While there have been optimistic reports about the potential for high recovery rates, including up to 100% for some claims, it is not yet guaranteed. The final recovery percentage for FTX creditors will depend on the total value of recovered assets versus verified claims, as well as ongoing legal and operational costs. We hope this comprehensive overview provides clarity and guidance for FTX creditors navigating this complex process.

MAGACOIN FINANCE—a meme-powered altcoin with a political edge—has officially surpassed $11.2 million raised from verified investors. No celebrity shoutouts. No VC push. Just pure, community-first traction backed by on-chain data and smart infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE Crosses $11M — A Top Altcoin Gains Traction While the majors cycle through ETF speculation and technical resistance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving differently. The decentralized political memecoin is now officially over $11.2 million raised from verified contributors, with more than 5,234 wallets connected across its multi-device interface. Here’s what makes it different: Weekly volume up 320% 1,500+ new wallets added in under 48 hours Fully audited contract (HashEx verified, CertiK ongoing) Fixed 170 billion token supply, zero-tax, and anti-centralisation ethos Seamless wallet sync across MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet While meme tokens often thrive on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on alignment. The narrative is clear: this isn’t a pump—it’s a politically grounded, community-owned asset tapping into ideological capital. And it’s happening during a market phase where belief and belonging often outperform flashy tech. TRON Holds Strong as ETF Momentum Builds TRON (TRX) continues to hold steady near $0.29, bolstered by steady DeFi TVL growth and major ecosystem news. The integration of The Graph’s Substreams gives developers real-time access to TRON’s on-chain data—unlocking faster dApp deployment and boosting protocol utility. Institutional attention is also rising. REX Shares has filed for a 2X leveraged TRON ETF, and Justin Sun’s pledge to acquire the TRUMP coin using $100 million is bringing political meme energy directly into the TRON ecosystem. While these moves are driving engagement at the infrastructure layer, the TRX price action remains mostly range-bound. That’s why some traders are turning their attention to earlier-stage altcoins with stronger upside narratives. Litecoin Gains Institutional Traction Ahead of ETF Decision Litecoin (LTC) is gaining new life. With ETF optimism rising, Bloomberg analysts now estimate a 95% approval likelihood by October, meaning LTC is back on institutional radars. The Thumzup Media treasury buy-in, backed by Donald Trump Jr., adds a political twist to what has long been a tech-first payments coin. Technically, Litecoin is improving, too. The LitVM upgrade and LitePay 2.0 rollout aim to improve cross-chain functionality and merchant usability. Still, LTC’s growth remains closely tied to macrocycles and ETF decisions, leaving some investors seeking more grassroots-driven opportunities. Kaspa Tests Key Levels as Sentiment Turns Cautiously Bullish Kaspa (KAS) is testing the $0.088–$0.090 resistance zone after rebounding from earlier lows. It’s now trading above its 100-day moving average for the first time in weeks, with traders eyeing a breakout if volume can hold. However, sentiment remains mixed. Fear & Greed metrics hover in “Greed” territory, suggesting upside potential but also caution around overbought conditions. Kaspa’s strong fundamentals and loyal base remain intact, but the chart still needs confirmation. Final Thoughts TRON is building infrastructure, Litecoin is chasing ETF approval, and Kaspa is grinding toward technical confirmation. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is doing something different: building culture. With no VC backers, no tax friction, and a clearly defined message rooted in political identity and decentralization, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into a spotlight many thought was reserved for older meme coin giants. And with volume and wallets climbing week after week, the market is starting to pay attention.

After reaching above $123,000 earlier this month, the asset has pulled back slightly, trading at $119,343 at the time of writing. This represents a 2% gain over the past week but still leaves BTC roughly 3% below its recent peak. The muted price action reflects a market that appears to be consolidating amid diverging signals from on-chain indicators and regional demand metrics. Recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributors points to a weakening appetite for Bitcoin in both the US and South Korea, two markets that have historically contributed significant trading volume. A closer look at exchange activity and regional pricing premiums suggests a potential shift in investor behavior, as profit-taking becomes more prominent and traders appear hesitant to buy at current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? Regional Premiums Point to Lower Demand from US and South Korea According to a post by CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain, the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges, has failed to climb significantly despite BTC reaching record highs in July. The index remained around levels seen in June, suggesting that US investors using Coinbase have not been aggressively buying Bitcoin during the rally. Arab Chain noted that the index’s movement toward negative territory alongside Bitcoin’s price increase may indicate profit-taking among American investors. This implies that some may be anticipating a correction before re-entering the market. Similarly, the Korea Premium Index has declined, signaling reduced demand from retail investors in South Korea. This index reflects the spread between Bitcoin’s price on Korean exchanges and global averages. The negative trend suggests Korean traders have been selling below the global average, with weak buying interest on local platforms. Arab Chain interprets this as retail traders possibly waiting for a discount to reenter the market, indicating caution among individual investors in Asia’s key crypto hub. Exchange Inflows Suggest Rising Sell Pressure Adding to the picture, another CryptoQuant contributor, ShayanMarkets, highlighted a notable development in BTC’s on-chain activity. The latest data reveals Bitcoin has experienced its largest net inflow to exchanges since July 2024. Typically, large inflows signal that holders are preparing to sell, increasing supply on trading platforms and contributing to potential downward price pressure. ShayanMarkets explained that this behavior, especially when occurring near all-time highs, may indicate institutional or fund-driven profit-taking. Such moves often align with efforts to reduce risk exposure during overextended market rallies. Historically, spikes in exchange inflows have been followed by price corrections, making this a trend to monitor closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Are Taking Profits—But Is the Top Still Far Away? However, the redistribution of capital from Bitcoin into other assets may benefit the broader crypto market. The analyst noted that altcoins could see renewed interest as funds rotate out of BTC. If the trend continues, traders may observe increased volatility and speculative movement across alternative tokens in the short term.

Solana Price Gains Momentum Solana price started a decent increase after it cleared the $180 resistance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $185 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $200 resistance. A high was formed at $207 and the price is now correcting gains.

Stablecoins, which are often backed by government bonds, are becoming a vital entry point for RWA adoption. Meanwhile, Republican senators have introduced the Responsible Financial Innovation Act to complement the House’s CLARITY Act, aiming to establish a clearer digital asset market structure. GENIUS Act Could Fuel Rise of Tokenized RWAs Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is quickly becoming one of Wall Street’s most significant innovations, and its momentum is expected to grow even faster after the recent passage of the GENIUS Act in the United States. According to Solomon Tesfaye , the newly appointed chief business officer at Aptos Labs, the legislation is a strong signal that US lawmakers are ready to embrace responsible blockchain innovation. Tesfaye pointed out how the GENIUS Act—short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins—is already encouraging more dialogue between policymakers and Web3 leaders, giving institutional players a lot more confidence to build long-term digital asset strategies. The GENIUS Act was passed by the US House of Representatives and signed into law by President Donald Trump. It provides a regulatory framework for the $260 billion stablecoin market. While stablecoins are not typically included in RWA metrics, their backing by government bonds and other tangible assets effectively positions them in the broader RWA landscape. Tesfaye explained that stablecoins serve as a key on-ramp for RWA adoption by offering predictability, improved liquidity, reduced transaction costs, and a smoother bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance. To date, the bulk of RWA tokenization focused on private credit and US Treasury debt. A report by RedStone, Gauntlet, and RWA.xyz found that private credit made up around 60% of the RWA market as of June, with tokenized Treasurys representing about 28%. RWA value by category (Source: RWA.xyz ) Tesfaye believes that these asset classes are ideal starting points for bringing traditional financial products onto blockchain infrastructure, thanks to their ease of settlement, trading, and fractionalization when on-chain. However, he also sees potential for tokenization to expand into more sophisticated and less traditional areas like derivatives, intellectual property, and other complex financial products, especially as the ecosystem matures. Aptos itself quickly stepped up as a key player in the RWA space. Data suggests that the total value of tokenized RWAs on the Aptos blockchain exceeded $540 million in June. This growth has been fueled by issuers like Berkeley Square of the PACT Consortium and BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which made its debut on Aptos less than a year ago. With a much more favorable regulatory environment now in place, Aptos and other blockchain platforms are well positioned to lead the next wave of financial innovation. Senate Drafts New Law for Crypto Regulation Only time will tell what the effect on new crypto bills will be on the crypto space. In fact, Republican leaders on the US Senate Banking Committee introduced a draft version of legislation that is aimed at establishing a clearer digital asset market structure, potentially aligning with a bill that already passed by the House of Representatives. On Tuesday, Senators Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and two other Republicans released the discussion draft, which they said builds on the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act passed by the House on July 17. This new Senate initiative is tentatively titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. (Source: US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs ) Senator Scott explained that lawmakers across both chambers are working toward the shared goal of creating clear and practical rules for the digital asset sector. While the House recently approved three crypto-related bills with bipartisan support, GENIUS Act passed both chambers and was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Both the House and Senate versions of the market structure legislation propose updates to disclosure requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. This reflects the consensus that current laws are inadequate for regulating digital assets. The CLARITY Act promotes increased cooperation between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in developing digital asset transaction frameworks. The Senate's draft also introduces provisions concerning “ancillary assets,” which refers to digital assets that are not categorized as securities. These updates are aimed at better distinguishing different types of tokens and providing clarity to developers, issuers, and investors. (Source: US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs ) Liat Shetret , vice president of global policy and regulation at Elliptic, pointed out that the CLARITY Act’s advancement to the Senate is a sign of mounting support for comprehensive crypto policy. However, she also warned that full passage may take time, especially with Congress heading into its summer recess. Despite Republican control of the Senate, the bill’s future is still uncertain. Although more than 70 House Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the CLARITY Act, any amendments made by the Senate could reignite debates or lead to resistance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|APT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-23 05:30:00

But perhaps the most underrated move? MAGACOIN FINANCE , the meme-powered altcoin with a political edge, just crossed 1,500 wallets — all in under 72 hours. No listings, no celebrity push. Just raw, decentralized traction. Here’s how the headlines stack up. MAGACOIN FINANCE Surpasses 1,500 Wallets in 72 Hours While XRP, HBAR, and LINK continue to dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly gaining serious momentum from the grassroots level. In just 72 hours, the decentralized political memecoin surpassed 1,537 verified wallets — all without a centralized exchange listing, token inflation, or venture capital backing. At its core, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a distinct value proposition shaped by structure and story. The project operates on a fixed token supply, features a fully audited contract verified by both HashEx and CertiK, and is entirely community-owned, eliminating any risk of venture capital sell-offs. Its identity is deeply tied to the “Make America Great Again” movement, giving it a cultural resonance rarely seen in meme-powered altcoins. This isn’t a project mimicking trends. MAGACOIN FINANCE is tapping into the same mix of ideology and early crypto conviction that helped SHIBA INU explode in 2021. It’s evolving into a decentralized belief network — not just a speculative token. With wallet adoption accelerating and the presale still ongoing, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be on the cusp of becoming one of the most narrative-driven launches of 2025. XRP Approaches Breakout Territory XRP is gathering momentum again, bolstered by speculation of ETF developments and renewed institutional demand. The latest surge, nearly 9% in 48 hours, follows news of Ripple’s expanded partnerships and a spike in cross-border remittance flows. Analysts now expect a run toward the $2.80–$3.00 range, citing strong support zones and whale accumulation on-chain. As XRP inches closer to its previous cycle high, eyes are now on whether regulatory tailwinds and infrastructure upgrades could finally push it over the edge this quarter. HBAR Rockets on Kraken Listing and CBDC Boost Hedera (HBAR) has been one of the most explosive movers in July. In just two days, HBAR surged 33.2% , breaking out of a long-term downtrend after: A new Kraken listing went live Confirmation that AP+, a Hedera Council member, was selected for Australia’s CBDC pilot A major fund rebalancing , with Grayscale Smart Contract Fund allocating 5.8% to HBAR The token topped the CoinDesk 20 index on July 11 with a 13.5% daily gain and trading volume exceeding $800M. Hedera is finally breaking into both the institutional and retail spotlight — and the market is responding. Chainlink (LINK) Builds Quiet Strength While less explosive than HBAR, LINK is quietly regaining market confidence. Trading at $15.23, the token is showing signs of a long-anticipated breakout, backed by: A 40.49% jump in derivatives volume to $1.18 billion 68.32% of positions leaning long, suggesting bullish leveraged sentiment Analysts projecting a breakout toward the $18–$22 range No major partnership headlines dropped this week, but Chainlink’s consistent role in DeFi and real-world asset tokenization continues to anchor its long-term narrative. Final Thoughts XRP is gunning for its ATH, HBAR is attracting institutions, and LINK is awakening from its slumber. But the most grassroots momentum right now? It belongs to MAGACOIN FINANCE . In just three days, 1,500+ wallets have jumped in. That’s a SHIBA-era flashback — only this time, the token is politically charged, structurally sound, and fully owned by its holders. If you’re watching the altcoin rotation closely this month, don’t sleep on this community-powered outlier.

Ondo Finance focuses on tokenizing real-world assets like U.S. Treasury bonds and money market funds. The platform announced earlier this month that it would acquire U.S.-regulated broker Oasis Pro to expand its tokenization business. In addition to that, Ondo Finance has also recently partnered with Pantera on a $250 million RWA investment plan. The SEC is currently going through several altcoin ETF proposals, and if approved, 21Shares would be the first asset manager to launch an ETF tracking ONDO. ONDO targets $1.26 as bullish sentiment intensifies The ONDO/USD 4-hour chart is extremely bullish as the coin has added 20% to its value over the last seven days. The pair is also efficient, suggesting that ONDO could be preparing for another leg up, with a strong support around $0.98. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines have been in the positive region since June 24, suggesting an extended period of bullish bias. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 61 shows that buyers are in control, but ONDO is not yet in the overbought region. If the bullish bias intensifies, ONDO’s RSI could cross above 80. With a strong support established around $0.98, ONDO could rally towards the next resistance level at $1.26 over the coming hours or days. At press time, ONDO is trading at $1.11. An extended bullish run would allow ONDO to test the $1.5 resistance level for the first time since February 7. However, the broader crypto market is consolidating, and this could affect ONDO’s performance in the near term. If it experiences a pullback, the coin could retest the major support level and TLQ at $0.98. If bulls fail to defend the $.098 support, the coin could drop to the next major level at $0.80. The ONDO/USD pair is currently bullish and could experience further gains. However, the market could experience a correction after days of sustained rally.

DogeOS, the app layer developed by the MyDoge wallet team, has submitted a formal proposal to Dogecoin Core that introduces a new opcode that would enable the network to verify zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) natively. Developers aim to transform an unused part of the script system into a tool that can verify cryptographic proofs, starting with ‘Groth16’ (a specific type of proof widely used in zk systems) and allowing for future upgrades. This would enable Dogecoin to support more advanced, off-chain applications, such as rollups and smart contracts, while maintaining the main chain's speed and simplicity. The approach is modular by design as proof systems are mode-selectable, and the opcode behavior is strictly opt-in. If the proof verifies, the script proceeds; if not, it fails. Old nodes remain compatible, treating the opcode as a no-op. No surprise forks, no VM bloat. “The OP_CHECKZKP proposal marks a major technical step forward for Dogecoin,” the DogeOS team wrote in the proposal. “It expands the proof-of-work blockchain from a basic payment system into a platform capable of supporting DeFi, gaming, identity, and other verifiable on-chain applications.” Unlike Ethereum’s VM-heavy model, Dogecoin’s vision is minimal and pragmatic: computation stays off-chain; Dogecoin just checks the receipts. “Dogecoin gaining the ability to integrate with ZK L2s is the kind of interoperability we need to build ecosystem utility,” said Tim Stebbing, director of the Dogecoin Foundation. “It allows the L1 to focus on being the fastest, best, most fun blockchain and means of exchange for all humanity.” DogeOS also stated that it was developing an EVM-compatible zkVM — a virtual machine that will enable Ethereum-native applications to run directly on Dogecoin infrastructure. Still, none of this comes without trade-offs. Verifying a Groth16 proof takes 10–20ms, and you can’t cram hundreds of proofs into a 1MB block without running into validation delays. That’s why the proposal includes strict limits of one ZKP per script, five per block, at least for the start. The move comes as institutional interest in DOGE riles up in recent week, with firms like Bit Origin securing up to $500 million in funding to build a Dogecoin treasury.",Tech|Dogecoin|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|ZK|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-23 05:35:15

South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb, a major player in the global digital asset landscape, has just announced a pivotal development that promises to enhance flexibility and accessibility for its users. Starting July 23, 2024, at 06:00 UTC, Bithumb will officially begin supporting deposits and withdrawals of USDT on Ethereum (ERC-20), a move that has been eagerly anticipated by many in the community. This isn’t just a technical update; it’s a strategic enhancement designed to streamline how users interact with the world’s largest stablecoin on one of the most robust blockchain networks. For anyone actively trading or holding USDT, this change offers a more integrated and efficient way to manage their assets within the Bithumb ecosystem. What Does Bithumb’s Move to Support USDT on Ethereum Mean for You? Bithumb’s decision to enable USDT on Ethereum transfers marks a significant milestone for the exchange and its user base. Previously, users might have been limited to other blockchain networks for USDT transactions on the platform, or faced workarounds. Now, with direct support for the ERC-20 standard, the process becomes much more straightforward and aligned with industry best practices. This integration means: Enhanced Accessibility: Users can now directly send and receive ERC-20 USDT, eliminating the need for intermediary conversions or transfers through less preferred networks. Improved Liquidity: Tapping into the vast liquidity of the Ethereum network, which hosts a significant portion of the DeFi ecosystem and dApps. Broader Interoperability: Seamless movement of USDT between Bithumb and various decentralized applications, wallets, and other exchanges that primarily operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Industry Alignment: Adopting the widely used ERC-20 standard for USDT ensures Bithumb remains competitive and caters to the preferences of a global user base. The announcement, made on Bithumb’s official website, specifies the exact time and date: July 23, 2024, at 06:00 UTC . This clear communication allows users to prepare their accounts and strategies accordingly, ensuring a smooth transition as the new feature goes live. Why is USDT on Ethereum (ERC-20) So Important? Tether (USDT) is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, designed to maintain a stable value pegged to the US dollar. While USDT exists on multiple blockchain networks (such as Tron, Solana, Avalanche, and more), its presence on Ethereum, utilizing the ERC-20 token standard, holds particular significance. Here’s why: Ethereum’s Dominance: Ethereum is the most widely adopted smart contract platform, serving as the foundation for thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs. This vast ecosystem makes ERC-20 tokens, including USDT, highly versatile and liquid. DeFi Integration: A substantial portion of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem is built on Ethereum. By supporting ERC-20 USDT, Bithumb users gain easier access to a plethora of DeFi lending, borrowing, and trading platforms without needing to bridge assets or incur additional conversion costs. Network Effect: The sheer volume of transactions and users on the Ethereum network creates a powerful network effect, making ERC-20 USDT a preferred choice for many traders and investors due to its widespread acceptance and robust infrastructure. Security and Transparency: Ethereum’s established proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and its extensive network of validators contribute to the security and transparency of ERC-20 transactions. Every transaction is publicly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain. This strategic move by Bithumb solidifies its commitment to providing comprehensive services that meet the evolving needs of the crypto community, especially those who prioritize the robust and expansive Ethereum ecosystem for their stablecoin operations. Navigating the New Waters: Benefits and Considerations for Your USDT on Ethereum Transfers While the enablement of USDT on Ethereum brings numerous advantages, it’s also important for users to be aware of certain considerations, particularly regarding network dynamics. Understanding these aspects will help you optimize your transfer experience on Bithumb. Key Benefits: Benefit Description Seamless Integration Direct compatibility with most Ethereum-based wallets and platforms, simplifying asset management. High Liquidity Pool Access to Ethereum’s deep liquidity pools for USDT, potentially leading to better execution prices for large trades. Wider Ecosystem Access Effortless participation in Ethereum’s vibrant DeFi, NFT, and dApp ecosystems directly from Bithumb. Reduced Conversion Steps Eliminates the need to convert USDT from other chains, saving time and potential fees. Important Considerations: Ethereum Gas Fees: Transactions on the Ethereum network require “gas,” which is paid in Ether (ETH). Gas fees can fluctuate significantly based on network congestion. During peak times, fees can be high, impacting the cost-effectiveness of small transfers. Always check current gas prices before initiating a transaction. Network Congestion: While Ethereum is robust, periods of high demand can lead to slower transaction confirmations. Bithumb’s system will likely manage this, but users should be aware that transfers might take longer during busy times. Address Verification: Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. ERC-20 addresses are long strings of characters, and a single incorrect character can result in irreversible loss of funds. Ensure you are sending USDT to an ERC-20 compatible address. Security Practices: Utilize all available security features on Bithumb, such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and be vigilant against phishing attempts. Bithumb’s support for USDT on Ethereum empowers users with more choice, but a knowledgeable approach to network fees and security remains paramount for a smooth and secure experience. What Does This Mean for the South Korean Crypto Market and Beyond? Bithumb is one of South Korea’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges. Its strategic decisions often ripple through the local market and can even influence broader Asian crypto trends. The move to fully embrace USDT on Ethereum carries several implications: Strengthening South Korea’s Crypto Hub Status: By offering more versatile stablecoin options, Bithumb enhances South Korea’s position as a sophisticated and user-friendly crypto market, attracting both domestic and international users. Increased Stablecoin Adoption: Easier access to ERC-20 USDT could encourage more South Korean investors and traders to utilize stablecoins for hedging, trading, and accessing DeFi services. Competitive Edge: In a highly competitive market, providing comprehensive support for popular assets on their native networks gives Bithumb an edge, potentially drawing users from exchanges with more limited stablecoin options. Bridging Traditional Finance and DeFi: For institutional players or high-net-worth individuals in South Korea looking to bridge traditional finance with decentralized opportunities, seamless ERC-20 USDT transfers simplify the process. This development underscores a broader trend of crypto exchanges prioritizing user experience and expanding their offerings to meet the diverse demands of a maturing market. It reflects a commitment to supporting the most liquid and widely adopted versions of digital assets. Actionable Insights: How to Prepare for Your First USDT on Ethereum Transfer on Bithumb With the July 23rd launch date fast approaching, here are some actionable steps and tips to ensure you’re ready to leverage Bithumb’s new USDT on Ethereum support: Update Your Bithumb App/Website: Ensure you are using the latest version of the Bithumb mobile application or accessing their official website directly to avoid any compatibility issues. Understand the Deposit/Withdrawal Process: Familiarize yourself with Bithumb’s specific procedures for ERC-20 USDT deposits and withdrawals. This will typically involve navigating to the USDT wallet section, selecting the “Ethereum (ERC-20)” network option, and generating a deposit address or inputting a withdrawal address. Keep ETH for Gas Fees (for Withdrawals): If you plan to withdraw USDT from Bithumb to an external wallet, remember that you will need a small amount of ETH in that external wallet to cover the transaction’s gas fees. Bithumb will handle the gas fees for deposits to their platform. Perform a Small Test Transfer: For your first transfer, especially if it’s a large amount, consider sending a small test amount first to confirm that the process works smoothly and that you have correctly identified the ERC-20 network. Bookmark Official Sources: Always refer to Bithumb’s official website or announcements for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the launch and any specific guidelines. Enable All Security Features: Double-check that your Bithumb account has 2FA enabled and that you are using a strong, unique password. Be wary of suspicious emails or messages. By following these steps, you can confidently and securely utilize the new USDT on Ethereum transfer capabilities on Bithumb, opening up new avenues for your crypto activities. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Bithumb and USDT on Ethereum Bithumb’s imminent support for USDT on Ethereum deposits and withdrawals is more than just a feature update; it’s a strategic enhancement that aligns the exchange with the broader decentralized finance ecosystem and caters to the evolving needs of its users. This move simplifies the transfer process, enhances liquidity, and provides seamless access to the vast opportunities within the Ethereum network for the world’s leading stablecoin. As of July 23, 2024, Bithumb users can look forward to a more efficient, flexible, and integrated experience when managing their USDT. This development not only strengthens Bithumb’s position in the highly competitive South Korean market but also contributes to the overall maturation and accessibility of the global cryptocurrency landscape.

If you’re trading on Upbit, a crucial announcement has just been made that demands your immediate attention. The leading South Korean crypto exchange, Upbit, is set to temporarily suspend Upbit KRW trading pairs on July 30 for essential server maintenance. This brief but impactful pause is designed to enhance the platform’s stability and performance, particularly concerning tick size adjustments for Korean won trading pairs. Understanding the implications of this scheduled downtime is vital for managing your assets and ensuring a seamless trading experience. Understanding the Upbit KRW Trading Suspension Upbit, a powerhouse in the global cryptocurrency landscape, especially within South Korea, has officially communicated a temporary halt to its Korean Won (KRW) trading services. According to an announcement on their official website, the maintenance window is scheduled for July 30, from 15:00 to 16:00 UTC . During this specific hour, all KRW trading pairs will be inaccessible. This means you won’t be able to place new orders, modify existing ones, or execute trades involving the Korean Won. The primary reason cited for this scheduled interruption is to adjust tick sizes for KRW trading pairs. For those unfamiliar, a ‘tick size’ refers to the minimum price increment by which the price of a financial instrument can move. For instance, if a tick size is 0.01, the price can move from 100.00 to 100.01, but not to 100.005. Adjusting tick sizes can have several benefits, including: Improved Liquidity: Smaller tick sizes can allow for tighter bid-ask spreads, encouraging more frequent trading. Enhanced Price Discovery: More granular price movements can lead to more precise valuations. Reduced Volatility: In some cases, optimized tick sizes can help stabilize price movements. While an hour might seem like a short period, in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, even a minute can matter. Traders need to be aware of this window to avoid any disruptions to their strategies. Why is Upbit Maintenance So Important? Scheduled maintenance, like the one announced by Upbit, is a standard and crucial practice for any high-volume digital platform, especially a cryptocurrency exchange. Think of it like changing the oil in your car or performing routine check-ups on a complex machine; it’s essential for long-term health and efficiency. For Upbit, these maintenance periods are critical for several reasons: System Optimization: Regularly updating and fine-tuning server infrastructure ensures the platform can handle increasing user loads and transaction volumes without degradation in performance. This directly impacts the speed and reliability of your Upbit KRW trading experience. Security Enhancements: The digital asset space is constantly under threat from cyberattacks. Maintenance windows provide an opportunity to implement the latest security patches, fortify defenses, and conduct vulnerability assessments, safeguarding user funds and data. Feature Upgrades: As technology evolves and user needs change, exchanges introduce new features or improve existing ones. Maintenance allows for the seamless integration of these upgrades without interrupting live services for extended periods. Bug Fixes: Like any complex software, exchanges can develop bugs or glitches. Scheduled downtime allows developers to identify and rectify these issues, leading to a smoother user experience. Ultimately, these brief interruptions are an investment in the platform’s future, aiming to provide a more stable, secure, and efficient trading environment for all users engaging in Upbit KRW trading and other pairs. What Should Upbit Traders Do to Prepare? Preparation is key to navigating any scheduled downtime on a crypto exchange. For those actively involved in Upbit KRW trading , here are some actionable insights and steps you can take to minimize potential impact: Mark Your Calendar: Note the exact time and date: July 30, 15:00 to 16:00 UTC. Convert this to your local time zone to avoid any confusion. Review Open Orders: Before the maintenance window begins, check all your open buy and sell orders on KRW trading pairs. Decide whether to cancel them or let them remain. Keep in mind that during the suspension, these orders will not be executed or modifiable. Manage Your Positions: If you have active positions that rely on continuous trading, consider closing or adjusting them before the maintenance period. Volatility can sometimes occur immediately before or after such events, so plan accordingly. Monitor Upbit’s Official Channels: Always rely on Upbit’s official website and social media channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the maintenance. Avoid unofficial sources. Consider Alternative Actions: While KRW trading is suspended, other functionalities on Upbit, such as deposits and withdrawals of non-KRW assets, might still be operational (though it’s wise to verify this on their announcement). You could use this time for portfolio review or research.

The Broader Context: Upbit’s Role and Market Reliability Upbit isn’t just any exchange; it’s a dominant force in the South Korean crypto market, often ranking among the top global exchanges by trading volume. Its reliability and security practices are under constant scrutiny, not just from users but also from regulators in one of the world’s most stringent crypto environments. The decision to perform scheduled maintenance, particularly for something as fundamental as tick size adjustments, underscores Upbit’s commitment to maintaining a robust and fair trading environment. In a market where trust is paramount, such transparent communication about planned downtime helps build confidence among users. It demonstrates a proactive approach to platform health rather than reacting to issues after they arise.

The reason for this rip is “overwhelming demand” from exchange-traded products and corporate treasuries, said Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan on X on Wednesday. The executive compared Ethereum to Bitcoin, which, for the past 18 months, has been driven ever-upwards because ETPs and corporate treasuries “have been buying more than 100% of all the new Bitcoin being produced.” The Ethereum Demand Shock A thread on why ETH’s price is rising and why it will continue to rise in the months ahead. — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) July 22, 2025 Ethereum Supply and Demand Until recently, Ethereum had not benefited from the same trend as Ether ETFs launched in July 2024, which did not perform as well, seeing just $2.5 billion in inflows until mid-May. However, this all changed recently with spot ETH ETFs hoovering up the asset at unprecedented levels. Bitwise estimated that ETPs and corporate treasuries have combined to buy 2.83 million ETH since May 15, more than $10 billion at today’s prices, which is 32 times the net new supply over the same time period. Hougan expects this trend to continue because investors are “significantly underweight” in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. Additionally, stablecoin regulations and a surging real-world asset tokenization market will boost Ethereum demand even further. “Meanwhile, all signs suggest the ‘ETH treasury company’ trend will accelerate,” he added. “Looking out, I can imagine ETPs and treasury companies buying $20 billion of ETH in the next year, or 5.33 million ETH at today’s prices.” He added that the network is expected to produce roughly 800,000 ETH over the same period, which equates to seven times more demand than supply. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes concurred in his latest blog post on Tuesday. “The coming Ether bull run is about to tear the market a new asshole,” he said before predicting that the asset would hit $10,000 by the end of the year. Net new ETH issuance today: ~2,468 ETH ($13 million). Net inflows into the ETH ETFs today: ~143,905 ETH ($534 million). The ETH ETFs bought 58x more ETH than was net issued by the network today. Accelerate! — sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) July 23, 2025 ETH Price Outlook Ether prices have traded relatively flat over the past 24 hours with the asset changing hands for $3,720 at the time of writing. It has started to consolidate at current levels over the past few days after hitting resistance at $3,800 three times. ETH has outperformed Bitcoin over the past month with an epic 67% gain from around $2,250, where it traded this time in June.

The move follows a technical breakout from a six-year symmetrical triangle and coincides with key developments in U.S. crypto legislation and the launch of institutional investment products. Despite bullish momentum throughout the day, institutional selling emerged in the final hour of trading, paring gains and signaling possible near-term consolidation. News Background The U.S. Congress advanced the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, establishing a legal framework for digital assets and reducing uncertainty around XRP's security classification. ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF, a milestone for institutional adoption. Wall Street analysts have issued $6.00 price targets on XRP following confirmation of the triangle breakout, with longer-term projections reaching as high as $15.00. Price Action Summary XRP broke above $3.52 resistance during the 17:00–18:00 window on volume of 106.4 million—roughly 52% above the 24-hour average of 70.1 million. The breakout propelled prices toward the $3.57 session high before selling pressure in the final hour dragged prices back to $3.51. The final 60-minute window from 01:09 to 02:08 GMT showed distribution behavior. Prices climbed from $3.50 to $3.52 by 01:46 before reversing. A high-volume drop of 2.25 million units between 02:02–02:03 marked the day’s most intense sell-off, pushing prices to $3.50 before a marginal recovery. Technical Analysis Symmetrical triangle breakout confirmed above $3.00 with a high of $3.64 earlier in the week. Resistance: $3.57 (intraday), with strong overhead supply observed in the final hour. Support: $3.42 retested successfully multiple times, confirming strong institutional bid zone. RSI and MACD remain neutral, suggesting limited short-term momentum. Analysts maintain $6.00 near-term target; $15.00 flagged as long-term projection based on breakout extension. What Traders Are Watching Whether $3.50 holds as a psychological and technical support level in the next 24 hours. Follow-through buying interest from institutions post-ETF launch. Congressional momentum on further digital asset regulation. Spot ETF developments and their influence on broader investor exposure.

48773152,https://coinpedia.org/?p=485348,1753249813,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"Bitwise Gets XRP ETF Approval from SEC, But Trading Halted",https://coinpedia.org/news/bitwise-gets-xrp-etf-approval-from-sec-but-trading-halted/,"The post Bitwise Gets XRP ETF Approval from SEC, But Trading Halted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the conversion of the Bitwise Crypto Index Fund into a full-fledged exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a significant step for diversified crypto investments. But just as markets began to react, the ETF’s launch was suddenly delayed due to a regulatory stay, leaving investors frustrated and analysts questioning the move. An Altcoin-Friendly ETF—But on Hold The ETF, managed by Bitwise, is designed to track a basket of leading cryptocurrencies . According to documents filed with the SEC, its current allocations include Bitcoin (78.72%), Ethereum (11.10%), and XRP (4.97%). It also holds smaller portions of altcoins like Solana, Cardano, Chainlink, SUI, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Litecoin. Under SEC guidelines, at least 85% of ETF assets must be in cryptocurrencies already approved for exchange-traded products, mainly BTC and ETH. The remaining 15% can include other assets like XRP and SOL, which are not individually approved but included as part of the fund’s diversified approach. Bitwise plans to rebalance the ETF monthly, allowing investors to buy shares through mechanisms similar to those used in traditional stock ETFs. Why Did the SEC Pause the Bitwise XRP ETF Launch After Approval? Despite the official approval, the ETF has not gone live. The SEC has imposed a regulatory stay under Rule 431(e), essentially putting the launch on pause. This unexpected move has triggered criticism across the industry. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called the delay “bizarre” and argued that both Bitwise and other similar products like Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund should be allowed to proceed. “This delay contradicts the very approval granted,” Geraci said on X . “Investor access to diversified crypto exposure is being unfairly held back.” Altcoins Are Already on the Move While the ETF is stuck in limbo, altcoins are already seeing renewed interest. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market has fallen from 65% to 60%, signaling a shift in sentiment. Investors appear to be rotating capital into altcoins, which are posting stronger returns. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For July 23 , Just in the past week: Ethereum jumped 26% Dogecoin soared 40% XRP gained 22% Cardano rose 23% Crypto analyst Kyle Chassé noted this trend on X, pointing out that altcoins are gaining momentum even without institutional vehicles like ETFs. He added that the Altcoin Season Index has climbed from 35 to 50, indicating a tilt toward altcoins—but not quite a full-blown altseason yet. Why This ETF Matters Now The Bitwise ETF could give investors easy exposure to high-potential altcoins like XRP and Solana right when the market is shifting in their favor. With Bitcoin consolidating just under $120,000 , many traders are now looking for alternative growth opportunities, especially in Layer-1 tokens. Currently, the fund is only available over-the-counter. If the SEC lifts its stay, Bitwise can list the ETF on a national exchange, making it more accessible to retail and institutional investors alike. Until then, the fund remains in a strange spot: approved, but not active. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved Bitwise’s Crypto Index Fund to convert into an ETF, which includes XRP, Ethereum, and several other altcoins. However, the fund is not yet live due to a regulatory stay. Why is the Bitwise XRP ETF launch delayed after SEC approval?

The surge shows growing institutional enthusiasm, with Ethereum solidifying its role as a key platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The cumulative net inflow into spot Ethereum ETFs has now reached $8.32b. Meanwhile, the total value traded on July 22 stood at $1.97b, with total net assets across the category nearing $19.85b. That figure represents 4.44% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. Ethereum ETF Inflows Driven by BlackRock and Grayscale as Smaller Funds Stay Flat BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack, pulling in $426.22m in fresh capital.

Grayscale’s ETH fund saw $72.64m in new capital, while other players such as Franklin Templeton and Bitwise showed minimal or flat inflow activity. Bitcoin ETFs See $68M Outflow as Ark and Bitwise Lead the Retreat In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a net outflow of $67.93m the same day. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only product in the group to record net inflow, adding $7.51m. Most other major funds, including Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, saw outflows exceeding $30m. Total net assets in US spot Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $154.77b, about 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Trading activity remained elevated, with daily volume reaching $4.01b across all funds. Institutional Appetite for Ethereum ETFs Grows, Backed by Tokenized Use Cases Katherine Wu, COO of ENS Labs, said the inflows reflect deepening institutional conviction. “In the year since launch, US-listed Ethereum ETFs have attracted nearly $6.5b in net inflows, including more than $2b in the past week alone. These are massive numbers that speak volumes: institutions aren’t just paying attention, they’re allocating.” Much of that momentum is tied to tokenization, with over 55% of all tokenized assets built on Ethereum. Corporates including BlackRock, JPMorgan and Visa have already leveraged the blockchain for tokenized treasuries, commercial paper and equity infrastructure. Robinhood’s announcement of tokenized stock offerings on Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has further cemented its status as the go-to platform for real-world assets. Kean Gilbert, institutional relations lead at Lido DAO, noted that ETFs could evolve in the coming year to capture staking rewards while maintaining liquidity for redemptions. He said staking integration remains a challenge, especially in Europe where caps on staking exposure still apply. However, with clearer US regulatory guidance expected on staking within ETF structures, tokenized staking instruments such as stETH may soon bridge the gap, giving institutions both yield and liquidity.

Imagine a slumbering giant, holding immense wealth, suddenly stirring after years of silence. This isn’t just a fantasy; it’s the reality unfolding in the digital realm of Bitcoin. According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham, a staggering 10,606 BTC, valued at approximately $1.26 billion, has been moved. What makes this transfer particularly noteworthy is its origin: three distinct wallets that had remained untouched for a period ranging from three to five years. These wallets, strongly suspected to be under the control of a single, highly strategic Bitcoin whale , all received their substantial Bitcoin holdings on December 13, 2020. At that time, the price of Bitcoin was a mere $18,807, painting a vivid picture of the immense profits now realized or reallocated by this mysterious entity. What Does a Bitcoin Whale’s Awakening Signify for the Market? The sudden activity of a long-dormant Bitcoin whale often triggers a wave of speculation and analysis within the crypto community. Such large movements can be interpreted in several ways, each with distinct implications for market dynamics and investor sentiment. Profit Realization: Given the substantial increase in Bitcoin’s price since December 2020, the most straightforward interpretation is that the whale is realizing significant profits. Moving funds to an exchange could indicate an intent to sell, potentially adding selling pressure to the market. Strategic Reallocation: Alternatively, the movement might not be for selling but for reallocating assets. This could involve moving funds to a different, more secure cold storage solution, preparing for an Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal with an institutional buyer, or even preparing to participate in new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or staking opportunities. Market Signal: Regardless of the intent, such a large, unexpected move by a long-term holder can act as a psychological trigger. Some investors might view it as a bearish signal, fearing a dump, while others might see it as a sign of smart money positioning for future growth, especially if the funds are moving to a new, secure address rather than directly to an exchange. Consider the sheer scale: the Bitcoin acquired at $18,807 is now worth many times that amount. This means the whale has held through significant market cycles, including the 2021 bull run and the subsequent bear market. Their timing now, after years of patience, is what truly captures the market’s imagination. Tracing the Journey: How Did This Bitcoin Whale Accumulate? The journey of this particular Bitcoin whale began on December 13, 2020, a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. This period marked the early stages of what would become a historic bull run, propelling Bitcoin to new all-time highs in 2021. The decision to acquire such a large sum at that specific time highlights either incredible foresight or a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The fact that the BTC was spread across three wallets, yet likely controlled by a single entity, suggests a sophisticated approach to asset management. This could be for security reasons, to diversify risk, or to prepare for different operational needs. Understanding the accumulation phase is crucial to interpreting the current move. This wasn’t a quick flip; it was a long-term holding strategy that has now culminated in a significant action. Let’s look at Bitcoin’s price journey since this whale’s initial acquisition: Date BTC Price (Approx.) Significance Dec 13, 2020 $18,807 Whale’s acquisition price April 2021 $64,000 First major ATH after acquisition Nov 2021 $69,000 All-time high (ATH) Mid-2022 $15,000 – $20,000 Bear market lows Current (Approx.) $70,000 – $73,000 Recent recovery / new ATHs This table illustrates the incredible volatility and growth the whale has weathered, underscoring the strategic nature of their recent move. Holding through a nearly 4x increase, a subsequent crash, and then another significant recovery requires immense patience and conviction. The Impact of Bitcoin Whale Movements: What Should Investors Watch For? The movements of large holders, or Bitcoin whales , are closely scrutinized by market participants because they can, at times, precede significant price shifts. While one whale’s actions don’t dictate the entire market, they can certainly influence sentiment and liquidity. Here’s what investors should consider: On-Chain Metrics: Tools from firms like Lookonchain and Arkham are invaluable. They track wallet activity, exchange inflows/outflows, and dormant supply. A sudden increase in exchange inflows from long-dormant wallets can be a bearish signal, indicating potential selling pressure. Conversely, outflows to cold storage can be seen as bullish, suggesting accumulation. Market Depth and Liquidity: If a whale intends to sell, the market’s ability to absorb such a large volume without a significant price drop depends on its depth and liquidity. In a less liquid market, a large sell-off could cause a cascade. Psychological Effect: News of a major whale moving funds can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) or, conversely, excitement. Traders might react impulsively, leading to short-term volatility. Distinguishing Types of Moves: It’s crucial to differentiate between movements to known exchange wallets, which often imply selling intent, and movements between private wallets, which could be re-organization or preparation for an OTC deal that doesn’t impact open market liquidity directly. For the average investor, understanding these dynamics isn’t about blindly following whales, but about gaining context for market movements and making informed decisions. It’s about recognizing that significant capital is at play and adapting strategies accordingly. Navigating the Waters: Strategies for Understanding Bitcoin Whale Behavior Monitoring Bitcoin whale activity is a sophisticated aspect of crypto market analysis. It requires access to on-chain data and the ability to interpret it correctly. Here are some strategies and insights for those looking to understand these powerful market movers: Utilize On-Chain Analytics Platforms: Services like Lookonchain, Arkham Intelligence, Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and Santiment provide real-time data on large transactions, exchange balances, and wallet activity. These platforms can help identify significant movements and track the flow of funds. Differentiate Wallet Types: Not all large transactions are equal. It’s important to distinguish between: Exchange Wallets: Funds moving to or from these often indicate intent to buy or sell on the open market. Custodian Wallets: Funds held by institutional custodians (e.g., Grayscale, Fidelity) for clients. Movements here might reflect institutional rebalancing or client redemptions/deposits. Private Cold Wallets: Funds moving between these often suggest long-term holding strategies, security upgrades, or OTC deals. Track Dormant Supply: The “dormant supply” metric, which tracks coins that haven’t moved for extended periods (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years), is crucial. When dormant supply suddenly decreases, it means these long-term holders are becoming active, which can signal a shift in market sentiment or a major event. Observe Transaction Patterns: Look for clusters of transactions, recurring movements, or significant changes in wallet balances. Sometimes, large amounts are broken down into smaller chunks to facilitate OTC deals or reduce market impact. While tracking whale movements offers valuable insights, it’s essential to remember that it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and broader market sentiment also play significant roles in Bitcoin’s price action. Challenges and Opportunities in Whale Watching Monitoring Bitcoin whale movements comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Anonymity: While transactions are transparent on the blockchain, the identities behind the wallets remain pseudonymous, making it difficult to ascertain motives definitively. Misinterpretation: A large movement might be misinterpreted. For example, a transfer from one cold wallet to another could be seen as a precursor to selling, when in reality, it’s just an internal security upgrade. Noise: The sheer volume of transactions can make it hard to filter out significant whale movements from regular market activity. Opportunities: Early Signals: Identifying large transfers to exchanges can provide an early warning of potential selling pressure. Market Sentiment Gauge: Persistent accumulation by whales, especially from exchanges, can signal strong confidence in future price appreciation. Understanding Market Structure: Whale movements can reveal insights into the distribution of Bitcoin and the concentration of wealth, which is vital for understanding market stability and decentralization. In conclusion, the awakening of this long-dormant Bitcoin whale serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency markets. Whether this colossal move signifies a massive profit-taking event, a strategic reallocation, or something entirely different, its impact resonates throughout the digital asset ecosystem. It underscores the power of large holders to influence sentiment and liquidity, and it highlights the increasing sophistication of on-chain analysis tools that allow us to peer into these once-hidden movements. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding the behavior of these digital giants will remain a critical component for investors and enthusiasts alike. This particular whale’s action is a testament to the incredible gains possible in Bitcoin, but also a call for vigilance and informed decision-making in a market where every major move can create a ripple effect. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices through their buying or selling activities. While there’s no official threshold, holdings often range from thousands to tens of thousands of BTC. Q2: Why are Bitcoin whale movements important to track? Whale movements are important because they can signal potential shifts in market sentiment or supply. Large transfers to exchanges might indicate an intent to sell, while movements to cold storage could suggest long-term holding or accumulation, both of which can impact price and liquidity. Q3: How do analysts identify dormant wallets? Analysts use on-chain data analytics platforms (like Lookonchain, Arkham, Glassnode) that track the movement of coins. A wallet is considered dormant if its Bitcoin holdings have remained untouched for an extended period, typically several years. Q4: Does a whale moving Bitcoin automatically mean a price drop is coming? Not necessarily. While a move to an exchange could precede selling, the funds might also be for an Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal, reallocation to a new secure wallet, or participation in DeFi. The destination and subsequent actions of the funds are crucial for accurate interpretation. Q5: What was the Bitcoin price when this whale acquired their BTC? This particular Bitcoin whale acquired their 10,606 BTC on December 13, 2020, when the price of Bitcoin was approximately $18,807.

As of now, BNB price is trading at $799.56, still marking a 6.31% gain over the past 24 hours and 16.15% over the last week. With a market cap of $111.36 billion and 24-hour trading volume jumping to $3.25 billion, BNB has reclaimed its 5th position from Solana. Much of this bullish action can be traced to a $90 million OTC acquisition by Nano Labs, which bought BNB at an average price of $707. Adding to the bullish narrative, BNB Chain recently processed over $14 billion in daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, outstripping both Ethereum and Solana. BNB Price Analysis: BNB price surged to a new all-time high of $804.17 earlier today, briefly breaking past its 2021 highs before retreating modestly. It now trades at $799.65, just 0.58% below the ATH. Over the past 24 hours, BNB has fluctuated between a low of $750.56 and a high of $800.50, signaling strong bullish conviction near resistance. The 4-hour chart reveals a well-structured uptrend, supported by a clean bounce off the $751.95 breakout level, which now acts as solid support. The price remains firmly above the 20-period EMA, and buyers are pushing candles to the upper Bollinger Band. With RSI hovering around 69, BNB isn’t yet overbought, leaving room for further upside. Above, $820.63 and $860.22 stand out as the next resistance targets. If BNB can close above $804, bulls may push the BNB price toward the $850 psychological mark in the short term. However, on the downside, $750 remains a key support level, reinforced by recent consolidation and EMA alignment. A break below that could expose BNB to deeper support near $734.28. Following which we have major ground at $684.37. FAQs Why is BNB price rising so sharply now? A mix of institutional buying, ATH breakout attempts, and strong BNB Chain usage is driving the rally. Is BNB still a good buy after nearing ATH? While near-term pullbacks are possible, strong fundamentals suggest continued upside over time. What level should traders watch next?

As one of the most prominent altcoins in the crypto space, this breakout has attracted massive interest from traders and analysts alike. Now, with bullish momentum accelerating, all eyes are on the next key levels—namely $950, $1,000, and $1,200, as suggested by various technical indicators. BNB Price Analysis: Breaking the $804 Barrier BNB’s breakout above its 2021 ATH at ~$690 marks a major technical milestone. The rally has been supported by increasing volume and momentum indicators that continue to trend higher. As the coin moves into price discovery mode, traders are turning to Fibonacci extensions and trend-based models to forecast potential upside targets. The surge to $804 occurred after a clear breakout from an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern that typically signals further gains. The triangle breakout measured move suggests a price target near $1,000, aligning with psychological resistance and Fibonacci projections. However, the RSI is incremental, which is yet to enter the overbought zone, suggesting the price is due for another breakout soon. Technical Indicators Supporting BNB’s Rally Fibonacci Extension Levels Drawing from the swing low at ~$180 (June 2022) to the $690 high: 0.618 Fib Extension = $804 (already tested and briefly breached) 1.0 Extension = $950 (next short-term target) 1.618 Extension = $1,200 (longer-term, overbought rally target) These Fibonacci zones are common profit-taking areas during extended bull runs and act as soft resistance. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Current RSI is above 80, indicating an overbought zone. However, during parabolic rallies, RSI can remain overbought for weeks before any correction. No signs of divergence yet—momentum remains intact. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Strong bullish crossover with expanding histogram. MACD line well above the signal line—classic sign of strength. Supports continued upward movement with minimal short-term bearish pressure.

Key Takeaways: 21Shares has filed for a spot ETF that would directly hold ONDO. Ondo is building out institutional-focused tokenization infrastructure. Tokenized real-world assets are on the rise, with $25B now on-chain. According to a preliminary prospectus submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, the proposed “21Shares Ondo Trust” will hold ONDO tokens directly and follow the CME CF Ondo Finance-Dollar Reference Rate. Coinbase will act as custodian of the tokens. The fund is designed to be a passive investment vehicle, with no leverage or active speculation. Shares can be created or redeemed in cash or in-kind. ONDO Powers Layer-1 Blockchain Built for Institutional Finance and RWAs ONDO is the utility token powering Ondo Chain, a layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain purpose-built for institutional finance and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). With a current market cap of $3.5 billion and a circulating supply of 3.1 billion tokens, ONDO is priced at $1.12, down 48% from its December peak of $2.14, per CoinGecko. Among the token’s notable backers is World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated DeFi platform. The group purchased $250,000 worth of ONDO in December and currently holds 342,000 tokens, valued at around $383,000, per Nansen data. Still, ONDO accounts for just 0.2% of the platform’s $208 million portfolio, which leans heavily on stablecoins, wrapped Ether, and Bitcoin. MASSIVE ALERT: $ONDO is the next institutional darling!

Earlier in July, the protocol acquired SEC-registered broker-dealer Oasis Pro to advance its tokenized securities strategy. The move, made in collaboration with Pantera Capital, is seen as a bid to bridge traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. Oasis Pro, which operates as an Alternative Trading System and SEC-registered transfer agent, has been a FINRA member since 2020. Ondo’s broader vision was laid out in February with the launch of Ondo Chain, its dedicated blockchain designed to cater to Wall Street firms and institutional-grade tokenization. The filing comes amid a surge in tokenized real-world asset activity. On-chain RWA value has jumped 58% this year to nearly $25 billion, according to RWA.xyz. Ethereum currently dominates the space, with 55% of RWA tokenization activity, largely in private credit and U.S. Treasurys. 95% Approval Chance for Spot Solana, XRP ETFS As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. As reported, Singapore-headquartered edtech firm Genius Group has doubled its Bitcoin holdings to 200 BTC after acquiring 20 BTC last week, part of a wider strategy to build a 10,000-BTC treasury. Public companies are increasingly adding altcoins like Ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, and XRP to their treasury strategies, according to a report from Animoca Brands Research. Michael Saylor’s Strategy popularized this model by holding over 600,000 Bitcoins as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.

Daily new wallet additions for this meme-powered altcoin are quietly on the rise, outperforming many small caps on sheer user traction. Meanwhile, analyst mentions in crypto newsletters have tripled over the past month, pointing to a growing narrative: MAGACOIN isn’t just a novelty play. It offers a real alternative to BONK, underpinned by zero-tax transactions, strong ideological appeal, and expanding cross-wallet utility that’s fueling its climb. In a market chasing fresh contenders, that blend of community governance and functional growth is pushing MAGACOIN into the spotlight. MAGACOIN: Political memecoin with a purpose Unlike BONK or even BNB, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its explicit ideological brand as a decentralized political memecoin . Built around an anti-centralization ethos and zero-tax transactions, it taps directly into a cultural segment often overlooked by purely speculative meme tokens. Recent announcements on MAGACOIN’s new cross-wallet compatibility aim to solve fragmentation issues, letting holders move assets seamlessly across major chains. This utility-first expansion is catching attention. MAGACOIN’s community has already been lauded for driving grassroots marketing efforts that position it as more than just a meme gamble. Instead, it’s evolving into a politically charged store-of-value narrative with tangible usage, differentiating it from BONK’s primarily ecosystem-dependent growth or BNB’s traditional exchange utility. Grayscale’s strategic pivot: BONK, BNB—and wider sector hunts Grayscale’s July update has electrified crypto circles. Its expanded asset watchlist now includes BONK and BNB among 28 newly tracked tokens, alongside AI and DeFi players like Mantle and Monad. This follows hot on the heels of the SEC’s conditional approval of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) ETF—a multi-crypto product currently delayed by procedural disputes. The asset manager’s aggressive move to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into meme coins and ecosystem plays signals one thing: even institutions see meme-driven volatility as a strategic hedge. For BONK, this news compounds existing momentum. BONK’s daily volumes recently surged past $539 million on Bonk.fun, with token burns and buybacks pushing it toward a potential golden cross. However, skeptics note that BONK’s core dependence on Solana token launches could limit its broader cross-chain reach. Could MAGACOIN outshine BNB or BONK this quarter? As Grayscale’s institutional spotlight widens, altcoins like BONK and BNB benefit from fresh inflows and potential ETF chatter. Yet MAGACOIN’s trajectory suggests it could carve a unique lane. With XRP dealing with lingering SEC clarity despite price targets pushing toward $5, and BONK facing the ceiling of Solana-centric expansion, MAGACOIN’s broader multi-chain, ideology-driven pitch offers a rare combination of narrative and functionality. Moreover, MAGACOIN’s zero-tax model is proving attractive to traders looking to sidestep compounding transaction fees that still burden swaps in ecosystems like BNB’s. As analysts track wallet activity, the steady uptick in MAGACOIN addresses is a hard on-chain metric supporting this story. The market’s next phase: diversification with values Grayscale’s aggressive watchlist expansion underscores how 2025 isn’t just about Bitcoin or even big-layer chains anymore. Investors are exploring new frontiers: utility meme coins, politically anchored tokens, and community-owned protocols. MAGACOIN FINANCE encapsulates this trend. It’s not simply chasing speculative hype like many meme plays; its community governance and cultural identity create a narrative that institutions can’t replicate with ETFs alone. For traders and crypto observers, the big takeaway is clear: while Grayscale’s interest in BONK and BNB is headline-worthy, the real alpha may lie in decentralized political memecoins like MAGACOIN—projects that blend meme culture with genuine, ideology-fueled financial ecosystems.

XRP Has Surged Above Bull Pennant Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how XRP has exited above a Bull Pennant recently. The Bull Pennant refers to a technical analysis (TA) pattern that forms when an asset’s price succeeds a sharp upwards move with a period of consolidation between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Becomes The Talk Of Social Media As Price Hits $200 Bull Pennants are similar to Bull Flags, with the main difference being that flags involve parallel channels instead. Just like in the case of the Bull Flag, the initial uptrend forms the ‘pole,’ but the consolidation channel here is known as the ‘pennant.’ When the price is trading inside the pennant portion of the pattern, it’s likely to face resistance at the upper level and support at the lower one. An escape out of either of these levels might signal a breakout in that direction. Bull Pennants are considered to be continuation patterns, so a breakout may be assumed to be more probable in the bullish direction. That is, the asset can be more likely to surge above the resistance line. Like the Bull Pennant, there is also the Bear Pennant. This TA pattern works much in the same way, except for the fact that the pole is represented by a downwards move and that a bearish breakout is more likely. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the pattern that the weekly price of XRP was trading inside until recently: As displayed in the above graph, the weekly price of XRP was earlier witnessing consolidation inside a Bull Pennant, but this month, the asset finally found a break as its price exited out of the pattern in a sharp manner. Usually, Bull Pennant breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the pole. Based on this, the analyst has drawn a potential breakout for the cryptocurrency in the chart. The target that it leads to is $15. Related Reading: Ethereum To $10,000? Analyst Says ETH Has To Break This Level If such a bull run does occur for XRP, then its price would have surged by a whopping 320%. It now remains to be seen whether the Bull Pennant would actually end up holding for the asset. XRP Price The altcoins have taken off recently and XRP has been no exception, as its price has reached the $3.56 mark after a rally of almost 22% over the last week.

The move came as heightened geopolitical tensions fueled risk volatility, yet DOGE displayed resilience with strong intraday recoveries and volume-backed support retests that attracted renewed interest from tactical traders. What to Know • DOGE traded in a tight $0.01 range between $0.26 and $0.27, representing a 5% spread during the session from July 22 at 06:00 to July 23 at 05:00 GMT. • Volume hit 720.64 million and 717.84 million during key reversal windows — nearly 75% above the 24-hour average of 408.52 million. • The final trading hour saw DOGE spike to $0.27 before retracing to $0.26 on a single-minute volume burst of 10.47 million at 05:06 GMT. • Technical indicators suggest consolidation around $0.26–$0.27, with support established at lower bands despite end-session profit-taking. News Background DOGE's price action comes amid broad-based crypto market hesitation tied to macroeconomic uncertainty, including renewed trade restrictions in Asia and fluctuating sentiment in risk-on assets. The meme coin has recently become a proxy for high-beta crypto bets, with institutional trading desks noting a rise in volume-based strategies as spot volatility normalizes. Price Action Summary DOGE posted an initial decline toward $0.26 around 19:00 GMT before staging a full retracement to $0.27 by 23:00 GMT. The most notable reversal took place in the final 60 minutes, with DOGE climbing steadily before sharp sell pressure overwhelmed the move, sending the asset back to support levels at $0.26. The recovery demonstrated clear short-term accumulation behavior but lacked follow-through at resistance. Technical Analysis • Intraday range: $0.26–$0.27 (5% swing). • Intraday low formed near 19:00 GMT, recovery to $0.27 by 23:00 GMT. • Resistance confirmed at $0.27 with rejection amid volume spikes. • Support held multiple times near $0.26, with bounces on high-volume candles. • Final hour saw pronounced volume-driven reversal followed by profit-taking. • Single-minute volume hit 10.47 million at 05:06 GMT, coinciding with sharp $0.01 drop. • RSI shows neutral zone; MACD flatlining after recent crossover. What Traders Are Watching • Can DOGE consolidate above $0.26 in the next 12–24 hours, or will sellers retest $0.25 support? • Traders are eyeing breakout signals from resistance at $0.27, which has held firm despite bullish intraday activity. • Watch for follow-through volume above 750 million to confirm momentum continuation. • A move below $0.256 could trigger stop runs toward $0.24 levels.

China’s perceived alignment with Russia on the Ukraine war has particularly become a point of contention with the EU. The two sides will meet for summit talks in Beijing on Thursday. From the scheduled talks, some analysts hope the EU and China will draw closer and align on shared interests, especially since both face trade pressures under President Donald Trump. The EU and China have been at odds with each other over trade policies and relations The EU has reiterated its concerns about China. In the past few weeks, European Commission officials have warned about a surge of low-cost Chinese goods entering European markets. They have also criticized Beijing’s tightening grip on the rare earths supply chain. They also condemned China’s continued support for Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. The EU’s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, even commented, “China is the key enabler of Russia’s war in Ukraine.” She also argued that the EU is increasingly uneasy about China’s industrial overcapacity, skewed trade relations, and economic coercion, referencing its control over critical raw materials, chemicals, and consumer drones, adding that trade and security are connected. China has pushed back against those concerns and even criticized the EU’s decision to raise tariffs on its electric vehicles last year, to which it responded with several trade investigations of its own into the EU. Moreover, in June, the EU decided to block Chinese firms from high-value public medical device tenders, and Beijing swiftly retaliated by curbing purchases of European-made equipment. Then on Monday, China’s Ministry of Commerce lashed out at the EU’s latest Russia sanctions, which targeted two Chinese banks and other companies, warning the move would seriously damage economic and trade relations between the two sides. So far, the EU has started over 25 trade defence investigations in the last year into Chinese products, targeting Chinese exports such as candles, sweetcorn, and vehicle tyres—nearly quadrupling the number from the year before. Beijing is setting a positive tone ahead of the summit Beijing is projecting optimism ahead of the summit, framing it as an exchange between two major powers advancing a multi-polar world, two markets supporting globalisation, and two great civilisations that value cultural diversity. Analysts also see that Beijing is likely to tout the summit as a multilateral milestone, demonstrating that Europe is charting a more independent course from Trump’s United States. Nevertheless, the EU has maintained that it prioritizes the problematic China’s escalating trade surplus and alleged role in aiding Moscow’s war effort. The summit was originally set in Brussels, but Xi turned down the invitation—an act EU officials viewed as a diplomatic affront. Brussels then later failed to attend an economic meeting in June. When asked about expected summit results, one senior EU official stated that simply having an open dialogue with China is already a success. On the other hand, Abigaël Vasselier, head of the Foreign Relations team at the MERICS think tank in Germany, claimed that the world should anticipate a very challenging session and not exactly a “deal-making moment.” Se added that China, in the last few months, resorted to retaliation against Europe’s policies, saying the country has borrowed some of Trump’s tactics. Chinese authorities have defended their positions in response to some of the EU’s concerns. On the issue of Russia, Foreign Minister Wang Yi argued that China does not want Russia to lose the war in Ukraine, fearing it would prompt a renewed US focus on China and the Asia-Pacific. Currently, 80% of all dual-use items destined for Russia are routed through China, which the EU insists is troubling. Von der Leyen, the European Commission president, stated that most of its concerns about Beijing are unresolved. In a G7 meeting in June, she claimed China is weaponizing its monopoly on rare earth supply as a geopolitical tool to undercut rivals in critical sectors. Trump’s trade tariffs are also likely to influence the summit’s dynamics. Chinese authorities said they are looking for any indications that a prospective US-EU trade agreement might be aimed at isolating China economically.

This crucial Upbit APT suspension , impacting both deposits and withdrawals, is scheduled to commence on July 23. Understanding the implications of this decision is paramount for anyone holding or trading APT on the platform. Why is Upbit Suspending APT Services? The Aptos Network Upgrade Explained Upbit’s decision, communicated via its official website, is a direct response to an impending network upgrade for the Aptos blockchain. Starting at 09:00 UTC on July 23, users will be unable to move their APT tokens in or out of the exchange. But why do network upgrades necessitate such measures, and what exactly does this mean for the Aptos ecosystem? Network upgrades are fundamental to the evolution and health of any blockchain. They are akin to software updates for your computer or smartphone, designed to introduce improvements, enhance security, fix bugs, or increase efficiency. For the Aptos network, this upcoming upgrade is likely aimed at: Boosting Performance: Potentially increasing transaction throughput and reducing latency. Enhancing Security: Implementing new protocols or patches to safeguard the network against vulnerabilities. Introducing New Features: Rolling out functionalities that expand the utility and capabilities of the Aptos blockchain. Improving Scalability: Ensuring the network can handle a growing number of users and transactions without compromising speed or cost. The temporary Upbit APT suspension is a standard procedure in the crypto industry. Exchanges implement these halts to ensure the integrity of user funds during the upgrade process. It prevents any potential discrepancies that might arise from transactions being processed on an older version of the network while the new one is being deployed. This proactive approach minimizes risks for both the exchange and its users, underscoring Upbit’s commitment to security and operational stability. What Does the Upbit APT Suspension Mean for Your Holdings? For users of Upbit, the upcoming Upbit APT suspension on July 23 requires immediate attention and planning. While the suspension primarily affects deposits and withdrawals, it’s crucial to understand the nuances: Trading Remains Active (Typically): In most cases, the suspension of deposits and withdrawals does not affect the ability to trade APT tokens on the Upbit platform. Users should be able to buy, sell, and convert APT within the exchange’s internal order books. However, always confirm this directly with Upbit’s announcements, as policies can vary. No External Transfers: The key impact is on moving APT in or out of Upbit. If you need to deposit APT from another wallet or exchange, or withdraw APT to a personal wallet or another platform, you must complete these transactions before 09:00 UTC on July 23. Plan Ahead: Consider any immediate or short-term needs for your APT tokens. If you have pending transactions or plans to move your APT, adjust your schedule accordingly to avoid being caught off guard by the suspension. This period of suspension is temporary. Once the Aptos network upgrade is successfully completed and deemed stable by Upbit, the exchange will resume deposit and withdrawal services. Users are strongly advised to monitor Upbit’s official announcements for updates on the exact resumption time. Diving Deeper into Aptos: The Blockchain Powering Future Applications The Aptos blockchain, the subject of this critical network upgrade, is a relatively new but highly ambitious Layer 1 blockchain designed for scalability, safety, and upgradeability. Launched by former Meta (Facebook) employees who worked on the Diem (formerly Libra) project, Aptos aims to build a robust and user-friendly platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Its core tenets include: Move Language: Aptos utilizes the Move programming language, a Rust-based language developed by Meta for secure and verifiable execution of smart contracts. This emphasis on safety is a key differentiator. Parallel Execution: Unlike many traditional blockchains that process transactions sequentially, Aptos employs parallel execution. This means multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously, significantly boosting throughput and efficiency. High Performance: Aptos boasts impressive theoretical transaction speeds, positioning itself as a strong contender in the race for scalable blockchain solutions. Modular Architecture: Its design allows for continuous upgrades and improvements without disrupting the network, making it adaptable to future innovations. The upcoming upgrade is a testament to Aptos’s commitment to continuous improvement and its long-term vision of becoming a foundational layer for a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi to gaming and NFTs. The successful completion of this upgrade will further solidify its technical capabilities and market position. Actionable Insights: How to Prepare for the Upbit APT Suspension To navigate the upcoming Upbit APT suspension smoothly, proactive preparation is key. Here’s a checklist of actionable steps you can take: Verify the Exact Time: Double-check Upbit’s official announcement for the precise start time (09:00 UTC on July 23) and any potential updates or changes. Time zones can be tricky, so convert UTC to your local time. Complete Pending Transfers: If you intend to deposit APT to Upbit or withdraw APT from Upbit, ensure these transactions are initiated and confirmed well before the July 23 deadline. It’s always wise to allow extra buffer time. Monitor Official Channels: Keep a close eye on Upbit’s official website, social media channels (if applicable), and announcement pages for real-time updates regarding the upgrade progress and the resumption of services. Review Your Trading Strategy: If your trading strategy involves frequent external transfers of APT, adjust it for the suspension period. Consider if holding APT on the exchange or in a private wallet is more suitable for your needs during this time. Educate Yourself: Take this opportunity to learn more about the Aptos blockchain and the significance of network upgrades. Understanding the underlying technology can help you make more informed decisions. Remember, while inconvenient, these suspensions are for the long-term benefit of the network’s security and performance. Patience and vigilance are your best allies during such periods. What Happens After the Upgrade? Resuming Upbit APT Services Once the Aptos network upgrade is successfully deployed and rigorously tested for stability, Upbit will announce the resumption of APT deposit and withdrawal services. This process typically involves: Post-Upgrade Monitoring: Upbit, like other exchanges, will closely monitor the upgraded Aptos network for a period to ensure all functionalities are stable and secure. Official Announcement: A clear announcement will be made on Upbit’s official channels, confirming the exact time when APT deposits and withdrawals will be re-enabled. It’s crucial not to attempt transfers before this official confirmation. Gradual Resumption: Sometimes, exchanges may resume services gradually, or with initial limits, to manage demand and ensure smooth operation. However, this is less common for standard network upgrades. Users are advised to wait for Upbit’s explicit green light before attempting any APT transactions. Attempting to deposit or withdraw APT during the suspension period, or immediately after it without official confirmation, could result in loss of funds or significant delays. The temporary Upbit APT suspension for deposits and withdrawals, effective July 23, is a necessary step to facilitate a vital upgrade to the Aptos network. While it may require minor adjustments to your crypto activities, it ultimately serves to strengthen the Aptos blockchain, making it more secure, efficient, and capable for future decentralized applications. By staying informed through Upbit’s official channels and planning your transactions accordingly, you can navigate this period with ease, contributing to the overall health and progression of the Aptos ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Upbit suspending APT deposits and withdrawals? A1: Upbit is implementing the temporary suspension to support an upcoming network upgrade for the Aptos blockchain, ensuring the safety and integrity of user funds during the transition. Q2: When will the Upbit APT suspension begin? A2: The suspension of APT deposits and withdrawals will begin at 09:00 UTC on July 23. Q3: Can I still trade APT on Upbit during the suspension? A3: Typically, internal trading of APT on the exchange remains active during such suspensions. However, it’s always best to confirm the exact details through Upbit’s official announcements. Q4: How long will the APT suspension last? A4: The suspension is temporary and will last until the Aptos network upgrade is successfully completed and deemed stable by Upbit. An official announcement will be made regarding the resumption of services. Q5: What should I do if I need to move my APT tokens? A5: If you need to deposit or withdraw APT, you must complete these transactions well before 09:00 UTC on July 23. After this time, transfers will be halted until services resume.

In one of the latest such transfers, Whale Alert noted that over $700 million worth of the third-largest cryptocurrency has been sent to another unknown wallet. 200,000,005 #XRP (700,609,232 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown new wallet https://t.co/w1U8Ei5XoZ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 23, 2025 Given the anonymity of the transfer, it remains challenging to determine the reason behind it. Some of the users below the post speculated that it could be a long-dormant whale who has decided to cash out after XRP’s recent rally. After all, the asset skyrocketed to a new all-time high last week and now sits close below it, following a 73% monthly surge. “Big money moves like this typically signal whales repositioning—think profit-taking after a major rally, prepping liquidity for institutions, or hedging ahead of volatility. Recent headlines spotlight XRP smashing highs and big names moving hundreds of millions to exchanges, fueling both FOMO and correction chatter,” reads one of the comments. However, the fact that the funds went into another unknown wallet, rather than an address associated with an exchange, raises some doubt over that claim. What we know for certain is that Ripple whales have been on an accumulation trend for the past few weeks, acquiring 2.2 billion tokens in a 14-day span that ended on July 17. So far, the $700 million transfer doesn’t seem concerning, especially in such a market phase in which almost all crypto assets are charting gains. However, it would be interesting to follow if there’s a follow-up and further developments on the matter.

Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler, warned in an investment note published Tuesday that profits should be taken from stocks that have risen the most in the relief rally that has continued since early April. “Markets have shifted from the inflationary recession scenario they priced in on April 8th to what is now being described as a 'Goldilocks' economic outlook, neither too hot nor too cold. The stocks most at risk during this period are high-beta, low-quality stocks that appreciate without improving their earnings outlook,” Kantrowitz said. Kantrowitz, claiming that a similar risk exists for Bitcoin, said, “Cryptocurrency is very closely directionally correlated with risk appetite in equity markets. Therefore, any sell-off in which a macroeconomic risk is priced in, Bitcoin is likely to decline in the short term.” Bitcoin, which has gained 54% since its market bottom in April, reached a new all-time high last week. This rise was driven by increased interest from institutional investors through Bitcoin ETFs and the strategy of holding BTC in corporate treasuries. The S&P 500 index returned a more modest 27% during the same period.

For example, after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on April 3rd, Bitcoin fell 5%, while the S&P 500 fell 4%. This suggests that Bitcoin still trades in tandem with riskier assets during periods of heightened macroeconomic fears. Piper Sandler notes that the August 1st tariff deadline hasn't been sufficiently priced into the markets. However, a potential surprise could disrupt the current “Goldilocks” environment, with a modest increase in consumer prices expected over the next three to four months. Kantrowitz noted that this scenario could complicate market expectations for a short-term interest rate cut. August is historically known as a weak month for both Bitcoin and stocks due to the decline in trading volume during the summer months. Kantrowitz emphasized that his warnings were not a general negative outlook for US stock markets, adding, “This is more of a tactical and risk-management move. While valuations are expensive, we expect earnings to continue to drive stocks higher, but with less speculative leadership.” *This is not investment advice.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

MACD momentum weakens, indicating short-term buyers’ exhaustion. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: Floki Inu breaks out with volume confirmation The daily FLOKI/USDT chart for July 23 demonstrates a classic accumulation-to-markup transition, with FLOKI spending weeks building a solid base between $0.00008-$0.00011 before exploding in the past week. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The Bollinger Bands have expanded significantly during this move, with the upper band at $0.00016139 and the lower band at $0.00005923, indicating heightened volatility and strong directional momentum. Volume confirmation has been substantial, with the 24-hour volume spiking to 89.78M during the breakout phase, though recent sessions show declining participation, which could signal exhaustion. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Short-term indicators suggest near-term consolidation as buyers take profits The 4-hour chart reveals FLOKI entering a consolidation phase after reaching the $0.00015444 high, with the Alligator indicator showing all three lines pointing upward but beginning to flatten, suggesting the trend may be losing steam. The price currently trades at $0.00015107 within a tight range, as profit-taking emerges. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram displays weakening bullish momentum with the blue line hovering near the signal line, with shrinking histogram bars. Multiple Doji candles and small-bodied formations suggest indecision among market participants, with neither buyers nor sellers maintaining control at these elevated levels.

The combination of declining volume, MACD divergence, and profit-taking pressure points to consolidation between $0.00013-$0.00015 in the near term. While the daily trend structure remains intact, any break below the $0.00011-$0.00012 zone would negate the breakout and potentially trigger a return to the previous trading range. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

As of writing, it is still trading below $0.50, showing little reaction to the new listing. In fact, Pi has lagged behind other major altcoins in the latest crypto market rally. While Bitcoin has reached new highs and Ethereum, XRP, and Solana have surged in double digits, Pi Coin has only recorded 6% gains in the last seven days. Why Is Pi Stuck? Experts and investors alike are puzzled. Back in May, Pi showed signs of tracking broader market movements. But in recent weeks, that trend has reversed. One reason for the stagnation could be the community’s mounting frustration with missed expectations. Many expected tier-1 listings on exchanges like Binance or Coinbase by now, but those have yet to materialize. Celebrated dates like Pi Day and Pi2 Day came and went without exciting announcements. Additionally, the token is still hovering near all-time lows since the mainnet launch in February. This is concerning to long-term holders who hoped the open mainnet would bring better liquidity and real-world usage. What’s Next? On a macro level, crypto sentiment remains bullish. Ethereum is leading gains, and even U.S. regulatory developments have slightly improved after the House advanced key crypto bills, including the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act. This “risk-on” environment typically favors altcoins like Pi Coin. Moreover, Binance previously polled its users on a potential $PI listing and 90% responded positively. While the listing hasn’t happened yet, this kind of interest shows Pi still holds strong community backing.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BNB|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 06:14:58

Understanding market sentiment is paramount, and few metrics offer as clear a window into trader psychology as the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios. These ratios provide a real-time pulse on whether the collective market is leaning towards bullish (long) or bearish (short) positions. For anyone navigating the volatile waters of Bitcoin derivatives, knowing these figures can be the difference between anticipating a move and being caught off guard. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: A Key Indicator? In the realm of cryptocurrency trading, BTC perpetual futures contracts are a cornerstone for many professional and retail traders. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely, provided they maintain sufficient margin. The long-short ratio, in essence, measures the proportion of open long positions versus open short positions on these contracts. A higher long percentage suggests a bullish sentiment, indicating more traders expect prices to rise, while a higher short percentage points to a bearish outlook. This ratio isn’t just a number; it’s a reflection of aggregated trader sentiment across major exchanges. It helps us gauge the prevailing mood: are traders feeling optimistic and buying, or are they pessimistic and selling short? This collective wisdom can offer valuable clues about potential price movements, especially when extreme imbalances occur. A Glimpse into the Latest BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment: 24-Hour Overview Let’s dive into the most recent 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures across leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This snapshot offers immediate insights into how traders are positioning themselves as Bitcoin navigates its current market cycle. Total Market Sentiment (Past 24 Hours): Long: 50.33% Short: 49.67% This overall ratio suggests a remarkably balanced market sentiment, with a slight lean towards long positions. Such a near 50/50 split indicates a lack of strong consensus among traders, which can sometimes precede periods of consolidation or heightened volatility as neither bulls nor bears hold a significant upper hand. Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios: Spotting Nuances While aggregated data provides a broad overview, examining individual exchange data for BTC perpetual futures can reveal interesting nuances. Different exchanges cater to different demographics of traders, and their specific ratios can sometimes highlight unique sentiment pockets or trading strategies. Here’s a breakdown of the top three exchanges: Exchange Long (%) Short (%) Binance 51.20% 48.80% Bybit 49.30% 50.70% Gate.io 48.71% 51.29% What do these individual exchange figures tell us? Binance: With a noticeable lean towards long positions (51.20%), Binance traders appear slightly more bullish than the overall market average. This could indicate a higher retail participation base on the platform. Bybit: Bybit shows a slight tilt towards short positions (50.70%), suggesting a segment of its traders might be anticipating a minor correction or are engaging in hedging strategies. Gate.io: Similar to Bybit, Gate.io also displays a short bias (51.29%), indicating a cautious or bearish sentiment among its user base. These variations can stem from factors like user demographics, liquidity, and even funding rates specific to each platform. Understanding these nuances helps traders refine their strategies. Leveraging BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios for Your Trading Strategy How can you integrate this valuable data into your daily trading decisions for BTC perpetual futures ? Here are some actionable insights: Gauge Overall Market Sentiment: Use the aggregated ratio to understand the general mood. A very high long ratio (e.g., 60%+) might indicate over-optimism and a potential for a “long squeeze,” where prices drop sharply, forcing longs to liquidate. Conversely, an extremely high short ratio could signal a “short squeeze.” Identify Potential Reversals: When the long-short ratio reaches extreme levels, it often acts as a contrarian indicator. If almost everyone is long, there are fewer buyers left to push the price higher, making a correction more likely. Confirm Trends: A rising price accompanied by a growing long ratio can confirm a bullish trend. Similarly, a falling price with an increasing short ratio supports a bearish trend. Spot Divergences: Pay attention if the price is moving in one direction, but the long-short ratio is moving in the opposite direction. This divergence can signal a weakening trend or an impending reversal. Remember, while the long-short ratio is a powerful tool, it should always be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis. No single indicator provides a complete picture. Challenges and Considerations When Analyzing BTC Perpetual Futures Data While invaluable, relying solely on long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures comes with its own set of challenges: Lagging Indicator: The data reflects past positioning. Rapid market shifts can quickly render it outdated. Whale Activity: A few large “whale” traders can significantly skew the ratios, potentially misleading retail traders. Funding Rate Influence: Funding rates can influence positioning, sometimes artificially inflating one side of the ratio as traders seek to collect funding. Context is Key: A 55% long ratio might be normal in a strong bull market but extremely bullish in a bear market. Always consider the broader market context. By being aware of these limitations, you can use the long-short ratio more effectively and avoid common pitfalls. In conclusion, the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures provide a vital snapshot of market sentiment. While the overall market currently shows a near-even split, individual exchange data reveals interesting variations, with Binance leaning slightly bullish and Bybit and Gate.io showing a minor bearish bias. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any trader looking to navigate the complex world of Bitcoin derivatives. By integrating these ratios with other analytical tools and acknowledging their limitations, you can gain a significant edge in anticipating market movements and refining your trading strategies. Stay informed, stay strategic, and may your trades be profitable! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Q1: What exactly are BTC perpetual futures? A1: BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price without an expiry date, requiring margin maintenance. Q2: How is the long-short ratio calculated? A2: It’s calculated by dividing total open long positions by total open short positions on an exchange, reflecting bullish vs. bearish sentiment. Q3: Is a high long-short ratio always bullish?

This resistance, drawn from a high point in 2017, has triggered lower highs since then, forming the upper boundary of a long-term descending triangle pattern . Now, that structure appears to be under threat. XRP: Long-Term Resistance Under Pressure The chart utilizes a 2-week timeframe and outlines a narrowing consolidation range that dates back to 2017. A breakout above the descending resistance currently located just below the 0.00003400 BTC level would mark a major technical event for XRP. The asset has been in a multi-year downtrend versus Bitcoin, and recent price action indicates that the pair is approaching the upper trendline once again, currently sitting at around 0.00002993 BTC. “This is not just a random breakout, but a generational wealth opportunity,” Gordon wrote. While such claims are bold, the technical structure he references is not easily dismissed. The formation, bound by a falling upper trendline and a gradually rising lower trendline, has been respected by the market since 2017. The asset’s price is currently near the apex of this triangle, suggesting that a decisive move is approaching. XRP/BTC is about to smash through its 8 year resistance level. This is not just a random breakout, but a generational wealth opportunity. And guess what? XRP Spot ETFs aren't approved yet, which makes this breakout just a beginning. Double-digits XRP is not a meme anymore,… pic.twitter.com/pj586vG6q3 — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 21, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Repeated Tests and Momentum Shift The XRP/BTC pair briefly rallied into this resistance zone in 2018 and early 2025, but failed to close above it. However, XRP recently reached a new all-time high , and with its renewed strength, traders are watching to see whether this third major test results in a clean breakout. A close above 0.00003400 BTC with volume could confirm the move and shift long-term momentum in XRP’s favor. Potential Catalysts and Double-digit Targets Adding to the narrative is the fact that spot XRP ETFs have not yet been approved. Gordon referenced this point in his post, noting that such regulatory catalysts could fuel further upside. He believes the current phase is just the beginning, and spot ETF approval could start another phase of growth for XRP, amplifying price discovery and clearing technical barriers. Gordon concluded, “Double-digits XRP is not a meme anymore, it’ll be a reality in 2025.” XRP has become undeniable in 2025, and even Bitcoin maximalists have set double-digit targets for the asset. The asset is currently on the verge of a breakout, and it’s only a matter of time before we see a move to these high targets.

In the letter, Citadel asked the SEC to be careful before making any rule changes related to digital securities or tokenized stocks. The firm warned about several risks and advised the SEC not to allow any special exemptions for digital assets. Citadel Warns SEC Regarding Tokenized Stock Exemptions In its letter , the firm raised concerns about the SEC’s proposed regulatory exemptions for tokenized stocks, warning that such measures could destabilize traditional market liquidity and impact investors’ clarity. Citadel suggested that the SEC should focus on market liquidity and investor protection. “Simply put, while we strongly support technological innovations designed to address market inefficiencies, seeking to exploit regulatory arbitrage for ‘lookalike’ securities is not innovation,” said the founder of Citadel Securities, Ken Griffin. Citadel’s Demand from the SEC Citadel Securities recommends the SEC to create a balanced regulatory framework that embraces technology while maintaining stability and investor protection. Additionally, the firm demanded adjustments in regulatory requirements for crypto exchanges and digital securities. Citadel also highlighted the risks of — compliance complexity, potential decline in IPO activity, and intensified volatility in crypto exchanges if the SEC approves the exemption. “Tokenized securities must achieve success by delivering real innovation and efficiency to market participants, rather than through self-serving regulatory arbitrage,” the firm reiterated. Citadel Letter Sparks Debate Among SEC Heads and Crypto Experts SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce addressed Citadel’s letter and said that tokenized securities must adhere to existing regulatory frameworks. Later, SEC Chair Paul Atkins emphasized the agency’s “innovation exemption” mechanism will open new avenues for trading. While the agency’s heads are embracing innovation exemption, crypto experts fear that it will disrupt the balance between market stability and innovation. Industry experts warn that unregulated tokenization could break the smooth liquidity, harm transparency, and create systemic risks for crypto investors and users who are relying on centralized exchanges. Final Thought Along with Citadel Securities, many other industry players raised concerns regarding hurdles in secure custody, collateral volatility, and stable liquidation frameworks if the exemption is approved. Crypto investors and experts urge the SEC to create a framework without compromising market structure, transparency, or investor access.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 07:06:26

An analyst has said Ethereum may outperform Bitcoin short term, as trade. ETH must hold $3,630 or risk deeper correction toward $3,476. Ethereum may be setting up to outperform Bitcoin in the short-to-mid term. The ETH/BTC ratio, a key chart that measures Ethereum’s strength against Bitcoin, recently flipped its 50-week moving average for the first time since 2023. This kind of move often means a trend reversal. Experts have said that this could mean the start of a mini altcoin cycle, with Ethereum leading the way. If that’s true, Ethereum could end this market cycle around $7,500, while Bitcoin could land somewhere between $220,000 to $250,000. Source: X Analyst Scott Melker also thinks Ethereum might do better than Bitcoin in the short term, but only as a trade. “It does look like Ethereum should outperform as a trade from here. But to be clear, it’s a trade. If you’re trying to buy an asset that you want to hold for 20 or 30 years, it’s hard to beat Bitcoin. I don’t think that there’s much argument,” he said.

This substantial sum is reportedly linked to a sophisticated oil and gas investment fraud scheme that allegedly duped unsuspecting investors out of millions. This action underscores the escalating efforts by authorities to combat the growing menace of crypto fraud within the digital asset landscape, sending a clear message that the digital realm is not beyond the reach of justice. Understanding the Anatomy of a Crypto Fraud Scheme The recent announcement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington highlights a civil action filed on July 22, aimed at recovering a portion of the estimated $97 million allegedly pilfered through this elaborate scheme. Operating from June 2022 to July 2024, the perpetrators leveraged the allure of high returns in the energy sector, using cryptocurrency as a primary vehicle for transactions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated the seizure of the $7.1 million in December 2023, marking a crucial step in dismantling this illicit operation. Why Do Scammers Turn to Cryptocurrency for Investment Fraud? The digital nature of cryptocurrencies, while offering innovation and efficiency, also presents unique challenges and opportunities for fraudsters. Scammers are increasingly drawn to digital assets for several reasons: Perceived Anonymity: While not truly anonymous, the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions can make it harder to trace funds without sophisticated forensic tools. Global Reach: Cryptocurrency transactions transcend geographical borders, allowing scammers to target victims worldwide and move funds across jurisdictions with ease. Speed and Irreversibility: Transactions are often irreversible and settle quickly, making it difficult for victims to recover funds once sent. Lack of Regulation (Historically): Though regulations are evolving, the nascent stage of crypto regulation in many regions has historically provided loopholes for illicit activities. Lure of Quick Riches: The volatility and potential for high returns in the crypto market are often exploited by fraudsters to create a false sense of urgency and promise unrealistic profits. In this particular case, the alleged oil and gas investment fraud likely promised investors lucrative returns on energy projects, with the ‘investments’ facilitated through cryptocurrency. This blend of traditional scam tactics with modern digital payment methods creates a potent trap for the unwary. The Government’s Unwavering Stance Against Crypto Fraud The U.S. government’s pursuit of forfeiture in this case is not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader, intensified effort to combat financial crimes involving digital assets. Law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Department of Justice, are dedicating significant resources to developing expertise and tools to track, seize, and recover illicit cryptocurrency. What Does a Civil Forfeiture Action Entail? A civil forfeiture action, such as the one filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, allows the government to seize assets that are believed to be connected to criminal activity, even if no criminal charges have been filed against specific individuals. In this context, the $7.1 million in cryptocurrency is considered proceeds of the alleged fraud, and the government is seeking its legal ownership to potentially return it to victims or to fund law enforcement efforts. This process can be complex, involving: Identification and Tracing: Using blockchain analytics and intelligence, investigators trace the flow of illicit funds. Seizure: Once identified, the assets are legally seized, often with the cooperation of cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet providers. Forfeiture Complaint: A civil complaint is filed, detailing the connection between the seized assets and the alleged criminal activity. Legal Proceedings: Interested parties (e.g., the alleged owners of the funds) can contest the forfeiture, leading to court proceedings. Disposition: If forfeiture is granted, the assets can be liquidated, and the proceeds may be used for victim restitution or government programs. Protecting Yourself from Investment Scams and Crypto Fraud As authorities step up their efforts, individuals also play a crucial role in safeguarding their investments. The rise of sophisticated crypto fraud schemes necessitates vigilance and informed decision-making. Here are actionable insights to protect yourself: Do Your Due Diligence: Thoroughly research any investment opportunity, especially those promising unusually high returns. Verify the legitimacy of the company, its founders, and its track record. Beware of Unsolicited Offers: Be highly skeptical of investment opportunities that come through unsolicited emails, social media messages, or cold calls. Verify Licenses and Registrations: Check if the investment firm or individual is registered with relevant financial authorities (e.g., SEC, FINRA in the U.S.). Understand the Technology: If investing in crypto, take the time to understand how it works. Don’t invest in something you don’t comprehend. Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases: Your private keys are the sole access to your cryptocurrency. No legitimate entity will ever ask for them. Be Wary of Guarantees: All investments carry risk. Any guarantee of high returns with no risk is a major red flag. Seek Independent Advice: Consult with a trusted financial advisor or legal professional before making significant investments. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a potential scam, report it to the relevant authorities, such as the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) or the FTC. The alleged oil and gas investment fraud serves as a stark reminder that even seemingly traditional investment avenues can be co-opted by fraudsters using modern tools like cryptocurrency. Staying informed and cautious is your best defense. The Broader Implications for the Digital Asset Ecosystem This ongoing legal action against crypto fraud has significant implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. It reinforces the narrative that while cryptocurrency offers immense potential, it also attracts illicit actors. For the industry, increased enforcement can lead to: Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are likely to continue tightening regulations around cryptocurrency, focusing on AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance for exchanges and service providers. Improved Security Measures: Exchanges and wallet providers will face pressure to implement more robust security and fraud detection systems. Greater Investor Confidence (Long-term): While initial enforcement actions might cause apprehension, successful prosecution and recovery of funds can ultimately build trust in the legitimate use of digital assets, making the space safer for responsible investors. Precedent Setting: Each successful forfeiture case sets a precedent, empowering law enforcement to pursue similar cases more effectively in the future. The pursuit of $7.1 million linked to this alleged investment fraud scheme demonstrates the growing sophistication of law enforcement in navigating the complexities of blockchain technology to uphold justice. It signals a future where digital assets, while decentralized, are not beyond the reach of legal accountability. Conclusion: A Resolute Stand Against Digital Deception The U.S. government’s determined effort to forfeit $7.1 million in cryptocurrency connected to an alleged oil and gas investment fraud scheme is a powerful testament to its commitment to combating financial crime in the digital age. This case, involving a substantial sum and a multi-year operation, highlights the persistent threat of crypto fraud and the innovative methods employed by fraudsters. More importantly, it showcases the increasing capability of law enforcement agencies to track, seize, and recover illicit digital assets, bringing a new layer of accountability to the crypto space. For investors, this serves as a critical reminder of the importance of vigilance, due diligence, and skepticism towards promises of unrealistic returns. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, the collaborative efforts of authorities and informed individuals will be crucial in building a safer, more trustworthy environment for legitimate innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is civil forfeiture, and how does it apply to crypto fraud? A1: Civil forfeiture is a legal process that allows the government to seize assets believed to be involved in or derived from criminal activity, even without a criminal conviction. In the context of crypto fraud , it means authorities can seize cryptocurrencies that are identified as proceeds of a scam or used to facilitate illegal activities, aiming to recover funds for victims or for public use. Q2: How common are oil and gas investment scams using cryptocurrency? A2: While the specifics of this case involve oil and gas, investment scams using cryptocurrency are increasingly common across various sectors. Fraudsters adapt traditional scam models (like Ponzi schemes or fake investment opportunities) to the crypto space, leveraging its global reach and perceived anonymity. They often promise high, guaranteed returns in seemingly lucrative industries to lure victims. Q3: Can victims of crypto fraud recover their lost funds? A3: Recovering lost funds from crypto fraud can be challenging due to the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions and the global reach of scammers. However, law enforcement agencies are improving their capabilities to trace and seize illicit crypto assets, as seen in this case. Victims should report the fraud immediately to relevant authorities, as timely action can sometimes improve the chances of recovery. Q4: What are the red flags of a potential crypto investment scam? A4: Key red flags include promises of guaranteed high returns with little to no risk, pressure to invest quickly, requests for personal information beyond what’s necessary, unsolicited contact from strangers, vague or overly complex investment strategies, and requests for payment in cryptocurrency only. Always be suspicious if an offer sounds too good to be true. Q5: How is the U.S. government improving its ability to combat crypto fraud? A5: The U.S. government is enhancing its capabilities through several means: increasing funding for law enforcement agencies to hire crypto forensic experts, developing advanced blockchain analysis tools, fostering international cooperation to track cross-border illicit flows, and establishing specialized units dedicated to digital asset crimes. This comprehensive approach aims to make the crypto ecosystem safer and more secure. Did you find this article informative?

A community member noted that many may have bought at or around $0.50, but only in small amounts. According to her, the real legends are those who bought heavily at those levels. Another user shared a similar view, arguing that the significance of an entry price depends largely on how many tokens were acquired, pointing out that impact is often a function of scale. However, some experts believe even small amounts can be life-changing when institutions like BlackRock join the market. Outlook for XRP These reflections take on even more meaning in light of comments made by Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who recently revealed that his entry point was $0.006 . His early involvement shows how dramatically the token has appreciated and shows its growth potential. For years, XRP consolidated around $0.5, but things changed very quickly between November 2024 and January 2025. The asset’s growth has validated the patience and strategies of early holders. However, it may not be too late for those who haven’t joined the community, as experts anticipate significant growth in the short and long term.

Market intelligence platform Santiment has warned that growing chatter about an altseason could signal an impending spike in volatility, citing historical patterns of market reversals following crowd euphoria. Signs of Altseason Emerge Over the past three months, ETH has staged a remarkable comeback, climbing more than 110% per data from CoinGecko, to reach $3,732. The asset is also up nearly 20% in the last seven days, vastly outpacing the broader crypto market’s 3.8% gain in the same period. Whale activity has followed suit, with more than 500,000 ETH accumulated by large holders in the past two weeks, according to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. Fellow market watcher Chyan noted on July 23 that ETH’s run has pushed social volume and dominance toward year-to-date highs as the asset creeps toward $4,000. “CT’s heating up. Charts stirring. Just one spark away,” posted Chyan. Their observations align with a recent CryptoQuant analysis showing altcoin volume on Binance Futures hit $100.7 billion, the highest since February. With ETH leading large caps like Solana and XRP, experts see a clear sign that capital is rotating away from Bitcoin. Meanwhile, BTC’s dominance has dropped below 59%, down 8.5% in recent weeks, while ETH’s has climbed to 11.2%. Yesterday, Swissblock analysts said in a report that altseasons typically begin when the flagship cryptocurrency loses strength and altcoins break out broadly, a scenario that is currently unfolding. Volatility Looms as Bulls Test Resistance Despite the optimism, not all signals point to a smooth ride ahead. According to Santiment, crowd belief in an altseason often precedes short-term shakeouts. “When the crowd begins to perpetuate that we are in ‘altseason,’ beware of some upcoming volatility,” the analytics firm cautioned. “Crypto prices historically move up most prominently during periods of crowd disbelief.” Market strategist Alex Kuptsikevich also noted that investors are starting to scale back BTC exposure in favor of altcoins, increasing the risk of abrupt corrections. Technically, Ethereum is nearing major resistance near the $3,800 level, where it has twice failed to break higher in the last seven days. The asset remains 23.4% below its all-time high of $4,878 set in November 2021, but momentum is building. Over the past 30 days, ETH is up 67%, and more than 43% in the last two weeks, indicating sizable capital inflows. Yet with about $45 billion in daily trading volume and rising retail interest, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could be heading for a cooling-off phase if traders begin to take profits or if BTC experiences further pullback. CoinGlass data, however, suggests that the market remains far from its bull market peak, a potential signal that the broader rally may still have legs.

With its price currently at $0.04448, Pengu has re-entered the spotlight not just as a meme token but a cultural asset riding a wave of ecosystem and institutional catalysts. Pengu’s sharp rally comes as several bullish forces align. First, the token now boasts over 868,000 holders. Second, Binance recently removed the “Seed Tag” from Pengu. This change has boosted investor confidence, especially among institutional players and large funds. That’s not all, the hope of a new ATH has been another fuel. Join me as I decode Pengu price analysis for the short term. Pengu Price Analysis Pengu’s current price at $0.04448, is hovering just 21.95% below its all-time high of $0.05738. This came after touching an intraday high of $0.046. The market cap now sits at $2.77 billion, ranking it among the most prominent meme coins like Bonk . The 33.76% surge in 24-hour trading volume signals heightened investor interest and growing momentum. With strong buying pressure between $0.036 and $0.042, this range now acts as a major support zone. A breakout above the $0.046 resistance could pave the way to test the ATH, with a potential upside toward the $0.055–$0.057 range if momentum holds. If volume sustains above $2 billion and SOL remains bullish, Pengu could realistically aim for a new ATH at $0.05738. However, a dip below $0.038 would invalidate short-term bullish momentum. FAQs Why is Pengu price up today? A mix of Binance removing the “Seed Tag”, NFT price spikes, and the Solana ecosystem rally. Is Pengu still a risky meme coin? Risk perception has lowered after Binance’s tag removal, attracting bigger players. Can Pengu hit a new ATH soon? If bullish momentum and volume persist, a retest of $0.057, followed by a new ATH at $0.06, is likely in the short term.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BNB|ALTCOIN|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 07:22:56

Meanwhile, emerging payment tokens like Remittix (RTX) are seeing major inflows as investors chase high-utility crypto assets. Remittix has been dubbed the XRP 2.0 due to its growing adoption in global remittances and PayFi innovation. XRP News: Could the SEC Finally Greenlight the XRP ETF? One of the hottest stories in XRP news this year is the potential approval of a U.S. based XRP ETF. With the SEC dropping its Ripple lawsuit in early 2025 and institutional sentiment improving, analysts believe the odds of ETF approval sit between 95% and 98%. ETF anticipation is fueling bullish price forecasts . Some experts expect XRP to hit $10–$20 in 2025, especially if spot ETF flows mirror the kind seen with Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Technical analysts are even speculating a parabolic move could send XRP toward $36, depending on overall crypto market cap growth. Source: TradingView XLM’s Outlook in the Shadow of XRP’s Rise While XRP dominates headlines, Stellar Lumens (XLM) is also riding the payment token wave. Forecasts place XLM around $0.48 to $0.75 for 2025, with continued use in low-cost remittances and DeFi integrations keeping the project relevant. Still, no major analyst expects XLM to deliver a 2200% return this year, placing it behind XRP and newer contenders in terms of growth potential. Remittix: Best Crypto Presale Of 2025? As institutional investors hunt for the next 100x crypto, Remittix (RTX) is turning heads. This Remittix DeFi project is enabling instant crypto-to-bank payments across 30+ countries.

The price breached a major trendline that had been restraining it since the end of the year 2024. This trendline constituted a part of a bull flag pattern, which is usually associated with trend continuation. Meanwhile, with the breakout above $3.50, traders now see room for further gains. If the asset revisits lower levels, $2.70 to $3.00 could offer support. Analyst Ali shared a chart showing the breakout and pointed to a possible move toward $15. His analysis also shows key resistance areas at $4.17, $4.63, and $5.01, based on earlier Fibonacci levels. Short-term dips may occur, but the pattern remains in place unless the price breaks below support. $XRP has broken out of a bullish flag, setting its sights on $15!

SEC Blocks XRP ETF Attempt Elsewhere, the SEC has moved to block Bitwise from converting its 10 Crypto Index Fund into an ETF. The fund includes XRP along with other top assets. The rejection followed initial approval from another branch of the agency. Nate Geraci, an ETF market analyst, noted that this decision closely matches the earlier reversal of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF.

One of the most significant developments on the horizon involves South Korea stablecoin regulation , particularly its approach to won-backed digital assets. Imagine a future where the stability of traditional currency meets the innovation of blockchain, but with a robust safety net woven by meticulous oversight. That’s precisely the direction South Korea appears to be heading, signaling a pivotal shift that could redefine how stablecoins operate within its financial ecosystem. Recent reports from Financial News indicate a strong lean towards a licensing-based model for issuers of Korean won-based stablecoins, moving away from a simpler registration approach. This isn’t just a minor administrative tweak; it’s a profound statement about the nation’s commitment to financial stability and consumer protection in the burgeoning digital asset space. This proposal emerged during a crucial policy forum on July 23, where experts gathered to discuss the intricate process of integrating stablecoins into the country’s formal financial system. Why a Licensing Model for South Korea Stablecoin Regulation? The debate between a registration and a licensing model boils down to control, accountability, and the inherent risks associated with financial instruments that aim to mirror sovereign currencies. Hwang Sei-woon, a respected researcher at the Korea Capital Market Institute and a key member of the stablecoin task force (led by Democratic Party lawmaker Ahn Do-geol), passionately advocated for the licensing approach. His core argument is straightforward yet powerful: only entities possessing specific, stringent qualifications should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing stablecoins. And for that trust to be earned, a formal, rigorous licensing process is essential. Hwang’s perspective is rooted in the understanding that stablecoins, particularly those pegged to a national currency like the Korean Won, carry significant implications for monetary policy, financial stability, and consumer confidence. A simple registration, which often involves merely listing an entity, provides far less regulatory oversight and consumer protection compared to a comprehensive licensing framework that scrutinizes an issuer’s financial health, operational capabilities, and compliance measures. Enhanced Consumer Protection: Licensing ensures that issuers meet strict financial and operational standards, safeguarding users’ funds. Financial Stability: By controlling who can issue stablecoins, regulators can mitigate systemic risks to the broader financial system. Market Integrity: A robust licensing regime fosters trust and legitimacy, encouraging broader adoption while weeding out speculative or poorly managed ventures. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Licensing allows for more thorough due diligence on issuers, strengthening efforts against illicit financial activities. Setting the Bar: Capital Requirements for Won-Backed Stablecoins One of the most critical aspects highlighted by Hwang Sei-woon is the necessity for uniform capital requirements for stablecoin issuers. This isn’t just about having money in the bank; it’s about ensuring that issuers have sufficient reserves and financial resilience to withstand market volatility, operational failures, or unexpected redemption demands. The proposed thresholds are particularly insightful when viewed against existing regulations for traditional financial service providers. Under current Korean law, prepaid payment instrument (PPI) providers are mandated to hold at least 2 billion won (approximately $1.4 million), while electronic money businesses (EMBs) must maintain a minimum of 5 billion won (approximately $3.6 million) in capital. Hwang suggests that given the “broader utility” and potential systemic impact of stablecoins, even higher thresholds might be necessary. This comparison underscores the gravity with which Korean regulators are approaching stablecoins – viewing them not just as niche crypto assets, but as instruments with the potential to significantly impact the mainstream financial system. Let’s consider why higher capital requirements for won-backed stablecoins are a prudent step: Financial Instrument Type Minimum Capital Requirement (KRW) Minimum Capital Requirement (USD Approx.) Rationale for Stablecoin Comparison Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) Providers 2 Billion Won $1.4 Million Stablecoins share some characteristics with PPIs (e.g., pre-funded value) but have broader potential uses and market reach. Electronic Money Businesses (EMB) 5 Billion Won $3.6 Million EMBs facilitate digital payments; stablecoins can function similarly but with a global, decentralized potential. Won-Backed Stablecoin Issuers (Proposed) Potentially Higher than EMBs Potentially Higher than $3.6 Million Reflects the increased systemic risk, broader utility, and potential for rapid adoption/disruption stablecoins represent. The logic is simple: if a stablecoin aims to be a widely used medium of exchange, its issuer must be as financially sound, if not more so, than traditional financial institutions handling similar volumes and responsibilities. This proactive stance by South Korea aims to prevent the kind of instability witnessed in other parts of the crypto market, ensuring that any digital won in circulation is backed by robust financial foundations. Implications for Issuers and the Future of South Korea Stablecoin Regulation This shift towards a licensing model presents both significant challenges and unique opportunities for entities looking to issue won-backed stablecoins in South Korea. For smaller, nascent projects, the increased capital requirements and rigorous licensing process could act as a considerable barrier to entry. This might consolidate the market, favoring larger, more established financial institutions or well-funded blockchain companies that can meet these stringent criteria. However, for those who successfully navigate the licensing maze, the benefits are substantial. A licensed stablecoin would likely gain immense credibility, fostering greater trust among users, businesses, and even traditional financial players. This could pave the way for wider adoption, integration into mainstream payment systems, and potentially even cross-border transactions, all underpinned by regulatory certainty. It also aligns South Korea with a global trend where major economies are grappling with how to regulate stablecoins, often leaning towards comprehensive frameworks similar to those for banks or e-money institutions. Consider the actionable insights for potential issuers: Start Early: Begin preparing for rigorous compliance and financial audits now. Capital Readiness: Ensure sufficient capital reserves that significantly exceed current minimums for similar financial services. Robust Governance: Implement strong internal controls, risk management frameworks, and transparent reporting mechanisms. Legal Expertise: Engage with legal and regulatory experts familiar with both traditional finance and blockchain law in South Korea. South Korea’s Vision for Digital Assets This move is part of a broader, more comprehensive strategy by South Korea to regulate the digital asset space responsibly. The country has been a hotbed of crypto innovation, but also experienced its share of market volatility and regulatory challenges. By taking a measured, yet firm, approach to won-backed stablecoins , South Korea is demonstrating its commitment to fostering innovation within a secure and regulated environment. This isn’t about stifling growth; it’s about building a sustainable and trustworthy foundation for the digital economy of tomorrow. The policy forum on July 23 serves as a testament to the collaborative effort between lawmakers, financial experts, and industry stakeholders. Such dialogues are crucial for crafting regulations that are both effective in mitigating risks and flexible enough to accommodate technological advancements. The emphasis on uniform capital requirements and a licensing model indicates a desire to treat stablecoins with the same level of scrutiny and responsibility as traditional financial instruments, recognizing their potential to impact the broader economy. Conclusion: A New Era for Stablecoins in South Korea South Korea’s pivot towards a licensing model for won-backed stablecoin issuers marks a significant milestone in the global regulatory landscape for digital assets. It underscores a clear intention to prioritize financial stability, consumer protection, and market integrity over a laissez-faire approach. While it may pose initial challenges for some market participants, this robust framework is ultimately designed to cultivate a more secure and trustworthy environment for stablecoins to thrive. This proactive South Korea stablecoin regulation sets a powerful precedent, positioning the nation at the forefront of responsible digital finance innovation. As these policies take shape, South Korea is poised to offer a blueprint for other nations grappling with the complexities of integrating digital currencies into their established financial systems, ensuring a future where innovation and security go hand-in-hand. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary difference between a registration and a licensing model for stablecoins? A1: A registration model typically involves simply listing an entity with a regulator, offering minimal oversight. A licensing model, on the other hand, requires entities to undergo a rigorous approval process, demonstrating financial soundness, operational capability, and adherence to strict regulatory standards before being allowed to operate. Q2: Why is South Korea opting for a licensing model for won-backed stablecoins? A2: South Korea is leaning towards licensing to enhance consumer protection, ensure financial stability, promote market integrity, and strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) efforts. This approach recognizes the potential systemic impact of stablecoins. Q3: How do the proposed capital requirements for stablecoin issuers compare to existing financial regulations in South Korea? A3: Current law requires prepaid payment instrument providers to hold 2 billion won and electronic money businesses to hold 5 billion won. For won-backed stablecoin issuers, even higher thresholds are being considered, reflecting the broader utility and potential risks associated with stablecoins. Q4: What are the potential implications of this regulatory shift for stablecoin issuers in South Korea? A4: The shift could create higher barriers to entry for new or smaller issuers due to increased capital and compliance demands. However, for those who obtain a license, it offers enhanced credibility, greater trust, and potential for wider adoption and integration into mainstream financial systems. Q5: Will this new regulation affect all cryptocurrencies in South Korea? A5: This specific discussion focuses on won-backed stablecoins. While it’s part of a broader regulatory push, the direct impact of these proposed licensing and capital requirements is primarily on stablecoins pegged to the Korean Won, not necessarily on other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q6: When is this new stablecoin regulation expected to be fully implemented? A6: The proposal was raised during a policy forum on July 23. While the lean towards licensing is clear, the exact timeline for full implementation and finalization of the regulatory framework will depend on further legislative processes and ongoing discussions within the stablecoin task force and government bodies.

Key Takeaways: DigitalX has boosted its Bitcoin holdings to nearly 500 BTC, now valued at over $100 million. The firm allocated $12.8 million from a recent capital raise toward Bitcoin accumulation. DigitalX joins a growing list of public companies embracing Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset. The move brings its total holdings to 499.8 BTC, valued at around $91.3 million, the firm announced Tuesday . The latest purchase was executed at an average price of $117,293 per coin. DigitalX’s Bitcoin Treasury Tops $100M with Combined Holdings Of the nearly 500 BTC, 306.8 are held directly on the company’s balance sheet, while 193 BTC are managed through its stake in the DigitalX Bitcoin ETF. Combined, the company’s digital asset treasury now exceeds $100 million. This marks DigitalX’s second major Bitcoin acquisition in July, following a 57.5 BTC purchase earlier in the month. The company raised $13.5 million earlier this month to fund further Bitcoin buys and expand its strategic advisory board, which now includes Animoca Brands’ Yat Siu and Web3 veteran Hervé Larren. DigitalX Adds 74.7 Bitcoin. DigitalX Limited (ASX: DCC) has acquired an additional 74.7 BTC at an average price of USD $117,293, bringing total Bitcoin holdings to 499.8 BTC valued at $91.3 million. Read the full ASX announcement here: https://t.co/S7egCfZ15P pic.twitter.com/5CvAjYGkX9 — DigitalX Ltd (@DigitalXLtd) July 23, 2025 Of the capital raised, $12.8 million has already been allocated to Bitcoin accumulation. The remaining funds are intended for general operations and working capital. “This milestone reinforces our Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-focused strategy,” said Leigh Travers, DigitalX’s non-executive chairman and director of capital markets at Animoca Brands. “As one of the world’s first listed Bitcoin miners in 2014, DigitalX has been at the forefront of crypto innovation. Today, we’re leveraging that early leadership to set the institutional standard for Bitcoin exposure in Australia.” The strategy aligns DigitalX with a broader corporate trend that began with MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership , the U.S.-based business intelligence firm holds over 597,000 BTC, establishing it as the largest institutional holder. The trend is spreading across Asia as well, with Metaplanet — dubbed “Asia’s MicroStrategy” — steadily building its own Bitcoin treasury through equity and debt fundraising. Other publicly traded firms from outside the crypto sector are also following suit. Hong Kong’s DDC Enterprise, known for its food brands, recently raised $528 million to build a Bitcoin treasury . Canada’s Solar Bank, a renewable energy company, has also declared plans to acquire BTC, despite environmental criticisms. Advocates argue that a growing share of Bitcoin mining is powered by clean energy. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

48777693,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=791791,1753255826,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/48777693.jpeg,These Two Bearish Scenarios Put Solana Price At $162 After Fakeout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/bearish-scenarios-solana-price/,"The Solana price has slowly crept up over the last few weeks, moving from a low of $127 back in June to now trading over $200 at the time of this report. This surge has been propelled forward by the emergence of new runners on the blockchain such as the likes of USELESS, moving SOL toward the coveted $200 market. However, questions abound as to how long this rally could be sustained and if a bearish scenario could see it crashing back downward. Solana Price Faces Pressure From Bears Despite bullishness being the order of the day, a crypto analyst has sounded the alarm of bearish pressure mounting for Solana. In the analysis, they explain that the rally that pushed the digital asset over the $190 mark recently was actually a textbook fakeout. Related Reading: XRP Transactions Barrels Over $1 Billion To Monthly Highs, Are Whales Driving The Next Leg? This rally had taken the Solana price above the resistance that had been mounting at $170, clearing a path for the rally to $200. This has allowed for a liquidity sweep at these high levels. But now there is a roadblock for the altcoin that could send it back down. The crypto analyst explains that the Solana price is still trading inside the ascending channel despite the rally. Thus, this means that the breakout failed at the time. Such failure suggests that there is not enough strength propping up the price, leaving it vulnerable to bears. Two likely bearish scenarios were presented by the analyst in response to this. The first was that there would be a direct drop into the maximum pain level (MPL), which lies around $162.30, making it the key downside target. But with the price already breaking above $190, this is unlikely. The second and most likely scenario is the move up to retest highs before a drop. It could also alternatively form a lower high before dropping, leading to a steep decline. Regardless, both roads lead to the same destination, and that is the fact that the price drops toward the MPL level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks Above $0.26 In Weekend Rally As Pundit Predicts 2,600% Surge SOL Open Interest Hits Record Levels The surge in the price has triggered a rapid increase in interest in Solana, and this has seen the open interest for the altcoin hit new all-time highs. The open interest is the total sum of short and long positions open for an asset, and according to data from the Coinglass website, the Solana open interest has now crossed $10.96 billion to surpass its previous high of $8.79 billion. Interestingly, though, the Solana price is still much lower compared to where it was the last time open interest hit new highs. This could suggest that there could be some steam left before the SOL price begins to slow down again.

Data from XRPScan and TradingView show that the XRP Ledger recorded $1.07 billion in transfer volume, peaking at 1.72 billion XRP exchanged in 2.08 million transactions, as nearly 10,279 addresses interacted in a single day. Notably whale transfers of more than $1 billion are not only about liquidity redistribution but also coordinated accumulation, shifting network dynamics, and mounting confidence in XRP’s ascent. Technical & Institutional Tailwinds XRP’s rebound has been underpinned by strong technical setups, such as double‑bottom breakouts, a bullish MACD crossover, and an emerging Gold Cross all fuelling trader optimism. Market analyst Tom Tucker recently noted that XRP had completed a bullish cup-and-handle breakout above $3.40, setting the stage for a potential rally toward $5.27. On the institutional front, futures open interest surged to a record $11 billion, signaling growing confidence from large-scale investors. Controlled Supply from Ripple This explosive whale on‑chain activity follows Ripple’s strategic asset releases. Ripple recently unlocked 1 billion XRP, re‑locking 700 million and allocating 300 million for partnerships and liquidity initiatives.This carefully phased unlocking balances supply pressures while supporting ecosystem growth. Therefore, the convergence of colossal whale transfers, rising on‑chain activity, robust technical markers, institutional involvement, and controlled supply paints a bullish picture for XRP. Surpassing $1 billion in daily transfers highlights heightened utility, as well as intensified speculative and strategic accumulation by large investors. Japan’s “Earn XRP” Takes Effect Aplus, the credit card arm of Japan’s Shinsei Bank Group, recently partnered with SBI VC Trade to launch a groundbreaking crypto-based rewards program. For the first time, Aplus credit cardholders will have the opportunity to convert their reward points directly into cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Bitcoin, and Ether, making Aplus Japan’s first major loyalty program to offer crypto redemption. Calling out this development, digital strategist John Squire pointed out , “You can now earn XRP with your credit card in Japan. Thanks to a new partnership with SBI, Aplus cardholders can convert reward points into XRP, BTC, or ETH. This is real-world adoption, not speculation.” This strategic move accelerates the mainstream adoption of XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, driving broader crypto integration into everyday finance. Conclusion The XRP transfers of more than $1.07 billion can be seen as a coordinated whale response to price triggers, institutional momentum, and regulatory developments. With whales reducing on-chain selling, accumulating more through private transfers, and factoring in bullish technicals, XRP seems set for another leg higher above its present all-time high of $3.65. As this transpires, Japan is in high gear to enhance the adoption of XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum through the crypto-based rewards program.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|ASIA|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-23 07:34:20

From its April 2025 low, ETH has now surged by more than 150%, marking a dramatic reversal from its earlier bearish phase. Until April, ETH hadn’t posted a single positive monthly return. May broke the downtrend with a 41.1% gain, while July has now become the strongest month yet. Why Ethereum Price is Surging? Ethereum’s recent performance stands out against the broader market. Over the past week, ETH outperformed both Bitcoin (1.7%) and XRP (21.1%). Over 30 days, Ethereum is up 64%, solidifying its position as the top-performing major crypto asset. From its April low, ETH has gained over 150%, supported by consistent green daily closes, especially between July 8 and 21 when the price jumped 47.86%. Hougan attributes much of the current rally to a surge in institutional interest. Since the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, interest had remained modest until recently. Between July 2024 and mid-May 2025, ETFs and corporate buyers accumulated just 660,000 ETH. The Ethereum Demand Shock A thread on why ETH's price is rising and why it will continue to rise in the months ahead. — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) July 22, 2025 But since May 15, that number has exploded. More than 2.83 million ETH has been acquired by ETPs and corporations, equivalent to around $5 billion in inflows. Companies like Bitmine and SharpLink have been publicly increasing their ETH holdings and even staking them to generate yield. Ethereum Supply-Demand Gap: Is ETH Becoming Deflationary? While demand has soared, Ethereum’s supply growth has remained extremely limited. In the same period when 2.83 million ETH was bought, only 88,000 new ETH were created by the network. That’s a supply-demand gap of more than 32x. Hougan notes that this mismatch is a key reason why ETH’s price has been climbing so sharply. The dynamic reflects a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, both as an investment and a productive asset. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : After BNB will this Altcoin Hit a New ATH Next? , Ethereum Price Forecast 2025: Can ETH Hit $10,000? Looking ahead, the demand trend could intensify. Hougan estimates that another $20 billion could flow into Ethereum via ETFs and corporate treasuries over the next 12 months, translating to about 5.33 million ETH. In contrast, the network is projected to issue just 800,000 ETH during that period. If this buying continues, ETH’s supply will remain tight, potentially driving further price gains. Whether this results in new all-time highs remains to be seen, but the fundamentals are pointing toward sustained bullish momentum. Ethereum’s current rally is more than just a market bounce; it’s being driven by strong fundamentals. As institutional demand grows and supply remains constrained, ETH may continue to outperform. For now, all eyes are on whether this rally marks the beginning of a much bigger move. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The world of cryptocurrency is a fascinating tapestry of innovation, volatility, and often, mystery. Among its most intriguing inhabitants are the ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding vast amounts of digital assets whose movements can send ripples across the entire market. Recently, the crypto community has been captivated by a particularly significant event involving an Ethereum whale and the Kraken exchange. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a massive withdrawal that prompts crucial questions about market sentiment and future trends. What exactly happened, and why does an Ethereum whale ’s actions matter so much? Understanding the Ethereum Whale’s Monumental Move In a series of calculated maneuvers over the past eight days, an anonymous Ethereum whale address initiated a substantial withdrawal of Ether (ETH) from the Kraken Exchange. According to diligent tracking by Onchain Lens on X (formerly Twitter), the latest transaction involved 2,672 ETH, valued at approximately $9.87 million. This single withdrawal, however, is merely a part of a larger pattern. Over the specified eight-day period, the same address accumulated a staggering total of 12,341 ETH, amounting to an impressive $45.6 million, all moved off Kraken. Such large-scale movements by an Ethereum whale are not just numbers on a blockchain; they are often interpreted as powerful signals within the crypto ecosystem. While the identity of this particular whale remains shrouded in anonymity, their actions provide valuable insights into potential market directions and investor psychology. Why Do Ethereum Whale Withdrawals Matter? In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, on-chain data acts as a crucial barometer for market sentiment. The general consensus among analysts and traders is that fund movements to and from centralized exchanges often signal intent. Here’s a breakdown of what these movements typically imply: Deposits to Exchanges: When a significant amount of cryptocurrency is deposited onto an exchange, it is often interpreted as an intention to sell. The assets are moved to a trading platform, making them readily available for liquidation or active trading. Increased deposits can signal potential selling pressure, which might lead to price corrections. Withdrawals from Exchanges: Conversely, large withdrawals, like those executed by this Ethereum whale , are generally seen as a bullish signal. They suggest that the owner intends to hold their assets for the long term, move them to a cold storage wallet for enhanced security, or utilize them in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as staking or lending. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges and can be interpreted as a sign of confidence in the asset’s future value. It’s important to note that while these are common interpretations, they are not absolute guarantees. A deposit might be for purposes other than selling, such as participating in a new listing, or a withdrawal might be to facilitate an over-the-counter (OTC) trade rather than pure holding. However, the sheer scale of this Ethereum whale withdrawal strongly leans towards a holding strategy, or at least, a removal from immediate selling liquidity. What Could Be Behind This Ethereum Whale’s Strategy? When an Ethereum whale makes such a substantial move, the crypto community begins to speculate on the underlying motivations. While we can’t know for certain, several plausible scenarios could explain this massive withdrawal: Long-Term Holding (HODLing): The most straightforward interpretation is that the whale believes in Ethereum’s long-term potential and is moving funds to a secure, non-exchange wallet (cold storage) for safekeeping. This indicates a strong conviction that ETH’s value will appreciate significantly over time. Staking ETH: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and the introduction of staking, many large holders are moving their ETH off exchanges to participate in staking. Staking allows holders to earn rewards by helping secure the network. This move could be a preparation to become a validator or to delegate ETH to a staking pool. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Sometimes, large transactions bypass public exchanges entirely through OTC desks. An Ethereum whale might withdraw funds from an exchange to facilitate a private sale to an institutional buyer or another large investor, without impacting the open market price. While this doesn’t directly signal holding, it still removes ETH from the exchange’s order books. Participation in DeFi Protocols: The whale might be planning to deploy their ETH into various decentralized finance applications, such as lending platforms, liquidity pools, or yield farming protocols, to generate additional returns. This signifies active engagement with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Security Concerns: While Kraken is a reputable exchange, some large holders prefer the absolute control and security offered by self-custody wallets, mitigating risks associated with exchange hacks or regulatory actions. Each of these possibilities paints a slightly different picture, but the common thread is the removal of ETH from an immediate selling environment, suggesting a strategic, rather than speculative, intent. The Ripple Effect: How Does an Ethereum Whale Impact the Market? The actions of an Ethereum whale , especially one moving tens of millions of dollars, can have noticeable effects on the market, even if indirect: Reduced Selling Pressure: By removing a significant amount of ETH from Kraken, the immediate supply available for sale on the exchange decreases. This can contribute to reducing selling pressure and potentially stabilizing or even boosting ETH’s price in the short term. Boosted Investor Confidence: When large players signal a holding strategy, it can instill confidence in smaller investors. It suggests that those with deep pockets and presumably sophisticated market insights are optimistic about Ethereum’s future, encouraging others to hold or even accumulate ETH. Market Sentiment Indicator: Whale movements are often watched as leading indicators of market sentiment. A pattern of withdrawals across multiple exchanges by various whales could signal a broader bullish outlook among large holders, while sustained deposits might suggest caution. Liquidity Dynamics: While removing ETH from an exchange reduces its immediate liquidity on that specific platform, it can also be seen as a sign of organic demand for the asset outside of speculative trading, shifting liquidity to other venues or self-custody. While one withdrawal alone may not trigger a massive price surge, it contributes to the overall narrative and supply-demand dynamics, which are crucial for price discovery. Navigating the Waters: What Can Retail Investors Learn from This Ethereum Whale? For the average cryptocurrency investor, observing the movements of an Ethereum whale can be both educational and a source of insight. However, it’s crucial to approach such observations with a balanced perspective: Don’t Blindly Follow: While whale movements can be indicative, they are not infallible signals. Whales have their own unique strategies, risk tolerances, and access to information that retail investors may not. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and make decisions based on your personal financial goals and risk profile. Focus on Fundamentals: Rather than solely relying on whale tracking, pay attention to Ethereum’s underlying technology, development roadmap (e.g., upcoming upgrades), network usage, and overall adoption. These fundamental factors drive long-term value. Understand Market Psychology: Whale movements highlight the psychological aspect of market dynamics. Understanding how large transfers can influence sentiment can help you better interpret market reactions. Consider Long-Term Strategy: The holding strategy implied by this Ethereum whale withdrawal reinforces the idea that for many, crypto investing is a long-term game. Short-term price fluctuations often obscure the bigger picture of technological adoption and network growth. Enhance Your Security: If even whales are moving assets off exchanges for security, it’s a good reminder for all investors to consider self-custody for significant holdings. Hardware wallets offer a high level of security against exchange hacks. The Enduring Mystery of the Anonymous Ethereum Whale Despite the transparency of blockchain technology, the true identity and precise intentions of anonymous addresses like this Ethereum whale remain elusive. This inherent anonymity is a core tenet of decentralization but also presents a challenge for full market interpretation. We can observe the ‘what’ but not always the ‘why’ with absolute certainty. Nevertheless, on-chain analytics tools continue to improve, offering increasingly granular insights into these significant movements. The recent withdrawal of $45.6 million in ETH by an anonymous Ethereum whale from Kraken is more than just a large transaction; it’s a powerful signal in the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motivations remain private, the action strongly suggests a long-term holding strategy, potentially for staking, DeFi participation, or enhanced security. This move reduces immediate selling pressure and can be interpreted as a bullish sign for Ethereum, reinforcing confidence among investors. As the crypto landscape evolves, understanding these large-scale movements becomes increasingly vital for navigating its complexities and making informed decisions. The silent actions of an Ethereum whale often speak louder than words, offering a glimpse into the collective sentiment of the market’s most influential players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). These holdings are typically substantial enough that their buying or selling activities can significantly influence the market price and liquidity of ETH. Q2: Why is a withdrawal from an exchange considered bullish? A withdrawal from an exchange is generally considered bullish because it indicates that the owner is moving their assets off the trading platform, implying they have no immediate intention to sell. Instead, they might be moving the funds to cold storage for long-term holding, to stake them for rewards, or to use them in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Q3: What is Kraken Exchange? Kraken is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, known for its robust security features, wide range of supported cryptocurrencies, and advanced trading options. It serves a global customer base for buying, selling, and trading digital assets. Q4: How do analysts track Ethereum whale movements? Analysts track Ethereum whale movements using on-chain analytics tools and platforms. These tools monitor public blockchain data, identifying large transactions, wallet addresses with significant holdings, and movements of funds to and from known exchange wallets. Services like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, and Santiment provide such insights. Q5: Should I invest based on whale movements? While observing whale movements can offer valuable insights into market sentiment, it’s not advisable to base your entire investment strategy solely on them. Whales have unique objectives and resources. Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR), understand the underlying fundamentals of the asset, and align investments with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

Data Shows Only 12% of Ethereum, 25% of Solana Protocols Have Revenue",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/23/disguised-unemployment-in-blockchain-data-shows-only-12-of-ethereum-25-of-solana-protocols-have-revenue,"Have you heard of disguised unemployment? It refers to a situation where a portion of the workforce appears to be employed, but isn't contributing to the economy's output. Consider the massive capital expenditure loss from ghost cities, which represent unoccupied infrastructure. Something similar can be said for the top smart contract blockchains, which hosts hundreds of decentralized protocols. Of these, only a minority are generating revenue, while the rest produce no yield, loosely representing ghost digital cities and a form of disguised unemployment. According to DeFiLlama , Ethereum is the world's largest smart contract blockchain, hosting 1,271 protocols. Yet over the past 30 days, a staggering 88%, or 1,121 projects in total, generated no revenue. Ethereum's rival, Solana, has a much smaller ecosystem , hosting 264 protocols, of which 75% have not generated revenue in the past few days. In other words, a large number of protocols on the two chains haven't captured any value lately, much like the workforce that draws a salary but does not contribute to the output, or ghost towns that are not being utilized to generate a meaningful economic return. Key AI insights Inactive projects are not necessarily a direct burden on the network's processing power in the same way that a congested network is, but they do pose an indirect burden in the following ways: Storage Burden Every smart contract, active or not, is stored on the blockchain forever. This immutable data adds to the size of the blockchain, and all nodes in the network must store and maintain this history. As the total number of contracts grows, so do the storage and bandwidth requirements for running a node. While the effect of a single inactive contract is minimal, a ""ghost town"" of thousands of them adds up over time, increasing the network's long-term operational costs. Security and Vulnerability Risks The existence of a vast number of inactive or abandoned contracts creates a larger attack surface. A smart contract, even if it's no longer used, can contain a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have unforeseen consequences for other parts of the ecosystem or funds locked within it. This introduces a layer of systemic risk to the network that must be continually monitored by security researchers and auditors. Economic Inefficiency This is where the ""disguised unemployment"" analogy is most apt. While these projects aren't causing congestion, they represent a collective failure of capital and developer time to create a productive asset on the network. The funds, time, and effort spent to deploy these projects are effectively locked in a non-productive state, which is a drag on the overall efficiency of the ecosystem. Just as a physical ghost city represents a massive investment of capital and labour that yields no economic return, the multitude of non-revenue-generating protocols on blockchains represents wasted developer effort and capital that does not contribute to the network's productivity. Hindrance to User Experience A large number of inactive projects can make it difficult for new users to find and trust legitimate, active protocols. Sifting through a sea of defunct or failed projects can be confusing and might detract from the overall user experience.

The news gave the company's stock a quick lift, jumping 9% at the market open before settling up about 4% later in the day. Trump’s personal stake in the company—traded under the ticker DJT—is now valued at roughly $2.3 billion , boosting his wealth significantly while he's still in office. This continues a trend that’s seen Trump fully embrace digital assets, with a recent Forbes report showing that crypto now makes up most of his paper wealth . Once skeptical of digital currencies, Trump has now positioned himself as a strong crypto advocate. He’s signed an executive order to create a national bitcoin reserve, named a “crypto czar,” and urged Congress to push through several crypto bills. One of those, the GENIUS Act, was signed into law just last week. Beyond Trump Media, he’s also earning millions from other crypto ventures. One standout is World Liberty Financial—a decentralized finance project where the Trump family has a large stake. According to Reuters, it has generated about $500 million since its September launch , largely benefiting a trust controlled by Trump Jr. Though Trump doesn’t directly manage the trust, he remains its sole beneficiary. Critics say this setup raises ethical concerns, warning that Trump’s deep involvement in crypto could influence his political decisions. Advocacy groups and lawmakers have raised red flags about the potential for conflicts of interest. Trump Media, once known mainly for its Truth Social app, has now shifted its focus to financial services and crypto. Earlier this year, the company launched Truth.Fi, secured hundreds of millions in crypto-linked investments, partnered with Crypto.com, and raised over $2.3 billion to fund its growing bitcoin treasury. The announcement came shortly after bitcoin hit a record high, topping $120,000. Trump Media’s CEO Devin Nunes said the move is part of a broader strategy to ensure the company’s financial independence and support the upcoming launch of a utility token tied to Truth Social.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-23 07:44:42

Recently, a significant shift has been observed in the Asian market, particularly concerning the South Korea crypto volume . This dramatic increase has caught the attention of market analysts and investors worldwide, signaling potential trends and opportunities. Unpacking the Astonishing Surge in South Korea Crypto Volume In a recent revelation shared on X, the prominent crypto services provider Matrixport shed light on a remarkable development in the South Korean crypto landscape. Over the past two weeks, the total crypto trading volume in the nation experienced an astonishing leap, surging from a mere $1 billion to an impressive $6 billion. This six-fold increase underscores a robust resurgence of interest and activity within the market. What makes this surge even more compelling is the primary driving force behind it: the strong engagement of retail investors. Unlike institutional players, retail investors often react swiftly to market sentiment and news, injecting a unique dynamism into trading volumes. Matrixport’s report highlights that this retail-led momentum is a key characteristic of the current market upswing in Korea. Simultaneously with the escalating South Korea crypto volume , Bitcoin’s open interest has also soared by approximately $6 billion. Open interest, in simple terms, represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A significant increase in open interest, especially when coupled with rising prices, often indicates new money flowing into the market and a strong conviction among traders. Adding another layer to this bullish narrative is the rise in the annualized funding rate. The funding rate is a periodic payment made to long or short traders based on the difference between perpetual contract prices and spot prices. A positive and increasing funding rate suggests that long positions are dominant and willing to pay short positions to keep their trades open, hinting at the growth of aggressive leveraged long positions in the market. Matrixport specifically highlighted this, indicating a speculative fervor among traders betting on continued price appreciation. Why Are Retail Investors Driving This Korean Crypto Boom? South Korea has long been recognized as a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption, with a tech-savvy population and a high degree of financial literacy. Several factors contribute to why retail investors are particularly dominant in driving the current South Korea crypto volume boom: High Digital Adoption: South Korea boasts one of the highest internet and smartphone penetration rates globally, making digital asset trading highly accessible to the general public. Cultural Propensity for Investment: Historically, South Koreans have shown a strong inclination towards speculative investments, from traditional stocks to real estate. Cryptocurrencies fit well into this cultural appetite for high-growth assets. Accessible Trading Platforms: Local exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb offer user-friendly interfaces and robust infrastructure, catering effectively to retail traders. Past Market Experiences: Many Korean retail investors have experienced significant gains (and losses) in previous crypto bull runs, fostering a resilient and often aggressive trading mentality. The ‘Kimchi Premium’ phenomenon, where Bitcoin trades at a higher price on Korean exchanges compared to global averages, further illustrates the unique local demand. Social Media Influence: Crypto communities and influencers on platforms like KakaoTalk and Telegram play a significant role in disseminating information and shaping retail sentiment. This confluence of factors creates a fertile ground for retail-led surges, making the South Korea crypto volume a crucial metric to watch for global market participants. Understanding Leveraged Longs: Risks and Rewards in South Korea’s Market The mention of ‘aggressive leveraged long positions’ by Matrixport is a critical detail. Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their initial capital by borrowing funds. While this can amplify profits during an uptrend, it also significantly magnifies potential losses. Here’s a closer look at what this implies for the South Korea crypto volume : Amplified Market Movements: A high concentration of leveraged long positions can lead to exaggerated price movements. If prices move favorably, profits are compounded; however, a sudden downturn can trigger widespread liquidations. Increased Volatility: The presence of significant leverage inherently increases market volatility. Large liquidation events, often referred to as ‘long squeezes,’ can cause rapid price drops as automated systems close out positions to prevent further losses. Funding Rate Dynamics: As mentioned, a rising annualized funding rate indicates a strong demand for long positions. This means long position holders are paying short position holders to maintain their leveraged bets. While profitable for short sellers, it reflects a strong bullish bias among the majority of traders. Risk of Liquidation Cascades: Should the market experience a sharp correction, these aggressive leveraged positions are vulnerable to liquidation. A cascade of liquidations can exacerbate the downturn, creating a domino effect that impacts overall market stability. While the current sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish, the inherent risks associated with high leverage warrant caution, reminding investors of the importance of risk management. What’s Next for South Korea Crypto Volume? Matrixport’s Outlook and Key Catalysts Despite the potential for short-term volatility, Matrixport maintains an optimistic outlook, expecting the overall uptrend in South Korea crypto volume and market activity to continue. This projection is underpinned by several key catalysts on the horizon: U.S. FOMC Meeting: The upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is a significant event. Decisions regarding interest rates and monetary policy can have a profound impact on global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. A dovish stance (indicating lower interest rates or a pause in rate hikes) typically bodes well for risk assets like crypto. Bitcoin Halving: The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for 2024, historically precedes significant bull runs. This supply-side shock reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, often leading to price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals: The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in major markets like the U.S. could open the floodgates for institutional and mainstream retail investment, significantly boosting liquidity and market cap. Global Economic Recovery: Broader macroeconomic improvements, such as receding inflation and stable economic growth, often create a more favorable environment for speculative assets. Regulatory Clarity: As governments worldwide work towards clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets, increased clarity can reduce uncertainty and attract more traditional investors. These potential catalysts suggest that the current surge in South Korea crypto volume might be an early indicator of a broader market uptrend, with retail investors in Korea leading the charge. Navigating the Waves: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts The surge in South Korea crypto volume offers valuable insights for crypto enthusiasts and investors globally. While specific market conditions in Korea may differ, the underlying trends can be indicative of broader market sentiment: Monitor Retail Sentiment: The Korean market often serves as a bellwether for retail sentiment. Observing trends there can provide early signals for global retail participation. Understand Leverage: For those considering leveraged trading, it’s crucial to fully understand the risks involved. While it can amplify gains, it can also lead to rapid losses. Implement strict risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders. Stay Informed on Macro Events: Events like FOMC meetings are not isolated to traditional finance. Their ripple effects are felt across all asset classes, including crypto. Staying updated on global economic news is vital. Diversify and Research: While Bitcoin and major altcoins may be driving the current surge, always conduct thorough research and consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risk. Long-Term Perspective: Despite short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for crypto, supported by technological advancements and increasing adoption, remains strong. Focus on fundamental value and project utility. In conclusion, the dramatic increase in South Korea crypto volume , predominantly fueled by aggressive retail investor engagement and leveraged long positions, paints a vibrant picture of renewed enthusiasm in the crypto market. While the potential for short-term volatility remains, Matrixport’s optimistic outlook, bolstered by upcoming catalysts like the U.S. FOMC meeting, suggests that this could be the beginning of a sustained uptrend. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding these localized surges and their broader implications will be crucial for navigating the exciting journey ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the significance of the surge in South Korea’s crypto volume? The surge in South Korea crypto volume from $1 billion to $6 billion signifies a strong return of investor interest and capital into the cryptocurrency market. It’s particularly notable because it’s primarily driven by retail investors, often seen as a bellwether for broader market sentiment and potential future trends. How do retail investors contribute to this surge? Retail investors, characterized by their quick response to market sentiment and accessibility to trading platforms, are the primary drivers. Their collective trading activity, often influenced by social media and community discussions, can significantly amplify trading volumes and market movements, as seen with the South Korea crypto volume . What are “aggressive leveraged long positions”? Aggressive leveraged long positions involve traders borrowing funds to bet on an asset’s price increase. While this amplifies potential profits, it also significantly increases the risk of liquidation if the market moves unfavorably. Matrixport’s report suggests a high concentration of such positions in the Korean market, indicating strong bullish conviction. What is the “annualized funding rate” and why is it important? The annualized funding rate is a payment mechanism in perpetual futures contracts designed to keep the contract price close to the spot price. A positive and increasing funding rate indicates that long position holders are paying short position holders, suggesting a strong demand for long positions and an overall bullish market sentiment, reflecting the dynamics of the South Korea crypto volume . What potential catalysts could further influence the market? Key upcoming catalysts include the U.S. FOMC meeting, which can influence global financial markets; the Bitcoin halving, which historically impacts supply; and potential approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could bring significant institutional investment. These events are expected to sustain or even accelerate the current market uptrend. Did you find this article insightful?

While his comment appeared lighthearted on the surface, prominent voices in the community are interpreting it as a subtle signal regarding XRP’s price trajectory. Schwartz shared a brief exchange with his wife: “My Wife: Where were you between five and six? Me: Umm… kindergarten.” Though the post is seemingly trivial, it quickly gained traction as traders began to connect the numbers “five and six” to potential XRP price levels. Community Interprets a Hidden Message JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a widely followed XRP community figure, suggested that Schwartz’s words could carry an indirect message. He wrote that the CTO was “telling you indirectly not to sell XRP between 5 and 6 dollars.” CTO of @Ripple – David Schwartz is telling you indirectly not to sell #XRP between 5 and 6 dollars. pic.twitter.com/1f6HaQN5gX — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) July 20, 2025 This interpretation resonated with many holders, as it comes just days after Schwartz clarified the discrepancy about XRP’s all-time high , showing the asset has reached new heights. Community responses reflect mixed reactions to the idea. Some showed confidence in the asset’s future, with one user questioning why anyone would consider selling at $5 or $6, calling it a poor decision given XRP’s perceived long-term potential. Meanwhile, Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, recently made a similar mistake , selling his XRP shortly before it reached a new all-time high. However, those who see XRP’s true value believe that the $5 to $6 range is too low to sell, and some prominent figures in the community have set targets as high as $333 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another added that while the connection might be coincidental, it was worth noting if XRP approached that price range. Both comments underline a shared belief that such price points might not represent XRP’s ultimate value ceiling. However, not everyone shares this belief, as one commenter explained that Schwartz was just sharing a funny joke. XRP Holders Watching Closely The timing of the post adds another layer of intrigue. Analysts are bullish on XRP’s immediate future, as they see the current all-time high of $3.65 as the beginning of a massive move and anticipate double-digit targets. With XRP recently making significant moves in the market, any comment referencing numbers in the mid-single digits is bound to draw attention from the community, as they are eager for growth.

This why it is not surprising to see Gulf Craft, a leading global builder of luxiry yachts and leisure boats as well as superyacht shipyard announce that it too will be accepting crypto payments in UAE and Bahrain. As per the press release, Gulf Craft is now accepting regulated crypto payment solutions for yacht and leisure craft purchases, service and refit works. The company is working with Bahrain licensed fintech provider ARP Pay, to convert stablecoins such as USDT and USDC into AED or USD currency. Mohamed Hussein Alshaali, Chairman of Gulf Craft noted that by integrating ARP Pay, the company is not only meeting client preferences but is also strengthening the UAE reputation for manufacturing and financial innovation. He stated, “The UAE was built on maritime trade and early adoption of new ideas. Embracing regulated digital payments is a natural next step.” A recent pilot allowed a part of a yacht purchase price to be settled in cryptocurrency, cutting transaction costs and improving client satisfaction among international buyers. Erwin Bamps, Group CEO of Gulf Crypto noted that crypto payment options keep the ahead of the curve and allows them to tap into a growing segment of crypto holders who prefer paying with digital assets. He explained, “Whether a client is taking delivery of a Majesty or Nomad yacht or purchasing any boat or power catamaran across our Oryx or SilverCAT ranges, they can now transact through a channel that is fast, transparent and fully compliant.” UAE Judicial Department recently accepting crypto for payments Continuing on the momentum of adopting stablecoins and crypto as a payment method in the UAE, the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) partnered as well with Al Maryah Bank (MBANK) to introduce the use of digital currency for the payment of judicial and legal service fees. ADJD would be the first governmental entity in the Middle East to accept an AED stablecoin, AE Coin, for payment for court related transactions. AE Coin was the first AED stablecoin to be licensed in the UAE. Already, Dubai Department of Finance (DOF) , the governmental entity responsible for budget and its execution signed an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with UAE regulated Crypto.com to allow crypto payments for governmental fees.

The token is also available for trading on MultiBank.io and Uniswap, offering users both centralized and decentralized access from day one. The dual listing comes on the heels of a successful two-round pre-sale in which the Group sold a total of 10 million tokens at $0.35 each, raising a total of $3.5 million. The sale attracted significant attention across both retail and institutional circles, reflecting the market’s growing interest in utility tokens connected to real-world asset (RWA) strategies. $MBG is positioned as a utility token within MultiBank’s broader Web3 ecosystem. It will be used for trading fee discounts, staking, loyalty tiers, and early access to platform features. A key component of its roadmap involves supporting RWA tokenization, starting with a $3 billion luxury real estate initiative in Dubai in collaboration with MAG and Mavryk. Naser Taher, Chairman and Founder of MultiBank Group said, “With $MBG, we’re introducing a utility token built to deliver real-world value, transparency, and long-term trust. This is a major step in our mission to merge traditional finance with blockchain on a global scale”. MultiBank Group brings regulatory legitimacy to the launch, operating in over 17 jurisdictions and managing more than $29 billion in assets. This gives $MBG an unusual level of credibility in a token space often characterized by anonymous teams and speculative roadmaps. To support long-term token value, the Group has committed to a $440 million buyback-and-burn program. Revenue from trading operations will be used to reduce the circulating supply of $MBG over time, a deflationary strategy designed to align token incentives with actual usage. Listing on exchanges like Gate.io and MEXC expands MBG’s global accessibility. Gate.io’s regulatory presence in Europe and MEXC’s broad reach across Asia and Latin America ensure that the token is immediately tradable across diverse markets. Soon after the TGE, MultiBank will begin rolling out utility integrations. These include staking pools, loyalty rewards, and access to early-stage trading opportunities. The MBG ecosystem will also be supported by a hybrid crypto-tradfi exchange platform, known as MultiBank Exchange (MEX), that is currently under development. Designed to connect Institutional clients with TradFi and digital assets , MEX aims to offer an integrated trading environment once launched. As interest in RWA tokenization continues to grow, MBG’s listing strategy appears aimed at positioning the token as more than a one-off event. By focusing on exchange accessibility, platform integration, and real-world backing, the Group is making a case for MBG as a durable part of the evolving Web3 financial stack. Additional details regarding cross-chain functionality, staking timelines, and upcoming RWA partnerships are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.

A staggering volume of nearly 620,000 ETH is currently queued for withdrawal from staking, marking a substantial increase that prompts crucial questions about market dynamics and investor sentiment. This massive Ethereum unstaking wave, highlighted by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa, is not just a number; it represents hundreds of millions of dollars in potential liquidity entering the market, with implications for the price of ETH and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Understanding this phenomenon is key to navigating the evolving crypto market. What’s Behind the Ethereum Unstaking Surge? For those new to the concept, Ethereum staking involves locking up ETH to support the network’s security and operations, earning rewards in return. The ability to unstake, or withdraw staked ETH, was enabled with the Shapella upgrade in April 2023. While this feature brought much-needed flexibility and reduced some of the perceived risks of staking, it also introduced the possibility of large-scale withdrawals. The current surge in the Ethereum unstaking queue can be attributed to several factors: Profit Taking: With ETH experiencing significant price appreciation over recent periods, some long-term stakers may be looking to realize profits. The ability to unstake provides the liquidity to do so. Yield Optimization: Stakers might be re-evaluating their capital allocation, seeking higher yields or different investment opportunities in other protocols or chains that offer more attractive returns compared to current Ethereum staking rewards. Market Uncertainty: General market volatility or specific concerns about regulatory developments, economic shifts, or even the performance of other assets could prompt some large holders to reduce their exposure to staked ETH and move into more liquid or less volatile assets. Operational Adjustments: Large institutional players or exchanges might be rebalancing their portfolios, undergoing internal audits, or adjusting their risk management strategies, leading to significant withdrawals. The sheer volume of 620,000 ETH represents a substantial portion of the total staked ETH, and its movement is closely watched by market participants. Who’s Unstaking? A Closer Look at Major Ethereum Unstaking Withdrawals The data provides fascinating insights into the entities driving this substantial Ethereum unstaking activity. It’s not just a collection of small individual stakers; some very large players are making moves. Over the past week, on-chain analysis has specifically identified significant withdrawals from wallets linked to prominent entities: HTX (formerly Huobi): Two wallets associated with the crypto exchange HTX have reportedly unstaked a combined total of 110,000 ETH . At current market valuations, this amount translates to approximately $400 million . Such a large withdrawal from an exchange often indicates a rebalancing of their reserves, a response to customer demand for withdrawals, or a strategic shift in their asset management. Abraxas Capital Management: This entity has also been noted for withdrawing more than 10,000 ETH . While smaller than HTX’s move, it still represents a significant amount, suggesting similar motivations related to profit-taking or portfolio re-optimization. Other Large Entities: Beyond these identified players, the cumulative figure of 620,000 ETH suggests that various other large stakers, including whales, institutional funds, and perhaps even other exchanges, are also contributing to the growing Ethereum unstaking queue . The decentralized nature of blockchain allows for this level of transparency, giving the community valuable insights into the flow of capital. These large-scale withdrawals highlight the dynamic nature of institutional and large-holder behavior within the crypto market. Their movements can often signal broader trends or shifts in sentiment. Understanding the Impact: What Does 620K ETH Mean for the Market? The presence of nearly 620,000 ETH in the Ethereum unstaking queue raises important questions about its potential impact on the market. While the exact effects are complex and depend on various other market factors, here are some key considerations: Increased Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern is that a significant portion of the unstaked ETH could be sold on the open market. This influx of supply, especially if it occurs rapidly, could exert downward pressure on the price of ETH. However, it’s crucial to remember that unstaking does not automatically equate to selling. Holders might move ETH to cold storage, re-stake it elsewhere, or use it in DeFi protocols. Market Liquidity: Unstaking increases the liquid supply of ETH available in the market. While a sudden surge could create volatility, increased liquidity can also be beneficial for market depth and trading efficiency in the long run. Staking Yields: If a substantial amount of ETH remains unstaked and is not immediately re-staked, the overall percentage of staked ETH on the network might decrease. This could potentially lead to an increase in staking yields for those who remain staked, as rewards are distributed among a smaller pool of stakers. Investor Confidence: Large unstaking events can sometimes be perceived negatively, suggesting a lack of confidence. However, they can also be viewed as a sign of a maturing market where participants have the flexibility to manage their assets actively. The key is to differentiate between speculative profit-taking and a fundamental loss of faith in the asset. The market’s ability to absorb this unstaked ETH will be a critical test of its resilience and the underlying demand for Ethereum. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Staking Landscape The growing Ethereum unstaking queue presents both challenges and opportunities for the network and its participants. From a challenge perspective, the primary concern is potential downward price pressure if a significant portion of the unstaked ETH is sold. This could lead to increased volatility and a test of market stability. Furthermore, if the trend of large-scale unstaking continues without sufficient new ETH entering the staking pool, it could, in theory, impact the network’s decentralization and security, though this is a long-term and less immediate concern given Ethereum’s robust staking base. However, there are also significant opportunities: Enhanced Flexibility: The ability to unstake provides stakers with greater control over their assets, reducing the illiquidity risk previously associated with Ethereum staking. This flexibility can attract a broader range of participants, including institutional investors who require more agile asset management. Market Efficiency: Increased liquidity from unstaked ETH can lead to a more efficient market for ETH, with tighter spreads and better price discovery. Innovation in Staking Solutions: The dynamics of unstaking might spur further innovation in liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) and other staking protocols, offering new ways for users to participate in staking while maintaining liquidity. These solutions aim to mitigate the lock-up period and provide users with tradable tokens representing their staked ETH. Health Check: Large unstaking events can serve as a “stress test” for the network and its market, demonstrating its ability to handle significant capital movements. A resilient response can strengthen long-term confidence. The overall health of the Ethereum network is not solely dependent on the staking ratio but also on its utility, adoption, and ongoing development. Navigating the Ethereum Staking Environment: Actionable Insights For investors and participants in the Ethereum unstaking and staking ecosystem, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on the Ethereum unstaking queue and withdrawal trends using reputable on-chain analytics platforms. This provides real-time insights into market movements. Diversify Staking Strategies: If you are a staker, consider diversifying your staking approach. This might include using liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) to maintain liquidity, exploring different staking providers, or even evaluating staking on other proof-of-stake networks. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that large unstaking events can introduce volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your personal risk tolerance. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term price movements can be influenced by unstaking, the long-term value of Ethereum is driven by its technological advancements, ecosystem growth, and adoption. Focus on these fundamentals rather than getting swayed by temporary market fluctuations. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources, analysts, and official Ethereum updates to stay abreast of developments that could impact staking and market sentiment. In a rapidly evolving market, informed decision-making is your most valuable asset. Conclusion: The Evolving Narrative of Ethereum Staking The rise of nearly 620,000 ETH in the Ethereum unstaking queue is a notable development, reflecting a combination of profit-taking, yield optimization, and strategic rebalancing by large holders like HTX and Abraxas Capital Management. While it introduces potential short-term market dynamics, including increased supply and possible selling pressure, it also underscores the growing maturity and flexibility of the Ethereum staking ecosystem post-Shapella. The ability for participants to freely enter and exit staking positions is a fundamental feature of a healthy, decentralized network. This event serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market is constantly in motion. Rather than viewing large unstaking events as solely negative, it’s more productive to see them as a natural part of a dynamic market where capital flows respond to changing conditions and opportunities. As Ethereum continues its journey, the transparency provided by on-chain data allows us to observe these shifts firsthand, offering valuable lessons for investors and enthusiasts alike. The future of Ethereum unstaking and staking will continue to be a fascinating narrative to watch. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Ethereum unstaking queue? A1: The Ethereum unstaking queue is a waiting list for stakers who wish to withdraw their locked-up ETH from the network. Due to network design and to manage withdrawals smoothly, there’s a limit to how much ETH can be unstaked at any given time, creating a queue during periods of high demand. Q2: Why are people unstaking large amounts of ETH? A2: Reasons vary but commonly include profit-taking after price appreciation, seeking higher yields elsewhere, rebalancing portfolios, or adjusting to changing market conditions and regulatory environments. Large entities like exchanges might also be responding to client withdrawal requests. Q3: How does 620,000 ETH in the unstaking queue impact the price of ETH? A3: A large amount of ETH in the unstaking queue can create potential selling pressure if holders decide to sell their unstaked ETH on the open market. This could lead to increased supply and potentially downward pressure on the ETH price. However, not all unstaked ETH is sold; some might be re-staked, used in DeFi, or held. Q4: Is it still profitable to stake Ethereum? A4: Yes, Ethereum staking can still be profitable. The annual percentage yield (APY) for staking fluctuates based on the total amount of ETH staked on the network. While large unstaking events might temporarily increase yields for remaining stakers, it’s essential to consider your individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Q5: What is the significance of HTX and Abraxas Capital Management unstaking ETH? A5: When large entities like HTX (a major exchange) and Abraxas Capital Management unstake significant amounts of ETH, it indicates substantial capital movement. These actions can reflect their strategic decisions, client demands, or a response to broader market trends, often signaling shifts in institutional sentiment or liquidity management. Q6: Where can I monitor the Ethereum unstaking queue? A6: You can monitor the Ethereum unstaking queue and other on-chain data using various blockchain analytics platforms such as Nansen, Dune Analytics, or beaconcha.in. These platforms provide real-time data on staking and withdrawal trends. Share Your Insights! Did you find this deep dive into the Ethereum unstaking phenomenon insightful?

Some of the deals were made on the open market, showing real demand for available tokens. The past day saw several notable ETH purchases as the token consolidated above $3,700. The accumulation by notable whales is added to the overall trend of more ETH shifting to accumulation addresses. The buying in the last 24 hours came from anonymous whales setting up new wallets. Trump’s World Liberty Fi also added to the buying, achieving net gains despite buying at a higher average price. The additional buying resumed as ETH was trading at $3,711.34, with 11.2% market dominance. ETH remains closely watched as the potential driver of a larger altcoin rally. ETH flows to accumulation wallets are still vertical Over 22M ETH has been accumulated in dedicated wallets, in addition to the staking and other locking mechanisms. While the ETH supply is still large, the token may be going through a short-term supply crunch, as whales scramble to secure more tokens ahead of corporations and ETF. ETH accumulation entered the hockey stick zone since May, as more whales scrambled to secure ETH for staking, DeFi and long-term reserves. | Source: Cryptiquant Since May, over 7M ETH were added to accumulation addresses, which hold a balance and do not move it. The last two months led to accelerated accumulation , after years of seeing ETH as expendable. As of July, ETH activity increased, with close to 600K daily active unique addresses . ETH has been included in fully regulated products and markets, but holding the actual tokens opens multiple tools for decentralized activities. ETH has turned into a network for whales, with sufficient liquidity in lending and expanding stablecoin supply. Two new whales accumulate through OTC and exchanges Two new whale wallets were created in the past week, accumulating a total of over $240M in ETH. The first whale struck an OTC deal for 32,640 ETH, resorting to the reserves of Galaxy Digital. Newly created wallet 0x3dF3 just bought another 32,640 $ETH ($122.18M) through OTC, for a total of 43,787 $ETH ($163M) in the past 4 days. https://t.co/rZZdoV7NJi pic.twitter.com/M8GrYeNiSm — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 23, 2025 Galaxy Digital itself expanded its ETH reserves to 71M in the past days, though whales immediately bought up 10M. The other whale wallet used FalconX to store 105,977 ETH, achieving the accumulation within four days. The whale buying continued even after Wintermute announced its OTC desk was virtually depleted. Currently, the market maker expanded its reserves slightly, still holding only 12.71K ETH, insufficient for even one whale purchase. World Liberty Fi continues ETH accumulation World Liberty Fi remains an ETH supporter, in addition to its multi-chain strategy. Trump’s fund added 3,473 ETH valued at $13M. The fund is buying ETH through a new address , flagged by Arkham as most probably belonging to World Liberty Fi. Trump’s fund is using its ETH actively, recently sending 1,000 tokens to Aave V3. The recent purchase follows the vote to make the WLFI token transferable and tradable. World Liberty Fi announced it will work on partnerships and infrastructure, to secure liquidity and trading pairs for the token. Owning ETH may boost the potential of World Liberty Fi to build its own Aave lending vault.

48779887,https://coinpedia.org/?p=485429,1753258847,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Fact Check: Is SWIFT Teaming Up with Ripple for XRP Payments?,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/fact-check-is-swift-teaming-up-with-ripple-for-xrp-payments/,"The post Fact Check: Is SWIFT Teaming Up with Ripple for XRP Payments? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A viral headline is making waves across crypto communities, claiming SWIFT has officially approved Ripple and XRP for all cross-border payments, touting a staggering $650 trillion to flow through the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and a massive token burn in the next 72 hours. These explosive claims are spreading fast across social media and crypto forums. But how much of it is true? In this fact-check, Coinpedia investigates the origin of the rumor, verifies the official statements from SWIFT and Ripple, and separates hype from reality. Where Did This Claim Start? The main claim appeared in a CryptoGeek headline stating : “SWIFT AGREEMENT WITH RIPPLE TO USE XRP FOR CROSS BORDER PAYMENTS HAS BEEN APPROVED!!” Even a Binance user posted the same, stating that billions of XRP will be blocked in escrow to boost global liquidity. Other posts go further, saying the XRPL is about to see $650 trillion added, and that a major XRP token burn will happen within three days to drive up the price even more. Fact Check: What’s Happening? There is no official confirmation from the SWIFT or Ripple team that an agreement has been finalized or “approved” for SWIFT to use XRP in all its cross-border payments. Meanwhile, official SWIFT communications and current crypto news show that they are exploring possible ways to integrate Ripple’s technology and XRP as a liquidity bridge, but nothing has been formally launched or approved yet. In 2025, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, predicted that XRP could handle up to 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume within five years, based on growing interest from banks. SWIFT continues to focus on updating its systems ( such as with ISO 20022 ) and has not made any announcement about switching all payment rails to XRP. Is $650 Trillion About to Be Injected into XRP? This number is way too high. SWIFT moves a huge amount of money every year, but there’s no proof that all of it will suddenly use XRP or the XRP Ledger. Some banks and payment companies do use XRP, mainly for sending money abroad in developing countries, but not on the big scale people are claiming. Is a Major XRP Token Burn Coming? There is no official or reliable information about a massive XRP token burn scheduled in the next 72 hours. XRP’s token supply and burns are strictly controlled by its creators and have not seen such announcements. Key Evidence Table: Coinpedia’s Fact Check Claim Coinpedia’s Evidence SWIFT has approved using XRP for all payments No official agreement; only talks and exploration Will $650 trillion to be injected into XRPL soon Highly exaggerated, not supported by SWIFT or Ripple Major XRP burn in next 72 hours No official announcement or evidence Conclusion Claim SWIFT has approved an agreement to use XRP for all cross-border payments. Verdict False Fact-Check by Coinpedia There is no official deal or approval for SWIFT to use XRP for global payments. Current developments show both sides are exploring possible integration, but nothing is finalized As always, trust only official news and be skeptical of viral posts promising too-good-to-be-true profits.",Uncategorized|FactCheck,EN,0,0,XRP|WALLET|BNB|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 08:20:47

Martinez recently highlighted that the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio for XRP flashed a golden cross, a technical signal that often precedes major price rallies. The last time this exact pattern appeared, XRP went into an overdrive mood, soaring by 630% in what can be marked as one of its most explosive bullish runs. An MVRV golden cross signals growing investor confidence as short-term and long-term holder metrics align often depicting a shift from undervaluation to accumulation and hinting at a strong upward price move. With the same golden cross reemerging and whales aggressively opening long positions, XRP may be on the verge of another major price surge. As a result, Martinez suggests this could be the early spark of another breakout similar to the last rally that saw XRP soar 630%, potentially propelling it from the present $3.48 to the $21.90 zone. This prediction aligns with the fact that XRP’s road to $23 recently came to light, thanks to the Valhalla Gate catalyst. Martinez also noted that XRP could be on track to hit the key $15 level after breaking out of a bullish flag, reinforcing its strong upward momentum as the third-largest crypto by market cap. Whales Open Massive XRP Longs As XRP trades at $3.48, whale wallets are quietly but decisively placing huge long bets one worth $1.02 million, the other $1.31 million—signaling growing institutional conviction. These massive positions are no coincidence and align with several converging bullish factors: 1. Whale Accumulation on Overdrive According to WhaleTrace, more than 2.2 billion XRP has been moved into large wallets over the past two weeks, pushing futures open interest to a staggering $9.98 billion. On‑chain records from XRPScan show skyrocketing network activity with XRP whale transfers exceeding $1 billion. Both metrics not only reflect sheer volume, but also indicate deep-pocketed whales actively positioning ahead of potential supply squeezes. 2. Institutional Tailwinds Weekly Fund inflows into XRP‑linked vehicles hit $36.1 million last week, according to CoinShares data. Derivatives metrics echo this trend since perpetual futures open interest reached a new high of $10.98 billion, illustrating institutional positioning. 3. Anticipating the Next Big Move Whales seems to be setting the stage for the next XRP leg because the $1.02M and $1.31M longs were opened near the $3.44 price level. Interestingly, this happened just after the surge in network volume and ahead of anticipated technical breakout zones. With strong on‑chain momentum, technical signals pointing higher, and macro catalysts lining up, these whales may well be positioning for a major rally toward the $4–6 range before the close of the year. Conclusion Whales placing massive XRP longs is by design because the more than $1 million bets reflect data-driven conviction, such as surging network activity, robust derivatives positioning, technical breakout setups, and renewed institutional legibility. With the tide turning in Ripple’s favor, these long positions may well be the bellwether for the next XRP mega‑move with a 630% jump in the picture.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-23 09:30:39

The token was taken up by influencers and rallied mostly on its dominant mindshare. While initially PENGU was seen as failing due to post-airdrop selling, currently the asset is viewed as undervalued based on its exposure and mentions. PENGU may also become a proxy for the meme market, due to its peak liquidity and availability on exchanges. The rally continues to be supported by trading against the Korean won. Over 38% of the PENGU trades are in Korean won pairs, up from 32% earlier this month. South Korean traders are also boosting the brand exposure, causing the breakaway rally. Pudgy Penguin creators are selling some PENGU During the latest stage of the PENGU rally, the collection’s creators sold some of their holdings. The recent sales are relatively small compared to February’s placement of 12B PENGU. In the past couple of weeks, around 1B PENGU left the collection team’s wallet . On-chain investigators noted PENGU was sold through Bybit, following the recent rapid growth from the year’s lows. The selling coincides with a period of price strength, though the team has also sold at $0.009. For now, the selling remains relatively small, but it may break the narrative of an even higher price range for PENGU. In the short term, the token is expected to rise above $0.05. PENGU open interest is also at an all-time high of over $435M. The long-short ratio remains balanced, with no shift to short-selling yet, due to the market’s potential for surprising rallies.

Why now?” As a profitable Web2 data company serving 450+ Fortune 500 clients, we didn’t need to change. Our traditional model was working perfectly. But we saw something bigger. The Big Data Growth Challenge Traditional Data Collection Limits For years, we’ve faced the same constraints every data company encounters: User fatigue : People increasingly resist surveys and data collection Privacy regulations : GDPR, CCPA limiting data access Quality decline : Paid respondents often provide low-quality data Scale bottlenecks : Growing panels is expensive and slow The InfoFI Solution Web3 technology, specifically InfoFI, solves these fundamental problems: Organic Growth : Users willingly participate because they’re rewarded Higher Quality : Financial incentives drive genuine engagement Transparent Value : Blockchain shows exactly how data creates value Network Effects : Referral systems create exponential growth Why InfoFI is the Best Way to Grow Big Data 1. Sustainable Data Quality Traditional panels burn out. InfoFI users stay engaged because they see direct financial benefits from their participation. Traditional Model : Pay $50 for a survey → User grudgingly completes → Poor data quality InfoFI Model : Share revenue continuously → User actively engages → Rich, ongoing data 2. Exponential Network Growth The referral mechanism creates viral growth impossible with traditional methods. Math : Each satisfied user refers 3 friends → Those refer 3 more → 1 becomes 100 in just 4 cycles Quality : Referred users are pre-qualified by existing users Cost : Organic acquisition vs. expensive paid acquisition 3. Data Visualization Revolution InfoFI doesn’t just collect more data—it makes data more valuable through transparency. How InfoFI Visualizes Data Value Traditional Data Flow (Invisible) User Data → Company Analytics → Enterprise Sales → ??? (Black Box) InfoFI Data Flow (Transparent) User Data → Real-time Analytics → Enterprise Sales → Visible Revenue Share The Visualization Advantage For Users : See exactly how their data creates value For Enterprises : Understand data provenance and quality For ADD+ : Demonstrate ROI and build trust Real-time Value Tracking User Dashboard : See monthly earnings from data contributions Enterprise Portal : Track data quality and source verification Public Blockchain : Verify all reward distributions The Strategic Decision: Web3 First Why We Chose InfoFI Over Incremental Improvements Option 1: Improve Traditional Model Increase survey payments Better user experience More privacy protection Result : Marginal improvements, same fundamental limits Option 2: Build InfoFI Protocol Revolutionary reward system Transparent value sharing Network effect growth Result : Exponential data growth + new revenue streams The Data Network Effect Traditional data companies hit ceiling around 100K quality respondents. InfoFI removes that ceiling entirely. Year 1 : 50K users (current baseline) Year 2 : 200K users (referral growth) Year 3 : 1M users (network effects) Year 5 : 10M users (global expansion) Each user generates 10x more valuable data than traditional panels because: Continuous engagement vs. one-time surveys Behavioral tracking vs. self-reported data Network insights vs. individual responses Quality incentives vs. completion incentives InfoFI: The Future of Data Economics Why This Model Will Dominate For Data Companies Lower acquisition costs : Viral referral growth Higher data quality : Financial engagement incentives Scalable model : No geographic or demographic limits Competitive moat : First-mover advantage in transparent data For Enterprises Better data quality : Users care about data accuracy Provenance tracking : Blockchain verification of data sources Ethical sourcing : Users are fairly compensated Richer insights : Continuous vs. snapshot data For Users Fair compensation : Share in value they create Transparency : See exactly how data is monetized Control : Choose level of participation Growth : Earnings increase with network participation The Visualization Revolution Making Data Value Visible Changes Everything Traditional : “Your data helps us serve you better” (vague promise) InfoFI : “Your data earned $47 this month” (concrete value) This shift from abstract to concrete value changes user behavior fundamentally: Higher participation rates : 85% vs. 23% in traditional panels Better data quality : Financial skin in the game Organic growth : Users recruit friends and family Long-term engagement : Sustainable incentive model The Blockchain Advantage Web3 infrastructure provides capabilities impossible in Web2: Immutable records : All transactions permanently recorded Automated payments : Smart contracts distribute rewards Global reach : No geographic payment restrictions Transparency : All stakeholders see the same data Results After 6 Months Data Quality Improvements Response rates : 89% vs. 34% traditional panels Data completeness : 94% vs. 67% traditional surveys User retention : 78% vs. 12% traditional panels Engagement depth : 3.2x more data points per user Growth Metrics User acquisition cost : 67% lower than paid acquisition Network growth rate : 34% monthly vs. 8% traditional Revenue per user : 2.4x higher than traditional model Client satisfaction : 91% vs. 76% traditional services The Bottom Line InfoFI isn’t just a Web3 experiment—it’s the strategic foundation for data company growth in the next decade. Traditional data companies will struggle with declining participation and increasing acquisition costs. InfoFI-powered companies will scale exponentially while improving data quality and user satisfaction. We didn’t choose Web3 because it’s trendy. We chose it because it’s the only path to sustainable, scalable, high-quality data growth. The future of data is transparent, fair, and mutually beneficial. InfoFI makes that future possible today.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/institutional-demand-shifts-to-ethereum-u-s-president-donald-trump-linked-enterprise-purchases-large-ethereum-details-here/,"World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the crypto project known for its links to US President Donald Trump, has purchased 3,473 ETH worth more than $13 million amid rising institutional interest in Ethereum. Trump-Backed World Liberty Financial Buys $13 Million in Ethereum According to data from onchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, purchases were made through various wallets throughout Tuesday evening. The received ETH was then staked on the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave. According to data shared by Lookonchain, World Liberty Financial's total Ethereum holdings currently stand at approximately 73,616 ETH, equivalent to approximately $275.9 million at current market prices. Institutional Demand Shifts to Ethereum World Liberty's acquisition comes amid growing interest in Ethereum from institutional investors. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw net inflows of $533.9 million on Tuesday alone, while spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $67.9 million. This suggests investors are increasingly focused on ETH in the short term. Although Ethereum's price remained stable over the past 24 hours, it has gained 20% on a weekly basis and 67.1% over the past 30 days. World Liberty has also begun the countdown to the unlock and exchange listing of its WLFI token. The project team announced last week that the token could officially begin trading within the next 6 to 8 weeks. “Our target for full awakening is 6 to 8 weeks. Strategic alignments (alliances, big stages, smart unlocks) take time, but the potential is great,” the project's expectations were shared. *This is not investment advice.

In a landmark development set to reshape the European crypto landscape, CoinShares , a leading digital asset investment firm, has achieved a significant milestone. They have successfully secured a Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license from France’s Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF). This marks a pivotal moment, positioning CoinShares as the first crypto asset manager based in continental Europe to qualify under this comprehensive new framework, signaling a new era of regulated crypto services. What is the MiCA License and Why is it a Game-Changer for Crypto? The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is a pioneering legislative framework by the European Union. Its primary goal is to provide a unified, comprehensive regulatory regime for crypto-assets across all 27 EU member states. Before MiCA, European crypto regulation was fragmented, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors. With CoinShares now holding a MiCA license , the implications are profound. Here’s why MiCA is a true game-changer: Harmonized Regulation: MiCA establishes consistent rules for crypto-asset issuers and service providers, bringing clarity and legal certainty. Enhanced Investor Protection: It introduces stringent requirements for transparency, disclosure, and operational resilience, significantly boosting investor safeguards and trust. Market Integrity: MiCA aims to prevent market manipulation and financial crime through strict anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Cross-Border Operations (Passporting): A key benefit is the “passporting” right. Authorization in one EU member state under MiCA allows firms to offer services across the entire European Economic Area (EEA) without needing separate national licenses, reducing hurdles and costs. This comprehensive framework fosters innovation while mitigating risks, creating a more secure environment for digital asset activities within the EU. CoinShares’ Pioneering Journey: How Did They Achieve This Landmark MiCA License? CoinShares is not new to regulated finance. The firm has a strong reputation as a digital asset investment powerhouse, already holding significant credentials under existing European financial regulations. Their journey to securing the MiCA license highlights their commitment to regulatory compliance and their strategic vision. CoinShares already operates under: MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive): Governs investment services and activities across the European Economic Area, ensuring transparency and investor protection in traditional financial markets. AIFM (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive): Regulates managers of alternative investment funds. The MiCA license acquisition from the AMF in France demonstrates CoinShares’ proactive approach. It involved rigorous scrutiny of their operational procedures, compliance frameworks, and investor protection measures. By navigating this complex process, CoinShares validated its robust infrastructure and set a precedent for other firms. This strategic move allows them to expand their regulated crypto portfolio services, solidifying their position as a trusted leader in the digital asset sector. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: What Challenges and Opportunities Does MiCA Present? While MiCA brings immense clarity and opportunity, new comprehensive regulatory frameworks also present challenges. Adapting to MiCA requires significant investment in compliance infrastructure, legal expertise, and operational adjustments. Challenges: Compliance Complexity: MiCA is extensive. Understanding and implementing its requirements, from disclosure to operational resilience, is resource-intensive. Technological Adaptation: Ensuring systems comply with MiCA’s requirements for data reporting, security, and transaction monitoring is a hurdle. Talent Acquisition: Demand for professionals with crypto and regulatory compliance expertise is high, making talent acquisition challenging. Opportunities: Increased Market Access: Passporting allows firms to scale operations across the entire EU with a single license, unlocking a massive market. Enhanced Credibility: Operating under a MiCA license significantly boosts a firm’s credibility, attracting institutional investors and traditional financial players. Level Playing Field: MiCA creates a more level playing field, ensuring all participants adhere to similar standards, fostering healthier competition and reducing illicit activities. Innovation within a Framework: MiCA is technology-neutral, allowing continued innovation within legal boundaries, encouraging responsible development of new crypto products. CoinShares’ success in obtaining the MiCA license shows these challenges are surmountable for prepared firms, paving the way for a more mature European crypto market. Impact on the European Crypto Market: What’s Next After CoinShares’ MiCA Milestone? The ripple effects of CoinShares securing the first continental European MiCA license are expected to be far-reaching, fundamentally altering the trajectory of the European crypto market. This milestone will likely trigger a domino effect, encouraging more institutional participation and fostering greater investor confidence. Here’s what we can anticipate: Area of Impact Description Institutional Adoption MiCA’s clarity, exemplified by CoinShares, makes it easier for traditional financial institutions to enter crypto. They now have a clear regulatory pathway, reducing perceived risks. Investor Confidence Retail and institutional investors benefit from enhanced protections. Knowing providers operate under a unified framework builds trust in digital assets as a legitimate class. Innovation and Growth MiCA creates a secure environment for innovation. Firms can develop new crypto products with greater legal certainty, potentially boosting regulated decentralized finance (DeFi) in the EU. Regulatory Precedent CoinShares’ success sets a powerful precedent, showing other EU member states that MiCA implementation is achievable and beneficial, potentially accelerating its adoption across the bloc. Global Influence The EU’s MiCA framework is being watched globally. Its successful implementation and emergence of regulated entities like CoinShares could influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto regulation, leading to more global harmonization. This groundbreaking step by CoinShares, leveraging their new MiCA license , validates the concept of regulated digital asset management and sets a high bar for future market participants in Europe.

Accordingly, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said that the SEC is increasingly likely to approve in-kind refunds for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Seyffart cited numerous filings filed with the SEC yesterday, stating that progress has been made with the SEC following recent filings by issuers to add in-kind payments to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. At this point, Seyffart noted that five issuers with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on the CBOE have amended their prospectuses, citing “positive action” from the SEC regarding approval of in-kind redemptions for their funds. These include Invesco Galaxy, Ark 21Shares, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Fidelity. The analyst noted that these changes could be a sign that issuers have reached an agreement with federal regulators regarding their demands to add in-kind reimbursements to BTC and ETH ETF funds. “More positive signs regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs becoming available for in-kind creation and redemption Five different funds on the CBOE have filed amendments with the SEC. This to me indicates positive movement and likely fine-tuning at the SEC.” Spot redemption is a method where ETF investors are repaid with actual virtual assets (cryptocurrencies) rather than cash, and is considered advantageous in terms of market efficiency and taxation. *This is not investment advice.

The new STRC preferred stock is designed as a low-duration, high-yield instrument to directly compete with money market funds, offering superior yield and stability. STRC's price stabilization mechanisms ensure principal preservation and yield competitiveness, drawing capital away from traditional cash equivalents and fueling further Bitcoin accumulation. I remain bullish on Strategy's common and preferreds, as each issuance strengthens the capital stack, increases intrinsic value, and perpetuates the Bitcoin accumulation flywheel. If you’ve been following my coverage of Strategy’s ( MSTR ) capital structure, you know I’m a firm believer in Saylor’s vision to develop Strategy into the ultimate levered Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) investment vehicle by essentially selling superior financial securities to the market. I previously covered ( STRK ) and ( STRF ) extensively here and here , while my previous article on STRD, their third preferred stock, highlighted how Saylor’s financial engineering creates a self-reinforcing flywheel, capturing capital from diverse investor classes to fuel Bitcoin accumulation. With STRC (STRC), Strategy takes this utterly corporate finance textbook-shuttering plan to a new level, introducing a low-duration, high-yield security designed to compete directly with money market funds. So, beyond further opening up its capital stack, Strategy is set to optimize its yield curve further. In fact, as I am about to explain, Strategy is setting itself to attract capital at unprecedented efficiency through STRC by creating what you can think of as a ""black hole"" in the world of short-term yield parking. Building the Yield Curve We have so far witnessed how Strategy's capital structure is a carefully crafted ecosystem, with each preferred (STRK, STRF, STRD, and now STRC) serving a distinct purpose in attracting capital from different investor profiles, which, in turn, Strategy leverages by attaching an at-the-money offering program. By issuing securities with varying risk/reward characteristics, Saylor and Co. is effectively building a Bitcoin-backed yield curve, where each instrument settles a specific niche in terms of duration, yield, and seniority. This system enables Strategy to tap into a broad spectrum of capital markets, ranging from risk-tolerant equity investors ( MSTR ) to conservative fixed-income seekers ( STRF ), to those seeking a middle ground ( STRK ) or even those willing to sit at a lower seniority level for higher yield ( STRD ), while minimizing financing costs and maximizing Bitcoin accumulation. MSTR's Yield Curve (STRC IPO Presentation) In my previous article, I explained how the introduction of STRD, a high-yield, junior preferred stock with a 10% dividend, was an indirect move to elevate the creditworthiness of STRF, the senior-most preferred in the capital stack. By offering a “junky” security with the exact same 10% yield as STRF, Strategy effectively pushed STRF’s perceived safety higher, encouraging investors to bid up its price above par, thus lowering its effective yield. This dynamic has allowed Strategy to issue STRF at a premium, raising capital at a lower cost while reinforcing the collateral base backing the entire capital structure. The result is a virtuous cycle where each new issuance strengthens the senior securities, attracts more capital, and funds further Bitcoin buys. MSTR's Preferred Stock Yields (STRC IPO Presentation) You can see in the chart above how my prediction played out quite accurately. The moment STRD entered the chat, the market has been chasing all three preferreds higher in order for each to more accurately reflect its underlying risk/reward ratio. The reality that the market is also getting increasingly educated about how these products are indeed superior to their tradfi peers (i.e., STRF is a superior credit instrument versus any other super long-term competitor, from the 30-Y US bond to Austria's 100-Y government bond ) has also contributed to this rally. It’s also clear that capital keeps flowing steadily into Strategy’s preferreds, especially when you compare them to the broader market. Just look at the underwhelming performance of the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF ( PFF ), which has lagged well behind. Again, this makes total sense as Strategy's preferreds are structurally superior in every shape or form, including the fact that they are overcollateralized multiple times over against Strategy's BTC holdings. MSTR's Preferreds vs. PFF (STRC IPO Presentation) STRC: The Money Market Competitor Now, here comes STRC, a perpetual preferred stock with a variable monthly dividend , initially set to deliver a high yield but (in my view) engineered to stabilize just above money market fund rates. Unlike say STRF, which competes with ultra-long-duration instruments due to its perpetual nature, STRC is engineered to be a low-duration security, offering investors near-cash-like stability with a superior yield. This positions STRC as a direct competitor to money market funds , which typically provide low yields (currently around 4-5% in a high-rate environment) but are prized for their liquidity and principal preservation. The financial engineering behind STRC is nothing short of marvelous (or crazy, depending on which camp you are sitting in). Strategy basically aims to maintain STRC’s price close to its $100 par value through a series of levers: If STRC trades at $101 or above: Strategy can (1) decrease the dividend rate, (2) issue additional STRC via secondary offerings at or below $101, or (3) call STRC at $101. If STRC trades at $99 or below: Strategy can (1) increase the dividend rate or (2) cease selling STRC in at-the-market (ATM) offerings below $99. STRC's Price Manipulation Mechanisms (STRC IPO Presentation) These mechanisms synthetically ensure that STRC remains a highly attractive, stable investment, mimicking the principal preservation of money market funds while offering a higher yield. Initially, STRC’s yield may be elevated to draw capital, potentially in the 9.5% to 10% range. However, as the security gains traction, I believe Strategy will fine-tune the dividend to hover just above money market fund rates, say, 4% to 5% in 3% to 3.5% rate environment. This strategy ensures STRC remains competitive compared to investing in a money market fund, thus gradually drawing capital away from traditional cash equivalents. It's essentially an attack on money market funds. Now here's where things get really interesting. In a scenario where the money market fund rates drop to 1-2% in a low-rate environment (as they did in the early 2020s - they, in fact, went negative in Europe ), STRC could offer a 2.5% to 3% yield, providing a premium while still being an ultra-low-cost financing tool for Strategy. This is a win-win as STRC holders enjoy a higher yield than money market funds with comparable principal stability, while Strategy secures cheap capital to acquire Bitcoin, which they project will appreciate at a CAGR of 21% over the next 21 years. The Flywheel: Why This Isn’t a Ponzi Scheme I know that many believe that Strategy’s non-stop issuance of common and preferred shares looks like a Ponzi scheme, as it relies on new capital to sustain dividends and fuel Bitcoin purchases. However, this perspective misses the mark of Strategy's engineering. As I argued in my STRD article, Strategy isn’t just issuing securities for the sake of raising capital. It is instead creating superior financial products that attract capital precisely because they offer better risk/reward profiles than competing instruments. Now, skeptics will proudly counter by arguing that this structure depends on MSTR’s common stock trading above par to fund preferred dividends, which is both very risky and dilutive. However, the accretive nature of Strategy’s preferreds supports the common stock’s premium . By issuing STRC, STRD, STRK, and STRF, Strategy raises capital at low costs, acquires more Bitcoin, and strengthens the collateral base backing the entire capital stack. This increases the intrinsic value of MSTR’s common stock, thus justifying its >1mNAV multiple. In the flywheel effect, each preferred issuance fuels Bitcoin accumulation, which boosts the value of the common per share, which in turn supports further preferred issuances. Besides, issuing common stock above NAV to pay preferred dividends is by definition accretive. If your common stock is trading at 2x NAV, you are selling $1 for $2 to pay dividends, which is something you want to do all day long.

The closure, which affects the Amazon Web Services (AWS) research unit established in 2018, is part of a strategic pullback, with the company citing ongoing internal restructuring. “We’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser. “These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimise resources.” Amazon’s six-year run ends amid strategic recalibration Wang Minjie, a senior scientist at the AWS Shanghai AI lab, confirmed the lab’s closure in a WeChat post, stating that the team was “being dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid US-China tensions.” Over its six-year tenure, the lab published more than 100 academic papers and developed an open-source neural network framework for graph-based data, which Wang claimed helped generate nearly $1 billion in revenue for Amazon . The lab also contributed to AWS’s global research output, operating at the intersection of fundamental AI research and cloud infrastructure innovation. Amazon did not disclose how many employees were affected. However, sources familiar with the matter said the AWS China division once employed over 1,000 people at its peak. America is pulling out of China Amazon’s retreat is part of a growing exodus of US technology firms pulling research operations out of China. Earlier this year, Microsoft shut down its Internet of Things and AI Insider Lab in Shanghai, relocating some Chinese-based AI staff to other countries amid escalating restrictions on technology exports. In 2024, IBM laid off more than 1,000 China-based R&D staff, consolidating research functions outside the country. Also, consultancy giant McKinsey recently barred its China practice from generative AI work following heightened geopolitical scrutiny. A major reason for these moves can be attributed to the intensification of US export controls aimed at curbing China’s access to advanced semiconductors and AI development tools. New rules implemented by the Trump administration have restricted Chinese firms and institutions from purchasing cutting-edge chips and using US cloud computing services for AI training. Domestic competition is rising to fill the gap While AWS still maintains some commercial activity in China, primarily serving multinationals and local tech firms with global operations, its core research operations have been increasingly constrained. The Shanghai lab, once positioned as a center of excellence for AI and cloud research, has now become the latest casualty of the tech sector’s global realignment. Industry analysts suggest the pullbacks could create opportunities for Chinese tech giants to fill the gap. Companies like Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba have significantly ramped up investment in domestic AI development, including the launch of large language models and dedicated chip design teams. However, the exodus of foreign labs from China also raises concerns about talent flow and the fragmentation of global tech ecosystems, among others. As national security concerns override commercial logic, the once-global AI research landscape is increasingly being divided across geopolitical lines.

This crucial development has sent ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to ponder the immediate implications and future trajectory of the Bitcoin price . According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC was observed trading at $117,968 on the Binance USDT market. This dip, while not unprecedented in Bitcoin’s volatile history, certainly commands attention and warrants a deeper dive into its potential causes and consequences. For anyone invested in or considering entering the crypto space, understanding these market shifts is absolutely essential. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Movement? When the Bitcoin price takes a notable dip, it’s rarely due to a single, isolated event. Instead, it’s typically a complex interplay of various factors, both internal to the crypto market and external macroeconomic forces. Understanding these triggers is key to interpreting market behavior. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The broader global economic landscape significantly influences risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Concerns over persistent inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks (such as the Federal Reserve), and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, pulling funds from more speculative assets. When traditional markets show signs of instability, the ripple effect often reaches the crypto market, impacting the Bitcoin price . Market Sentiment and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): The cryptocurrency market is highly sensitive to news and rumors. Negative regulatory news from major economies, concerns over the solvency of crypto exchanges or lending platforms, or even widespread social media speculation can quickly erode investor confidence. This FUD can trigger panic selling, creating a downward spiral for prices. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: Professional traders and algorithms often rely on technical indicators and support levels. When the Bitcoin price breaks below a significant psychological or technical support level, such as the $118,000 mark, it can trigger automatic sell orders and encourage further selling pressure as traders anticipate continued declines. Whale Activity: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can exert considerable influence on the market. A significant sell-off by one or more whales can inject a large supply of Bitcoin into the market, overwhelming demand and causing a rapid decline in price. Tracking these large movements is a constant endeavor for market analysts. Liquidity Issues: While Bitcoin is highly liquid, sudden large sell orders in a specific market can temporarily overwhelm buying interest, especially if liquidity is concentrated on a few exchanges. This can lead to rapid price discovery downwards until new buyers step in. The confluence of these factors often creates a perfect storm, leading to sharp corrections in the Bitcoin price , reminding us of the inherent volatility that defines this innovative asset class. The Immediate Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Wider Market A sudden drop in Bitcoin price below a key level like $118,000 doesn’t just affect Bitcoin itself; it sends tremors throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The immediate aftermath can be a period of heightened uncertainty and rapid re-evaluation for all market participants. Investor Reaction and Sentiment: For many investors, a sharp decline triggers a mix of fear and opportunity. Some may panic sell to cut losses, contributing to further downward pressure. Others, particularly those with a long-term conviction, may view it as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, looking to accumulate more Bitcoin at a perceived discount. This divergence in reaction often creates choppy market conditions. Altcoin Correlation: Bitcoin is often considered the bellwether of the crypto market. When the Bitcoin price moves significantly, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) tend to follow suit. A drop in BTC usually leads to a corresponding decline across most altcoins, although some may experience more severe percentage losses due to their smaller market caps and higher volatility. Projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano often see their prices influenced heavily by Bitcoin’s performance. Liquidation Events: For traders using leverage, a sharp drop in price can trigger forced liquidations. When the value of their collateral falls below a certain threshold, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent further losses, which can amplify selling pressure and accelerate the price decline in a cascading effect. This is a particularly dangerous aspect of highly leveraged trading during volatile periods. Market Narrative Shift: A significant price drop can shift the overall market narrative from bullish optimism to cautious pessimism. Media coverage might focus more on the risks and challenges of cryptocurrency investment, which can further deter new entrants and put pressure on existing holders. Potential for Rebound: While immediate impact can be negative, history shows that significant dips in Bitcoin price often precede periods of strong recovery. The question becomes whether the underlying fundamentals remain strong enough to attract new buying interest and overcome the bearish sentiment. Understanding these immediate impacts is crucial for investors to make informed decisions and manage their portfolios effectively in the face of market volatility. Navigating Volatility: Strategies for Bitcoin Price Swings The recent drop in Bitcoin price serves as a potent reminder that volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. While it can be daunting, experienced investors employ several strategies to navigate these swings and potentially turn them into opportunities. Here’s how you can approach periods of significant price movement: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, especially during periods of market stress, thoroughly research Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its underlying technology, and its long-term potential. Rely on credible sources like Bitcoin World and avoid making decisions based solely on social media hype or fear. Understanding why the Bitcoin price is moving helps in making rational choices. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the asset’s price. When the price is high, your fixed amount buys fewer units; when the price is low, it buys more. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and reduces the risk associated with trying to ‘time the market.’ It’s an excellent approach for mitigating the impact of Bitcoin price fluctuations. Implement Robust Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This golden rule is paramount in volatile markets. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the price continues to fall beyond a certain point. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, perhaps into other asset classes or even stablecoins, can also reduce overall risk exposure. Maintain a Long-Term Vision (HODL): For those who believe in Bitcoin’s revolutionary potential and its role as a digital store of value, significant price dips can be viewed as temporary setbacks on a long-term growth trajectory. The ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) philosophy encourages investors to ride out short-term volatility based on a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. Historically, Bitcoin has recovered from far more severe corrections. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: While it’s important to be aware of market developments, constantly checking charts and reacting to every minor fluctuation can lead to emotional decisions. Follow reputable news outlets and analysis, but avoid getting caught up in the daily noise. Focus on the broader trends and the factors influencing the long-term Bitcoin price . By adopting these disciplined strategies, investors can approach market volatility with a clearer mind and a more resilient portfolio, rather than being swept away by fear or greed. What Does This Bitcoin Price Dip Mean for the Future? While the recent drop in Bitcoin price below $118,000 may seem concerning in the short term, it’s crucial to view such movements within the broader context of Bitcoin’s historical performance and its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Bitcoin has a proven track record of resilience, often recovering from significant corrections to reach new all-time highs. Historical Resilience: Bitcoin has endured numerous dramatic price crashes throughout its history, only to rebound stronger. Each major correction has often purged speculative excess from the market, paving the way for more sustainable growth. This inherent resilience suggests that while dips are painful, they are a normal part of its growth cycle. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The cryptocurrency market is far more mature now than it was during previous cycles. We’re seeing increased institutional adoption, clearer regulatory discussions (even if slow), and the development of more robust financial products like Bitcoin ETFs. This growing infrastructure provides a stronger foundation, potentially cushioning future drops and supporting long-term growth for the Bitcoin price . Upcoming Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s supply is programmatically capped, and its issuance rate is cut in half approximately every four years through an event known as ‘halving.’ Historically, these halving events have preceded significant bull runs due to the reduced supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. While not an immediate factor, future halvings remain a powerful long-term driver for the Bitcoin price . Global Adoption Trends: Despite short-term price volatility, the fundamental adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology continues to expand globally. More businesses are accepting crypto payments, more countries are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and awareness is growing. This increasing utility and acceptance are strong long-term tailwinds. A Test of Conviction: For many, these dips are a test of conviction. They separate those looking for quick gains from those who truly believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a decentralized, scarce digital asset. The current Bitcoin price action, therefore, can be seen as a necessary market correction that strengthens its foundation for future growth. In essence, while short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin price remains tied to its fundamental strengths, increasing utility, and the relentless innovation within the broader crypto space. Informed investors understand that patience and a long-term perspective are often rewarded. Conclusion The recent fall of the Bitcoin price below $118,000, as reported by Bitcoin World and observed on Binance, underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. This movement is a result of a complex interplay of macroeconomic pressures, market sentiment, technical indicators, and whale activity. While such dips can trigger immediate concerns, they are also a fundamental characteristic of a maturing asset class. For investors, understanding these triggers and their immediate impacts is crucial. More importantly, adopting disciplined strategies such as Dollar-Cost Averaging, robust risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective are vital for navigating volatility. History has shown Bitcoin’s remarkable resilience, consistently recovering from significant corrections to achieve new milestones. As the market matures, with increasing institutional interest and ongoing technological advancements, the long-term outlook for the Bitcoin price remains compelling, albeit with the continued expectation of short-term fluctuations. Stay informed, stay strategic, and approach the crypto market with a well-researched perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $118,000? The recent drop in Bitcoin price is likely due to a combination of factors, including broader macroeconomic concerns (like inflation and interest rate hikes), negative market sentiment fueled by regulatory news or FUD, technical breakdowns below key support levels, and potential large sell-offs by significant holders (whales). It’s rarely a single cause but rather a confluence of these elements. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Whether it’s a ‘good’ time to buy depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Some investors view significant dips in Bitcoin price as opportunities to ‘buy the dip’ and accumulate more at a lower cost, especially if they have a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value. Others prefer to wait for signs of market stabilization. Strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can help mitigate risk by spreading purchases over time. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s price volatility affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often acts as the market leader for the broader cryptocurrency space. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant volatility, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) typically follow suit. A sharp drop in Bitcoin often leads to a corresponding decline across most altcoins, while a strong Bitcoin rally can pull the rest of the market up. This correlation is a key characteristic of the crypto market. Q4: What are some common strategies for managing Bitcoin price risk? Key strategies include: 1) Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to average out your purchase price over time; 2) Setting Stop-Loss Orders to limit potential losses; 3) Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin; 4) Only investing what you can afford to lose ; and 5) Conducting thorough research (DYOR) to understand the asset’s fundamentals. Q5: What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin’s price? Despite short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin price remains largely positive for many analysts and investors. This is based on Bitcoin’s scarcity, its growing adoption as a digital store of value and medium of exchange, increasing institutional interest, and the anticipation of future halving events that reduce new supply. While dips are expected, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated strong resilience and growth over longer periods. Did you find this analysis helpful?

This milestone signals renewed confidence among large institutional players, who are now beginning to rotate profits into promising altcoins that promise faster, more explosive growth. While Layer-1 blockchains such as Sui focus on technical upgrades like speed and scalability, the financial upside offered by certain altcoins is capturing more attention from savvy investors. One such token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform poised to deliver rapid returns that could far outpace slow-moving tech improvements. As whales increase their stakes, MUTM stands out not just for its innovative DeFi protocols but also for its strong presale momentum and well-structured roadmap. Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized around $119,750 as of July 21, 2025, after hitting a new all-time high of $123,153 on July 14, driven by $2.7 billion in weekly ETF inflows, per Reuters. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, holding over 700,000 BTC, led with $1.18 billion in single-day inflows, boosting institutional demand. The CLARITY Act and pro-crypto policies during “Crypto Week” fueled optimism, with X posts noting a 13% monthly gain. A bullish three white soldiers pattern targets $125,000-$136,000 by Q4 2025, per Ledn’s CEO, though an overbought RSI (75) and $445 million in short liquidations suggest a potential dip to $116,500-$117,000. Long-term holder accumulation (250,000 BTC) and rising transactions (364,000 daily) signal sustained momentum, but tariff uncertainties and miner outflows could spark volatility, keeping BTC’s trajectory in a delicate balance. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized lending platform built on a fast Layer-2 network, offering two distinct models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will be able to deposit assets like $28,000 MATIC into a lending pool and earn a projected 13.8% APY—yielding $3,864 in passive income annually. Borrowers, on the other hand, will be able to put blue-chip tokens such as $2,800 worth of ADA at 70% LTV to instantly borrow $1,960 in USDT, with flexible repayment and no penalties. Meanwhile, the P2P model will support risk-adjusted lending backed by volatile assets like memecoins. Users will negotiate terms directly, unlocking higher yield opportunities with smart contract safeguards. All earnings will be tracked through mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that grow in value automatically, can be transferred, and staked for extra rewards via MUTM buybacks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale has attracted tremendous interest, with Phase 5 nearly complete. Out of a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, $12.9 million has been raised, and 90% of tokens allocated in this phase are sold. Over 13,900 holders have secured their positions at the current price of $0.03, just before the next planned price increase to $0.035—a 20% rise. This rapid token uptake illustrates strong market confidence and positions MUTM as one of the hottest altcoins for investors seeking meaningful returns ahead of the token’s full launch. Stablecoin Innovation & mtToken Staking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a steady $1 value. This stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral like ETH, and burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. Governance will actively adjust borrowing interest rates to keep the stablecoin price close to its peg, lowering rates if it trades above $1 and raising them if it dips below. This dynamic rate model works alongside natural arbitrage to maintain price stability. Meanwhile, mtTokens generated in lending pools can be staked in designated smart contracts, enabling holders to earn passive income through MUTM buybacks. This mechanism not only incentivizes long-term holding but also adds an extra layer of security and community engagement to the ecosystem. Roadmap Progress and Future Milestones Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made significant strides since the presale launch. Most of Phase 1, “Introducing Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” is complete, including presale initiation, marketing campaigns, giveaway launches, external smart contract audits, token tracking listings, and implementation of an AI-powered helpdesk. Pending items include educational content on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s technology and forming a legal and compliance team. Looking ahead, Phase 2, titled “Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” will focus on core smart contract development, DApp front-end and back-end infrastructure setup, introduction of advanced features, and implementation of robust risk parameters. Both internal and external auditors will conduct regular code reviews to ensure security and efficiency. Additionally, Phase 2 will bring advanced analytics tools for improved platform insights. Phases 3 and 4, “Finalizing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)” and “Delivering Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” respectively, will see beta testing, launch of the demo version, regulatory alignment, and preparation for exchange listings. The live platform launch, token listing on exchanges, bug bounty program activation, and expansion to multiple blockchain networks are also slated for these stages, along with institutional partnership development and ongoing platform enhancements. This structured roadmap lays a clear path toward a fully functional, secure, and scalable DeFi ecosystem. A notable example of early success comes from a trader who swapped 10 ETH for MUTM tokens during Phase 2 at just $0.015 each. With the token set to list at $0.06, this investor currently sits on a 4x paper gain. Looking ahead, if post-launch demand pushes MUTM toward the projected $0.30 target, that same position could grow to a 20x return. This upside is supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming beta launch, which will activate real-world P2P and P2C lending use cases—attracting a wider user base and increasing token demand. CertiK Audit & $100K Giveaway Boost Confidence Security is a top priority for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), evidenced by a thorough CertiK audit combining manual code reviews and static analysis. The platform has earned a strong scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet rating of 77.50, underscoring its robust security protocols. Alongside these assurances, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway with ten $10,000 worth of MUTM token prizes, fueling community enthusiasm. The project’s Twitter following has surpassed 12,000, reflecting an engaged and growing user base ready to support the token’s journey. With approximately 60 million MUTM tokens remaining at $0.03, this is a final opportunity for investors to secure tokens before the upcoming Phase 6 price jump to $0.035. This 20% increase is locked in and offers immediate upside to those who move swiftly. While Bitcoin (BTC) stabilizes near historic highs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative DeFi approach and strong presale performance position it to be the next altcoin breakout story.

48784391,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=181680,1753264825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48784391.jpeg,Tether Investments: Unveiling a Billion-Dollar Empire’s Bold Expansion,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-investments-portfolio-expansion/,"BitcoinWorld Tether Investments: Unveiling a Billion-Dollar Empire’s Bold Expansion In a move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency landscape, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has recently pulled back the curtain on a significant portion of its expansive investment portfolio. This isn’t just about holding reserves; it’s about active, strategic deployment of profits into a diverse array of over 120 companies. If you’ve been wondering how a stablecoin giant leverages its financial might beyond just backing its tokens, this revelation about Tether investments offers a fascinating glimpse into its growing influence. What Are Tether Investments Really About? The recent disclosure by Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, via a post on X (formerly Twitter), provided a rare look into the company’s ambitious financial strategy. Ardoino clarified that these substantial investments are not derived from Tether’s stablecoin reserves—the funds specifically held to back USDT and other Tether-issued stablecoins. This is a crucial distinction that underscores the company’s commitment to maintaining the 1:1 peg of its stablecoins, ensuring their stability and liquidity. Instead, these significant capital allocations are made directly from Tether’s accumulated profits. And what profits they are! In 2024 alone, Tether reported a staggering $13.7 billion in profits. This immense profitability positions Tether not just as a stablecoin issuer but as a formidable investment entity with considerable financial muscle. The sheer scale of these profits allows Tether to engage in a broad spectrum of ventures, extending its reach far beyond the traditional crypto sphere. The fact that over 120 companies have already received funding highlights a methodical and diversified approach to capital deployment. While specific names of these companies haven’t been fully disclosed, the sheer number suggests a strategy aimed at fostering innovation and growth across various sectors. This strategic use of profits demonstrates a proactive stance in building and supporting the broader digital economy, rather than merely holding onto cash. The Strategic Vision Behind These Expansive Tether Investments Why would a stablecoin issuer venture into such a wide array of investments? The answer lies in Tether’s long-term vision and its evolving role in the digital asset ecosystem. These Tether investments are not random; they are part of a calculated strategy designed to achieve several key objectives: Ecosystem Growth and Diversification: By investing in various companies, Tether is actively contributing to the development of new technologies, platforms, and services. This diversification reduces reliance on any single market segment and fosters a more robust and interconnected digital economy. It’s a way of ‘giving back’ to the ecosystem that has enabled its success, ensuring continued innovation. Future-Proofing and Revenue Streams: As the crypto market matures, companies like Tether are looking beyond their core products to secure future revenue streams. Investments in promising startups and established ventures can yield significant returns, further bolstering Tether’s financial strength and resilience. This strategy ensures the company remains relevant and profitable in a rapidly evolving landscape. Influence and Strategic Partnerships: Financial investments often come with strategic influence. By backing various companies, Tether can forge partnerships, gain insights into emerging trends, and potentially steer development in directions that align with its broader goals for decentralization and digital financial infrastructure. Supporting Web3 and Emerging Technologies: While the exact sectors aren’t detailed, it’s highly probable that many of these investments are directed towards Web3 infrastructure, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, renewable energy, and other cutting-edge fields. This aligns with a broader industry trend of crypto entities supporting the next generation of technological advancements. Paolo Ardoino’s statement about significantly expanding investments in the coming months and years reinforces this long-term, strategic outlook. It suggests that Tether views its role as a key financial enabler for innovation, leveraging its substantial profits to shape the future of technology and finance. How Do Tether Investments Impact the Crypto Landscape? The extensive nature of Tether investments carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and beyond. On one hand, there are clear benefits: Stimulating Innovation: Capital injection into over 120 companies, especially those in nascent or high-growth sectors, can accelerate innovation. This funding allows startups to scale, develop new products, and bring groundbreaking ideas to market, ultimately benefiting users and the wider economy. Increased Liquidity and Stability: A financially strong and diversified Tether is beneficial for the stability of USDT, which remains a cornerstone of crypto trading. The ability to generate substantial profits from diversified investments adds another layer of financial robustness to the company, potentially enhancing confidence in its stablecoin. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: As Tether invests in a wider array of companies, it naturally bridges the gap between traditional industries and the digital asset space. This cross-pollination can lead to greater adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in mainstream applications. However, such expansive financial influence also brings potential challenges and considerations: Centralization Concerns: While Tether champions decentralization, its significant financial power and wide-ranging investments could lead to concerns about centralized influence within the crypto ecosystem. A single entity holding stakes in many key projects might raise questions about market control and competitive fairness. Transparency and Disclosure: While Tether has disclosed the number of companies and the source of funds, the lack of specific details about the recipient companies can lead to calls for greater transparency. For an entity with such systemic importance, more granular disclosures could foster greater trust and accountability. Market Influence: The sheer scale of Tether’s investment capacity means its decisions could significantly impact the growth trajectories of various sectors. While this can be positive, it also means Tether’s strategic choices could inadvertently shape market dynamics in powerful ways. Navigating the Future of Tether Investments : What’s Next? Looking ahead, the trajectory of Tether investments appears to be one of continued expansion and deepening influence. Paolo Ardoino’s explicit statement about scaling up investments suggests that the current portfolio of 120+ companies is just the beginning. We can anticipate several key developments: Firstly, expect a more pronounced focus on specific strategic sectors. While the current investments are broad, Tether might hone in on areas like AI infrastructure, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), biotech advancements, and sustainable energy solutions. These are sectors that align with a vision of a technologically advanced and environmentally conscious future, and where significant capital can drive transformative change. Secondly, the regulatory landscape will undoubtedly play a crucial role. As Tether’s financial footprint grows, so too will the scrutiny from regulators worldwide. The company’s ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and comply with global financial standards will be critical in navigating this environment. Clear communication about its investment thesis and the nature of its holdings will be paramount for maintaining trust. Finally, the interplay between these investments and Tether’s core stablecoin business will be fascinating to observe. While distinct, the success of one can certainly bolster the other. Strong returns from its investment portfolio can further solidify Tether’s financial position, indirectly strengthening the confidence in USDT, even as the funds remain separate from reserves. This symbiotic relationship could create a powerful feedback loop, driving both innovation and stability. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor: Monitor Tether’s Disclosures: Keep an eye on any further transparency reports or announcements from Tether regarding their investment activities. These can offer clues about emerging trends and sectors they deem promising. Research Potential Beneficiaries: While direct names are scarce, understanding the types of companies Tether might favor (e.g., Web3 infrastructure, AI, biotech) can help identify broader investment themes. Understand the Distinction: Always remember that these investments are from profits, separate from stablecoin reserves. This distinction is vital for assessing USDT’s stability. A Bold New Era for Crypto Finance Tether’s revelation about its extensive Tether investments marks a significant moment in the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies a shift where major crypto entities are not just building within their immediate domain but are actively shaping the broader technological and economic landscape through strategic capital deployment. This bold expansion, fueled by substantial profits, positions Tether as a formidable player in global finance, with a reach that extends far beyond the stablecoin market. While questions around transparency and centralized influence will undoubtedly persist, the potential for these investments to foster innovation and drive the adoption of new technologies is undeniable. As Tether continues to expand its portfolio, it will be fascinating to witness the impact of its financial might on the companies it supports and the industries it seeks to transform. This is more than just an investment strategy; it’s a blueprint for a new era of crypto-powered growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Are Tether’s investments part of its stablecoin reserves? No, Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino explicitly stated that these investments are made from Tether’s accumulated profits, which amounted to $13.7 billion in 2024. These funds are entirely separate from the reserves held to back USDT and other stablecoins, ensuring the 1:1 peg and liquidity of its stablecoins. Q2: How many companies has Tether invested in? Tether has revealed that it has invested in over 120 companies to date. This number is expected to significantly expand in the coming months and years, indicating a long-term strategic investment approach. Q3: Why is Tether making these investments?

Q5: What are the potential impacts of Tether’s extensive investment portfolio? The impacts are multifaceted.

However, Bitcoin and other altcoins rallied due to a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict, triggering a rally that even benefited PEPE. From H1’s final week to the third week of July, PEPE crypto’s technical chart shows signs of life. Currently, PEPE price has broken out from the Q2 decline, forming a falling wedge pattern. As a result, in the past 25 days, it has surged over 60%. PEPE Price Targets July 2025 Interestingly, the price action in Q2 shows a stark similarity with Elliott Wave theory. After five impulsive waves and three corrective waves, the recent wave 3 has ended. This indicates that the current ongoing rise could be the start of a new series of fresh impulsive waves, and we are experiencing Wave 1 in July. In the short term, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands are flipped, and in the most recent week, PEPE has successfully flipped the 200-day EMA. This shows that a short-term golden cross has formed, and a long-term golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs could occur soon, as the gap between them is getting filled with PEPE price rising. Also, adding to the optimism, the RSI shows strength still intact and has room for another push until PEPE completes its wave 1 by hitting $0.16. On the other hand, if the bears pressure rises and PEPE fails to maintain above the 200-day EMA and $0.00001255, then a retest of the $0.00001100 level is likely, with a possibility of declining to $0.00000760.

After a small Wave 2 correction, a much stronger Wave 3 rally could be on the horizon. This means that Q3 could see another series of new impulsive waves, from 1 to 5, as selling pressure appears to have diminished. If all the momentum continues throughout Q3 and Q4, it could potentially push PEPE to $0.00002837 by late 2025. However, for a bullish outlook, breaking the Fibonacci 0.5 level is still very essential. Failing to surpass $0.00001688 could trigger a trend reversal and lead to a price pullback.

At press time, ETH was trading at $3,674, up almost 62.39% in the past month, with a market cap of approximately $444.54 billion, as per CoinMarketCap . According to Finbold’s AI price prediction model , ETH price could reach $3,800 by August 31 (a +3.41% increase from the current price). ETH AI price prediction. Source: Finbold The prediction is based on several technical indicators, including the Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ), Relative Strength Index ( RSI ), Stochastic Oscillator , MACD Slope, and 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ). ETHtechnicals considered by AI. Source: Finbold ETH continues to trade well above its 50-day SMA of $2,752, which suggests the momentum remains broadly bullish . However, the MACD line, standing at 311.498, with a signal line at 250.056 and a positive histogram reading of 61.443, indicates strong underlying buying pressure. Likewise, while the MACD signal line is rising and thus implying continued upward momentum, the MACD histogram slope has flattened to 1.138, hinting that the pace of the momentum is slowing. Short-term indicators are signaling overextension. The 7-day RSI is hovering near 80, down from a high of 87 last month. While still in overbought territory, the declining RSI alongside rising prices points to a bearish divergence often seen as foreboding a consolidation or a pullback. Similarly, the Stochastic Oscillator remains elevated between 83 and 89, further supporting the view that ETH may be nearing a short-term peak. Ethereum trading volume Meanwhile, Ethereum’s 24-hour trading volume has dropped more than 20%, now sitting at $37.28 billion, according to CoinMarketCap . Total futures open interest (OI), i.e., the total number of active contracts (futures or options) that haven’t been settled or closed, has also dropped by 3.16% in the past day, as indicated by CoinGlass data. This might signal a short squeeze unwind. Taken alongside the mixed technical indicators, these numbers support a cautiously optimistic outlook and a modest potential upside, as predicted by the AI.

For anyone tracking global macro trends, understanding these pivotal moments is key, as they often signal broader economic health and future movements, even influencing the cryptocurrency landscape indirectly by shaping investor sentiment and liquidity. The Hungarian National Bank (MNB) has opted to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 6.50%, a decision that reflects a calculated approach to managing inflation and fostering currency stability. What’s Driving the Hungarian Forint’s Current Trajectory? The Hungarian Forint has been on a journey marked by both volatility and periods of resilience. Its performance is often influenced by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. Domestically, inflation rates, government fiscal policy, and economic growth figures play a significant role. Internationally, global commodity prices, particularly energy, and the broader geopolitical landscape can exert considerable pressure on the Forint’s value. The MNB’s recent decision to hold rates steady signals a belief that current monetary conditions are appropriate for guiding the Forint towards a more predictable path. Historically, the Forint has faced challenges from high inflation and external imbalances. However, recent policy actions by the MNB have aimed at taming price pressures and stabilizing the currency. This latest hold at 6.50% suggests that the central bank sees the current policy stance as effective in balancing the need for disinflation with supporting economic activity. Investors and market watchers are closely observing how this stability will translate into long-term confidence in the Hungarian economy. How Does the Central Bank’s Decision Influence Your Finances? The role of a Central Bank like the MNB extends far beyond setting interest rates; it acts as the guardian of a nation’s financial stability. Its decisions directly impact borrowing costs, savings returns, and the overall economic environment. For individuals, this means the cost of mortgages, personal loans, and even the returns on savings accounts are influenced by the central bank’s actions. For businesses, it affects the cost of capital, investment decisions, and ultimately, job creation. When the Central Bank maintains rates, it signals a period of predictability. This can be beneficial for planning and investment, as the cost of money remains constant. Here’s how a central bank’s rate decision can ripple through the economy: Borrowing Costs: Stable rates mean consistent costs for loans, from home mortgages to business credit. Savings Returns: Interest earned on deposits tends to align with the central bank’s benchmark rate, offering predictable returns for savers. Investment Climate: Predictable interest rate environments can encourage long-term investment by reducing uncertainty for businesses. Currency Value: Stable rates can contribute to a more stable currency value, impacting import and export prices. Inflation Expectations: A consistent monetary policy helps anchor inflation expectations, which is crucial for price stability. Decoding the 6.50% Interest Rates : A Deep Dive into MNB’s Stance The decision to maintain Interest Rates at 6.50% is not made in a vacuum. It reflects the MNB’s assessment of current economic conditions, including inflation trends, economic growth forecasts, and external risks. This specific rate is considered a neutral stance, neither overly restrictive nor overly accommodative, designed to continue the disinflationary process while avoiding a sharp economic downturn. The MNB has been proactive in its efforts to combat inflation, which soared in recent years. The current 6.50% rate is a significant step down from previous, much higher levels, indicating that the central bank believes the peak of inflation has passed and that price pressures are now moderating. The focus has shifted from aggressive tightening to carefully managing the economy’s transition to a lower inflation environment. This sustained period of steady Interest Rates is intended to provide a stable foundation for businesses and consumers to plan their financial futures. To put the MNB’s recent rate decisions into perspective, consider the following: Date of Decision Base Rate Action Primary Rationale (Simplified) March 2024 8.25% Cut Continued disinflation, supporting economy April 2024 7.75% Cut Further disinflationary trends May 2024 7.25% Cut Achieving inflation target sustainably June 2024 6.50% Cut Sustained decline in inflation July 2024 6.50% Hold Maintaining price stability, assessing global risks Is Hungary’s Current Monetary Policy Steering Towards Long-Term Stability? The MNB’s current Monetary Policy stance, characterized by a steady 6.50% rate, aims to anchor long-term inflation expectations and foster sustainable economic growth. This policy framework involves not just interest rates but also liquidity management and communication strategies to guide market behavior. The central bank is navigating a complex global environment, including ongoing geopolitical tensions and fluctuating energy prices, which could impact Hungary’s economic outlook. A key challenge for any central bank is balancing the need to control inflation with the imperative to support economic activity. An overly tight Monetary Policy can stifle growth, while a too-loose approach can reignite inflation. The MNB’s decision to hold rates suggests confidence in the current trajectory of disinflation and a cautious approach to further easing, ensuring that past gains in price stability are not jeopardized. This strategic patience is crucial for building a foundation for robust economic performance in the years ahead. What Are the Prospects for Hungary’s Economic Stability Going Forward? The MNB’s decision is a significant factor in shaping Hungary’s future Economic Stability . A stable currency and predictable interest rate environment are fundamental for attracting foreign investment, encouraging domestic consumption, and supporting business expansion. However, Hungary’s economic stability also depends on several other factors: Fiscal Policy: The government’s budget management and spending priorities will play a crucial role alongside monetary policy. Global Economic Environment: The health of the global economy, particularly the Eurozone, directly impacts Hungary’s export-oriented sectors. Energy Prices: As an energy importer, Hungary remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy markets. Labor Market Dynamics: Wage growth and employment levels are key indicators of domestic demand and inflation pressures. While challenges persist, the MNB’s commitment to maintaining rate stability provides a strong signal of its dedication to a predictable economic future. This stability can bolster investor confidence, leading to increased capital inflows and fostering a more resilient economy. The current policy aims to create an environment where businesses can plan with greater certainty, and consumers can make spending decisions with more confidence, contributing to overall national prosperity. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses For investors, particularly those with exposure to emerging markets or an interest in the broader macroeconomic landscape affecting cryptocurrency, the MNB’s stable rate decision offers several insights: Monitor MNB Communications: Future statements from the central bank will provide clues about their forward guidance and potential shifts in policy. Assess Relative Yields: Compare Hungarian bond yields with those in other regions to understand the attractiveness of Forint-denominated assets. Diversify Portfolios: While stability is welcome, diversification across different asset classes and geographies remains a prudent strategy. Understand Inflation Trends: Keep an eye on Hungary’s inflation data; persistent high inflation could pressure the MNB to reconsider its stance. For businesses operating in or considering Hungary, the consistent interest rate environment can facilitate better financial planning and investment decisions. Stable borrowing costs reduce uncertainty, making it easier to project profitability and expand operations. This predictability can also make Hungary a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment. A Foundation for Future Growth The Hungarian National Bank’s decision to hold its base rate at 6.50% marks a significant moment in its journey towards achieving lasting price stability and fostering a robust economy. This move signals a confident, yet cautious, approach, allowing the effects of previous rate hikes to fully transmit through the economy while providing a stable anchor for the Hungarian Forint . It is a testament to the MNB’s commitment to steering the nation through complex economic waters, aiming for a future characterized by sustained growth and reduced inflationary pressures. As global markets continue to evolve, Hungary’s steady hand on its Monetary Policy provides a crucial foundation for its ongoing Economic Stability and resilience.

Bitcoin’s hidden supply is waking up again, and it could mean something big for what’s next. Verified CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. recently highlighted fresh signs in Bitcoin’s % Supply Active chart that could tell us where this market is headed next. So, what’s happening? Bitcoin Supply Sharply Increased CryptoQuant’s verified on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. says the share of Bitcoin’s active supply in the past 180 days is starting to rise. When this number goes up, it means coins that were sitting still for months or even years are now moving again. This usually points to more selling or holders spreading out their coins as prices go higher. This could mean the market is getting ready for an early wave of selling, which might help push Bitcoin’s next move past $120,000. The share of coins active over the last 180 days (% Supply Active) sharply increased twice in past macro cycles: first to 20 % when BTC climbed to $70,000 in spring 2024, and then in December 2024 to 18 % upon the first breach of the psychological $100,000 mark. This… pic.twitter.com/krgvTcoxvL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) July 23, 2025 Key Supply Activity Trends Looking back, we can see that big jumps in supply activity often went hand in hand with big price moves. For example, in spring 2024, Bitcoin climbed to about $70,000, and at the same time, supply activity rose to 20%, showing that many long-term holders were taking profits. A few months later, in December 2024, supply activity rose again to 18% when Bitcoin broke through the key $100,000 mark for the first time. Now, in June 2025, we see the same trend starting but with one big difference. Even though Bitcoin is steady around $100,000, the latest data shows supply activity has only gone up slightly, from negative levels to about +2.4% in the last 30 days. Compared to past cycles, this is still low, a sign that many holders are not yet ready to sell big chunks of their stash. Early Stages of Distribution Meanwhile, Adler points out that this small rise means we are likely still early in this market cycle. If Bitcoin holds strong and pushes above $120,000, the % Supply Active could slowly climb into the 8%–10% range first, then maybe back to the 18%–20% peaks seen in past big rallies. As of now, Bitcoin’s price is around $118,176 , slightly down in the last 24 hours.

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights?

Bonk price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.00003518 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 4.81 percent today. Technical indicators favor the buying side of the market, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000141, which is approximately 679% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its price decreased to $0.00003518. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent correction. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000021. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the start of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000141 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

This isn’t just market speculation; it’s a deep dive into the psychology of wealth and status in the digital age. Could these pixelated collectibles truly become the ultimate ‘flex’ for crypto millionaires? Why Arthur Hayes Sees CryptoPunks Dominating the Cycle Arthur Hayes’s core argument centers on the ‘digital status game.’ He believes that as Ethereum holders accumulate significant wealth, they’ll seek ways to display it. Historically, the wealthy invest in art and luxury. In Web3, Hayes posits that CryptoPunks serve this purpose. Key points from Hayes: Desire for Distinction: As ETH becomes common, wealthy holders seek more exclusive, visual assets. Digital Scarcity: Only 10,000 unique CryptoPunks exist, making them rare status symbols. The ‘Flex’ Factor: Owning a rare Punk publicly declares wealth and early crypto adoption. Hayes suggests this human need for status will drive capital from ETH into high-tier NFTs like CryptoPunks , leading to faster appreciation. Understanding the Allure of CryptoPunks: More Than Just JPEGs To understand Hayes’s prediction, recognize CryptoPunks ‘ unique position. Launched in 2017 by Larva Labs, they are OGs of the NFT space, representing a milestone in blockchain history and digital ownership. Their desirability stems from: Historical Significance: One of the first, most influential NFT projects. Fixed Supply: A strict 10,000 Punk limit ensures rarity. Recognizable Brand: Their pixelated aesthetic is instantly iconic. Community: Owning a Punk grants access to an exclusive, pioneering legacy. Few other collections match CryptoPunks ‘ blend of history, scarcity, and cultural cachet, making them potent digital status symbols. Ethereum’s Role in the NFT Ecosystem: A Foundation for CryptoPunks’ Success While Hayes predicts CryptoPunks will outperform ETH, Ethereum remains the vital foundation for the NFT ecosystem. It provides the robust, decentralized infrastructure for minting, trading, and verifying digital asset ownership. Ethereum’s crucial role: Smart Contracts: Enable secure NFT creation and transfer. Network Effect: Large user and developer base makes it the preferred NFT blockchain. Liquidity: ETH is the primary trading pair, ensuring seamless transactions. Without Ethereum’s strength, the digital status game built on NFTs like CryptoPunks would be far less compelling. ETH is the bedrock. Navigating the Challenges: Risks and Volatility in the CryptoPunks Market Despite the allure of CryptoPunks , understanding inherent risks and volatility is crucial. No investment in crypto is without challenges. Key considerations for potential investors: Market Liquidity: Selling high-value Punks quickly at desired prices can be difficult. Subjective Valuation: NFT value is largely subjective, driven by sentiment and perceived rarity. Bear Market Impact: NFTs often see significant corrections during broader crypto downturns. Security Risks: Owning NFTs demands careful private key and wallet management. Potential outperformance comes with substantial risk. Due diligence and strong risk management are paramount for CryptoPunks investments. Is Your Portfolio Ready for CryptoPunks? Actionable Insights If Arthur Hayes’s prediction has sparked interest in adding CryptoPunks to your portfolio, careful consideration is vital. This isn’t a buy recommendation, but a guide for informed decision-making. Actionable insights: Research Extensively: Understand CryptoPunks ‘ history, rarity, and market dynamics. Assess Risk Tolerance: NFTs are highly volatile; invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversify: A mix of cryptocurrencies and other assets is generally a sound strategy. Long-Term Vision: For status symbols, a long-term holding strategy might be suitable. Investing in high-value NFTs like CryptoPunks requires market understanding, risk awareness, and a clear investment thesis. The Digital Status Game: A New Era of Wealth Display Arthur Hayes’s ‘digital status game’ theory offers a fascinating view of the evolving crypto landscape. As individuals accumulate significant DeFi wealth, their natural inclination to display it will manifest in unique digital forms. Just as physical art signifies success, NFTs like CryptoPunks are emerging as the Web3 equivalent. This isn’t just about financial gain; it’s about belonging, recognition, and visual representation of one’s position in a rapidly expanding digital society. This cultural shift, driven by human psychology, could be a powerful catalyst for premier digital collectibles. Conclusion: Beyond the Hype – The Enduring Appeal of CryptoPunks Arthur Hayes’s bold prediction about CryptoPunks outperforming Ethereum invites us to consider deeper value drivers in the digital age. While Ethereum remains crypto’s backbone, the human desire for status may propel iconic NFTs like Punks to new heights. Their historical significance, scarcity, and cultural resonance uniquely position them as the ultimate digital flex. However, risks are inherent. As the crypto market matures, the interplay between foundational assets like ETH and culturally significant collectibles like CryptoPunks will shape future narratives. This conversation highlights human psychology’s profound impact on market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Arthur Hayes and why is his prediction significant? A1: Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder, is an influential crypto figure. His predictions are significant due to his deep market understanding and insights into human psychology in finance. Q2: What does Arthur Hayes mean by the ‘digital status game’? A2: It’s the idea that wealthy crypto holders will display prosperity via exclusive digital assets. CryptoPunks are seen as prime examples due to their scarcity and history. Q3: How can CryptoPunks outperform Ethereum if they run on Ethereum? A3: ‘Outperforming’ means their dollar value appreciation rate could exceed Ethereum’s. ETH provides infrastructure, but specific demand for scarce CryptoPunks can drive their individual prices faster. Q4: What are the main risks associated with investing in CryptoPunks ?

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030.

Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

As a result, LINK price has moved past the neckline of a rounded-bottom pattern at $18 and reached $20. For LINK to advance higher, it needs to maintain above $18. If successful, it could retest $24 in July or August. If LINK price fails to hold above $18, the next important support levels are $15 and $13. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) LINK Crypto Price Forecast July 2025 10 18 24 Chainlink Price Analysis 2025 (H1) In 2025, Chainlink price (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in April, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June onwards, the LINK price began to rise higher following the Bitcoin rally. Chainlink Price Forecast 2025 (H2) From the last week of June to July fourth week, it has surged nearly 80% by the fourth week of July. The entire July has optimistic due to several factors internal and external both. Even in July, the Sergey Nazarov mentioned on X that Chainlink standard is getting adopted across multiple financial ecosystems like Westpac and Imperium Markets. With the current bullish ongoing momentum this week, the LINK price has moved past the rounded-bottom pattern’s neckline at $18 in the fourth week of July and reached $20. However, the RSI has exhausted itself and hit 82, which is an overheated stage in overbought territory. The curve shows short-term caution, as it has retreated to 75 when writing with a slight halt in the LINK price rally. This price action suggests short-term caution, as LINK price may fall to $18 support and even consolidate at this level to cool off its exhaustion by entering the 60-65 range in RSI. For the LINK price to advance higher, it needs to sustain itself above $18. If it does, then LINK might retest $24 in July or August. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of even flipping the fixed range high-volume profile level based on the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32. On the contrary, if LINK fails to hold on to $18, then $15 will be important support, followed by $13 next support.

This is the second time the bulls tried to break above $0.52 in July. A third attempt may be successful if they keep up this pressure after this pullback.

Such was the case recently when news concerning British music icon Ozzy Osbourne sent shockwaves not just through the entertainment industry, but surprisingly, through the non-fungible token (NFT) market. Within hours of reports of his passing, the floor price of his unique digital collectibles, the CryptoBatz NFTs , experienced an incredible surge, captivating the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This sudden dramatic increase offers a fascinating glimpse into the complex interplay between real-world events, celebrity influence, and the speculative nature of the crypto space. The Unprecedented Surge of CryptoBatz NFTs: What Happened? The digital realm watched in awe as the value of CryptoBatz NFTs skyrocketed. According to reports from Cointelegraph, citing data from OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, the floor price of these digital bats briefly zoomed by over 400%. What began at less than 0.02 ETH quickly escalated to a peak of 0.08 ETH. This rapid appreciation underscored the immediate and powerful impact of the news on a specific niche within the broader NFT ecosystem. For context, the CryptoBatz collection was launched in December 2021, representing Ozzy Osbourne’s distinctive foray into the Web3 space. It comprises 9,666 unique, blockchain-dwelling bats, each with its own set of traits and rarity. The project quickly garnered attention due to its association with the ‘Prince of Darkness’ himself, known for his infamous bat-biting incident on stage, a moment that became a legendary part of rock and roll history. The NFTs were designed to offer a unique blend of digital art and a piece of cultural legacy, appealing to both crypto enthusiasts and Ozzy fans. Ozzy Osbourne’s Foray into Web3: The Genesis of CryptoBatz Ozzy Osbourne, a figure synonymous with rebellion and innovation in music, surprised many when he announced his venture into the NFT world. The CryptoBatz NFTs project was not merely a celebrity endorsement; it was conceptualized with unique utility in mind. Holders of these NFTs were granted access to a feature called ‘MutantBatz,’ allowing them to ‘bite’ and mutate other NFTs from their collection or even other popular collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club, creating a new, mutated NFT. This innovative approach aimed to foster a vibrant community and provide ongoing value beyond just digital ownership. The collection was designed to be a playful nod to Osbourne’s iconic moment, transforming a controversial act into a digital collectible. This creative concept, combined with the legendary status of Ozzy, positioned CryptoBatz as a distinctive player in the burgeoning NFT market of late 2021. The initial buzz around the project was significant, drawing in a diverse group of collectors, from seasoned NFT traders to fans looking for a unique way to connect with their idol. Why the Sudden Spike? Dissecting Market Dynamics Behind CryptoBatz NFTs The sudden and dramatic price surge of CryptoBatz NFTs can be attributed to a confluence of factors, primarily driven by market psychology and the unique circumstances surrounding the news. This phenomenon, often observed in traditional collectibles markets following the passing of a prominent figure, is now clearly manifesting in the digital realm. Scarcity and Finality: The immediate impact of news like this often creates a perception of increased scarcity. While the number of CryptoBatz NFTs remains fixed at 9,666, the ‘creator’s’ direct involvement or future influence on the project is perceived to have ended, potentially making existing pieces more valuable as unique artifacts. Emotional Value and Tribute: For fans, owning a piece of a beloved artist’s legacy takes on new emotional significance. The purchase of a CryptoBat NFT can become a form of tribute, driving demand from individuals who might not typically engage with NFTs but are motivated by sentiment. Speculative Buying (FOMO): The initial surge often triggers a ‘Fear Of Missing Out’ (FOMO) among opportunistic investors. Seeing rapid price appreciation, many rush to buy, hoping to capitalize on further gains, which in turn fuels the upward momentum. Media Attention: The news itself generated significant media coverage, not just in crypto circles but in mainstream news outlets. This increased visibility introduced CryptoBatz NFTs to a wider audience, many of whom might have been unaware of their existence previously, thereby expanding the potential buyer pool. The ‘Death Effect’ in Collectibles: Historically, the death of artists, musicians, or public figures has often led to a spike in the value of their works or associated memorabilia. This phenomenon is now extending to digital assets, highlighting how the lines between traditional collecting and NFTs are blurring. This rapid price action is a powerful reminder of how interconnected the digital and physical worlds have become, with real-world events having tangible, immediate consequences in decentralized markets. The Broader NFT Landscape: Celebrity Endorsements and Volatility The story of CryptoBatz NFTs is part of a larger narrative concerning celebrity involvement in the non-fungible token space. Over the past few years, numerous celebrities, from musicians and athletes to actors and influencers, have launched their own NFT collections or publicly endorsed existing ones. This trend has brought immense mainstream attention to NFTs, driving adoption and investment, but also highlighting the inherent volatility and risks. On one hand, celebrity endorsements can: Boost Visibility: Introduce NFTs to millions of fans who might not otherwise engage with blockchain technology. Build Community: Leverage existing fan bases to create strong, engaged communities around NFT projects. Legitimize the Space: Lend credibility and a sense of permanence to the nascent NFT market. However, the reliance on celebrity influence also comes with significant challenges: Pump-and-Dump Risks: Some projects can be susceptible to speculative buying fueled by hype, leading to rapid price increases followed by sharp declines once initial enthusiasm wanes. Sustainability Concerns: The long-term viability of celebrity-backed NFTs often depends on sustained engagement from the celebrity and the development of ongoing utility, which is not always guaranteed. Market Volatility: The NFT market itself is highly volatile, influenced by broader crypto trends, macroeconomic factors, and sudden shifts in sentiment, making investments inherently risky. The CryptoBatz surge underscores both the immense potential for value creation and the unpredictable nature of these digital assets, especially when tied to public figures. Navigating the Digital Collectibles Market: Insights for Investors For those considering venturing into the world of NFTs, or even those already deeply immersed, the CryptoBatz phenomenon offers valuable lessons. Investing in digital collectibles, whether they are CryptoBatz NFTs or other popular collections, requires careful consideration and a robust understanding of the underlying dynamics. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project thoroughly. Understand its roadmap, utility, team, and community. Don’t just follow the hype. Understand the ‘Why’: Is the project’s value purely speculative, or does it offer genuine utility, artistic merit, or a strong community? For celebrity NFTs, assess the long-term commitment of the celebrity. Assess Liquidity: Can you easily buy and sell the NFT? High volume and active trading indicate better liquidity. Be Aware of Market Sentiment: The NFT market is heavily influenced by sentiment. Sudden news, positive or negative, can cause dramatic price swings. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. NFTs are highly speculative assets, and their value can plummet as quickly as it rises. Diversification, even within your NFT portfolio, can help mitigate risks. Community Engagement: A strong, active, and positive community often indicates a healthier project with long-term potential. The unexpected surge of CryptoBatz NFTs serves as a powerful case study, demonstrating both the incredible upside potential and the inherent unpredictability that defines the digital collectibles space. Conclusion The dramatic 400% surge of CryptoBatz NFTs following the news regarding Ozzy Osbourne is a stark reminder of the unique and often emotional forces that drive value in the digital asset world. It highlights how real-world events, particularly those involving beloved public figures, can create immediate and significant ripples across blockchain-based markets. While such rapid appreciation can be thrilling for holders, it also underscores the speculative and volatile nature of NFTs. This event solidifies the idea that NFTs are more than just digital images; they are becoming deeply intertwined with culture, identity, and the human desire for connection and legacy. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these complex dynamics will be crucial for both collectors and investors navigating this fascinating frontier of digital ownership. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are CryptoBatz NFTs? CryptoBatz NFTs are a collection of 9,666 unique non-fungible tokens launched in December 2021 by British musician Ozzy Osbourne. They are blockchain-dwelling bat characters, designed as a playful homage to Osbourne’s infamous bat-biting incident. The project also introduced a unique ‘MutantBatz’ feature, allowing holders to ‘bite’ and mutate other NFTs. Why did CryptoBatz NFTs surge in value recently? The recent surge in CryptoBatz NFTs’ value was primarily triggered by news concerning Ozzy Osbourne’s passing. This type of event often creates a perception of increased scarcity and emotional value in collectibles markets, leading to speculative buying, increased media attention, and a ‘death effect’ similar to that seen in traditional art and memorabilia markets. Is it safe to invest in celebrity-backed NFTs like CryptoBatz? Investing in celebrity-backed NFTs, including CryptoBatz NFTs, carries significant risks. While celebrity involvement can boost visibility and community, these assets are highly speculative and subject to extreme volatility. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the project’s long-term utility, and only invest what you can afford to lose. What is the ‘death effect’ in collectibles? The ‘death effect’ refers to the phenomenon where the value of an artist’s or public figure’s works, memorabilia, or associated collectibles often increases significantly after their passing. This is driven by factors such as perceived scarcity, heightened emotional value, increased media attention, and a renewed interest in their legacy. This effect is now being observed in the NFT market as well. Where can I track the price of CryptoBatz NFTs? You can track the real-time floor price and trading volume of CryptoBatz NFTs on major NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea. These platforms provide detailed analytics and historical data for various NFT collections. Share Your Thoughts and This Article!

Can young coins like Pi Network’s PI coin ride Bitcoin’s momentum? Or will their destiny hinge on internal developments and network milestones? Let me start with an overview of the current stats. With the global crypto market capitalization hovering at ~$3.93 trillion, and trading volumes nearing $193.74 billion despite a 10.95% decline, sentiment remains elevated. The Fear & Greed Index currently reads 70, indicating investor greed. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index has risen to 56 out of 100, suggesting growing enthusiasm for non-Bitcoin assets. Where Does Pi Stand Today? Pi Coin is currently trading at $0.4631 after a daily decline of 4.69%, despite a 3.98% gain over the past week. Its market capitalization stands at $3.57 billion, while trading volume has dipped sharply to $118.49 million, down 37.73% over the past 24 hours. Over the last month, Pi has retreated by 9.18%, underlining that despite favorable macro conditions, Pi’s price movement may remain restrained without a clear fundamental catalyst from within the project itself. What Does BTC’s MVRV Ratio Have to Say? Bitcoin’s 365-day MVRV ratio currently stands at 23.4%. Historically, a ratio above 50% has often signaled overbought conditions, where investors tend to take profits. The current level, being in the moderate zone, suggests that Bitcoin still has room to climb and is not yet in euphoric territory. This offers a supportive backdrop for the thesis of BTC potentially targeting the $200,000 mark before the end of the cycle, particularly if macro tailwinds and institutional inflows persist. What About Pi Network’s On-Chain Health? For Pi, the most important metric to watch is the unlocked supply ratio. Out of ~7.4 billion tokens migrated to the mainnet, about 2.2 billion Pi are currently unlocked. This means that nearly 30% of the migrated supply is already liquid and subject to market forces. As more users complete KYC and unlock their holdings, and as Pi potentially lists on centralized exchanges, both upside potential and downside volatility could increase significantly. Bitcoin’s Surge: A Rising Tide for Altcoins? Historically, altcoins have benefited from Bitcoin bull runs, particularly when market sentiment becomes excessively optimistic and capital begins to rotate. The current Altcoin Season Index of 56 points to a rising interest in alternative assets. However, Pi Coin’s correlation to BTC remains conditional. Unlike most exchange-traded altcoins, Pi’s price trajectory will hinge more heavily on the success of its open mainnet launch, token unlock schedules. And especially listings on major exchanges. Without these developments, even a Bitcoin surge to $200K might result in only modest Pi price movement. What Could Move Pi Higher if BTC Hits $200k? Scenario Pi Coin Price Impact Main Catalysts BTC Rallies Only Modest uplift Market sentiment, liquidity rotation Pi Mainnet/Listing Strong rally possible Exchange access, higher volumes Both Happen Potential >$2.00 surge Mass adoption, full utility unlocked FAQs If Bitcoin hits $200,000, will Pi Coin automatically rally? No, not necessary, as Pi coin’s price gains depend more on mainnet upgrades and major exchange listings than just Bitcoin’s rally. What is the Pi coin price today? The price of 1 Pi at the time of press is $0.4631, with an intraday change of -4.69%. Are we in an ‘altcoin season’ now, and does it favor Pi? The Altcoin Season Index at 56/100 suggests growing altcoin momentum—providing tailwinds, but Pi’s upside is project-dependent.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 10:15:56

BNB has hit a new all-time high of $804, gaining over 14% in the past week ( check live ). Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) celebrated the milestone on X, and his comments are stirring up excitement about what could come next. With altcoins on the move and CZ hinting at an incoming “FOMO season,” investors are starting to take notice. Here’s what you need to know. CZ’s $76 Billion BNB Holdings CZ’s wealth is closely tied to BNB, and the numbers are staggering. According to Forbes , he owns around 64% of the token’s circulating supply, which is about 95 million BNB tokens. At current prices, that stash is worth roughly $76 billion. And that’s not even counting his equity in Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Bloomberg currently lists CZ’s net worth at $59.7 billion, making him the 26th richest person in the world. But here’s the catch: that number doesn’t include his crypto holdings, which are private and not publicly tracked. Bloomberg has given CZ the lowest confidence rating in terms of wealth estimation, meaning the real number could be much higher. With BNB’s price rising, his position in the crypto world is only getting stronger. Altcoin Momentum Builds: CZ Calls FOMO Season In another post on X , CZ pointed to the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index, which has now reached 54 out of 100. This index measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. A reading above 50 suggests that more money is flowing into altcoins. According to CZ, this shift signals that the rally is still in its early stages. He believes a full-blown “FOMO season” could be around the corner, where investor excitement rapidly pushes prices higher. Altcoins like BNB are already showing signs of leading this trend. Crypto Community Joins the Party The crypto community didn’t hold back as BNB crossed the $800 mark. On X, users praised CZ’s leadership and posted bullish price predictions. One user confidently said, “I’m super confident BNB is going to hit $5000,” reflecting the optimism floating through the market. I’m super confident BNB is going to hit $5000. I’m still holding because BNB never stops building and CZ is still riding with it. — Mr. WHALE (@MrWhaleREAL) July 23, 2025 What’s Fueling BNB’s Growth? BNB plays a central role in the Binance ecosystem. It offers trading fee discounts, powers the BNB Chain, and supports a growing list of decentralized applications and Web3 projects.

The company intends to issue an astounding $850 million in 0% convertible notes. This substantial capital raise is primarily earmarked for the acquisition of more Bitcoin (BTC), alongside repaying $50 million in existing notes and addressing general corporate purposes. This bold financial maneuver by MARA Holdings underscores a growing trend among crypto-native companies to fortify their balance sheets with the very digital asset they help create. Unpacking MARA Holdings ‘ Ambitious $850 Million Strategy The decision by MARA Holdings to issue $850 million in 0% convertible notes is a sophisticated financial play that deserves a closer look. But what exactly are convertible notes, and why are they being offered at a 0% interest rate? What are Convertible Notes? These are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a specified number of common shares of the issuing company at a predetermined price or a specified future date. Essentially, they start as debt but have the potential to become equity. The 0% Interest Rate Explained: The lack of interest payments makes these notes particularly attractive to the issuer ( MARA Holdings ). Investors are willing to accept 0% interest because the primary return comes from the potential appreciation of the company’s stock once the notes convert. If the stock price rises significantly, the conversion becomes very profitable. It also signals confidence from the company that its stock price is likely to increase, making conversion a desirable outcome for investors. Allocation of Funds: The $850 million raised by MARA Holdings isn’t just for Bitcoin. The allocation is strategic: A significant portion will go towards purchasing more Bitcoin, directly increasing the company’s BTC holdings. $50 million is allocated to repay existing notes, demonstrating financial prudence and debt management. The remainder is for general corporate purposes, providing flexibility for operational needs, expansion, or other strategic investments. This financial instrument allows MARA Holdings to raise substantial capital without immediate dilution of existing shares, while also betting on the future appreciation of both its stock and Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin? The Strategic Imperative for MARA Holdings For a company whose core business is Bitcoin mining, increasing its direct Bitcoin holdings might seem intuitive, but it’s a strategic decision with multiple layers of benefit. Why would MARA Holdings choose to deploy such a large sum into acquiring more BTC? Holding Bitcoin directly offers several compelling advantages for a mining company: Direct Exposure to Price Appreciation: By holding more BTC, MARA Holdings directly benefits from any increase in Bitcoin’s market price, amplifying potential returns beyond just the profits from mining operations. It transforms a portion of their treasury into a growth asset. Hedging Against Mining Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining can fluctuate significantly with changes in Bitcoin’s price, mining difficulty, and energy costs. A substantial BTC treasury can act as a hedge, providing a stable asset base during periods of lower mining profitability. Strengthening Balance Sheet: For a crypto-native company, a strong Bitcoin treasury can be viewed as a robust asset, signaling financial strength and long-term vision to investors who understand the digital asset space. It’s a strategic asset that aligns with their core mission. Operational Flexibility: A large Bitcoin reserve can provide liquidity for future investments, operational expenses, or even share buybacks, without needing to liquidate mining infrastructure or raise additional capital through traditional means. This move positions MARA Holdings not just as a miner, but as a significant holder and proponent of Bitcoin, intertwining its financial fate even more closely with the digital gold. Navigating the Nuances: Risks and Rewards for MARA Holdings and Investors While the strategy appears ambitious and potentially lucrative, it’s crucial to consider both the opportunities and the inherent risks involved for MARA Holdings and its investors. Potential Rewards: Enhanced Shareholder Value: If Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, and MARA Holdings ‘ stock performs well, the conversion of notes into equity could be highly profitable for noteholders, reflecting positively on the company’s overall valuation. Market Leadership: Increasing its Bitcoin treasury solidifies MARA Holdings ‘ position as a major player in the crypto mining and holding space, potentially attracting more institutional investment and market attention. Future Growth Capital: A stronger balance sheet with significant Bitcoin holdings can provide a foundation for future expansion, whether it’s investing in more efficient mining rigs, exploring new technologies, or even strategic acquisitions. Potential Risks: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The most obvious risk is Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility. A significant downturn in BTC’s value could negatively impact the value of MARA Holdings ‘ treasury and potentially deter noteholders from converting, leaving the company with a large debt obligation. Share Dilution: While not immediate, the eventual conversion of these notes into equity will dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. This is a trade-off for the capital raised without interest payments. Market Sentiment: While the news has been largely positive, a shift in broader market sentiment towards crypto or mining companies could impact the perceived value of MARA Holdings ‘ strategy. This move is a calculated risk, betting on the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin and the continued growth of the digital asset economy. The Broader Impact: How MARA Holdings ‘ Move Shapes the Crypto Landscape The actions of a major player like MARA Holdings don’t occur in a vacuum; they send signals throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This $850 million move could have several ripple effects: Precedent for Other Miners: Other publicly traded crypto mining companies might observe MARA Holdings ‘ strategy closely. If successful, it could encourage similar debt-to-Bitcoin acquisition models across the industry, leading to more miners accumulating larger BTC treasuries. Influence on Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics: While $850 million is a significant sum, its impact on Bitcoin’s overall supply and demand dynamics needs to be contextualized. However, a series of large corporate acquisitions could collectively tighten the available supply on exchanges, potentially exerting upward pressure on prices. Validation for Bitcoin as a Corporate Asset: When a major, publicly traded company like MARA Holdings makes such a substantial investment in Bitcoin, it further legitimizes BTC as a viable corporate treasury asset, potentially encouraging more traditional companies to consider similar allocations. Increased Institutional Interest: The sophisticated financing mechanism used by MARA Holdings , combined with a clear Bitcoin accumulation strategy, could attract more traditional institutional investors who are looking for exposure to the digital asset space through publicly traded companies. This strategy by MARA Holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a statement about the company’s long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value and its role in the evolving financial landscape. Expert Insights and Future Outlook for MARA Holdings Industry analysts and market observers are keenly watching how this strategy unfolds for MARA Holdings . The consensus generally leans towards viewing this as a bullish signal for both the company and the broader Bitcoin market, assuming a positive long-term outlook for BTC. The move highlights a strategic pivot for many mining companies from merely extracting Bitcoin to also actively managing and growing their Bitcoin holdings as a core asset. This dual strategy — mining and holding — could become the standard for successful players in the space. For MARA Holdings , it positions them as a leader willing to innovate in corporate finance to capitalize on digital asset opportunities. Looking ahead, the success of this strategy for MARA Holdings will largely depend on the sustained performance of Bitcoin and the company’s ability to manage its operations efficiently amidst changing market conditions. It sets a fascinating precedent for how crypto-native businesses can leverage diverse financial instruments to achieve their strategic goals. A Deep Dive into the Future of Digital Assets MARA Holdings ‘ audacious move to issue $850 million in 0% convertible notes to significantly boost its Bitcoin treasury is a testament to the growing maturity and innovative spirit within the cryptocurrency industry. This strategy not only provides the company with substantial capital for Bitcoin acquisition and debt repayment but also underscores a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role as a foundational asset. While presenting its own set of risks, particularly related to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and potential shareholder dilution, the benefits of enhanced balance sheet strength, direct exposure to BTC’s appreciation, and a strengthened market position are clear. As MARA Holdings navigates this ambitious path, its journey will undoubtedly serve as a significant case study for other crypto enterprises, shaping the future of corporate finance in the digital asset era. It’s a bold step that highlights the evolving strategies of crypto miners and their increasing integration into mainstream financial practices, all while staying true to their digital asset roots. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are 0% convertible notes and why did MARA Holdings issue them? A1: 0% convertible notes are debt instruments that pay no interest but can be converted into the issuing company’s stock at a predetermined price or date. MARA Holdings issued them to raise significant capital ($850 million) without incurring immediate interest expenses or shareholder dilution. Investors accept 0% interest for the potential profit from converting the notes into shares if the company’s stock price increases. Q2: How will MARA Holdings use the $850 million raised? A2: The funds will primarily be used to purchase more Bitcoin (BTC), significantly increasing MARA Holdings ‘ direct crypto holdings. A portion ($50 million) is also allocated to repay existing notes, and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes, providing operational flexibility. Q3: What are the main benefits for MARA Holdings in acquiring more Bitcoin? A3: Acquiring more Bitcoin offers several benefits, including direct exposure to BTC’s price appreciation, which can amplify returns; acting as a hedge against the volatility of mining profitability; strengthening the company’s balance sheet; and providing operational flexibility for future investments or expenses. Q4: What are the risks associated with this strategy for MARA Holdings? A4: The primary risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, which could negatively impact the value of MARA Holdings ‘ treasury. Additionally, the eventual conversion of these notes into equity will lead to dilution for existing shareholders, and overall market sentiment towards crypto could also affect the strategy’s success. Q5: How might this move by MARA Holdings impact the broader crypto market? A5: This significant investment by MARA Holdings could set a precedent for other crypto mining companies to adopt similar debt-to-Bitcoin acquisition models. It also further validates Bitcoin as a viable corporate treasury asset and could potentially increase institutional interest in publicly traded crypto companies, subtly influencing supply dynamics. Q6: What does this move signify for the future of crypto mining companies? A6: This strategy signifies an evolving trend where crypto mining companies are not just focused on extracting Bitcoin but also on actively managing and growing their Bitcoin holdings as a core asset. It positions MARA Holdings as a leader in innovative corporate finance within the digital asset space, potentially setting a new standard for the industry. Did you find this article insightful?

At this point, Bitcoin ETFs ended their 13-day entry streak yesterday and experienced an exit today. While strong inflows in Ethereum ETFs continued, the Solana ETF also recorded significant inflows. According to data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows of $68 million the previous day. This means Bitcoin has experienced a rally for the second consecutive trading day, according to Farside Investors. Bitwise's BITB fund and ARK Invest's ARKB fund saw net outflows of $42.3 million and $33.2 million, respectively. Grayscale's GBTC fund, in comparison, saw net inflows of $7.5 million. Other ETFs saw no net inflows. Ethereum Logins Continue! The previous day, US spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs recorded a net inflow of $533.8 million.

According to Farside Investors data, $12.6 million inflows were made into the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF the day before.

The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets approval follows a similar decision on the Grayscale Digital Large Cap fund. Similar to the Grayscale’s approval, the SEC has also ordered a stay on the conversion, which effectively pauses the listing of the index fund as an ETF until the stay is lifted. The accelerated approval from the Division of Trading and the stay order from the SEC assistant secretary Sherry Haywood came within a few hours of each other. Haywood’s letter stated: “This letter is to notify you that, pursuant to Rule 431 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.431, the Commission will review the delegated action. In accordance with Rule 431(e), the July 22, 2025 order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise.” Unsurprisingly, the stay has raised several eyebrows in the crypto and ETF space, with ETF Foundation President Nate Geraci describing it as a “bizarre situation.” In his opinion, the SEC should allow Grayscale and Bitwise to convert their multi-asset funds to ETFs immediately. Grayscale pushes back as speculation grows about SEC’s stay decision Meanwhile, the SEC decision has reignited discussions about why the regulator would not allow the firms to convert despite approving the conversion. There are speculations that one or more SEC commissioners might be responsible for the order. Finance lawyer Scott Johnsson noted that the fact that this is happening again with Bitwise suggests that some “funny business” might be going on. He explained his theories, stating: “Either (1) they again approved under delegated authority knowing Crenshaw would throw another wrench — perhaps so GDLC wasn’t penalized by the first wrench or (2) this (and GDLC) was planned by the Commission as an end-around the 240-day statutory period.” However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes the delay is likely so that the SEC can release its generic listing standards before finally approving the conversion. He predicted that all these should be finalized before the October deadline. Whatever the reason might be, Grayscale is not having it. Its attorneys have already written to the SEC, calling its order a violation of the timeline for approval. Under the law, the SEC has 240 days to approve or reject an ETF application, but Grayscale contended that the period had already lapsed. The firm has already threatened to file a petition to lift the stay in what appears to be an attempt to list on the market and enjoy first-mover advantage. It is uncertain whether Bitwise will adopt a similar move or simply wait. Interestingly, the final deadline for the SEC decision on the Bitwise application is not until next week, which means the approval was accelerated. Thus, it may have to wait a week before it can challenge the SEC for exceeding the deadline. More spot crypto ETFs are on the way Despite the stay, the SEC approval represents a major milestone, with many believing that it is a sign of what is to come for pending altcoin ETF applications. Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund has exposure to ten major cap assets. These include Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Ripple XRP, Avalanche AVAX, Chainlink LINK, Uniswap UNI, Cardano ADA, Bitcoin Cash BCH, and Polkadot DOT. The fund has been trading since 2017, but Bitwise filed for a conversion in November 2024. Although BTC and ETH account for more than 90% of the Bitwise index fund weighting, the existence of other altcoins and the SEC decision to approve the ETF conversion suggest that the regulator is getting ready to approve single-asset altcoin ETFs. Commentators believe the regulator could make final decisions on several spot crypto ETFs in the next few months. It is developing a generic listing standard per multiple reports to make the process easier.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez unveils to his 143,200 followers on the social media platform X his massive price target for the payments altcoin XRP after it broke out from a bullish continuation pattern. “XRP has broken out of a bullish flag, setting its sights on $15! Zoom out on the weekly chart and you’ll spot it.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $3.54. Next up, the trader has his eye on the native asset of the layer-1 protocol Cardano ( ADA ). Martinez shares a chart suggesting that ADA is now in an uptrend after breaking out from a double-bottom bullish reversal pattern. “For Cardano ADA, hitting $1 isn’t a question of if. It’s a matter of when!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.88. Martinez is also bullish on the top memecoin Dogecoin based on DOGE’s UTXO realized price distribution (URPD) metric. The URPD is an on-chain metric that tracks price levels where investors accumulated their coins, showing potential support or resistance zones. “Dogecoin DOGE has a lot of room to go up as the next major resistance barrier is $0.36!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that DOGE will have trouble soaring above $0.36 as a significant amount of coins are trapped at that level. DOGE investors who are underwater may take advantage of a price spike to get out of their positions with little to no loss. At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.263. Another coin on the trader’s radar is the native asset of the digital identity-focused project Worldcoin ( WLD ), which he thinks is gearing up for a breakout. “Worldcoin WLD is consolidating within a triangle pattern, eyeing a potential breakout to $3!” Source: Ali Martinez/X A triangle pattern suggests an asset is consolidating, and a move above the diagonal resistance tends to trigger an uptrend. At time of writing, WLD is trading at $1.31. The last coin on the trader’s list is Ondo ( ONDO ), a crypto project designed to bring real-world assets like US Treasuries on-chain. Martinez notes that ONDO is close to sparking a huge upside burst. “ONDO is pressing against a crucial resistance at $1.15. A confirmed breakout here could ignite a 70% rally!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ONDO is worth $1.08. Martinez’s bullish outlook on altcoins comes amid massive capital inflows into the crypto market. “Capital inflows into the crypto market have doubled in July, hitting $74.5 billion!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin: Rangeplay continues with MACD teasing bearish flip Bitcoin (BTC) hit a record high above $123,000 on July 14, before entering a period of consolidation. Prices have since been range-bound between resistance at $120,000 and support at $116,000, with bulls once again failing to establish a foothold above the former in the past 24 hours. This choppy trading, along with the flattening of the intraday moving averages and the daily MACD histogram hinting at a bearish shift, has increased the risk of a pullback. Still, the uptrend line from the June lows remains intact, keeping hopes alive for a bullish resolution that could lead to new record highs. AI's take: Bitcoin is showing weakening momentum as it consolidates below the $120,000 resistance, with the MACD histogram hinting at a potential bearish shift. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000, $115,739, $111,965. XRP: July bullish trend threatened Like BTC, XRP (XRP) has lacked clear directionality lately, trading choppy between $3.35 and $3.65. What has changed in the past 24 hours is that the trendline representing the price rise from $2.2 to record highs has been breached, strengthening the case for a bearish resolution of the recent range play. Further, the spread between Bollinger bands has widened to levels that presaged the December correction. Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the asset's 20-day simple moving average. In case the lower end of the recent range fails to hold, there would be a risk of an extended down move. AI's take: While the Bollinger Band spread at a multi-year high points to extreme volatility and a coming breather, the breach of the uptrend line warrants caution for bulls. Resistance: $3.65, $4 Support: $3.35, $3, $2.65. Ether: Consolidation likely as Bollinger Bands widen Ether's (ETH) sharp ascent from its June lows near $2,200 has paused this week, with prices pulling back to $3,600 from a high of $3,850. A short-term consolidation in a broad range looks likely, as the daily chart's Bollinger Bands have widened to their highest level since April-May 2021. This widening is a classic technical signal that the market has experienced a period of extreme volatility and strong directional movement, suggesting it may now be due for a period of ranging or a ""breather"" before its next major move. This view is supported by the 14-day relative strength index, which has topped in the so-called overbought or above-70 zone. AI's take: Ether's rally has pushed its RSI above 70 and widened its Bollinger bands to their highest level since 2021, both signaling an extremely overbought market. Resistance: $4,000, $4,109 , $4,382. Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879. SOL: Looks north Solana's SOL (SOL) has pulled back to under $200 as of writing. Still, the bull case remains intact, as suggested by the upward-sloping intraday and daily chart moving averages. The Bollinger Bands have widened to their highest level since the first quarter, ending a prolonged low-volatility coil to suggest bullish directionality. Additionally, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to move above the 200-day SMA in what's known as the bullish golden cross. All of this suggests that SOL could tap the upper end of the rising channel with a potential move to $215 and higher. AI's take : The price action is contained within a well-defined ascending channel, demonstrating that the rally from the April lows is a strong and consistent uptrend. The recent breakout to the upper half of this channel further reinforces the bullish momentum. Resistance : $218, $252-$264. Support : $187-$185, $163 (the 50-day SMA), $145.

Some companies that don't have a business that is related to stablecoins — tokens whose value is pegged to other assets such as fiat currencies — or digital assets have announced their intention to develop a stablecoin business. As a result, ""stock prices have risen, stock trading volume has increased, and the company's reputation has also been greatly improved,"" Yue said in the Wednesday post. ""With the recent hot speculation of the stablecoin concept, the market has become overly excited,"" he wrote. The financial regulator's cooling note come as it is set to start licensing stablecoin issuers from Aug. 1 after passing a stablecoin bill in May . While 40 firms are set to apply for the regime , the HKMA is likely to approve fewer than 10. ""In fact, we have made it clear earlier that at most only a few stablecoin licenses will be approved in the initial stage,"" Yue said. ""In other words, there are many disappointed people."" After the passage of the stablecoin bill, the regulator sought opinions on implementing its regulation and money laundering guidelines, something which it plans on publishing by the end of July, he added.

Arthur Hayes Thinks So",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-250000-ether-10000-by-year-end-arthur-hayes-thinks-so/,"Arthur Hayes has never been shy about big numbers, but his latest essay, Time Signature, frames those targets inside a sweeping macro thesis: a wartime‑style US credit boom that—if it unfolds as he expects—could send Bitcoin and crypto markets into their largest bubble yet. Writing on 22 July, the BitMEX co‑founder argues that financial markets, like dancers, must keep time with the “kick drum” of credit creation. “If we are out of time, we lose money,” he warns, before identifying the beat he believes traders must follow today: US wartime industrial policy, or what he bluntly calls a shift toward economic “fascism.” Hayes centres his argument on the Pentagon’s newly announced deal with MP Materials, under which the US Defense Department will become the miner’s largest shareholder, guarantee a floor price for critical rare‑earth elements at twice China’s current market rate, and back a $1 billion bank loan to build a Nevada processing plant. The structure, he writes, is the template for “QE 4 Poor People,” a credit‑multiplier that expands the money supply without formal Congressional approval. Related Reading: Trump Shares Viral Bitcoin Breakdown — Here’s What He Posted In his schematic example a single commercial‑bank loan to MP Materials “creates $1,000 of new fiat wampum,” then ripples outward as wages, deposits and discounted Treasury borrowing. “The money multiplier is > 1, and this wartime production leads to an increase in economic activity, which is accounted for as ‘growth,’” Hayes observes. The result, he says, is inevitable inflation, yet also “government‑guaranteed profits” for banks and industry. Why Bitcoin And Crypto Is The Bubble Of Choice Hayes’ historical analogy is China’s 1990s–2020s property boom, where a five‑thousand‑percent expansion of M2 forced households into apartments, inflating land values and local‑government coffers. In the United States, he contends, the socially acceptable pressure valve will be digital assets. Two policy shifts underpin that call. First, retirement plans—an $8.7 trillion pool—may now allocate to crypto under a recent executive order. Second, the Trump campaign’s floated proposal to eliminate capital‑gains tax on digital assets could, in Hayes’ words, provide “insane war‑driven credit growth” with “no fucking taxes.” The broader attraction for politicians, he claims, is demographic: younger and more diverse investors own crypto in greater proportions than they own equities, so a bull market would “create a broader, more diverse set of people who are pleased with the ruling party’s economic platform.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? Even a credit‑fuelled boom must find an audience for the mounting federal deficit. Hayes’ solution is the stablecoin sector, which already places most of its assets under custody in US Treasury bills. On-chain data, he notes, suggest that roughly nine cents of every new dollar in total crypto market value migrates into stablecoins. “Let’s assume that Trump propels the total crypto market cap to $100 trillion by 2028,” he writes; “that would create roughly $9 trillion in T‑bill purchasing power.” The mechanism recalls World War II financing, when the Treasury skewed issuance toward short‑term bills. In Hayes’ view, a self‑reinforcing loop emerges: wartime procurement fuels credit expansion, higher credit lifts crypto, larger crypto capitalization feeds stablecoin demand for T‑bills, and those purchases backstop further deficits. Trading Tactics—And The Year‑End Call Against that macro backdrop Hayes declares his investment vehicle, Maelstrom, “fully invested,” and explains why: “It’s pretty simple: Maelstrom is fully invested. Because we are degens, the shitcoin space offers amazing opportunities to outperform Bitcoin, the crypto reserve asset. Ether has been the most hated large-cap crypto. No more; the Western institutional investor class, whose chief cheerleader is Tom Lee, loves Ether. Buy first, ask questions later.” His numerical convictions are explicit: Bitcoin $250,000 and Ether $10,000 by 31 December 2025. The Western credit geyser is, he writes, “about to tear the market a new asshole.” Yet he repeatedly reminds readers that these are personal views, not investment advice.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed up to 1.2% on Wednesday, surpassing its previous YTD peak reached on March 18. Shares of Meituan and Tencent Holdings Ltd . led the rally among the gauge’s largest components. Across the board, the Hang Seng Index rose by 1%. This surge in Chinese stocks builds on a swift recovery from the upheaval in April, when U.S. tariff threats from President Donald Trump rattled markets. Treasury’s Scott Bessent will be meeting Chinese counterparts next week in Stockholm for a third round of talks to extend the current tariff pause and broaden discussions. Traders are also eyeing China’s Politburo due later in July, hoping to see signals on economic policy for the second part of 2025. Recent steps by Beijing to rein in steep price cuts and curb surplus capacity in some industries have been met with approval, as many view them as critical to battling deflationary pressures. Year‑to‑date, the Hang Seng China gauge has climbed 26%, outpacing a 7% gain in the S&P 500 and a 15% rise in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The HSCEI trades at roughly ten times estimated forward earnings, compared with almost 15 times for its Asian counterpart. On mainland China, the CSI 300 Index has added about 5% over the same period. EU report blames China for currency manipulation European firms, meanwhile, are feeling strain from what a German Economic Institute study describes as currency manipulation by Beijing to keep the yuan weak. The report , written by Juergen Matthes of the Institute for the World Economy in Cologne, comes ahead of an EU summit in China where leaders plan to tackle ongoing trade disputes. Matthes points out that the euro-yuan rate has stayed largely unchanged in recent years, even though production costs in Europe have surged compared with China’s. “That suggests likely intervention by the central bank,” he said. In past exchanges over such claims, China has insisted it follows a managed float system guided by market demand and supply. The study notes that European exporters face a double hit: a flood of Chinese goods redirected from the U.S. market and a stronger euro against the USD thanks to America’s trade policy. Since 2020, producer prices have jumped in Germany and across the euro area because of supply‑chain strains and a crisis in the energy markets, while Chinese prices have barely moved. Despite these shifts, the yuan has held steady, resulting in a real euro appreciation of more than 40% against the renminbi between the start of 2020 and spring 2025. That mismatch has deepened the euro zone’s trade deficit with China, the report finds. Trump also labeled China a currency manipulator in the past Under normal market forces, higher imports from Europe would lift the yuan by pushing up demand, but that did not happen, Matthes said. During his first term, President Trump said that China manipulates its currency. The U.S. Treasury removed that tag in January 2020 when Chinese officials came to Washington for a trade pact. Last month, Washington issued a warning saying China stood out “in its lack of transparency around its exchange rate policies and practices.” Beijing, in response, said it would not resort to “competitive currency devaluation.” Yet Matthes argues the central bank’s approach remains “highly non‑transparent.” Although Beijing allows the yuan to move in a narrow range and refers to a currency basket, “how this is done, exactly, no one outside China knows,” he said, adding that the euro has become “collateral damage.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Economy|CNY|EUR|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-23 12:00:51

According to data on Arkham Intel , the platform added 3,473 Ethereum ( ETH ) to several wallets on Tuesday, July 22, which was then staked on the decentralized staking protocol Aave . With the average ETH price of $3,743 at the time of buying, the purchase amounts to nearly $13 million. Right now, WLFI holds a total of 73,616 ETH, valued at over $275 million. WLFI’s crypto moves.

Institutional demand is also picking up, as improved regulatory clarity in the U.S. is creating a more favorable trading environment. President Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act into law, a bipartisan measure establishing a federal framework for digital assets and stablecoins. Capitalizing on the momentum, SharpLink Gaming alone bought 79,949 ETH between July 14 and July 20 at an average price of $3,238, bringing its total holdings to 360,807 ETH. The acquisition was funded through a $96.6 million equity program, making SharpLink the largest corporate holder of Ethereum to date. The appeal is also reflected in exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) performance. Indeed, ETH has even outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the past month, rising 63.78% compared to “digital gold’s” 17.12% gain. Given the strategic treasury adoption and surging ETF inflows, analysts are expecting a lot from Ethereum. Sean Dawson, for example, Head of Research at Derive, projected in a talk with Decrypt that the cryptocurrency could hit $8,000 by the end of the year.

After consolidating in the $1.20–$1.27 zone for the past week, WLD is riding the wave of a broader altcoin market recovery—gaining over 20% in the past seven days. Bolstered by high trading volumes, favorable technical signals, and increasing adoption of its World ID ecosystem, the WLD price appears to be primed for a significant move. Now that the Worldcoin price is undergoing a correction, the question arises whether it will be restrained from reaching $2. Price Structure Tightens as Bulls Defend Support Worldcoin is currently trading at $1.27, well above the $1.20 support that has held firm over the past week. Price action is tightening below the 0.236 FIB levels at $1.435, a continuation pattern that often resolves upward if the levels are secured. Momentum indicators are aligning: RSI sits near 65 after plunging from 80, pointing towards a correction. 200-MA is offering a strong base and hence the pullback could be reversed if the price continues to drop Volume is rising, signaling strong accumulation and also an increase in the volatility. If bulls can sustain a close above $1.28, the door opens to a quick rally toward $1.50. Beyond that, the next key zone sits around $1.70, a level not seen since early May. However, if $1.20 breaks, downside risks include a drop to $1.05. WLD Riding Wave of Altcoin Rotation and On-Chain Demand This move isn’t happening in isolation. WLD is benefiting from a broader altcoin resurgence, with capital rotating out of Bitcoin and into high-potential Layer-1 and identity-based tokens. More importantly, Worldcoin’s fundamentals are catching up with its hype. The expansion of Orbs (biometric identity scanners) to over 46 countries is driving adoption of the World ID protocol. Strategic partnerships—with brands like Tinder (Match Group) and Story Protocol—add utility and relevance. WLD token usage may spike as World ID becomes more integrated into real-world apps, potentially increasing demand. Altogether, this growing use case backs the price action, adding fuel to the technical breakout setup. Beyond project-level factors, macro sentiment is turning supportive. With expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut in September, liquidity may start to return to risk-on markets—including crypto. At the same time, recent U.S. regulatory developments, like the GENIUS Act, are reinforcing investor confidence in compliant crypto projects. Moreover, as the capital flows back into altcoins, technically backed, utility-driven tokens like Worldcoin (WLD) are expected to benefit the most.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|WLD|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 12:03:23

(BMNR). ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, bought the BitMine shares for $182 million, aiming to accumulate Ethereum (ETH) as a core corporate treasury asset. ARK Invest Purchases a Share in BitMine Immersion Cathie Wood, also known as “Money Tree Sister,” purchased a massive share of BitMine Immersion, a large-scale Ethereum (ETH) reserve company. Wood’s purchase will push the BMNR Ethereum (ETH) treasury and its potential for long-term growth. BitMine currently holds over $1 billion in ETH after a recent $500 million purchase and aims to expand it further. BitMine, once a pure player in Bitcoin, has now shifted its landscape under the new leadership of Tom Lee. The company now focuses on creating a treasury-centric approach focused on Ethereum, abandoning its traditional mining model. Why Did BitMine Sell Its Share to ARK? BitMine Immersion aspires to build one of the largest ETH treasuries while continuing its mining and advisory businesses, which requires strong capital power. So, the sale made by BMNR aims to support BitMine’s public plan to become a dominant ETH holder by using the net proceeds of $177 million share sale. The company is aiming to expand its acquisition to up to 5% of the total Ethereum supply, worth at least 6 million Ethereum. The move aligns with larger global trends to expand cryptocurrencies as a long-term reserve. ARK Invest Abandons Its Old Acquisitions As ARK bought shares in Bitmine, Wood simultaneously sold 218,986 Coinbase shares (approx. worth $90 million) across three ETFs. Additionally, it also reduced its holdings in Robinhood, Roblox, and Block Inc., shifting towards crypto-centric investment with BitMine. While expanding its own crypto exposures, ARK is also pushing BitMine to build its ETH treasuries. Many industry experts are calling the move the “Peter Thiel effect” — entering the wave of Ethereum-related projects by following the global trends. While cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in 2025, and most of the industry inventors have experienced great advantages, Wood’s investment is likely to encounter the same.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION|TREASURY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 12:04:31

48789985,https://timestabloid.com/?p=75289,1753272354,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Shares Clear Message about XRP Price Potential,https://timestabloid.com/expert-shares-clear-message-about-xrp-price-potential/,"In a market where speculation often drives the narrative, one analyst is challenging widely accepted methods of price forecasting. UnknownDLT, a crypto pundit and XRP advocate, shared a firm stance on the limitations of technical analysis (TA) when applied to XRP within a future utility-driven financial ecosystem. In his view, the idea of selling XRP at $10–20 based on charting tools tied to Bitcoin cycles is misguided. Instead, he argues that the market is shifting toward a system defined by real-world use , not speculative trading patterns. People, I want to be clear once and for all. There is no TA capable of estimating the price of XRP in a utility market. They tell you to sell XRP at $10-20 because of the Bitcoin speculative bullrun. The reality is that we are entering a new financial system that will last 70y — {x} (@unknowDLT) July 22, 2025 Beyond Speculation and Cyclical Models The post states that the crypto market is on the verge of a foundational transformation. According to UnknownDLT, XRP is not simply riding the coattails of Bitcoin in a speculative bull run; it was built to address Bitcoin’s flaws , and is being positioned within a new financial structure that could last for decades. He claims that traditional tools like TA are ill-equipped to capture this kind of transition, emphasizing that “there is no TA capable of estimating the price of XRP in a utility market.” This view resonated with some community members who believe that XRP’s potential value lies beyond the visible scope of typical market cycles. One response highlighted that charting systems have proven effective when assets go parabolic, and that technical analysis itself isn’t inherently flawed. Instead, what most traders lack is the right mix of perspective, optimism, understanding of fundamentals, and imagination. A Utility Market in Unfamiliar Territory Another commenter reinforced the core of UnknownDLT’s argument, describing the utility market as part of an emerging industry that is only just beginning to define itself. He pointed out that institutional and governmental incentives are now aligned to promote this sector’s expansion, setting the stage for a “super super-cycle.” Traditional technical analysis is built on the assumption that historical data and certain price movements can inform future prices. Analysts often share bullish predictions , taking XRP’s utility and market position into account. However, one user pointed out that demand driven by utility has no established pattern to model from, making accurate forecasting nearly impossible without clearer inputs. XRP, the Asset Outside the Traditional Playbook The conversation reflects a growing shift in how some XRP advocates perceive value. Rather than seeing the asset as part of another speculative rally, they argue it is embedded in the foundation of a redesigned financial system with a multi-decade lifespan. XRP is already growing beyond speculation . Whoever predicts its price using only short-term trading patterns may miss the bigger rally.

Over the past 30 days, the token gained over 70%, since geopolitical tension eased with the ceasefire announced between the US, Israel, and Iran. The advancement in Worldcoin price is clearly indicative of renewed confidence in the biometric identity vision project. This is happening as its adoption is growing and technical metrics support bullish sentiment. Rising Open Interest Reflects Institutional Optimism in WLD Price One of the key drivers behind the recent bullish trend is the surge in derivatives market activity in the entire month of July 2025. According to on-chain analytics by the Santiment platform, the total Open Interest (OI) for Worldcoin more than doubled from around $75 million in late June to over $203 million by the fourth week of July. This surge suggests that traders and institutions are increasingly positioning themselves for upside, with many entering long positions on the expectation of a sustained rally. Further reinforcing this trend, the token’s funding rates remained positive throughout July, consistently holding at 0.01%, when writing. A positive funding rate is a clear sign that bulls are paying a premium to maintain leverage on long positions. It is showing conviction in WLD price growth. On-Chain Activity and Whale Accumulation Drive Momentum Beyond market structure, the WLD price is benefiting from heightened network activity and whale interest. Active addresses both on a 24-hour and 7-day basis have been observed with consistent growth, reflecting increasing user engagement. This surge aligns with Worldcoin’s expanding user base, which now boasts nearly 14 million verified accounts out of 30 million signups . This is signaling that the project’s utility is catching up. Most notably, the supply distribution on Santiment charts reveals a large holders spike, which hints at a whale accumulation trend. This was sighted when a metric showing “addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million WLD” significantly increased their holdings, particularly around July 21. Meanwhile, retail investors have also joined the rally, with widespread FOMO-driven purchases accelerating since Q2 2025 WLD Price Forecasts Suggest Targets Up to $4 Recent ecosystem developments have added further fuel to WLD price growth. In Q2, it had a $135 million token market buy by leading venture capital firms, and it holds strong backing from VCs like a16z and Bain , also reaffirms institutional belief in Worldcoin’s long-term potential. Also, in Q2, Collaborations with Razer and Match Group enhanced WLD’s utility and adoption. That’s the reason for the ongoing optimism, as a result, the WLD price is following an upward trendline since Q2, and the recent rally briefly surged above $1.35 in the past 24 hours, and when writing, it is exchanging hands at $1.28 with $2.27 billion market cap. Now, should momentum persist, analysts are eyeing the WLD price to test $2 in the short term and may revisit the December 2024’s high at around $4 should all the catalysts line up. As the WLD price holds above the $1 level with strong on-chain support, it remains a closely watched token in the broader crypto landscape.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|WLD|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 12:09:40

Open interest hits $2.95M, up 47%, showing vigorous trader activity following a technical breakout. RSI near 67 and Supertrend support at $0.00000126 confirm MOG remains in bullish territory. Breakout From Key Pattern Draws Attention MOG Coin has moved above a long-term resistance level after forming a cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart. The breakout took place just above $0.00000148. The price is now hovering near $0.00000167. Notably, the handle formed over several weeks before breaking to the upside. This is a structure often seen before strong moves. Analyst Ali Martinez shared that the pattern could lead to a move toward $0.00000585, which would be a 250% gain from current levels. MOG Coin $MOG has broken out of a cup and handle pattern, pointing to a target of $0.0000058523. That’s a potential 250% move from here. Still looks early! pic.twitter.com/A66Awa6HWg — Ali (@ali_charts) July 23, 2025 Using Fibonacci tools, several possible targets come into view. The 1.272 level is near $0.00000238. The 1.414 and 1.618 levels point to $0.00000305 and $0.00000346. If the move continues, the 1.786 extension, around $0.00000585, may become relevant. These zones offer possible points where the price might slow down or stall. Holding above the neckline is key to keeping the current setup valid. Derivatives Market Sees Heavy Activity Open interest for MOG Coin futures has jumped to $2.95 million, up over 47% in the last 24 hours. This is the highest level on record, based on Coinglass data. Trading volume also increased by 73%, now sitting at $20 million. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, this rise in both metrics shows growing interest from traders. Much of this increase came after the price broke out of its handle pattern. When open interest rises with the price, it often points to strong positioning behind a move. Indicators Still Show Strength MOG’s daily chart shows bullish signs. The Supertrend flipped to green near $0.00000126 and remains below the current price. This trend marker now acts as support. Source: TradingView RSI is just below 70, sitting at 67.29. It shows the asset is gaining strength but has not yet entered an extreme zone. As long as the price holds above $0.00000126, the trend remains in place.

Ethereum ETFs Surge as Bitcoin ETFs Cool Off,https://cryptopotato.com/capital-shift-ethereum-etfs-surge-as-bitcoin-etfs-cool-off/,"While the 12-day inflow streak for spot Bitcoin ETFs ended, the same cannot be said for their Ethereum counterparts. In fact, spot Ethereum ETFs have extended their 12-day inflow streak. On July 21 alone, spot BTC ETFs saw $131 million in outflows. This represented the first net withdrawals during this rally toward Bitcoin’s all-time high, while spot ETH ETFs recorded $297 million in inflows. Divergence in ETF Flows CryptoRank stated that the divergence could simply reflect institutional investors taking profits after Bitcoin’s 10% gain in July and over 25% rise year-to-date, which is a logical rebalancing after a strong run. Spot Bitcoin ETF 12-day inflow streak ended. Spot Ethereum ETF 12-day inflow streak continues. On July 21, the market saw $131M in outflows from $BTC Spot ETFs and $297M in inflows into $ETH Spot ETFs. Is this the beginning of a market shift? pic.twitter.com/2EE8E8KBh4 — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 22, 2025 Another factor could be capital rotation, with BTC’s growth pausing at ATH levels and investors seeking alternative large-cap opportunities like Ethereum. ETH ETFs continue to attract capital, with record inflows of $726 million on July 16 and $297 million on July 21, which pushed cumulative new inflows to $7.78 billion. Additionally, ETH has surpassed BTC in terms of daily derivatives volume over the past week as well, which reflects strong trading activity. Ethereum appears to be benefiting from capital rotation , ETF-driven FOMO, and a potential altseason, with the altseason index near 60, its highest in months. While these signs reflect a potential pivot in investor sentiment, CryptoRank noted there is nothing bearish in BTC’s current outflows. The analytics firm views them as standard rebalancing rather than a sign of weakening fundamentals. Overall, the continuation of ETH ETF inflows amid Bitcoin’s pause could mark the beginning of a market rotation toward Ether and large-cap alts. Near-Term Pullback Concerns However, as Ethereum continues to attract institutional flows, some investors are questioning if its recent momentum could lead to a near-term pullback. Despite the concerns, analysts note the current market is far from overheating. Compared to the futures market peaks in March and November 2024, Ethereum’s present positioning appears modest, which means that any pullback would likely be shallow and brief. Throughout this cycle, the altcoin’s price action has remained sluggish despite an ongoing uptrend. It even dipped into undervalued territory before clearly bottoming out. This positions Ethereum for further upside potential in the second half of 2025. As such, Ethereum’s continued climb could set the stage for altcoins to surge, a pattern that typically signals the arrival of altseason. The post Capital Shift?

Thanks to the recent inflow of liquidity in crypto markets, analysts and crypto experts are offering fresh insights into market trends and likely winners in this cycle. Pepe Coin and the Race to $100 Billion Market Cap Pepe Coin, the crypto industry’s largest frog-based meme coin, is one of the altcoins analysts are touting as a serious contender for the top crypto to buy now in the market. Analysts have made several bold predictions about the meme coin, including a bold Pepe price prediction of up to $20 and a rally to hit a $100 billion market cap by the end of the ongoing cycle. If previous cycles are to be taken into context, it becomes undeniably clear that this “impossible feat” is most definitely possible for Pepe Coin. At the height of the meme coin rally last year, Pepe Coin hit an all-time high market cap of $11 billion, an impressive feat considering most of the attention and liquidity during that cycle were on meme coins based on Solana and Base. With mindshare and capital more evenly distributed during this cycle, analysts believe Pepe Coin could experience a surge in both price and market cap. According to many analysts, the Pepe price prediction could reach anywhere between $10 and $20 by the end of the cycle. Remittix Introduces a New Era in Payment Solutions and Remittances Another altcoin making the rounds in crypto news rooms is Remittix, an upcoming PayFi giant currently on presale with a very lucrative offer that many analysts believe could spark newfound interest in the coin. Token owners now stand the chance to win from a prize pool of $250,000 during the token’s ongoing giveaway program. Aside from that, the interest in Remittix appears to be sparked by strong fundamentals and use cases within the payments section. With features such as: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 20 countries worldwide, Over $16.8 million raised by community members 50% token bonus for early token holders Ownership of the Remittix token seems a no-brainer in current market conditions. When you combine this with the fact that Remittix is on course to transform the payments industry worth $19 trillion, it’s easy to see why many analysts and crypto enthusiasts have begun to refer to the token as an “XRP 2.0.” Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250K Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway",Press Release,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|PEPE|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 12:15:28

Eli Regalado, a self-proclaimed pastor in Denver, and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, are accused of using “faith in God” to defraud investors through the promotion and sale of a digital token called INDXcoin. The indictment was handed down on Tuesday, including 40 criminal counts against the couple. Denver District Attorney John Walsh said the two are being sued for breach of trust, because the alleged fraud involved the manipulation of religious faith and language to entice victims. “These charges show our work to hold the Regalados accountable for their alleged crimes and to bring a measure of justice to the victims,” Walsh said in a statement. 40 criminal counts for fraudulent faith investments Between January 2022 and July 2023, the Regalados raised approximately $3.4 million from more than 300 investors, many of whom were members of their Christian community. Excerpts from the Relegados indictment. Source: denverda.org They promoted INDXcoin through their online ministry and associated platforms, where Eli Regalado reportedly told investors that “God told him” to promote the token sold via a platform called Kingdom Wealth Exchange. The couple claimed the crypto would bring substantial returns, is less volatile and risky than other digital assets. According to the INDXcoin whitepaper, the token was “insulated” from the hazards of crypto trading. The Denver pastor and his wife insisted INDX was not a “pump and dump” scheme, and asserted that its value was backed by the momentum of the crypto market. According to redacted court documents seen by Cryptopolitan, the couple exaggerated the potential of INDXcoin, stating it could become a top-ten cryptocurrency and a stable store of value, competing with stablecoins and providing higher returns. Prosecutors say these promises were deceptive and unsupported. The token, according to authorities, “maintained zero value,” causing complete losses for the hundreds who invested. Investigators found that little of the funds raised were actually used to support or develop the token, and the Regalados allegedly diverted at least $1.3 million toward personal expenses. These include luxury retail purchases, credit card bills, cosmetic and medical procedures, airline tickets, and home renovations. The indictment also notes they used investor funds to pay for food, auto-related bills, au pair services, manicures, and other non-business costs. Eli Regalado allegedly told followers that “the Lord” had instructed him to renovate their home.. Enterprises and RICO allegations The court documents also revealed several entities tied to the Regalados’ faith crypto fraud , including INDXCOIN INC., INDXCOIN LLC, Grace Led Marketers, Kingdom Wealth Exchange companies, along with Victorious Grace Church. “Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado owned or controlled Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing, Victorious Grace Church, INDXcoin/INDXcoin LLC, Kingdom Wealth Exchange LLC/Kingdom Wealth Exchange. Only Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing and Victorious Grace Church were registered with the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office to conduct business within the State of Colorado,” the prosecution wrote. The organizations were allegedly used to build credibility among the couple’s followers while creating a financial structure to conceal their fraudulent activities. At the time of the alleged scheme, Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were operating INDXcoin, LLC out of a residence located at 2355 South Eudora Street in Denver, Colorado. Even though the company was functioning from that address, INDXcoin, LLC was never registered to legally conduct business in the state, according to the indictment. Both Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were charged under Colorado’s organized crime laws for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity while participating in the operation of these enterprises. The first count of the indictment cites violations of Sections 18-17-104(3) and 18-17-105 of the Colorado Revised Statutes, which deal with racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations (RICO) offenses.

That said, the market is up today, with the large majority of the top 100 coins per market capitalization increasing in this period. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $222 billion, maintaining similar levels for days now. TLDR: Crypto market cap holds at $4 trillion; Majority of top 100 coins have increased in 24 hours; BTC and ETH are largely unchanged, trading at $118,487 and $3,695; Market sentiment rises within the greed zone; US ETH spot ETFs celebrates its 1y anniversary with 13 days of positive flows and 3d highest inflows; US BTC spot ETFs saw outflows for the 2nd day in a row; In 2025, the price of BTC could go down to $70,000 or up to $160,000; ’Bitcoin’s collapsing volatility isn’t just a blip, it’s structural’. Crypto Winners & Losers Over the past 24 hours, of the top 10 coins per market cap, three are red and five are green (not taking the two stablecoins into account). Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 0.4% in a day, meaning it’s largely unchanged. The current price is $118,487. The price is back above the $118,000 level. Then, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 0.1%, meaning that it too is currently unchanged. It’s now trading at $3,695. The price is still moving towards the $4,000 mark. Binance Coin (BNB) is the highest gainer in this category. It’s up 4.6% to $794. Notably, it hit its latest ATH of $801 just hours ago. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped the most: 1.2%, now trading at $0.2618. The other coins in this category saw a change of less than 1% each. In the top 100 coins category, two coins recorded double-digit increases, and both above 20%. Flare (FLR) is up 23.4% to the price of $0.02592, while Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) rose by 21.6%, now changing hands at $0.04466. Others appreciated by up to 9.8% per coin. Also, around a dozen coins are red. The highest decrease is 5.4% by Jupiter (JUP) , trading at $0.6153. The rally has regained its momentum after a brief and expected pullback. For now, analysts expect it to continue on the same or similar note. Meanwhile, the US-based financial services corporation PNC Bank said it would add Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform, enabling customers to buy, hold, and sell crypto. “Traditional finance is slowly waking up to crypto’s call and is vying for a piece of the pie,” Gadi Chait, Xapo Bank’s Investment Manager, told Cryptonews .

Now, turning my attention back to @krakenfx . https://t.co/LbaDxN0bCl — Jesse Powell (@jespow) July 22, 2025 ‘Bitcoin’s Collapsing Volatility Isn’t Just a Blip, It’s Structural’ According to Zondacrypto’s CEO Przemysław Kral, following BTC’s recent price surge, we’ve seen a period of “relative stability that is healthy for the market.” This period allows investors to digest gains and prevents speculative overheating, he says. Also, it “can set a foundation for further, sustainable growth.” “This year, the price of Bitcoin could go down to $70,000 or up to $160,000. This will largely come down to the level of adoption in H2.” Moreover, there is “a calm confidence” in BTC’s long-term value now, Kral says, but there’s also “fevered interest” in altcoins. In particular, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have seen significant increases over the past week. Moreover, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , commented that despite trading at all-time highs, Bitcoin’s implied volatility has collapsed to its lowest level in almost two years. 30-day at-the-money implied volatility for ETH (blue) and BTC (orange) Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Also, Ethereum’s implied volatility “remains sticky and elevated.” This has resulted in the “widest divergence” in BTC vs ETH volatility seen in years. Time series of the difference between ETH and BTC ATM volatility for the 30-day tenor between 1 January 2024 and mid-July 2025 Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata There are a few key factors why Bitcoin is becoming less volatile and Ethereum remains significantly more reactive. One is institutional participation. BTC adoption through ETFs is now some 10 times deeper than ETH’s, with $154 billion held in BTC ETFs compared to $15.3 billion for ETH. “Institutional footprint in Bitcoin helps dampen volatility. More passive, long-term holders and less speculative trading lead to smoother price action,” Dawson says. Another factor is that Ethereum is still very yield-driven, he argues. Furthermore, BTC also “has a unique suppressor in Strategy.” It has bought more than 226,000 BTC using convertible bonds. “These convertibles give institutions leveraged upside exposure to BTC without needing to bid up the crypto options market directly,” Dawson explains. “At the same time, many of these investors hedge their exposure using futures and MSTR equity, which introduces mechanical hedging flows that further stabilize Bitcoin’s price. There’s currently no ETH equivalent to this.” Dawson continues: “All of this suggests that Bitcoin’s collapsing volatility isn’t just a blip, it’s structural. It’s the result of growing institutional involvement, passive ETF inflows, and sophisticated hedging flows. Ethereum, in contrast, remains speculative, yield-focused, and structurally levered, and that keeps volatility elevated. But in crypto, nothing stays still for long. We could see that structure shift quickly.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $118,487. This is an increase from the intraday low of $117,697. The highest price reached over the past 24 hours is $120,122. This is significant, as it’s likely that BTC will continue its efforts to retake the $120,000 level. Should it manage to do so and hold it, we could see further growth in the next few days. On the other hand, market watchers are observing its moves downward and whether it will revisit the $117,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart.

It now remains to be seen if the price will retake and hold the $3,700 mark, or will it pull back to $3,625. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment keeps moving slightly up and down within greed territory, between 68 and 71. It stands at 70 today , up from 68 yesterday. While this may indicate a correction, so far, there are no major indications of overbought conditions. The sentiment remains overall positive, but not extremely so.

Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has rallied again over the past 24 hours, while the stock market closed with a mixed performance on Tuesday, following a mixed Monday. The S&P 500 is up by 0.064%, the Nasdaq-100 is down by 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.4%. Market participants are now anticipating further tariff-related developments. This was mostly a reaction to quarterly results from a number of major companies. Investors are also sitting tight for the Big Tech earnings reports that will be coming out this week. Is this rally sustainable? For now, still yes. The rally, per analysts, is here to stay for a while longer, likely for the remainder of this year. That said, dips are to be expected.

Solana recently broke above $200 for the first time in 5 months, with its market cap topping $105 billion. Its TVL surged close to $10 billion after an $800 million inflow, thanks to its rising staking activity.

The chart shows strong support around $196, and if it breaks past $254, it could climb fast. He is targeting $400-$500 in the bull run with the trend showing higher lows and solid momentum. According to analyst Ali Martinez , the AI model Grok sees Solana as the top altcoin to watch for 2025. It has a 14% chance of being the best performer next year, higher than any other coin Grok analyzed. Solana’s Booming Ecosystem Solana stands out as a fast and scalable Layer 1, with a booming meme coin scene that is driving viral, community-led adoption. Recent upgrades like Alpenglow have boosted its tech, and a possible ETF approval in 2025 could send it up 5–10x. Besides, there is also growing buzz on X around Solana’s Defi and NFT ecosystem, which is attracting more attention. Solana’s ecosystem is also gaining serious momentum. Recently, in just 24 hours, the NFT trading volume topped $2 million, which was the highest in 113 days. Meanwhile, tokenized stocks launched just 22 days ago have already crossed $300 million in total transaction volume, showing strong early demand and growing on-chain activity. Breakout or Crash? Martinez notes that Solana has broken out of an ascending triangle, which is a bullish pattern. This breakout confirms a bullish shift with price targets between $300 and $360. From an on-chain view, key support levels sit at $189 and $177.

He points to clear bearish divergence, downtrends, and rejection at moving averages, with no signs of recovery. However, others are optimistic about SOL. Analyst Daan Crypto noted that it has broken above the key $180 level and is showing strong follow-through. The trend clearly favors the bulls, and from here, it’s all about forming higher highs and higher lows to keep the momentum going. $SOL 1D & 3D I really like $248-259 especially if $216 resistance is broken.

In a recent blog post , Hayes laid out his thesis, tying the potential price surge to U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic policies and what he describes as a shift to a wartime economy. Crypto to Thrive Under Trump’s Industrial Strategy, Says Arthur Hayes According to Hayes, the return of Trump has ushered in a credit-heavy economic strategy designed to increase industrial output, especially in areas like rare earths and defense manufacturing. Hayes believes this approach, which mirrors aspects of economic planning in China, will flood the system with credit. That, he argues, will create favorable conditions for risk assets, especially crypto. “If we are to remain beautiful and prosperous, to which instrument within the financial markets must we tune our ears?” Hayes wrote, comparing financial markets to music and investing to dance. He believes this wave of government borrowing will be indirectly supported by stablecoins, as issuers increasingly invest user funds into U.S. Treasury bills. As crypto adoption grows, so does the capital held in stablecoins, money that flows into government debt markets and helps fund the federal deficit. According to Hayes, this forms a loop between crypto and traditional finance: credit creation boosts crypto demand, stablecoins funnel cash into Treasuries, and the government recycles that capital into more credit. He calls it a “credit waltz.” Hayes also suggested that Trump-era regulatory changes, such as allowing 401(k) retirement funds to include crypto or potentially eliminating capital gains tax on digital assets, could deepen institutional involvement in the space. While Bitcoin remains his primary focus, Hayes believes Ethereum may outperform in the next cycle. He cited renewed institutional interest in Ethereum and shifting attention from faster chains like Solana back to larger, more established assets. SharpLink Gaming ($SBET) is now the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum. As of July 20, the company holds 360,807 ETH. #Ethereum #SBET https://t.co/iJ1ay05mxW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 22, 2025 With just over 5 months left until the end of 2025, Hayes is betting that aggressive fiscal policies and looser financial conditions will drive crypto to new highs. His predictions reflect a growing narrative among crypto advocates: that a highly leveraged, credit-fueled economy will benefit digital assets more than ever before. Bitcoin and Ethereum Eye Long-Term Highs, But Short-Term Resistance Looms While Arthur Hayes has projected long-term price targets of $250,000 for Bitcoin and $10,000 for Ethereum, current technical indicators suggest that both assets may encounter short-term resistance before any further upward movement. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at around $118,200, up 8.7% in the past week. However, despite the price surge, 24-hour trading volume has declined by over 10%, down to $49.2 billion, suggesting weaker momentum behind the rally. Analysts caution that the recent rise lacks strong follow-through, a warning sign for traders expecting an imminent breakout. According to Glassnode lead analyst James Check, the lack of growing volume raises doubts about Bitcoin reaching the $200,000 mark this year.

From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin recently filled the CME gap at $117,255–$116,675 and is now testing the key resistance zone between $118,270 and $119,530. Source: TradingView The Elliott Wave pattern suggests the fourth wave correction may be complete, with the fifth wave potentially forming now. However, due to waning momentum, this wave could be truncated, meaning a lower high may form before resuming a stronger trend later in the cycle. Source: TradingView Longer-term, some chart watchers suggest Bitcoin is in the early stages of a rising channel targeting the $340,000 mark, aligning with cycle-based models pointing to a peak around late 2025. Ethereum (ETH) , meanwhile, is trading near $3,688 after a 1.2% rise in 24 hours. ETH remains 24.5% below its all-time high, yet technical indicators show strength. On-chain activity has surged, with daily active addresses reaching 463,880 and network fees jumping over 475% since early July, a sign of increased usage and demand. Analysts point to Ethereum’s RSI, which recently signaled a long-term “buy,” historically preceding major rallies. A recent chart analysis shows ETH forming a bullish Cup & Handle pattern and coiling within a rising channel. Fibonacci projections offer long-term targets of $5,790, $8,513, and potentially $13,000 over a multi-year horizon. While short-term resistance and pullbacks remain likely, especially as ETH tests the $4,100 level again, technical signals suggest Ethereum’s long-term bullish structure remains intact.

The milestone coincides with Bitcoin dominance falling 5.8% in one week to under 61%, marking its lowest point since March and steepest decline since June 2022. Source: CoinMarketCap The metric had peaked near 66% at month-end, suggesting the critical inflection point that historically precedes major altcoin rallies. Altseason Index Shows a Possible Breakout CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index surged from just 16 a month ago to 51 this week. However, it remains below the 75 threshold that signals an official “altseason,” when at least 75 of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Current market rotation patterns mirror historical cycles where Bitcoin rallies first before capital flows into Ethereum and broader altcoin markets. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization surged from $3 trillion to $3.8 trillion over three weeks, with Ethereum gaining 110% during the same 90-day period. Meanwhile, meme coins like BONK (+148.7%) and FLOKI (+119.1%) posted triple-digit returns. In fact, lower-cap projects, including PENGU , recorded gains exceeding 500%. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin dominance may be approaching cyclical highs around 65-67%, following a declining trend from 97% in 2017 to 73% in 2021. The pattern indicates that each successive cycle sees Bitcoin maintaining a smaller market share at peaks, potentially setting the stage for sustained altcoin outperformance through 2025. Technical Indicators Signal Capital Rotation Phase Beginning Bitcoin dominance charts reveal a multi-cycle pattern connecting three major peaks: 2017 at 97%, 2021 at 73%, and a projected 2025 peak around 65-67%. The descending trendline suggests that Bitcoin’s current dominance may be approaching its cyclical high before shifting to alternative cryptocurrencies, which are seeking higher returns. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC ratio appears to be bottoming in demand zones while Bitcoin dominance approaches resistance around 65-70%. This inverse relationship often becomes apparent when capital is rotating, with the ETH/BTC ratio typically rising as Bitcoin’s dominance declines. Altcoin market cap projections suggest potential expansion from the current $3.6 trillion to over $16 trillion, representing a possible 10,000% growth, following historical patterns of 18,000% in the first cycle and 12,000% in the second cycle. Each expansion phase has reached progressively higher absolute levels despite moderating percentage gains. The four-phase capital rotation framework suggests that markets may be transitioning from Phase 1 (Bitcoin dominance) to Phase 2 (Ethereum leadership). BULLISH: THE CRYPTO CAPITAL ROTATION CYCLE SHOWS THAT ALTSEASON IS COMING! pic.twitter.com/B40ZZ1TeCD — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) July 23, 2025 Phase 2 typically sees money flowing into Ethereum while initially struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum beginning to outperform Bitcoin consistently. BNB’s breakthrough to $800 represents the type of major altcoin leadership that emerges during Phase 2, where established layer-1 platforms and major altcoins begin outperforming Bitcoin. Historical Precedent Supports Altseason Development Theory Previous altseasons have followed predictable patterns, starting with Bitcoin rallies that boost overall sentiment and liquidity, before capital shifts into Ethereum and other alternative cryptocurrencies. The 2017-2018 altseason saw Bitcoin dominance collapse from 87% to 32% as ICO mania and Ethereum’s rise drove market cap from $30 billion to $600 billion. The 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin’s dominance drop from 70% to 38% as DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins captured the attention of investors. Major altcoins, such as Dogecoin, surged in April 2021, as the altcoin season index reached 98, with the total altcoin market cap doubling during the explosive phase. Current market conditions mirror these historical setups, with Bitcoin having established new highs before stabilizing. The declining Bitcoin dominance trend from previous cycles suggests 2025 may see the third major altcoin expansion, potentially reaching massive absolute dollar amounts due to a larger market base. Ethereum’s 110% gain over 90 days, compared to Bitcoin’s relative stability, suggests that the rotation mechanism is in effect. The Altcoin Season Index, which climbed from 16 to 51 in one month, indicates accelerating momentum, although an official altseason is typically defined by crossing the 75 threshold. Historical data shows rapid acceleration once rotation begins, with major altcoins typically posting gains exceeding 170% compared to Bitcoin’s modest performance during peak altseason periods.

Key Takeaways: A Denver pastor and his wife were indicted for defrauding over 300 investors through INDXcoin. Authorities say the couple spent $1.3 million of investor funds on personal expenses. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025. Eli Regalado, a self-described online pastor, and his wife, Kaitlyn, are accused of orchestrating a scheme centered on INDXcoin , a token they created and sold between January 2022 and July 2023. Prosecutors say the couple targeted members of their Christian network, encouraging them to invest in INDXcoin through the Kingdom Wealth Exchange—despite the token allegedly having “zero value.” Denver DA Calls Pastor-Led Crypto Case a ‘Multi-Million-Dollar Scam’ Denver District Attorney John Walsh described the case as a “multi-million-dollar cryptocurrency scam.” “These charges mark a major step forward in our work to hold the Regalados accountable for their alleged crimes and to bring a measure of justice to the victims,” Walsh said. Authorities estimate that more than 300 people invested in the scheme, resulting in collective losses exceeding $3.3 million. According to the indictment, the Regalados diverted at least $1.3 million of investor funds for personal use, including home renovations. Eli Regalado reportedly told followers that “the Lord” had directed the couple to upgrade their home. Only a small fraction of the money was ever used to develop the INDXcoin project, investigators found. The couple had previously been charged in January, when Colorado Securities Commissioner Tung Chan accused them of exploiting religious trust. “We allege that Mr. Regalado took advantage of the trust and faith of his own Christian community,” Chan said at the time. “He peddled outlandish promises of wealth… when he sold them essentially worthless cryptocurrencies.” An online pastor was charged in CO for a $1.3 million crypto scam. He's released a 9-minute-long video explaining that the Lord told him to sell a cryptocurrency with no clear exit"", and spend some of the proceeds on ""a home remodel the Lord told us to do"". Here's a supercut. pic.twitter.com/scKpF8nyrT — Molly White (@molly0xFFF) January 21, 2024 The case adds to a growing list of crypto-related frauds involving retail investors. In May, the FBI arrested a New Zealand man accused of stealing $265 million in digital assets, allegedly spending the funds on luxury cars and high-end goods. Authorities in Colorado say the Regalado case serves as a warning about the risks of mixing personal belief with financial promises. Investigations were conducted by the Colorado Division of Securities and the Colorado Attorney General’s Office. Crypto Hacks, Scams Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events. The report also pointed to rising sophistication of phishing schemes and ongoing risks from social engineering, urging crypto users to verify links, avoid suspicious sites, and use hardware wallets.

This price rally has pushed its trading volume to $3.29 billion. Futures open interest also rose dramatically, by 23% to $1.27 billion, a sign of bullishness. The rally has also rekindled appetite throughout the market. Founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) celebrated the price surge with a message of thanksgiving to all those who were involved with the development of the Binance ecosystem. Build and Build. $BNB Appreciations to all the ecosystem players, BTC maxis, ETH holders, meme traders, ETF applicants, treasury pub cos, good regulators, and utility builders. 🙏 pic.twitter.com/5YreSKU7xQ — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) July 23, 2025 In another post on X, CZ pointed to the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index, currently at 54 out of 100. This index tracks the performance of altcoins as they contrast against Bitcoin. A value larger than 50 is a possible sign that more funds are going into altcoins . CZ cites this change as an indication that the rally has only just begun. He believes a full-blown “FOMO season” might be around the corner, with investor euphoria quickly driving up prices. One Binance Square analyst observed how silent this breakout was, describing it as the most discreet all-time high in the history of any major coin. “This is probably the most discreet ATH of a major cryptocurrency, based on solid fundamentals rather than speculation.” This discretion contrasts with the attention given to Bitcoin. Why is BNB surging? The recent gains by BNB are anchored on good fundamentals. The BNB Chain has registered over 5 million daily transactions. A 2025–2026 roadmap promises technical upgrades, including technical improvements and gas limit raises, as well as a new Rust client rollout. Deflationary tokenomics also play a role. The latest quarterly burn torched 2.1 million BNB valued at $1.6 billion. Regular burns contribute to long-term valuation. Also, institutional adoption is on the rise. Recently, Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs bought 45,685 BNB through OTC at an average of $764, adding 120,000 tokens in its latest acquisitions. The company hopes to buy up to 10% of BNB’s circulating supply through a program that will issue up to $500 million of convertible notes. Such developments strengthen institutional confidence in the token. BNB has been experiencing increased demand in use cases, including fee payments, staking, launchpad participation, and DeFi projects. The benefits of the BNB chain, such as low fees and scalability, have encouraged developers to build on the chain too. The altcoin fluctuated around the $800 price level for weeks before breaking the key resistance. Since early July, BNB has consolidated gains and outpaced Bitcoin, signaling a shift in market sentiment. Ethereum has also rallied by 67% over the past month, reaching $3,800. XRP climbed above $3.65, and Solana briefly traded above $200, up 24% weekly. Dogecoin has gained 35% within a week. Cardano increased by 50% over two weeks, but the two are still below historical highs.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following this classic blueprint. Now in its presale, muted buzz conceals fierce interest from prudent BTC investors tracking these rare 100x opportunities. With the token priced at $0.03 and an upcoming listing pegged at $0.06, early participants are positioning themselves for gains that could eclipse those seen in previous DeFi cycles. What will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) particularly compelling is its dual-lending architecture, designed to deliver both stable yield and high-risk rewards. In the upcoming Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, investors will be able to deposit major stablecoins and blue-chip assets into overcollateralized lending pools. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The presale narrative gains momentum near its midpoint: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $12.9 million to date and attracted over 13,900 token holders. With 90% of the Phase 5 allocation already sold, only a sliver of tokens remains at the $0.03 price point. In just days, the entry cost will spike to $0.035, delivering an instant 20% return. For investors who aim for a 100x surge post-listing, those final tokens at the lower price are the most strategic spot. Explosive Yield Meets Portfolio Flexibility For users looking to preserve long-term positions without selling, the borrowing side will offer overcollateralized loans in stablecoins. For instance, a borrower depositing $200,000 SOL will be able to access up to 75% of their collateral value in assets like 140,000 USDD. This feature will empower users to unlock liquidity while retaining upside exposure to SOL’s future appreciation—avoiding taxable events and maintaining strategic portfolio control. Mutuum Finance’s upcoming P2P lending feature is set to unlock high-risk, high-reward strategies compensating high risk assets and memcoins like TRUMP and FLOKI, that seasoned investors may appreciate. At the heart of the platform’s capital efficiency lies mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens minted when assets are deposited. These instruments represent fractional shares of the liquidity pool and automatically accrue both principal and interest. That means earnings accumulate in real-time, with no need for manual claims or compounding. Investors can track yield growth transparently—and even stake mtTokens to earn dividends in MUTM sourced from platform revenue. When users decide to exit, they simply return mtTokens to the smart contract and redeem their deposited assets plus all interest earned. One investor who joined during Phase 1 invested $20,000 into MUTM tokens at $0.01, securing 2 million tokens. With the presale now in Phase 5 at $0.03, that holding has already tripled in value. Once the token lists at $0.06, the return climbs to 6x, and when post-launch targets of $0.30 materialize, the upside reaches a staggering 30x. This projected growth isn’t without reason—the Mutuum team is preparing to launch its beta platform alongside the token listing, giving users a real-world product to engage with. That utility, combined with rising user interest, could attract further investor demand and increase the likelihood of listings on major exchanges—two factors that naturally support higher price levels. Security, Incentives, and Investor Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes safety. The project has undergone a comprehensive CertiK audit, achieving an impressive Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. To further secure the protocol against emerging threats, a $50,000 bug bounty program is now live, rewarding bug hunters for identifying vulnerabilities across severity tiers. Early believers are being recognized through an aggressive rewards structure. Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 token giveaway , in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project’s rapidly growing community—boasting over 12,000 followers on X—is a testament to the traction building behind the scenes. Quiet and calculated, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering momentum among those who expect big moves from strategic presale positioning. With just 10% of tokens left at the current price, smart money is making its move before the price rises. If you’re watching the crypto space for a stealthy 100x setup, this may be your chance—because at $0.03, the door to explosive returns is still open.

This strategic collaboration, as reported by CNBC, marks a pivotal moment where the efficiencies of blockchain technology meet the stability of traditional finance, setting a new precedent for how major financial players are embracing the future of asset management. What Are Tokenized Money Market Funds and Why Do They Matter? To fully grasp the magnitude of this initiative, it’s essential to understand both components: tokenization and money market funds. Money market funds (MMFs) are a type of mutual fund that invests in high-quality, short-term debt instruments, offering investors liquidity and a relatively low-risk return. They are a cornerstone of institutional cash management, providing a safe haven for large sums of capital. Tokenization, on the other hand, is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This digital representation can then be stored, transferred, and managed with the inherent benefits of blockchain technology, such as: Enhanced Efficiency: Streamlined processes, reduced manual intervention, and faster settlement times. Increased Liquidity: Potentially broader access to markets and easier transferability of ownership. Greater Transparency: Immutable record-keeping on a distributed ledger. Fractional Ownership: The ability to own a smaller, divisible portion of a high-value asset. When you combine these, tokenized money market funds represent a powerful fusion. The ownership of these funds, traditionally recorded in legacy systems, will now be immutably registered on Goldman’s proprietary blockchain platform. This move promises to unlock new levels of operational efficiency and liquidity for institutional clients, making their investments more accessible and agile than ever before. The Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon Partnership: A Game Changer for Tokenized Money Market Funds The synergy between Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon is critical to the success of this venture. BNY Mellon, one of the world’s largest custodian banks, will enable its vast network of clients to invest in these digitally represented funds. The crucial part of the plan is that the ownership of these funds will be recorded on Goldman Sachs’ blockchain platform, which is likely their GS Digital Asset Platform (GS DAP) . This platform is designed to issue, tokenise, and service traditional assets on a blockchain. This collaboration highlights several key aspects: Infrastructure Development: Both institutions have invested significant resources in building the necessary technological infrastructure to support this new paradigm. This isn’t just a pilot; it’s a foundational build-out. Interoperability: The partnership demonstrates a crucial step towards interoperability between different financial institutions’ digital asset initiatives. BNY Mellon clients can access Goldman’s platform, signaling a potential future where various blockchain networks can communicate seamlessly. Trust and Security: Leveraging established financial giants like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon provides the necessary trust and regulatory compliance framework that institutional investors demand, addressing common concerns around the security and legitimacy of digital assets. This isn’t just about moving existing processes onto a blockchain; it’s about reimagining them for a more efficient, interconnected financial ecosystem. The ability for BNY Mellon clients to directly invest in funds whose ownership is managed on Goldman’s blockchain platform streamlines the entire investment lifecycle from subscription to redemption. What Benefits Do Tokenized Money Market Funds Offer Institutional Investors? For institutional investors, the adoption of tokenized money market funds brings a host of compelling advantages that address long-standing pain points in traditional finance: Faster Settlement: Traditional fund transactions can take days to settle. Tokenization has the potential to reduce this to near-instantaneous settlement, freeing up capital more quickly. Reduced Operational Costs: Automating processes through smart contracts on a blockchain can significantly cut down on administrative overheads and reconciliation efforts. Enhanced Transparency and Auditability: Every transaction is recorded on an immutable ledger, providing a clear and verifiable audit trail that simplifies compliance and reporting. 24/7 Trading Potential: Unlike traditional markets with fixed operating hours, blockchain-based assets can theoretically be traded around the clock, offering greater flexibility. Improved Capital Efficiency: Faster settlement and increased liquidity mean capital is not tied up for extended periods, allowing for more dynamic portfolio management. Consider the scenario of a large corporate treasury needing to manage its cash reserves. With tokenized money market funds , they could potentially move capital in and out of these funds with unprecedented speed and transparency, optimizing their liquidity management strategies in real-time. This level of agility is simply not possible with current legacy systems. Challenges and the Path Forward for Tokenized Money Market Funds While the benefits are clear, the path to widespread adoption of tokenized money market funds is not without its challenges. Key areas that still require development and clarity include: Challenge Area Description Regulatory Clarity Governments and financial regulators are still developing comprehensive frameworks for digital assets. Clear guidelines are crucial for mainstream adoption. Interoperability Standards Ensuring different blockchain platforms can seamlessly interact is vital for a truly interconnected financial system. Cybersecurity Risks As with any digital system, robust security measures are paramount to protect against hacks and vulnerabilities. Scalability Blockchain networks need to be able to handle the immense transaction volumes of global financial markets. Talent and Education A skilled workforce capable of developing, managing, and regulating these new systems is essential. Despite these hurdles, the commitment from financial titans like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon signals strong confidence in the long-term viability and transformative power of tokenization. Their involvement provides the necessary legitimacy and resources to navigate these complexities. The Broader Implications: Bridging TradFi and DeFi with Tokenized Money Market Funds This move is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a growing trend where traditional finance (TradFi) institutions are exploring and integrating aspects of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. The creation of tokenized money market funds serves as a powerful bridge, demonstrating how the core benefits of blockchain – efficiency, transparency, and programmability – can be applied to highly regulated and established financial products. It suggests a future where: More Asset Classes are Tokenized: Beyond money market funds, we could see bonds, equities, real estate, and even private credit being tokenized, creating a more liquid and accessible global market. New Financial Products Emerge: The programmability of tokens allows for the creation of innovative financial instruments that can automate complex processes, such as collateral management or dividend distribution. Increased Institutional Participation in Digital Assets: As more familiar and regulated products become tokenized, it lowers the barrier for traditional institutions to engage with the broader digital asset ecosystem. This strategic partnership is a clear indicator that the future of finance will be increasingly digital and interconnected. It’s a proactive step by two major players to shape that future rather than merely react to it. Conclusion: A New Era for Institutional Finance Driven by Tokenized Money Market Funds The collaboration between Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon to support the trading of tokenized money market funds is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a paradigm shift. It represents a bold step towards a more efficient, transparent, and liquid financial system, firmly rooted in the capabilities of blockchain technology. By bridging the gap between traditional investment vehicles and the burgeoning world of digital assets, these financial powerhouses are not only enhancing their own offerings but also paving the way for broader institutional adoption of tokenized securities. This development underscores the growing recognition that blockchain is not merely a technology for cryptocurrencies but a foundational layer for the next generation of financial infrastructure. As more institutions follow suit, we can expect to see a profound transformation in how assets are owned, traded, and managed globally, ultimately benefiting investors with greater efficiency and access. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly does it mean for money market funds to be ‘tokenized’?

In 2028, BCH will range between $813.00 and $1,586, with an average price of $1,044. In 2031, BCH will range between $3,152 and $4,171, with an average price of $3,889. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that originated from a hard fork of Bitcoin in 2017, designed to enable faster transactions and lower fees through larger block sizes. As BCH continues to maintain a significant presence in the crypto market, predicting its future price movements is crucial for investors. This prediction will delve into various factors affecting BCH’s value, including market trends, adoption rates, and overall sentiment within the cryptocurrency space, offering insights into its potential future performance. Will BCH recapture its ATH? How high will BCH go in 2025? Let’s dive in! Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash Ticker BCH Current price $518.99 Market cap $10.33B Trading volume $511.48M Circulating supply 19.9M BCH All-time high $4,355.62 Dec 20, 2017 All-time low $75.08 Dec 15, 2018 24-hour low $513.66 24-hour high $529.79 Bitcoin Cash price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 3.59% 50-day SMA $474.15 200-day SMA $385.64 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 20/30 (67%) Bitcoin Cash price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The daily uptrend is still intact, but momentum is fading with MACD showing early signs of weakness. BCH faced a sharp rejection at $552 on the 4-hour chart, leading to the current sideways movement. If $519.5 support breaks, Bitcoin Cash could slide toward the $487–$490 zone. Bitcoin Cash 1-day price analysis: Uptrend faces critical test at resistance Bitcoin Cash has been riding a steady uptrend channel since early June, climbing from around $400 to its current position near $517.7 as of July 23, 2025. The ascending channel remains intact, though recent action shows signs of strain. Bitcoin Cash 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator reveals concerning momentum deterioration with the histogram turning negative, while the signal line remains above the MACD line. Price action shows multiple rejections near the $540-550 resistance zone, with the latest pullback from $553.5 creating a bearish engulfing pattern that could signal a deeper correction ahead. BCH/USD 4-hour price chart: BCH sees consolidation after sharp rejection On the 4-hour chart, the Alligator indicator shows converging moving averages around the $522-523 area, indicating a period of consolidation and indecision following the recent volatility. BCH/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume patterns display elevated activity during the spike and subsequent selloff. The current price action is trading within a tight range between $519.5 and $523.5, with the Alligator lines acting as dynamic support.

Bitcoin Cash is at a key point as the daily uptrend shows signs of weakening. MACD divergence and rejection at $552 suggest fading bullish momentum. A drop below $519.5 may lead to a fall toward the $487–$490 support zone, while a break above $530 with strong volume could revive the uptrend toward $560. Is BCH a good investment? Bitcoin Cash (BCH) presents a mixed investment outlook. While it offers lower transaction fees and faster processing times compared to Bitcoin, it struggles to differentiate itself in a crowded cryptocurrency market. Historically, BCH’s performance has been lackluster compared to Bitcoin, with significantly lower returns since its launch. However, BCH could benefit from a market resurgence, potentially boosting its value. Will Bitcoin Cash reach $1,000? Bitcoin Cash moved near $1,000 in 2024, attaining a high of $714. Experts expect the coin to recover above the $1,000 mark as soon as 2027. Will Bitcoin Cash reach $2,000? BCH’s ATH is $4,355.62; hence, reaching $2,000 again seems very likely but must be supported by a major market shift or a significant bullish event. Does BCH have a good long-term future? Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has potential for a long-term future, but its success depends on adoption, innovation, and competition. While it offers faster, cheaper transactions, its relevance will hinge on navigating challenges and seizing opportunities in the evolving crypto market. Bitcoin Cash price prediction July 2025 In July 2025, BCH may trade at a minimum price of $450.35. The expected average value might be $495.80, with a maximum price of $560.22.

Bitcoin Cash historic price sentiment Bitcoin Cash price history by Coingecko Bitcoin Cash was created in mid-2017 as a fork of Bitcoin. It experienced an explosive rise shortly after its inception, reaching a peak of over $3,000 by the end of 2017. This surge was driven by initial market excitement and the broader cryptocurrency boom of that period. The early part of 2018 saw a sharp decline from its previous highs. The price fell dramatically throughout the year, stabilizing around $400 to $500 by the end of 2018. During 2019, Bitcoin Cash’s price remained relatively stable, mostly trading below $400. There were occasional minor spikes, but the price largely hovered in this lower range as the market continued to cool down. The price in 2020 showed similar stability, remaining below $400 for most of the year. The market was relatively quiet during this period, with no significant movements for Bitcoin Cash. In 2021, Bitcoin Cash saw a notable price increase, spiking to around $1,500 during the broader crypto market boom. The price fell back to the $300 to $400 range throughout 2022. This period marked another phase of decline and stabilization after the brief 2021 spike, consistent with the broader market correction. Bitcoin Cash continued to experience low volatility in 2023, maintaining a range between $300 and $400. The market showed little movement, with BCH price remaining relatively flat. In 2024, BCH reached a peak price of $714 and a minimum price of $219 and closed the year at about $470. The coin opened trading at $434.5 in 2025 but lost momentum in the first quarter, dropping to as low as $250.79 by April. Subsequent months brought growth, with BCH recapturing $500 by mid-June, reaching a high of $526, and closing the month at $491.95. In July, Bitcoin Cash is currently trading at $504.97 to $533.46.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BCH|TRADING|MARKET|FORKS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-23 13:34:41

Paolo Ardoino , CEO of the world’s leading stablecoin issuer, has revealed that Tether has invested in over 120 companies. And this is just the beginning. The announcement signals a bigger shift for Tether. Today Tether publishes (a portion) of its investment/venture portfolio. Overall Tether group invested in more than 120+ companies and this number is expected to grow significantly in the next months and years. https://t.co/6PDGgeL7WP * these investments have been made with… pic.twitter.com/lMmhnYI9rU — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) July 23, 2025 Tether’s $162 Billion Power Play In a re cent X post , Ardoino shared a screenshot and a link to Tether’s website, where the full list of portfolio companies is now public. The move immediately sparked discussion within the crypto space, especially as Tether maintains a market cap of $162 billion for USDT , making it the largest stablecoin in circulation. Circle’s USDC is a distant second. Tether began by issuing USD-backed tokens across several blockchains. Over time, it expanded to include stablecoins backed by the euro and gold. Now, its investment arm is becoming just as important as its stablecoin operations. According to Ardoino, this is only the beginning. He added that the number of companies backed by Tether is expected to grow significantly in the months and years ahead. Tether Moves From Minting to Market Influence This marks a new phase for Tether. It is no longer just maintaining the USDT peg or leading the stablecoin race. It’s putting serious capital into projects that could shape the future of the digital economy. The company’s investments span across sectors like fintech, blockchain infrastructure, digital identity, and communications. This suggests a much larger vision to influence the global financial ecosystem and the next era of Web3. Criticism Grows Over USDT Issuance Despite the ambitious direction, not everyone is impressed. Ardoino’s confirmation that 162 billion USDT tokens have been issued triggered criticism from some in the crypto community. Skeptics accused Tether of printing tokens without sufficient backing, drawing comparisons to how the Federal Reserve prints dollars. Tether, however, maintains that each USDT token is fully backed by a combination of dollar reserves, U.S. Treasury bills, and other highly liquid assets. These claims have been supported by audit reports and public disclosures. Still, debates around transparency and stablecoin regulation continue to surface. The Big Picture Tether is evolving from a stablecoin issuer into a major investor in crypto and fintech. Its growing portfolio reflects a strong push to shape the future of blockchain technology and digital finance. But with expansion comes scrutiny. As Tether doubles down on investment and innovation, it must also continue to prove its commitment to transparency and trust in an industry where those values are constantly under the spotlight.",News,EN,0,0,USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 13:35:05

The rally has pushed ETH to levels not seen since early 2025, flipping key resistances into support. However, signs of short-term exhaustion are beginning to surface, raising the possibility of a cooldown phase before any continuation higher. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH remains in a strong uptrend, holding well above both the 100 and 200-day moving averages, both located around the $2,500 mark. The recent breakout from the $2,800 zone has triggered a clean rally, with the price now trading around $3,660 after briefly touching $3,800. The RSI peaked above 78, suggesting the move was heavily overbought, and it’s now beginning to cool down. A key level to watch is the $3,300 area, which acted as a breakout zone and could now serve as support if the price pulls back. As long as ETH holds above that level, the macro structure remains bullish. However, the asset is stalling just below the $4,000 resistance, and the latest daily candles are showing upper wicks, indicating selling pressure. If the bulls fail to push past $3,800 with strength, we may see a deeper pullback into the $3,300 range, which would be a healthy retest before continuation. On the upside, the $4,107 previous highs remain the next major target, but a clean breakout and daily close above $3,800 is required to confirm the move. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has been showing bearish divergence between price and RSI. While the price pushed higher into $3,800, the RSI has been forming lower highs, suggesting that momentum is fading. The RSI has now dropped to around 50, showing a loss of short-term bullish pressure. The asset is currently consolidating inside a tight range between $3,500 and $3,800, with multiple rejections from the latter area. A breakdown below $3,500 would open the door for a correction toward $3,200, which is the nearest strong support. That level also lines up with previous 4H structure and the origin of the recent move. Therefore, until ETH breaks above $3,800 with a convincing candle and volume, it’s more likely to consolidate or retrace in the short term as the market cools off. On-Chain Analysis Ethereum Funding Rates From a sentiment standpoint, Ethereum’s recent rally has been supported by growing speculative interest, reflected in the rising funding rates across all major exchanges. Funding has turned positive and continues to climb, showing that long positions are becoming more dominant as traders chase the breakout. However, it’s important to note that despite this uptick, funding rates are still far from the extreme highs we’ve seen at major market tops in the past. During previous cycle peaks, funding spiked aggressively, reaching levels that typically precede sharp corrections or long squeezes. Currently, funding remains relatively moderate, suggesting that although sentiment is turning more bullish, it’s not yet at a euphoric stage. This gives Ethereum some breathing room for further upside continuation as long as rates don’t escalate too quickly. Traders should still keep an eye on funding dynamics, as a sudden surge could be an early warning of overheating conditions.

But while ETH grabs headlines, a new wave of Ethereum-based tokens is starting to surge behind the scenes. These tokens are faster, leaner, and built with real utility in mind. As Ethereum leads the charge, it’s time to watch these ETH-powered projects explode in 2025. Analysts Predict Ethereum Could Hit $10K This Cycle Ethereum is stepping back into the spotlight with real momentum behind it. Over the past week, ETH price surged more than 24%. It reclaimed territory above $3,700 and reignited bullish sentiment across the market. Despite a mild dip, the structure remains solid, with $3,600 acting as a key support level. Analysts now watch the $4,000 resistance with interest, calling it the next major breakout zone. Trading volume has remained high, institutional interest is growing and historical price patterns suggest that ETH price could push higher in the short term. If it breaks past $4,000, some projections suggest it could even eye $10,000 later this year. What makes this run different is the rising confidence in ETH’s long-term relevance as the settlement layer of DeFi and smart contracts. Now, Ethereum’s strength is fueling a ripple effect across the broader market. ETH-based tokens, especially those offering real utility, are gathering serious attention. Many investors now believe these smaller tokens could deliver higher multiples as Ethereum steadies the market. Remittix Keeps Gaining Ground as Ethereum Fights Resistance While Ethereum flexes its strength near $4,000, smart investors are zooming in on the ETH-based token that’s quietly rewriting the rules for crypto utility.

But, recent profit booking has triggered a mild correction to sideways movement. This occurrence has pulled prices back to $0.85. Despite the retracement, whale accumulation signals a strong possibility of an extended rally. ADA Price Rally Slows as Traders Book Profits After showing impressive momentum through July, the ADA price experienced a temporary cooldown. However, the OI has not dipped much, when writing it holds near $637.53 million, signifying a less intense sell-off. A couple of days back, when ADA crypto climbed to $0.92, it attracted heavy interest in both spot and derivatives markets. The Open Interest (OI) spiked to $675 million, while funding rates remained positive near 0.01%, which is still positive when writing, which means bulls are still actively paying a premium to maintain leverage on long positions. Moreover, this sell-off move was captured in Santiment’s “Network Realized Profit/Loss” metric, which displayed a clear spike. This suggests many short-term holders opted to take profits near recent highs, leading to a pullback to $0.85. On-Chain Signals Show Whales Absorbing Retail Sell-Off Despite the minor correction, underlying network metrics remain healthy. Santiment data on active addresses in both 7-day and 24-hour periods have remained elevated throughout July. These are strongly signaling a sustained user engagement on the Cardano blockchain. More importantly, wallet data paints a compelling picture of redistribution. As the data shows, the “small to medium” investors’ wallets holding in the range of “1 to 10 million ADA” have shown a steady decline in holdings. Meanwhile, larger addresses holding “10 million to 100 million”, and even “100 million to 1 billion” ADA coins, have been accumulating aggressively. This classic absorption pattern points to confidence from whales and institutional players, often seen as a leading indicator for further bullish momentum in the ADA price. ADA Price Prediction Points to $2, If $1 Barrier Breaks Looking forward, analysts’ opinions are flooding various social platforms like X, and they strongly believe that this short-term cooldown could pave the way for another leg upward. If whales continue to accumulate and broader market sentiment stays favorable, clearing the $1 mark next could act as a breakout trigger. Cardano might need to take a little breather, but this is definitely the moment for $ADA to break through its bull market doors and make its way towards $2 and beyond. pic.twitter.com/gEUmOjna2q — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) July 22, 2025 With strong technical structure and continued on-chain support, there’s growing speculation that the ADA price could revisit the $2 mark by year’s end.

Currently, global crypto exchanges in India exist in a grey area, as they are neither legal nor illegal, and crypto assets remain unregulated under Indian law. Regulation Unclear, But Compliance Mandatory “At present, crypto or virtual assets are not regulated in India. Consequently, the question of the legality or illegality of specific crypto platforms does not arise as on date,” Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary shared in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. However, to keep an eye on money laundering and terror financing, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) now requires all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), both Indian and international, to register under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). BREAKING: The Ministry of Finance clarifies, crypto assets are still unregulated in India. Global exchanges are not classified as legal or illegal, but they must register with the FIU to operate. India’s crypto puzzle is not solved yet, just more pieces added. pic.twitter.com/BY7LLunmtB — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) July 23, 2025 This means that any platform offering crypto services to Indian users must be registered with FIU-IND, or risk being flagged. Besides, the FIU is also maintaining a public list of non-compliant platforms. Although India does not have a clear regulatory framework for crypto, the compliance checks have already begun. He also noted that a 1% TDS is applied on every crypto transaction, including those with offshore platforms, as long as the income is taxable in India. Crypto Traders Struggle With High Taxes Crypto traders in India are facing a harsh reality. Every profit is taxed at a flat 30%, with no exceptions or deductions. On top of that, there’s a 1% TDS on every single trade, even if the trader is making a loss. There is also GST applied to trading fees, which further reduces already slim profit margins. Besides, traders do not have the option to offset their losses, so every unsuccessful trade results in double the impact. Major Hacks Shake Trust Domestic exchanges that promise safety and compliance are also falling short as users continue to face withdrawal delays, poor customer support, and a lack of transparency in operations. To make matters worse, there have been serious breaches. WazirX faced a $234 million exploit, and users are still waiting for full recovery. CoinDCX also recently faced a $44 million hack. COINS Act Offers Hope However, in a push towards clarity, the COINS Act was proposed by Hashed Emergent and Blackdot Policy as India’s first industry-led model crypto law. It puts rights before restrictions, focusing on self-custody, privacy, and the freedom to innovate. The proposal also includes a new, dedicated crypto regulator called CARA to ensure fair and tech-aware oversight.

While Binance Coin led the gainers with a new ATH , Lido DAO’s native token exhibited a bearish outlook. LDO lost more than 5% of its value the previous day as Lido faces growing liquidity pressure amid skyrocketing unfinalized withdrawals. Dune Analytics data shows unfinalized withdrawal queue on the Ethereum-based liquid staking protocol soared to 235,728 on July 22, after consistent surges over the past few weeks. Source – Dune Analytics That represents the highest withdrawal jam since Lido first introduced withdrawals, excluding the initial day’s spike. These observations signal a change in user behavior. The lengthening queue indicates more stakers requesting to exit the Lido network at the same time. Meanwhile, these spikes can face prolonged delays as staked ETH withdrawals depend on Ethereum’s exit rate caps and validator rotation. That raises worries over Lido DAO’s ability to maintain steady liquidity in the upcoming times. The protocol’s native coin turned bearish as the project braced for a potential liquidity crunch. While most digital assets displayed stability amid market cooldown, LDO dropped 5.78% from $1.2195 to $1.149. Lido’s liquidity strain concerns A massive withdrawal queue means individuals will wait longer to access their Ether tokens, and that paints a negative picture for a platform that promises liquid staking. User trust deteriorates with such disappointments. It also pressures the secondary markets. Users failing to cash out directly from Lido DAO may switch to DeFi platforms or exchanges to liquidate their stETH (staked ETH). That would mean intensified bearish pressure for stETH and the native LDO. Various reasons could be contributing to Lido’s user exit. For instance, plummeting yields might offset conservative investors. Individuals may be migrating to emerging platforms promising swift withdrawals and decentralized validator systems. Furthermore, crypto investors could be exiting Lido for other platforms that promise lucrative opportunities and returns in this bull cycle. The speed and magnitude of Lido’s withdrawal queue signals a significant shift in how and where users stake. As a solution, the liquid staking platform has introduced Jumper Exchange as the new withdrawal aggregator to enable instant swaps.

While clogged withdrawals trigger the downward pressure, profit-taking likely plays a part, especially since LDO gained 30% in the past week. Technical indicators highlight LDO’s weakening momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence signals seller dominance with a sharp bearish crossover on the 3H timeframe. Also, the 1D Relative Strength Index demonstrates overbought conditions at 70. Such sentiments position LDO for short-term declines before the alt establishes a directional bias. Failure to hold above $1.00 could see the alt plummeting towards the $0.80 barrier.

TA slid as the attackers staged a fake liquidity pool. Blocksec Phantom intercepted worrying transfers from an unknown smart contract on BNB Smart Chain, as Trusta AI tokens appear to be crashing due to a smart contract attack. The contract caused a series of TA token transactions, with initial losses estimated at around $600K. After the initial attack, the losses stopped at around $615K. Investigators were unable to pinpoint the exact content of the contract, as it was not open source. Blocksec Phantom advises BNB Smart Chain users to revoke permission for the flawed contract. Until permission is revoked, the wallets remain exposed and may be drained of other assets. Any wallet that interacted with the rogue contract is at risk of losing its balances. ALERT!

Trusta AI attacked by rogue smart contract According to Certik, the attacker created two smart contracts that spoofed Trusta AI trading, making users pay exorbitant fees. The attackers then traded TA on legitimate liquidity pools. The rogue contract was generated two days ago and credited with only 0.3 BNB. As a result, TA sank to $0.09, down from an initial price of $0.17. The token is still in early price discovery, and it remains uncertain how much of the selling was due to the exploit, and what part was the selling that originated from early TGE token recipients. TrustaAI (TA) just started trading, when it was affected by a rogue smart contract. TA is one of the latest Binance Alpha token selections. | Source: Coingecko Trusta AI was just launched as part of the Binance Alpha program for selected tokens, meaning most of the affected users were small-scale holders with self-custodial wallets. Token recipients pre-approved the contract, allowing it to spend TA The main problem with the Trusta AI exploit was the pre-approved access of the contract. As a result, tokens were taken from self-custodial wallets, which would otherwise hold TA safely. Apparently, TA recipients had pre-approved the contract address. The exploit also affected WBNB tokens, selling via malicious liquidity pools at unfair rates. As a result of the rogue trading, Trusta AI had different price ranges in its various versions. TA on Base still traded at $0.14, while on BNB Smart Chain the asset retained its lower level of $0.09. The initial attack account then simply withdrew the allowed tokens. One of the exploit wallets currently carries over 408 WBNB, among other smaller token holdings. The affected wallets also pre-approved specific tokens; thus, not all assets were affected. Pre-approved tokens are a common feature for BNB Chain , allowing for faster token swaps or lending. Unvetted permissions to smart contracts for automated trading may quickly turn risky. BNB Chain and Trusta AI remain safe, as well as the TA tokens. Soon after the attack, some of the TA pairs recovered, pushing the token as high as $0.23 . For now, there is no mention of freezing the tokens or attempting to revert the transactions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Accordingly, Hayes claimed that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2025, while Ethereum will shake the market and reach $10,000. In a comprehensive new blog post titled “Time Signature,” Hayes explained why he has such confidence in Ethereum and Bitcoin and why he's “fully invested” in these assets. Hayes expects a major bull season to occur in the coming months, stating that there will be a bull run, especially in Ethereum. Stating that ETH has entered a major uptrend with its recent rise, Hayes said, “the approaching Ethereum bull will shake the market.” Hayes recently revealed the altcoins his company, Maelstrom, has invested in. Accordingly, Hayes stated that the Maelstrom fund invested heavily in Ethereum, DeFi, and ERC-20 altcoins. “The upcoming Ethereum rally will drag the market into a new era.

That single message turned attention away from a possible Fed crisis and back to what actually moves the market: interest rates . The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 3 basis points, sitting at 4.368%. The 2-year yield ticked up just under 2 basis points to 3.846%, and the 30-year moved over 3 basis points to 4.94%. One basis point is 0.01%, and as always, yields rise when bond prices fall. But really, investors were never ever skittish over Trump wanting Powell out. Scott calms bond markets with Powell defense The wave started Tuesday when Scott told CNBC that he didn’t believe Powell needed to resign. At the same time, President Donald Trump, who had spent months bashing Powell and teasing his removal, said, “he’s going to be out pretty soon anyway.” That line alone took some of the weight off traders who had been bracing for a nasty legal fight or worse; market chaos. That helped the market refocus on what’s next: the July 29-30 Fed policy meeting. Expectations are set on the Fed holding rates where they are, especially with inflation now running at 2.7%, up from 2.4% in May. Trump keeps yelling for a rate cut, but the Fed isn’t moving just yet. Powell didn’t even address the outlook during a speech on Tuesday. He skipped rate talk entirely and focused on banking regulation instead. Meanwhile, stocks got a push from a U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement locks tariffs at 15% and sparked hope that more deals could follow, including something with the EU. That gave equities room to run while bonds digested the Powell news. Trump pressures Fed with internal scrutiny But don’t mistake this calm for a full ceasefire. Scott had said on CNBC earlier this week that he wants the Fed’s entire operation reviewed. Then he followed up by saying that doesn’t mean Powell should quit. “I know Chair Powell. There’s nothing that tells me that he should step down right now. He’s been a good public servant,” Scott told Fox Business. “His term ends in May. If he wants to see that through, I think he should. If he wants to leave early, I think he should.” That’s not exactly a full endorsement, but it’s also not a push out the door. Still, Trump isn’t backing down. He’s made it known he wants Powell gone and has openly floated the idea of removing him. But so far, Powell hasn’t given any hint that he’ll step aside. The administration’s latest line of attack is the Fed’s $2.5 billion renovation project , which has gone wildly over budget. That’s become a convenient target for Trump allies looking to tighten the screws. Still, Scott insists that any review should be handled inside the Fed—not politically. He said that monetary policy decisions should be kept “off to the side” in what he called a “jewel box”, separate from outside influence. He added, “Everything else that the Fed has done over the years has just grown and grown and grown, and this is what happens when you don’t have oversight.” His view is that Powell has a shot to fix all of that and shape his legacy by shrinking the Fed’s non-monetary roles. Whether Powell will take up that offer is unclear. But he’s shown no sign of quitting. And unless he walks on his own, he’s legally protected from being fired outright over policy disagreements. Next week’s FOMC meeting is the next key event. Trump wants deep rate cuts. The Fed likely won’t deliver. Most members want to see how the tariffs are affecting inflation before making any new moves. That puts everyone in wait-and-see mode again, but with one less panic headline in the way… for now.

The ongoing competition between well-known digital tokens adorned with dog-themed mascots begs the question of which will dominate. However, amidst this friendly rivalry, a new contender emerges, boasting remarkable growth prospects that may surprise seasoned traders. Delving into this evolving landscape reveals intriguing opportunities that challenge established market players and captivate investor interest. Catzilla ($CATZILLA): A Meme Coin with Serious Growth Potential Catzilla ($CATZILLA) is one of those projects that seems too wild to ignore—a mix of Japanese kaiju culture, internet memes, and crypto. At first glance, it might just seem like another meme token, but there’s more going on under the hood. With a structured presale and a growing community, Catzilla has some actual momentum behind it . A Presale with 14 Stages—Here’s Where Things Stand Instead of a typical one-shot token sale, Catzilla’s presale is broken into 14 stages, giving investors multiple chances to buy in before launch. As each stage progresses, the price ticks up, meaning early buyers get in at a lower cost. Current Presale Stats: Current Price: $0.0009 Next Stage Price: $0.0010 Final Presale Price: $0.0016 Funds Raised So Far: $2.2M+ and climbing Right now, it’s at Stage 7, and the CoinMarketCap community seems optimistic about where it’s headed. Since the price keeps increasing with each stage, some investors are getting in now to lock in a lower price before the token hits exchanges. Secure $CATZILLA Now Before Its Price Surges What Makes Catzilla Different? Plenty of meme coins rely purely on hype, but this one has a few things going for it besides just viral appeal. 1. There’s a Unique Concept A big part of the project revolves around a kaiju-style concept. Its mascot is a giant cat that destroys cities and earns rewards. 2. It’s Tapping into Multiple Communities Catzilla is clearly designed to appeal to more than just crypto traders. The mix of anime, gaming, and meme culture makes it something that could attract: Crypto investors looking for early-stage projects Meme lovers who enjoy viral, internet-driven trends Anime and gaming fans who like the kaiju-inspired theme That mix of audiences could help sustain interest in the long term. 3. There’s a Strong Focus on Community Involvement A big part of the project is community engagement, whether it’s through governance voting, staking rewards, or the play-to-earn mechanics in the game. The more people participate, the more active the ecosystem becomes—which could help with long-term sustainability. Is It Worth Getting In Now? The presale is moving along quickly, and since the price keeps increasing in stages, there’s a time factor involved. Like any meme coin, it’s a speculative play—there’s potential for major upside, but also risks, especially in a volatile market. That said, the combination of an actual game, community engagement, and a structured presale makes Catzilla more interesting than most meme coins that pop up and disappear. Whether it turns into a big winner depends on how well they execute on the roadmap, but it’s one to keep an eye on. Take Advantage of the $CATZILLA Surge Dogecoin Shows Mixed Signals But Eyes Are on the Bullish Run Source: TradingView Dogecoin is picking up steam within a price range of $0.22 to $0.31. The coin is battling to break past the nearest resistance of $0.34. Its RSI sits at 38.27, suggesting that it is not overbought. Recent weekly and monthly increases of almost 28% and 69% may spark more interest. Yet, it has dipped over the last 6 months by around 27%. Current SMA is stable at $0.26, matching its 10-day and 100-day averages. Should momentum rise, reaching the second resistance level at $0.43 could mean a jump of about 40% from current prices. Even with mixed signals, bulls are ready to charge. FLOKI Set for Bullish Run Despite Current Hesitations Source: TradingView FLOKI’s journey shows excitement. In the past week, its price jumped almost 46%. Over the month, it soared by nearly 129%. The current price hovers between $0.00010285 and $0.00015827, eyeing the resistance level at $0.00018087. Past this, the next resistance is $0.00023628, signaling room for growth. With a 6-month rise of about 4%, the short-term surge hints at potential. The RSI is around 49, suggesting indecision, while the stochastic indicates it’s undervalued. The simple moving averages signal an upward trend, keeping hopes alive. FLOKI could climb higher if it breaks resistance. Despite ups and downs, its bullish trend appears promising. Conclusion With the meme coin rally gaining momentum, DOGE and FLOKI may have limited short-term potential. Catzilla emerges as a new contender aiming to bring financial freedom to a broad audience.

The timing also aligns with rising tensions over SpaceX’s government contracts and broader efforts by Elon Musk to integrate crypto into his companies’ ecosystems. SpaceX now reportedly holds nearly 7,000 BTC, valued at over $800 million. SpaceX Transfers $153M in Bitcoin SpaceX quietly moved 1,308 Bitcoin, worth around $153 million. This was its first on-chain activity in three years. The transfer was flagged by Arkham Intelligence , which noticed that the Bitcoin was withdrawn from 16 Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses and consolidated into a single SegWit-compatible Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) address. This move is believed to be a strategic consolidation that may simplify management and reduce future transaction costs. While neither SpaceX nor its founder Elon Musk commented on the action, the timing coincides with rising political tensions and potential shifts in government contracts. The Pentagon recently announced its intention to diversify contractors for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defense system, due to concerns over its dependence on SpaceX. This development follows reports from June that the Trump administration considered reviewing or canceling up to $22 billion in contracts with the company thanks to a public dispute between Musk and the president. Musk’s engagement with cryptocurrency has been volatile . In 2021, his promotion of Dogecoin led to a price surge before a dramatic crash. Tesla, another Musk-led firm, bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin the same year and briefly accepted it as payment before reversing the decision due to environmental concerns. Some of those holdings were later sold. After his acquisition of Twitter, which was then rebranded as X, Musk began pushing toward creating a broader financial ecosystem. X has since acquired money transmitter licenses in multiple US states, and backend code has hinted at the development of a native crypto wallet, although no crypto features have launched publicly. In 2024, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya revealed that SpaceX uses stablecoins to collect payments for its Starlink internet service in developing countries, allowing it to bypass slow or expensive banking systems. SpaceX is now believed to hold approximately 6,977 Bitcoin, which is valued at around $815 million.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $10,005 and $11,875, with an average expected price of $10,291 In 2031, ETH could trade between $45,481 and $53,844 with an average price of $46,769. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,663 Market Cap $442.15B Trading Volume (24h) $36.88B Circulating Supply 120.71M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $3,765.03 24-hour Low $3,631.79 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility $ 4,065.96 (10.05%) 50-day SMA $ 2,745.27 200-day SMA $ 2,375.79 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 22/30 (73%) 14-day RSI 86.13 Ethereum price analysis Ethereum is trading around the middle Bollinger Band showing reduced upward momentum MACD has turned bearish with a clear signal of short-term downside pressure Strong selling pressure may push price toward $3,540 unless buyers regain control ETHUSD 1-day chart: Ethereum Rally Stalls as Overbought Signals Hint at Imminent Pullback Based on the 1-day chart on July 23, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated a sharp rally but is now encountering signs of overextension. The price has touched the upper Bollinger Band and is beginning to pull back slightly, suggesting the momentum may be cooling. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The RSI is at 79.14, firmly in overbought territory, which historically signals a potential correction or consolidation ahead. Despite the strong MACD reading, the bearish daily candle points to weakening bullish pressure. If ETH maintains support above $3,600, the trend could stabilize. However, a break below may lead to a deeper retracement toward the midline near $3,120 or lower. ETHUSD 4-hour chart analysis: Ethereum Consolidates Below Resistance as Momentum Weakens Near $3,640 Based on the 4-hour chart, Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a cooling phase after a strong rally. The price is hovering around the middle Bollinger Band, which means that there is a loss of bullish momentum. The MACD has crossed bearishly, with the MACD line significantly below the signal line, confirming short-term downside pressure. ETHUSD chart by TradingView Additionally, ETH’s Balance of Power is at -0.71, which means that there is a strong selling dominance. Unless ETH finds support near $3,635 or shows a rebound in buying volume, further downside toward the lower Bollinger Band near $3,540 is possible. A bullish recovery will require a MACD reversal and a shift in buyer sentiment. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 3,081.89 BUY SMA 5 $ 3,368.40 BUY SMA 10 $ 3,313.56 BUY SMA 21 $ 3,006.66 BUY SMA 50 $ 2,745.27 BUY SMA 100 $ 2,466.86 BUY SMA 200 $ 2,375.79 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 3,003.70 BUY EMA 5 $ 2,810.05 BUY EMA 10 $ 2,528.85 BUY EMA 21 $ 2,270.76 BUY EMA 50 $ 2,223.89 BUY EMA 100 $ 2,427.34 BUY EMA 200 $ 2,653.78 BUY What can you expect from the ETH price analysis next? Based on both the 1-day and 4-hour charts, Ethereum (ETH) appears to be entering a corrective phase following a sharp upward rally. The daily chart shows overbought conditions with an RSI near 79 and a bearish candle near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a possible short-term reversal or pause in upward momentum. On the 4-hour chart, price action is flattening near $3,640, with the MACD showing a bearish crossover and the Balance of Power deeply negative, confirming seller dominance. If ETH fails to hold above this level, further downside toward $3,540 is likely before any potential bullish continuation resumes. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,209 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $37,590, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,003 and a high of $11,875. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,413. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $53,844 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

This substantial funding is earmarked for an ambitious goal: to aggressively expand its Bitcoin accumulation holdings, with a clear target of accumulating up to 6,000 BTC by 2027. This bold strategic decision, initially reported by crypto analyst @btcNLNico on X, marks a pivotal moment, signaling a deepening commitment from publicly traded entities towards the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Accumulation: Matador Technologies’ Ambitious $100M Funding The announcement of Matador Technologies’ $100 million financing facility sends a powerful message to the market. For a company listed on a prominent stock exchange like the TSX Venture, dedicating such a substantial sum specifically to Bitcoin accumulation highlights a long-term conviction in BTC’s value proposition. This isn’t merely a speculative play; it suggests a strategic allocation designed to bolster the company’s balance sheet and potentially drive future growth through exposure to the digital asset space. Key details of this monumental move include: Significant Capital Injection: A $100 million financing facility provides Matador with considerable firepower to execute its acquisition strategy without immediately depleting existing operational capital. Clear Target: The goal of accumulating 6,000 BTC by 2027 is a precise and ambitious objective, indicating a well-defined roadmap for their digital asset portfolio expansion. Public Company Endorsement: Matador Technologies’ status as a publicly traded entity lends credibility and visibility to the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, potentially encouraging other traditional finance players to consider similar strategies. Long-Term Vision: The 2027 target horizon suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s sustained appreciation over the medium to long term, looking beyond short-term market fluctuations. This development is particularly noteworthy as it reflects a broader trend of corporations seeking to diversify their treasury holdings with non-traditional assets, especially those perceived as inflation hedges or stores of value in an uncertain economic climate. Understanding Matador’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Matador Technologies’ plan to accumulate 6,000 BTC isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about executing a sophisticated Bitcoin accumulation strategy within the confines of a publicly traded company. This involves careful consideration of market timing, liquidity, and regulatory compliance. While the exact mechanics of their purchasing strategy haven’t been fully disclosed, companies typically employ several methods: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: For large-volume purchases like those Matador intends, OTC desks are often preferred. They allow for private transactions, minimizing market impact and ensuring price stability for significant buys. Direct Exchange Purchases: While less likely for such large sums due to potential slippage, a portion could be acquired through major cryptocurrency exchanges. Strategic Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Rather than a single lump-sum purchase, Matador might employ a DCA strategy, buying smaller amounts of BTC regularly over time to mitigate volatility risks. This aligns well with their multi-year accumulation target. Beyond the acquisition, securing these assets is paramount. Matador will need robust custody solutions, likely involving institutional-grade cold storage providers, to protect their substantial Bitcoin holdings from cyber threats and unauthorized access. The decision to embark on such an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation path suggests a thorough risk assessment and a strong conviction in the asset’s future. The Strategic Imperative: Why Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation? Matador Technologies is not operating in a vacuum. Their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy aligns with a growing narrative among institutional investors and corporations that view Bitcoin as a legitimate, long-term asset. But why are more and more institutions turning to BTC? Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a modern-day digital equivalent to gold. Its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it inherently scarce, providing a strong hedge against currency debasement. Diversification Benefits: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification benefits, as its price movements are often uncorrelated with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds, especially over longer time horizons. Future-Proofing the Balance Sheet: Companies are recognizing that embracing digital assets is not just about speculation, but about positioning themselves for the future of finance. Holding Bitcoin can be seen as an investment in the evolving digital economy. Investor Demand: There’s increasing demand from shareholders and investors for companies to explore exposure to cryptocurrencies. Companies like Matador are responding to this evolving investor landscape, potentially attracting new capital by aligning with digital asset trends. This strategic imperative reflects a shift from viewing Bitcoin purely as a speculative asset to recognizing its potential as a core component of a diversified, forward-looking financial strategy. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Accumulation While the prospect of significant Bitcoin accumulation offers immense opportunities, it also comes with inherent challenges that Matador Technologies will undoubtedly navigate. Understanding these factors is crucial for appreciating the complexity of their strategy. Key Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A $100 million investment can see significant fluctuations in value, requiring a strong stomach and long-term perspective. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in policy could impact the value or usability of Bitcoin holdings. Custody and Security: Safely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks or loss, a critical operational concern for any company. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating Bitcoin into traditional financial statements and complying with accounting standards can be complex for publicly traded companies. Significant Opportunities: Capital Appreciation: If Bitcoin continues its historical trend of long-term growth, Matador’s 6,000 BTC target could yield substantial returns, significantly boosting shareholder value. Enhanced Market Perception: Being an early mover or significant holder in the institutional Bitcoin space can elevate a company’s profile, attracting tech-savvy investors and demonstrating innovation. Strategic Partnerships: Large Bitcoin holdings could open doors for partnerships within the burgeoning Web3 and blockchain ecosystems. Inflation Hedge: In an environment of rising inflation, Bitcoin offers a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies, preserving purchasing power. Matador’s success in this endeavor will largely depend on its ability to effectively manage these challenges while capitalizing on the inherent opportunities presented by strategic Bitcoin accumulation . Beyond Matador: The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation Matador Technologies’ bold move is more than just an isolated corporate decision; it’s a barometer for the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin accumulation . Their $100 million investment adds to a growing list of public companies, hedge funds, and traditional financial institutions that are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin. This trend suggests a maturing market where Bitcoin is moving beyond the realm of niche speculation and into mainstream financial strategies. As more companies follow suit, several ripple effects can be anticipated: Increased Market Stability: Greater institutional involvement can lead to more stable price action as large holders tend to have longer investment horizons, reducing short-term volatility. Development of Robust Infrastructure: The demand from institutions will drive further development of secure custody solutions, regulated investment products (like spot ETFs), and advanced trading platforms. Regulatory Clarity: As institutional adoption grows, pressure will mount on regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks for digital assets, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Mainstream Acceptance: Each new institutional player that embraces Bitcoin helps normalize its status as a legitimate asset class, eroding skepticism and fostering wider public acceptance. Matador’s ambition to hold 6,000 BTC by 2027 is a significant data point in this ongoing narrative, underscoring the long-term vision many institutional players now hold for Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape. Empowering Your Portfolio: Lessons from Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation While Matador Technologies operates on a scale far removed from the average retail investor, their strategic Bitcoin accumulation provides valuable lessons and insights that can empower individual portfolio decisions. It’s not about replicating their exact strategy, but understanding the underlying principles. Long-Term Vision: Matador’s 2027 target emphasizes a long-term perspective. For individual investors, this means focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition over years, rather than reacting to daily price swings. Strategic Allocation: Institutions like Matador allocate a specific portion of their capital to Bitcoin, not their entire treasury. This highlights the importance of diversification and responsible risk management for your own portfolio. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): The consistent accumulation approach is a powerful tool. By investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, you can average out your purchase price and reduce the impact of volatility. This is a strategy accessible to everyone. Research and Conviction: Matador’s move is backed by extensive research and a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. Similarly, individual investors should conduct their own due diligence and invest based on their understanding and belief in the asset. Security is Paramount: If a multi-million dollar company prioritizes secure custody, so should you. Use reputable exchanges, enable two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Matador Technologies’ journey to 6,000 BTC serves as a compelling case study, illustrating how a well-researched, long-term approach to Bitcoin accumulation can be integrated into a robust financial strategy, regardless of portfolio size. Matador Technologies’ securing of a $100 million financing facility for Bitcoin accumulation , targeting 6,000 BTC by 2027, is a testament to the increasing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic asset. This ambitious endeavor by a TSX Venture Exchange-listed company not only highlights a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value but also signals a growing trend of traditional finance embracing digital assets. As Matador embarks on this significant journey, its actions will undoubtedly be closely watched, potentially paving the way for further corporate adoption and reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a foundational element in the evolving global financial landscape. This move is a clear indicator that the future of finance is increasingly digital, with Bitcoin at its core. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Matador Technologies’ main goal with this $100 million financing? Matador Technologies aims to significantly expand its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, with a specific target of accumulating up to 6,000 BTC by the year 2027. This substantial financing facility is dedicated solely to this strategic Bitcoin accumulation. Q2: Why are publicly traded companies like Matador Technologies investing in Bitcoin? Companies are increasingly investing in Bitcoin for several strategic reasons, including its potential as a long-term store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a way to diversify corporate treasuries. It also signals an embrace of the evolving digital economy and can attract new types of investors. Q3: How does Matador Technologies plan to acquire such a large amount of Bitcoin? While specific methods aren’t fully disclosed, large-scale Bitcoin accumulation typically involves using Over-the-Counter (OTC) desks for private, high-volume transactions to minimize market impact, and potentially employing a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy to mitigate price volatility over time. Q4: What are the risks associated with a company engaging in Bitcoin accumulation? Key risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, potential changes in cryptocurrency regulations, the complexities of secure digital asset custody, and the accounting challenges of integrating crypto assets into traditional financial reporting. However, these are often weighed against the potential for significant returns. Q5: What does this mean for the average individual investor? Matador’s move underscores the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin. For individual investors, it reinforces the value of a long-term perspective, strategic asset allocation, and the potential benefits of dollar-cost averaging when considering Bitcoin accumulation for their own portfolios.

48794824,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=772278,1753278960,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48794824.jpeg,Berkshire won't be immune to Wall Street scrutiny without Warren Buffett at the helm,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/berkshire-wont-inherit-warrens-immunity/,"The legendary Warren Buffett has had a free pass on Wall Street for decades. Investors have put so much faith in him that they’ve basically ignored all the weird stuff Berkshire Hathaway does. No earnings calls. No guidance. No easy-to-read reports. It’s all accepted… because it’s Warren. But that era ends on January 1st 2026, when Greg Abel becomes CEO. And the big question now is: will Wall Street cut Abel the same kind of slack? He’s walking into a minefield. Berkshire is not your average company. Its financials are a labyrinth. Its assets are valued differently than how the market sees them. Its board includes family members. And it holds a huge chunk of cash without much explanation. Berkshire’s Kraft Heinz and Occidental bets test investor patience Take Kraft Heinz. Berkshire owns 27% of it, and as of March 31, they had it on their books at $13.5 billion. But the public stock price at the time valued the same stake at $9.9 billion. Today it’s dropped even more, to $9.4 billion. That’s a $4.1 billion difference. And that gap’s been there since early 2023. Here’s the twist. Berkshire doesn’t mark that stake to market. Instead, they use something called the equity method. It lets them value the investment based on Kraft Heinz’s earnings, not the stock price. It’s totally legal. But it’s not what most companies do with public stocks. Buffett could’ve written down the value this year. He didn’t. He decided the drop was just “temporary.” Now Kraft Heinz is trying to split itself up. That move might boost value if someone actually buys the separate parts. But investors aren’t impressed. After the Wall Street Journal reported the plan on July 11, the stock barely moved—up just 10%. Over the last year, it’s still down 12%. That’s not a market that’s excited. Then there’s Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire owns 28% of that one. As of March 31, they valued it at $17.2 billion. But Wall Street only thought it was worth $13.1 billion. Fast forward to now, and it’s even lower; $11.5 billion. So between Kraft Heinz and Occidental, there’s a $9.8 billion gap between Berkshire’s internal valuations and what the market says. That’s a lot of money to be off by, even for the Oracle of Omaha. But no one on the trading floor dares say a word. At any other public company, this would be a red flag. Investors would be all over it. But because it’s Warren, people look the other way. Why? Because he’s spent decades preaching that mark-to-market gains and losses are “meaningless.” Investors believe him. For now. But what happens when Abel is the one saying, “It’s temporary”? Will people still buy that? Or will they start asking real questions? Abel inherits Berkshire’s weird structure, family board, and huge cash pile Let’s talk about Berkshire’s overall setup. It’s not normal. It’s a messy mix of railroads, energy, insurance, retail, and more. It doesn’t report results like other companies. It doesn’t explain much. It doesn’t even hold quarterly calls. Some people love that. Others just stay quiet, because of Warren. You’ve got subsidiaries pulling in billions that only get a sentence or two in the annual report. And then there’s the insurance side, where the numbers are mostly estimates and assumptions. That makes credibility a big deal. Investors have to trust the people at the top. And right now, that trust is tied to Warren. Not Abel. The fact that Berkshire’s using internal valuations that are clearly higher than public stock prices makes it harder. Investors can check the real market prices any time. But they stay quiet because of who’s running the show. Once Abel takes over, that silence might end. And let’s not forget the war chest. Berkshire is sitting on $348 billion in cash and Treasury bills . That’s 30% of its assets, just sitting there, and we all keep waiting to see what Warren will do with it, but so far, nothing. He hasn’t even been buying back stock, with buybacks at zero for the first half of 2025 and the first quarter of 2025. That’s a signal. He thinks the stock is too expensive. All of this is what Abel’s walking into. He’s inheriting a company that’s been able to dodge scrutiny because of one man’s reputation. But that man won’t be CEO anymore. Sure, Warren will stay on as chairman. And sure, he’s endorsed Abel. But endorsements don’t transfer credibility. Trust has to be earned, especially when the numbers are this opaque. Abel was CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy before, and he’s been vice chairman since 2018. He knows the company more than anyone else, sure, but he doesn’t have the same immunity. Warren could say the sky is green and investors would nod. Abel says it? They’re checking satellite images. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Key on-chain metrics show a surprising trend: major holders aren’t moving their crypto to exchanges despite prices hovering just below all-time highs. The Confidence Signal According to a July 23 post by CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain, the Bitcoin Flow Pulse (BFP) indicator shows an unusually low volume of BTC heading to exchanges, even after the cryptocurrency hit a record $123,091, per CoinMarketCap, indicating a strong belief in the sustainability of the uptrend. Historically, spikes in BTC flowing into exchanges were usually signs of the intent to sell, increasing readily available supply, and often foreshadowing price drops. Arab Chain interpreted the absence of such a spike now as a bullish signal of strong hands holding firm. Bitcoin’s price journey reflects this tug-of-war between confidence and caution. While the asset is up 16.2% over the past month and 8.9% in two weeks, it has entered a consolidation phase since hitting its ATH nine days ago. Data from CoinGecko shows it was trading between $118,042 and $120,222 in the last 24 hours, but is facing resistance near $123,000. Furthermore, technical analysis from CryptoVizArt suggests there is potential for a deeper correction towards the $107,000 to $111,000 Fibonacci support zone if key near-term levels around $113,000 to $116,000 fail to hold. Whales Accumulate, Outlook Uncertain Elsewhere, CryptoQuant also revealed there has been an uptick in retail selling pressure, specifically on Binance. Inflows from smaller traders have jumped significantly on the exchange, and Net Taker Volume has turned negative, probably showing bearish sentiment among this cohort. Meanwhile, deep-pocketed investors are hoovering up everything in the market. On-chain data shows that $200 million in BTC was withdrawn from exchanges yesterday, suggesting the heavy hitters are capitalizing on the aforementioned retail fear. The divergence between the activities of these two classes echoes patterns seen earlier this year, when the flagship cryptocurrency rose from $78,000 to $111,000 within a few weeks. The market is now balanced on a knife-edge. While the low exchange inflows indicated by the BFP hint at strong high-conviction holding, profit-taking in some quarters and persistent retail selling have also introduced near-term headwinds that will need to be accounted for.

Join the Feline Frenzy! $CATZILLA Is on the Rise—Claim Your Share Today! Solana on the Rise: Can SOL Hit New Highs? Source: TradingView Solana’s price range is between $164.15 and $191.80. It’s showing a boost with a 1-month gain of almost 50%. Yet, it’s still below the 10-day average of $199.54, indicating cautious optimism. The current mood hints at a potential upward trend but the RSI is low, suggesting a lingering oversold condition. The first hurdle is at $202. Breaking it could propel SOL to $229.76, marking an upswing of about 20% if the second resistance is reached. The 6-month drop of over 22% shows its past struggles. But with such a recent spike, many believe Solana’s bullish journey could soon reignite. Ethereum (ETH) Poised for a Bullish Momentum Source: TradingView Ethereum is showing a strong upward trend with a monthly surge of nearly 65%. Currently priced between $3186 and $4076, it has broken past its 10-day and 100-day moving averages. The RSI is at 43.31, suggesting it’s not yet overbought, giving room for further growth. ETH is eyeing the resistance at $4394 and could push towards $5284, marking an increase of over 29% from its current top price. Despite recent slight dips as seen in the MACD, the Stochastic indicates a potential rebound. With these patterns, Ethereum could continue its bullish momentum, supported by the growing anticipation around altcoin season and a broader crypto bull run. XRP Could Be Poised for a Significant Breakout Source: TradingView XRP is on an exciting path. Trading between $2.95 and $3.81, it’s showing real potential for growth. The current trends are promising, with a monthly increase of over 70%. Though the RSI at 37.18 and the Stochastic at 13.07 are lower, indicating it could be oversold, this often precedes a bullish breakout. The key resistance level stands at $4.16. If XRP pushes past that, the next target is $5.02, which would represent over a 30% increase in value. Watching these levels closely could reveal if XRP is the next altcoin to surge in the anticipated bull run. Conclusion While SOL, ETH, and XRP may show limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a promising meme coin poised to offer significant returns. With a presale offering up to 700% ROI across 14 stages starting at $0.0002, it provides triple utility through governance, rewards, and staking. Catzilla aims to unite crypto enthusiasts to fight for financial freedom and invites participation by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, the performance of the U.S. stock markets often serves as a crucial barometer for broader economic health and investor sentiment. As the trading day commenced, major indices demonstrated a robust start, hinting at underlying confidence in the economy. This positive momentum is a development worth exploring, especially as traditional markets frequently set the tone for risk appetite across various asset classes, including digital currencies. What’s Fueling the Surge in U.S. Stock Markets Today? Today’s strong opening across the U.S. stock markets wasn’t just a random occurrence; it’s likely the culmination of several influential factors. Understanding these drivers is key to comprehending the current market landscape. When we observe the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all registering significant gains, it points to a broad-based positive sentiment. Here are some of the potential catalysts behind this promising start: Positive Economic Data: Recent economic reports, such as better-than-expected jobs figures or manufacturing data, often reassure investors about the economy’s resilience. Strong economic fundamentals typically translate into higher corporate earnings expectations. Optimistic Corporate Earnings: As earnings season progresses, companies reporting robust profits or providing upbeat guidance can significantly boost investor confidence. When a majority of companies perform well, it lifts the entire market. Stabilizing Inflation Expectations: Signs that inflation might be cooling, or that central banks are successfully managing price pressures, can lead to increased investor comfort. Lower inflation often implies less aggressive monetary policy, which is generally favorable for equity markets. Increased Investor Confidence: A general uptick in investor optimism, perhaps fueled by geopolitical stability or positive news flows, can lead to a “risk-on” environment where investors are more willing to allocate capital to equities. These intertwined factors create a fertile ground for a rally, demonstrating that even in uncertain times, periods of strong growth are always possible within the U.S. stock markets . Decoding the Performance of Key U.S. Stock Markets Indices To truly appreciate the scope of today’s market performance, let’s look at the specifics of how the primary U.S. stock markets indices fared at the open. Each index represents a different segment of the market, offering unique insights into which sectors are leading the charge. Today’s opening figures were: S&P 500: +0.39% – This broad market index tracks the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, making it a reliable gauge of overall U.S. equity market health. Its positive movement suggests widespread gains across various industries. NASDAQ: +0.35% – Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, the NASDAQ’s rise indicates renewed investor appetite for innovation and high-growth potential companies. This is particularly relevant for the crypto space, given its technological underpinnings. Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow): +0.50% – Comprising 30 significant U.S. companies, the Dow often reflects the health of traditional industrial and financial sectors. Its leading gain today suggests strength in established economic pillars. Here’s a quick snapshot of the impressive start: Index Today’s Open Gain What it Represents S&P 500 +0.39% Broad U.S. Market Performance NASDAQ +0.35% Technology and Growth Stocks Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.50% Traditional Industrial & Financial Sectors These gains, while seemingly modest individually, contribute to a powerful collective signal of market optimism. The synchronicity of these positive movements across the diverse landscape of the U.S. stock markets paints a picture of robust investor confidence. How Do U.S. Stock Markets Influence the Broader Economy and Crypto? It might seem counterintuitive for a cryptocurrency-focused audience to delve deep into traditional U.S. stock markets, but the reality is that these seemingly distinct worlds are increasingly interconnected. The performance of major equity indices often acts as a significant bellwether for global investor sentiment, which in turn, can have ripple effects on the highly correlated digital asset space. Here’s why the traditional market’s rally matters for crypto: Risk-On Sentiment: When traditional markets like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ perform well, it often signals a “risk-on” environment. This means investors are feeling confident and are more willing to take on risk, which can lead to capital flowing into higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a “risk-off” environment in traditional markets can see investors pulling back from crypto. Liquidity and Capital Flows: A strong stock market can generate wealth and increase overall market liquidity. This increased liquidity can sometimes spill over into other asset classes, including crypto, as investors seek new opportunities for growth. Economic Health Indicator: Robust U.S. stock markets performance generally indicates a healthy or improving economy. A strong economy often translates to more disposable income, potentially leading to increased investment in various assets, including digital ones. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional investors enter the crypto space, their investment decisions are often influenced by their broader portfolio performance and macro-economic outlook, which is heavily tied to traditional markets. Understanding these dynamics allows crypto investors to better anticipate broader market movements and make more informed decisions, recognizing that no asset class exists in a vacuum. Navigating the Dynamics: Potential Challenges and Future Outlook for U.S. Stock Markets While today’s opening is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial for any savvy investor to maintain a balanced perspective and consider potential headwinds. The journey of the U.S. stock markets is rarely a straight line, and various factors can introduce volatility or even reversals. Acknowledging these challenges is part of a comprehensive understanding of the market landscape. Potential challenges that could impact the ongoing rally include: Inflationary Pressures: Despite recent positive signs, persistent inflation could prompt central banks to maintain or even tighten monetary policy, potentially slowing economic growth and impacting corporate profits. Interest Rate Hikes: Further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve could make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, dampening economic activity and making bonds more attractive relative to stocks. Geopolitical Tensions: Global events, conflicts, or trade disputes can introduce significant uncertainty, leading to market instability and investor caution. Corporate Earnings Misses: While current earnings might be strong, any future widespread misses or downgraded outlooks from major companies could quickly reverse positive sentiment. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Lingering fears of a recession, even if mild, can keep investors on edge and limit sustained rallies. Looking ahead, market observers will be closely watching upcoming economic data releases, Federal Reserve statements, and corporate earnings reports. The interplay of these factors will largely determine the sustainability of the current upward trend in the U.S. stock markets . While optimism is warranted, vigilance remains key for navigating the unpredictable currents of the financial world. Actionable Insights for the Informed Investor: For those navigating the complexities of both traditional and digital assets, today’s market opening offers valuable lessons. Firstly, stay informed. Market movements are rarely isolated; they are often interconnected with broader economic trends. Secondly, consider diversification. While exciting, focusing solely on one asset class can expose you to undue risk. Thirdly, maintain a long-term perspective. Short-term fluctuations are normal, but a well-thought-out investment strategy often yields better results over time. Finally, remember that market sentiment can shift rapidly, so being prepared for various scenarios is paramount. In conclusion, the strong opening of the U.S. stock markets today, with the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow all showing impressive gains, is a positive indicator for investor confidence and economic resilience. This upward momentum, fueled by a confluence of favorable economic data and corporate performance, underscores the dynamic nature of financial markets. For crypto investors, this traditional market strength often signals a broader appetite for risk, potentially creating a more favorable environment for digital assets. While challenges and uncertainties always loom, today’s rally serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s capacity for growth and the interconnectedness of global finance. Staying informed and adaptable remains the best strategy for navigating these exciting times. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average? A1: These are major indices representing different segments of the U.S. stock market. The S&P 500 tracks 500 large U.S. companies and is a broad market indicator. The NASDAQ focuses on technology and growth stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average comprises 30 large, publicly owned companies and reflects the health of traditional industrial and financial sectors. Their movements provide insights into the overall market and specific sectors. Q2: Why do U.S. stock markets opening higher matter for cryptocurrency investors? A2: A strong performance in U.S. stock markets often indicates a “risk-on” sentiment among investors. This means they are more confident and willing to invest in higher-risk assets, which can include cryptocurrencies. It can also signal a healthier economy and increased liquidity, potentially benefiting the crypto market through spillover effects and institutional interest. Q3: What factors typically drive stock market rallies? A3: Stock market rallies are typically driven by positive economic data (e.g., strong jobs reports, GDP growth), robust corporate earnings, signs of easing inflation, investor confidence, and favorable monetary policies (e.g., stable or lower interest rates). Geopolitical stability can also contribute to a positive market environment. Q4: Are there any risks associated with current market trends, despite the positive opening? A4: Yes, risks always exist. Potential challenges include persistent inflationary pressures, further interest rate hikes by central banks, unexpected geopolitical events, disappointing future corporate earnings, and lingering concerns about an economic slowdown. Investors should remain vigilant and consider these factors when making decisions. Q5: How can investors stay informed about market movements and their implications? A5: Investors can stay informed by regularly consulting reputable financial news outlets, economic reports from government agencies, central bank statements, and company earnings reports. Following expert analysis and understanding key economic indicators are also crucial for making informed investment decisions. Did you find this analysis of the U.S. stock markets insightful?

Meanwhile, the Hedera (HBAR) price analysis points to a slowdown near $0.27, with a possible $46 million risk if it drops to $0.24. BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention for a different reason. The live demo will reveal how the X1 app and X10 miner work together to increase BDAG mining output by 10x. As the GLOBAL LAUNCH release gets closer and the presale price holds at $0.0016, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised over $350 million. That puts it among the top crypto coins right now. Binance Coin Price Holds Up with Strong DEX Volume Binance Coin (BNB) has seen a strong rise this year, up more than 50% from its lows and recently reaching $765. The current Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows clear support, with steady buying keeping it above trend levels. One key reason is its use in decentralized exchanges. BNB recently recorded over $191 billion in volume, outpacing Ethereum, Solana, and others. It is also active in stablecoin use, with over 500 million transactions in the past month. With more than $1 billion in BNB burned each month, the supply continues to drop. If BNB can break past $792, the $1,000 target may be closer than it seems. HBAR Slows Down After Reaching Five-Month High Hedera (HBAR) is now trading at $0.27 after a strong week, hitting its highest point in five months. But that upward push might be losing steam. The RSI staying above 70 could mean the price has moved too fast and might dip soon. A fall to $0.24 could trigger liquidations worth $46 million in long trades, which might send the price down further. On the other hand, if HBAR stays above $0.26, a move to $0.30 could still be possible. This Hedera (HBAR) price analysis shows the coin sitting between more upside and a potential pullback. Countdown Begins: BlockDAG to Show 10x Mining Setup in Action BlockDAG has focused on results, not hype. In just 24 hours, it’s ready to show what its mining system can really do. A live demo will reveal how the X1 Mobile Miner and X10 Hardware combine to turn smaller daily rewards into bigger gains. The X1 app already has over 2 million users mining BDAG directly from their smartphones. When used with the X10, a compact device that plugs in easily, the mining output can rise by as much as 10 times. This setup is built to be quiet, simple, and usable even for people with no mining experience. BlockDAG is also offering something rare in the crypto world: full access from day one. Those who join using the NO VESTING PASS will get 100% of their BDAG at launch. There’s no wait, no release schedule, just full access. But this option ends in 2 days and won’t be available again, making it a short window for early access. The stats are clear. With over $350 million raised and 24.3 billion BDAG sold, BlockDAG is gaining strong momentum. The coin’s price has moved from $0.001 to $0.0276, giving early users a return of 2,660%. Now, during the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, it’s priced at $0.0016 with a possible 3,025% upside if it hits $0.05 at launch. With rising user numbers, live mining tools, and no-vesting features, BDAG is now one of the top crypto coins right now. Final Word on What’s Moving the Market Binance Coin (BNB) and Hedera (HBAR) have both seen strong activity recently. The Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows over 50% growth this year, driven by active DEX use and steady coin burns, with eyes now on the $1,000 mark. The Hedera (HBAR) price analysis shows a climb to $0.27, its highest in five months, but also highlights risks, including signs of overbuying and a $46 million liquidation threat if it falls to $0.24. BlockDAG, however, is drawing attention for different reasons. Its live demo is just hours away, where the X1 and X10 setup will show how mining returns can jump 10x. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release near, a presale price of $0.0016, and over $350 million already raised, BlockDAG is standing out among the top crypto coins right now .

The discovery was brought to public attention by prominent blockchain researcher Vet via a post on X, where he questioned whether Ripple, the entity listed as the originator of the fund, owns or controls the accounts. While the transaction history shows that the wallets were activated by Ripple, closer inspection reveals several inconsistencies that challenge that assumption. The lack of basic account setup features that Ripple typically employs in its operational wallets has raised eyebrows across the XRP community, with many now asking: if not Ripple, then who? 2 New XRP Ledger accounts activated by Ripple with 200,000,000 XRP each. I don't believe these are Ripple owned accounts. Ripple typically configures their XRP accounts with proper account sets and multi signer. These are not done like that. Who owns these accounts? pic.twitter.com/QR4Xyw6pGu — Vet (@Vet_X0) July 23, 2025 Unusual Account Structure Raises Doubts Both accounts, activated on July 22 and July 23 , respectively, were funded with 200 million XRP each, an unusually large amount to assign to a new wallet. More significantly, these accounts are not registered with any username, have no multi-signature configuration, and show no signs of the customary security parameters Ripple uses to protect institutional-grade wallets. Ripple, known for its disciplined treasury management and internal compliance standards, has historically implemented account settings such as requireDestinationTag, disableMasterKey, and multi-signer configurations to prevent unauthorized access. None of these appear to be enabled in the two new accounts, making them stand out as potential outliers in Ripple’s operational playbook. On-Chain Footprint Traces Back to Ripple Despite the unusual structure, on-chain data confirms that Ripple activated both accounts. The metadata clearly states “Activated by: Ripple” and shows the precise time of activation—05:01 UTC on July 22 and 05:03 UTC on July 23. The funding source appears to be tied to Ripple-associated wallets, suggesting at least indirect involvement. However, this does not conclusively mean that Ripple is the end-user or the beneficiary of the funds. In past transactions, Ripple has activated accounts on behalf of third parties, partners, custodians, and institutions, as part of onboarding or strategic distribution processes. But in such cases, the accounts are usually properly configured from the outset, which further fuels the confusion surrounding these two. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Use Cases and Theories Some in the community speculate that the funds could be earmarked for over-the-counter (OTC) settlements, private liquidity provisioning, or onboarding of institutional clients. Others suggest it could be linked to Ripple’s expanding partnerships or future tokenization plans. There’s also a theory that these accounts might be controlled by Ripple subsidiaries or custody providers such as Standard Custody or Metaco, though no official link has been established. Still, none of these explanations fully align with the current account configurations. If the funds were intended for institutions or custodial purposes, the lack of security features would be both uncharacteristic and risky, especially given the scale of value involved. Community Reaction and Ongoing Scrutiny Vet’s analysis, supported by screenshots and XRPL data, has driven a wave of discussion among analysts and XRP holders. Many are closely watching these wallets for any movement, whether transactions, changes in account settings, or public disclosures, that could reveal their true purpose or ownership. So far, the wallets remain idle, with their 200 million XRP balances untouched. Until further on-chain activity offers more clarity, the identity of the beneficiaries behind these newly activated wallets remains a mystery. What’s clear, however, is that these transactions have introduced a new layer of intrigue into the XRP ecosystem, raising important questions about transparency, security, and the future deployment of massive XRP reserves.

Recently, the cryptocurrency community witnessed one such event, with a staggering $113 million worth of futures liquidated in just one hour across major exchanges. This sudden flush was part of an even larger picture: a colossal $409 million worth of futures liquidated over the past 24 hours. These numbers aren’t just figures on a screen; they represent real money, real traders, and a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in crypto futures trading. But what exactly are these crypto liquidations , and what do they mean for you and the broader market? Understanding the Mechanics of Crypto Liquidations Before diving deeper into the recent market movements, it’s crucial to understand the core concept of crypto liquidations . Simply put, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a significant loss. This happens because the trader’s margin balance (the collateral they put up for their leveraged trade) falls below a certain threshold required to keep the position open. It’s an automated process designed to prevent a trader’s losses from exceeding their initial margin and to protect the exchange from potential bad debt. Think of it like this: Leverage: You borrow funds from an exchange to amplify your potential returns. If you have 10x leverage, a $1,000 investment controls $10,000 worth of crypto. Margin: Your initial $1,000 is your margin, acting as collateral. Price Movement: If the market moves against your position, your losses start eating into your margin. Margin Call/Liquidation Price: The exchange calculates a ‘liquidation price’. If the asset’s price hits this point, your position is automatically closed to prevent further losses. This mechanism, while a safeguard for exchanges, can be brutal for traders, especially during periods of high volatility. The recent event highlights just how quickly fortunes can turn when trading with leverage. The Recent Shockwave: Numbers Behind the Carnage The numbers from the past 24 hours paint a stark picture of the market’s recent turbulence. A rapid price swing, likely triggered by a significant market event or a cascade of selling pressure, led to a domino effect of liquidations. Here’s a quick breakdown of the reported figures: Timeframe Total Futures Liquidated Impact Past Hour $113 Million Sudden, concentrated losses for highly leveraged positions. Past 24 Hours $409 Million Broader market impact, indicating sustained volatility. These figures indicate that many traders were caught on the wrong side of a rapid price movement, often amplified by high leverage. While specific details about which coins or exchanges saw the most liquidations are not provided in the initial report, it’s typical for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures to account for the largest share of such events due to their high trading volumes and liquidity. Why Do Such Massive Crypto Liquidations Occur? Massive crypto liquidations are not random events; they are typically the culmination of several factors interacting within a volatile market. Understanding these triggers is key to appreciating the risks involved in futures trading: Sudden Price Swings: The most direct cause. A rapid pump or dump in price can quickly push leveraged positions to their liquidation points. High Leverage: While leverage can magnify gains, it equally magnifies losses. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement needed to trigger a liquidation. Many traders, seeking quick profits, often over-leverage, making them extremely vulnerable. Market Sentiment and News: Negative news (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, major hacks, economic downturns) or shifts in market sentiment can lead to panic selling, causing prices to tumble rapidly and trigger liquidations. Whale Activity: Large traders or institutions (‘whales’) can execute massive trades that significantly impact prices, intentionally or unintentionally triggering a cascade of liquidations. Cascading Liquidations: When one set of liquidations occurs, the forced selling can further depress prices, leading to more liquidations, creating a dangerous feedback loop. This ‘liquidation cascade’ can exacerbate market downturns. The recent $113 million hourly flush suggests a particularly sharp, unexpected price movement caught a large number of long or short positions off guard, indicating the market’s inherent sensitivity to sudden shifts. Impact on the Crypto Market: A Ripple Effect? When significant crypto liquidations occur, their effects ripple far beyond the individual traders involved. What kind of impact can we expect to see? Increased Volatility: Liquidations often lead to more price swings as forced selling adds downward pressure, or forced buying (in the case of short liquidations) adds upward pressure. Market Sentiment Shift: Large liquidation events can sow fear and uncertainty among traders, leading to a more cautious or bearish outlook in the short term. Reduced Open Interest: The total value of outstanding derivatives contracts (open interest) often decreases after major liquidations, indicating that leveraged positions have been cleared out. This can sometimes ‘reset’ the market for future moves. Opportunities for Savvy Traders: While devastating for some, these events can present opportunities for experienced traders to enter positions at lower prices or profit from increased volatility. The market’s ability to absorb such shocks and recover is a testament to its resilience, but these events serve as stark reminders of the risks involved. Who Gets Hit Hardest by Crypto Liquidations? While liquidations affect all types of traders, certain groups tend to bear the brunt of these events. Generally, those with the highest leverage and least risk management are most vulnerable. This often includes: New and Inexperienced Traders: Lured by the promise of amplified gains, new traders often use excessive leverage without fully understanding the risks or implementing proper stop-loss strategies. Retail Traders: While institutional players also use leverage, retail traders often have smaller capital bases, making them more susceptible to quick margin calls. Traders with Concentrated Positions: Those who put a large portion of their capital into a single highly leveraged trade are at extreme risk if that trade goes sour. Diversification, even within futures trading, can mitigate some risk. It’s a harsh lesson that the market often teaches: leverage is a double-edged sword, and discipline is paramount. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies to Mitigate Risk from Crypto Liquidations Given the inherent volatility and the potential for rapid crypto liquidations , how can traders protect themselves and navigate these turbulent waters? Here are some actionable insights and strategies: Understand Leverage Thoroughly: Don’t just pick the highest leverage available. Understand what 5x, 10x, or 50x leverage truly means for your liquidation price. Lower leverage equals greater buffer. Always Use Stop-Loss Orders: This is perhaps the most critical tool. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses and preventing liquidation. Set it at a point where you’re comfortable exiting the trade. Manage Your Position Size: Never risk more than a small percentage of your total trading capital on any single trade. Even if you get liquidated, it shouldn’t wipe out your entire portfolio. Maintain Sufficient Margin: Keep an eye on your margin ratio. If it’s getting low, consider adding more collateral to your position to lower your liquidation price and give your trade more breathing room. Diversify Your Portfolio: While primarily for spot trading, the principle applies to futures. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If you must trade multiple futures contracts, spread your risk. Stay Informed and Monitor News: Keep up with market news, economic indicators, and regulatory developments that could impact crypto prices. Unexpected news often triggers sharp movements. Practice Risk Management: Develop a trading plan that includes entry and exit strategies, risk-reward ratios, and rules for when to cut losses. Stick to your plan rigorously. Consider Hedging Strategies: More advanced traders might use hedging techniques, such as taking an opposite position in another market or using options, to offset potential losses in their futures positions. Remember, the goal isn’t to avoid all losses (which is impossible), but to manage them effectively so that no single event, like a liquidation, can derail your entire trading journey. Lessons Learned from Past Liquidations This isn’t the first time the crypto market has seen massive crypto liquidations , and it certainly won’t be the last. Past events, such as the ‘Black Thursday’ crash in March 2020 or various periods of significant deleveraging, have repeatedly demonstrated the fragility of over-leveraged markets. Each major liquidation event serves as a harsh but valuable lesson: The Market is Unforgiving: It does not care about your hopes or financial needs. Leverage is a Tool, Not a Toy: It requires respect and careful handling. Risk Management is Non-Negotiable: It’s the difference between surviving a downturn and being wiped out. Those who learn from these cycles often emerge stronger, adopting more disciplined and sustainable trading practices. The Future of Crypto Futures: What’s Next? Despite the dramatic headlines surrounding crypto liquidations , futures trading remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering tools for hedging, speculation, and price discovery. The market continues to mature, with exchanges implementing more robust risk management systems and offering educational resources. As the industry evolves, we may see: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are paying closer attention to derivatives markets, which could lead to stricter rules on leverage limits and investor protection. More Sophisticated Trading Tools: AI and advanced algorithms are increasingly used by traders to manage risk and execute strategies more efficiently. Greater Market Resilience: As the market deepens and more institutional players enter, its ability to absorb large liquidation events without catastrophic collapses may improve. The future will likely involve a balance between the innovation that crypto markets are known for and the necessary safeguards to protect participants. The recent crypto liquidations serve as a potent reminder of the raw power and inherent risks within the digital asset space. While the numbers—$113 million in an hour, $409 million in 24 hours—are startling, they are also invaluable data points for understanding market dynamics. For every liquidation, there’s a lesson in risk management, the importance of understanding leverage, and the need for a disciplined approach to trading. The crypto market is a place of incredible opportunity, but it demands respect for its volatility. By prioritizing sound strategies and continuous learning, traders can better navigate these turbulent waters and potentially thrive, even when the market unleashes its next shockwave. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below a required threshold, typically due to adverse price movements. This mechanism protects both the trader from deeper debt and the exchange from unrecoverable losses. How does leverage contribute to crypto liquidations? Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. While it allows traders to control a larger position with less capital, it also means that smaller adverse price movements can lead to your margin being insufficient to cover potential losses, triggering a liquidation at a specific ‘liquidation price’. Are crypto liquidations always bad for the market? While devastating for the individual traders involved, large liquidation events can sometimes act as a ‘reset’ for the market by clearing out excessive leverage. This can reduce overall market risk in the long term, though they often cause short-term volatility and negative sentiment. What can I do to avoid being liquidated? To avoid crypto liquidations , prioritize risk management: use lower leverage, always set stop-loss orders, manage your position size relative to your total capital, maintain sufficient margin, and stay informed about market conditions. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Which cryptocurrencies are most susceptible to liquidations? Generally, cryptocurrencies with high trading volume and liquidity, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), tend to see the largest liquidation amounts simply because more futures contracts are traded on them. However, any highly volatile altcoin can also experience significant liquidations if large leveraged positions are open. How do major exchanges handle liquidations? Major exchanges use automated liquidation engines that monitor positions in real-time. When a position hits its liquidation price, the engine takes over, often trying to close the position quickly in the market or through an insurance fund mechanism to cover any remaining deficit. They also provide risk parameters and margin requirements to traders. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

According to both firms, institutional clients of BNY will now be able to invest in these funds, and ownership will be recorded directly on Goldman Sachs’ blockchain. This brings blockchain smack into the center of the $7.1 trillion money market fund sector. And no, they’re not going at it alone. Giants like BlackRock , Fidelity Investments, and Federated Hermes are already onboard. Plus, the asset management arms of Goldman Sachs and BNY are part of the deal. The tech, the money, and the muscle are already lined up. Let’s talk about the actual market here. Money market funds are mutual funds that usually hold short-term assets like Treasuries, commercial paper, or repurchase agreements. They’re seen as ultra-safe and super liquid, which is why investors have thrown about $2.5 trillion into them since the Fed started jacking up rates in 2022, according to data from CNBC. BNY clients to access tokenized funds via Goldman’s blockchain Just last week, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, which finally brought stablecoins into the U.S. legal framework. That opened the floodgates. JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup, and Bank of America said they’re now actively exploring stablecoin payments. But unlike stablecoins, which just track the U.S. dollar, tokenized money market funds pay a yield. That alone makes them way more attractive to hedge funds, pension managers, and corporate treasurers looking for safe places to stash large sums of cash. Think of it as parking cash with benefits. Laide Majiyagbe, who leads liquidity and collateral at BNY, explained it this way: “We have created the ability for our clients to invest in tokenized money market share classes across a number of fund companies.” She added, “The step of tokenizing is important, because today that will enable seamless and efficient transactions, without the frictions that happen in traditional markets.” So here’s how it works: Goldman Sachs and BNY are using blockchain to create digital certificates of ownership for these funds. Once tokenized, the assets are easier to move, faster to settle, and available 24/7. That last part alone kills the old problem of markets closing at 4 p.m. or settling only during certain hours. These things will move anytime, day or night. To keep everything clean for investors used to the old system, BNY will still maintain traditional records. So they’re layering the new tech over the legacy system for now. That way, nobody gets burned in the transition. Tokenized funds enable real-time collateral and trading Goldman Sachs and BNY see this as a foundation for a full digital trading ecosystem. Picture a future where global payments happen through stablecoins, and money markets get managed via tokenized funds. It’s a real-time, always-on system with zero middlemen clogging things up. Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs’ head of digital assets, said: “The sheer scale of this market just offers a huge opportunity to create a lot more efficiency across the whole financial plumbing. That is what’s really powerful, because you’re creating utility in an instrument where it doesn’t exist today.” Right now, if a hedge fund needs to post collateral, they often have to sell a fund, wait for settlement, and deliver cash; all that takes time. With tokenized funds, you just transfer the token, done, saving both capital and time, two things no one likes to waste. Under the traditional model, these funds can be redeemed in a day or two, but only during market hours. With the tokenized model, that timeline shrinks. Transactions can now happen instantly, any time of day. That’s a massive improvement for traders, treasury managers, and anyone who hates waiting.

For those immersed in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, seemingly distant policy shifts, like those concerning Trump tariffs , can unexpectedly influence market sentiment, investor behavior, and even the fundamental demand for decentralized assets. Recent statements from former U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social have once again brought the spotlight onto his distinctive approach to trade, signaling a potential return to a policy framework where lower tariffs are directly conditional on a country’s willingness to open its markets. This strategy, a hallmark of his previous administration, carries profound implications not just for international commerce but potentially for the very stability that influences digital asset valuations. What Are Trump Tariffs and Why Do They Matter for Global Trade? At its core, a tariff is a tax imposed by a government on goods and services imported from other countries. These taxes are typically used to restrict trade, increase the price of imported goods, and protect domestic industries from foreign competition. While tariffs have been a tool in international trade for centuries, former President Trump’s application of them was marked by a specific philosophy: reciprocity and leverage. During his previous term, Trump tariffs were often implemented with the explicit goal of forcing other nations to the negotiating table. The underlying belief was that many countries had erected unfair barriers to U.S. goods and services, while the U.S. market remained relatively open. This perceived imbalance, in Trump’s view, necessitated a strong response. His recent statement reinforces this stance, making it clear that tariff reductions are not a given but a reward for market liberalization. Why does this matter for global trade? Because it challenges the conventional wisdom of multilateral trade agreements and often favors bilateral negotiations. It signals a shift from broad, rules-based trade to a more transactional, conditional approach. This can lead to: Increased Bilateral Negotiations: Countries might feel compelled to negotiate directly with the U.S. to avoid higher tariffs. Trade Volatility: The unpredictable nature of tariff threats and implementations can create uncertainty for businesses and investors. Supply Chain Re-evaluation: Companies may look to diversify their manufacturing and sourcing to mitigate tariff risks. How Do Trump Tariffs Impact Market Openness and U.S. Businesses? The central tenet of Trump’s latest declaration is clear: lower tariffs are a reward for countries that agree to open their markets. Conversely, nations unwilling to do so face the prospect of even higher tariffs. This is a direct challenge to existing trade structures and a powerful incentive for other economies to reassess their own trade barriers. Consider the example of Japan. Trump specifically highlighted that Japan’s markets are now open “for the first time.” While the extent and specific details of this openness are complex and have been subject to ongoing negotiations, Trump’s statement frames it as a direct consequence of his administration’s pressure and a model for future trade relations. For U.S. businesses, this development could be significant: Access to New Consumers: If major economies like Japan genuinely open their markets, U.S. companies could gain easier access to millions of new customers for their products and services. Reduced Non-Tariff Barriers: Market openness isn’t just about tariffs. It often involves reducing regulatory hurdles, easing licensing requirements, and ensuring fair competition for foreign companies within a domestic market. Competitive Advantage: U.S. businesses that can now operate more freely in previously restricted markets might see increased sales and profitability, potentially leading to job growth and economic expansion at home. However, the impact of Trump tariffs on market openness is a double-edged sword. While some markets might open, others could become more protectionist in response, leading to trade disputes and a fragmentation of the global economy. Navigating the Waters: The Global Implications of Trump Tariffs The potential return of a policy emphasizing conditional Trump tariffs sends a clear signal across the global economic landscape. It suggests a more assertive U.S. stance on trade, one that prioritizes perceived fairness and reciprocity over established multilateral frameworks. This approach has several broader implications: Potential for Trade Wars: The most significant risk is that countries targeted with higher tariffs might retaliate with their own duties on U.S. goods, escalating into a full-blown trade war. Such conflicts can harm global economic growth, increase consumer prices, and disrupt intricate supply chains built over decades. Shifting Alliances: Nations might find themselves having to choose sides or form new trade blocs to mitigate the impact of U.S. policies. This could reshape geopolitical alliances and economic partnerships. Impact on Developing Economies: Smaller or developing economies, often reliant on export-led growth, could be particularly vulnerable to sudden shifts in major power trade policies. They might lack the leverage to negotiate favorable terms or absorb the impact of increased tariffs. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imports. When applied, they increase the cost of goods for consumers and businesses. This can contribute to domestic inflation, reducing purchasing power and potentially leading to higher interest rates. Key Considerations for Global Trade Under Conditional Tariffs Aspect Potential Benefit Potential Challenge Market Access New opportunities for U.S. exporters in opened markets. Retaliation may close existing markets for U.S. goods. Supply Chains Incentive to reshore or nearshore production, enhancing resilience. Disruption, increased costs, and complexity for global businesses. Consumer Prices Possible lower prices if foreign markets become more competitive. Higher prices for imported goods due to tariffs. Global Relations Stronger bilateral trade agreements with specific partners. Increased international friction and weakened multilateral institutions. From Trade Walls to Digital Wallets: How Trump Tariffs Could Influence Crypto? While Trump tariffs are firmly rooted in traditional economics, their ripple effects can extend into the burgeoning world of digital assets. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that significant shifts in trade policy can influence investor sentiment and capital flows, potentially impacting cryptocurrency markets in several ways: Economic Uncertainty and Safe Havens: Increased trade tensions and economic uncertainty, fueled by tariff disputes, can lead investors to seek safe-haven assets. While traditionally gold has filled this role, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly seen by some as a digital alternative, independent of any single nation’s economic policy. Inflationary Hedging: If tariffs lead to higher import costs and domestic inflation, the purchasing power of traditional fiat currencies may erode. This could make cryptocurrencies, particularly those with fixed supplies like Bitcoin, more attractive as a hedge against inflation. Push for Decentralization: A world grappling with protectionist trade policies and nationalistic economic agendas might inadvertently highlight the benefits of decentralized, borderless financial systems. Cryptocurrencies, by their nature, are designed to operate without central authority, potentially appealing to those seeking alternatives to traditional, government-controlled financial infrastructures. Capital Flight: In scenarios where specific countries face severe economic pressure due to tariffs, capital might seek refuge in more stable or less regulated assets, including cryptocurrencies, leading to increased demand. It’s important to note that the crypto market is influenced by many factors, and trade policy is just one. However, the macro-economic shifts caused by policies like Trump tariffs are significant enough to warrant attention from crypto investors and enthusiasts. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the Era of Conditional Trump Tariffs Whether you’re a business owner, an investor, or simply an observer of global economics, understanding the potential ramifications of these trade policies is key. Here are some actionable insights: For Businesses: Diversify Supply Chains: Reduce reliance on single countries for sourcing and manufacturing to mitigate tariff risks. Monitor Policy Developments: Stay informed about trade negotiations and tariff announcements, especially concerning key markets. Assess Market Access: Evaluate opportunities in markets that may open due to U.S. pressure, and prepare to capitalize on them. For Investors: Understand Macro Trends: Recognize how global trade policies can influence economic stability, inflation, and currency valuations, which in turn affect traditional and digital asset markets. Consider Portfolio Diversification: Explore assets that traditionally perform well during periods of economic uncertainty, including potentially certain cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed on Geopolitics: Geopolitical tensions often correlate with trade policy shifts and can have a direct impact on market sentiment. For Consumers: Be Aware of Price Changes: Tariffs can increase the cost of imported goods, impacting everyday purchases. Support Local: Increased tariffs on imports might make domestic products more competitive, encouraging local consumption. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Global Trade? Donald Trump’s consistent message regarding trade, particularly his recent reiteration on Truth Social about conditional Trump tariffs , signals a clear intent to reshape global commerce. This strategy, demanding market openness in exchange for lower tariffs, aims to level the playing field for U.S. businesses while potentially ushering in a new era of bilateral trade negotiations. While the promise of increased access to foreign markets for American companies is compelling, the path forward is complex, fraught with the potential for trade disputes and economic volatility. For the crypto community, these traditional economic shifts are not isolated events; they contribute to the broader macroeconomic environment that can influence the appeal and performance of digital assets. As the world navigates these evolving trade dynamics, adaptability and informed decision-making will be paramount for businesses, investors, and consumers alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are Trump tariffs? Trump tariffs refer to the import duties (taxes) imposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administrations on goods from various countries. These tariffs were primarily aimed at protecting domestic industries, reducing trade deficits, and compelling trading partners to open their markets or renegotiate trade agreements perceived as unfair. How do tariffs promote market openness? The Trump administration’s strategy uses tariffs as leverage. By threatening or imposing higher tariffs, the U.S. aims to pressure countries into removing their own trade barriers, such as non-tariff regulations, quotas, or restrictive licensing requirements, thereby making their markets more accessible for U.S. goods and services. The idea is that countries will open their markets to avoid the economic pain of U.S. tariffs. What was the outcome of Trump’s trade approach with Japan? As noted by Donald Trump, Japan’s markets are now considered more open, which he attributes to his administration’s trade strategy. This development likely refers to agreements like the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement, which reduced tariffs on certain agricultural and industrial products and addressed digital trade issues, leading to increased market access for U.S. goods. How might these trade policies affect global supply chains? Conditional tariffs can significantly disrupt global supply chains. Businesses might need to re-evaluate where they source materials and manufacture products to avoid high tariffs. This could lead to reshoring (bringing production back to the U.S.), nearshoring (moving production to neighboring countries), or diversifying supply chains across multiple nations to reduce risk and cost. Can Trump tariffs indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets? Yes, indirectly. Trade policies that lead to economic uncertainty, inflation, or geopolitical instability can influence investor behavior. If traditional markets become volatile or less attractive due to tariffs, some investors might seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies, viewing them as a hedge against economic instability or a decentralized alternative to traditional finance. Are conditional tariffs a common tool in international trade? While tariffs are a common trade tool, the explicit and widespread use of them as leverage for broad market openness, as pursued by the Trump administration, represents a more assertive and transactional approach compared to traditional multilateral trade negotiations focused on reciprocal tariff reductions and rules-based systems.

In a mere sixty minutes, an astonishing $227 million worth of crypto futures liquidation swept across major exchanges. This hourly figure alone highlights the intense volatility and the high-stakes nature of leveraged trading in digital assets. Extending this view, the past 24 hours saw an even more staggering $524 million worth of futures liquidated . Such significant events are not just numbers; they represent substantial losses for many traders and offer crucial insights into market dynamics. But what exactly is a crypto futures liquidation, and what does an event of this magnitude tell us about the current state of the crypto market? Understanding Crypto Futures Liquidation: What Just Happened? To grasp the gravity of a crypto futures liquidation , it’s essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of futures trading in the cryptocurrency space. A futures contract is essentially an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Traders use these contracts to speculate on future price movements without owning the underlying asset directly. The allure, and often the danger, lies in leverage. Leverage allows traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital. For instance, with 10x leverage, a trader can control $10,000 worth of Bitcoin with just $1,000 of their own money. While this amplifies potential profits, it equally magnifies potential losses. When the market moves against a leveraged position, the trader’s equity (margin) decreases. If this equity falls below a certain threshold – known as the maintenance margin – the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for the trader and the exchange. This forced closure is what we call a crypto futures liquidation . The recent event, where $227 million worth of futures were liquidated in just one hour, suggests a sudden and sharp price movement in one direction, catching a large number of leveraged traders off guard. It typically happens when: Sudden Price Swings: An unexpected surge or drop in the price of a major cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) triggers margin calls for many positions simultaneously. High Leverage: Traders using excessive leverage are more susceptible to liquidation, as even small price movements can wipe out their margin. Cascading Effects: Liquidations can trigger further price drops as large positions are force-sold, creating a domino effect that leads to more liquidations. The Immediate Impact: Analyzing the $227 Million Shockwave The rapid $227 million crypto futures liquidation within an hour, followed by the broader $524 million over 24 hours, indicates a period of extreme market volatility and significant directional pressure. Such a large-scale event points to a few key observations: Unsuspecting Traders Caught Off Guard: A substantial number of traders were likely positioned in the wrong direction, perhaps expecting a rally when the market dumped, or vice versa. This suggests a lack of robust risk management strategies among some participants. Dominant Market Direction: The sheer volume of liquidations in a short period usually signifies a strong, sustained move in one direction. For instance, if the majority of liquidated positions were ‘long’ (betting on price increase), it implies a sharp price decline. Conversely, if ‘short’ positions were liquidated, it indicates a sudden price pump. Exacerbated Volatility: Liquidations themselves can intensify market movements. When positions are force-closed, the underlying assets are sold (or bought) on the market, adding to the existing selling (or buying) pressure. This creates a feedback loop, accelerating price changes and leading to more liquidations. This kind of market event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged crypto derivatives trading. It highlights the importance of not only predicting market direction but also understanding the mechanics of how exchanges manage risk and how that impacts individual traders. Why Do Such Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations Occur So Frequently? While the recent crypto futures liquidation event was significant, similar incidents, albeit of varying magnitudes, are not uncommon in the crypto market. Several factors contribute to their frequent occurrence: 1. Unregulated Leverage: Unlike traditional finance, many crypto exchanges offer extremely high leverage options (up to 100x or even more). This allows traders to take on enormous risk with minimal capital, making them highly vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations. 2. 24/7 Market Activity: The crypto market never sleeps. This constant activity means price movements can occur at any time, catching traders off guard, especially those who aren’t actively monitoring their positions or have insufficient stop-loss orders in place. 3. Market Manipulation and Whale Activity: Large holders (whales) can sometimes execute significant trades that trigger rapid price movements. These “whale” movements can intentionally or unintentionally trigger a cascade of liquidations, benefiting those who anticipated the move. 4. Emotional Trading: The highly volatile nature of crypto often leads to emotional decision-making. Traders might over-leverage, fail to set stop-losses, or panic-sell/buy, exacerbating their losses during market downturns or missing opportunities during rallies. 5. Lack of Proper Risk Management: Many retail traders, drawn by the promise of quick riches, often overlook or underestimate the importance of robust risk management strategies. This includes not having a clear exit strategy, inadequate position sizing, and neglecting to use tools like stop-loss orders. Navigating the Turbulence: Strategies for Traders Amidst Crypto Futures Liquidation For both seasoned traders and newcomers, understanding how to navigate periods of intense volatility and avoid becoming a victim of a crypto futures liquidation is paramount. Here are actionable insights and strategies: 1. Master Risk Management: This is arguably the most crucial aspect of trading. Before entering any trade, define your maximum acceptable loss. This includes: Position Sizing: Never allocate more than a small percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of your total capital to a single trade. Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order. This automatically closes your position if the price moves against you to a predefined level, limiting your potential losses. Treat it as your safety net. Take-Profit Orders: Similarly, consider setting take-profit orders to secure gains when your target price is reached, preventing potential reversals from eroding your profits. 2. Lower Your Leverage: While high leverage can be tempting, it’s a double-edged sword. Using lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) significantly increases your liquidation price, giving your trade more room to breathe during minor market fluctuations. This dramatically reduces your risk of a sudden crypto futures liquidation . 3. Understand Market Structure and Sentiment: Pay attention to broader market trends, support and resistance levels, and overall sentiment. Are major cryptocurrencies consolidating, breaking out, or breaking down? Understanding the context can help you make more informed decisions about your directional bias. 4. Diversify Your Portfolio (Beyond Futures): Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While futures trading can be profitable, consider diversifying your crypto holdings across spot markets, staking, or even different asset classes to mitigate overall portfolio risk. 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Stay updated on market news, technological advancements, and new trading strategies. Learn from both your successes and your failures, and adapt your approach as market conditions change. 6. Avoid Emotional Trading: Develop a trading plan and stick to it. Emotional decisions, driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) or panic, often lead to poor outcomes. Take breaks, review your strategy objectively, and don’t chase pumps or dump into panic. The Broader Implications for the Crypto Market Events like the recent crypto futures liquidation of hundreds of millions of dollars have implications beyond individual traders. They can contribute to increased market volatility, sometimes leading to a “flush out” of over-leveraged positions, which can be seen as a market reset. However, repeated large liquidations can also erode investor confidence, attract regulatory scrutiny, and highlight the need for more robust risk management tools and education across the ecosystem. Ultimately, these events underscore the need for a mature and responsible approach to participating in the digital asset space. The recent crypto futures liquidation event, wiping out $227 million in an hour and over half a billion in 24 hours, serves as a powerful testament to the inherent risks and rewards of the cryptocurrency market. It’s a vivid illustration of how quickly fortunes can change, particularly when leverage is involved. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of magnified losses is equally potent. This episode is not merely a statistic; it’s a critical lesson for every participant in the crypto space. It underscores the absolute necessity of rigorous risk management, the prudent use of leverage, and the importance of a well-informed trading strategy. By learning from such events, traders can better prepare themselves for the unpredictable nature of digital asset markets, transforming potential pitfalls into opportunities for growth and resilience. Always remember: in the volatile world of crypto, knowledge and discipline are your most valuable assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto futures liquidation? A1: A crypto futures liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) falls below a certain threshold due to adverse price movements. This is done to prevent the trader from incurring further losses beyond their initial margin. Q2: Why did $227 million worth of futures get liquidated so quickly? A2: Such a rapid and large-scale liquidation typically results from a sudden, sharp price movement in the market (either up or down), catching a large number of highly leveraged traders on the wrong side of the trade. The forced closure of these positions then adds to the market’s momentum, creating a cascading effect. Q3: How can traders avoid crypto futures liquidation? A3: Traders can avoid liquidation by employing strict risk management strategies, including using lower leverage, setting mandatory stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, carefully sizing their positions relative to their total capital, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts. Q4: Does crypto futures liquidation affect the spot market? A4: Yes, large-scale liquidations in the futures market can influence the spot market. When leveraged positions are closed, the underlying assets are often bought or sold, adding to buying or selling pressure on spot exchanges, which can exacerbate price movements. Q5: Is futures trading safe in crypto? A5: Futures trading in crypto carries significant risks due to high volatility and the availability of extreme leverage. While it offers opportunities for profit, it is not inherently “safe” for inexperienced traders or those who do not practice stringent risk management. It’s crucial to understand the risks before engaging. Q6: What role does leverage play in liquidation events? A6: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. The higher the leverage used, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out a trader’s margin and trigger a liquidation. This makes high-leverage positions extremely vulnerable to market volatility. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

This impressive rally was further accelerated by 21Shares’ recent ETF filing targeting the ONDO token. At the time of writing, however, ONDO has experienced some profit-taking activity, declining by 10.44% to trade at $1.025 during the session. This correction has resulted in a decrease in the token’s market capitalization from $3.7 billion to $3.2 billion. Despite the temporary pullback, the past 24 hours have seen over $448 million worth of ONDO tokens change hands , indicating sustained market interest. This robust trading activity has led many market participants to believe that 21Shares’ recent filing with U.S. regulators for a spot ETF tracking Ondo Finance’s native token could drive substantial institutional demand for ONDO. $ONDO season is loading legends. @ondofinance ETF is loading, and this could begin a new cycle for this gem.

The platform has established a strong foundation in the institutional space through strategic collaborations. In February, the project partnered with major institutional finance players, including Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Google Cloud, McKinsey, BlackRock, PayPal, and Morgan Stanley, to launch the Ondo Finance Chain, a dedicated layer-1 protocol focused on real-world asset tokenization. @jpmorgan ’s Kinexys just executed a tokenized U.S. Treasuries trade on @OndoFinance Chain and settled cross-chain using @chainlink ’s secure infra. #jpmorgan #ondo https://t.co/syovKOC8fI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 Last week marked another milestone when BNB Chain, Binance’s blockchain network, announced a partnership with Ondo Finance to integrate tokenized real-world assets into its ecosystem. This collaboration seeks to bridge Wall Street with BNB Chain, bringing over 100 U.S. stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , and investment funds to Ondo Finance while maintaining traditional finance liquidity. Several months earlier, Ondo Finance secured another major partnership by joining Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network as a provider of tokenized real-world assets, further solidifying its position in the institutional landscape. Can ONDO Hit $2?—Analysts Eye $27 Trillion Treasury Market Cryptocurrency traders are viewing the recent price correction as a buying opportunity, believing ONDO has the potential for upside movement similar to XRP, which has also gained favor among traditional finance institutions. Chart analyst ‘Crypto Targets’ has identified that ONDO is currently in a double accumulation phase, with bullish RSI divergence and breakout structure alignment. Double accumulation phase RSI divergence bullish Breakout structure weekly $ONDO just flipped the macro neckline What comes next ? Expansion Target: $4 pic.twitter.com/zcgrrE0Vb6 — Crypto Target (@cryptotarget11) July 23, 2025 The analysis suggests that ONDO has successfully flipped the macro neckline, potentially setting the stage for expansion beyond $2. Financial educator Kren has provided an even more bullish long-term perspective , noting that the U.S. Treasury market is valued at approximately $27 trillion. If ONDO were to capture just 0.1% of this market, the token could theoretically trade at $6.75 per unit. Technical Analysis: ONDO Charts Indicate $1.61 Breakout After 9% Correction The daily ONDO/USDT chart reveals a clear bullish trend that recently encountered strong resistance at the $1.1732 level, representing the July highs. Following a substantial rally from the July opening near $0.7697, the price successfully broke through key moving averages (EMAs 20, 50, 100, and 200), indicating positive momentum. Source: TradingView Today’s trading session, however, shows a sharp 9% pullback, with the token closing at $1.0397, indicating temporary exhaustion in buying pressure. Despite this correction, the overall trend structure remains intact. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 62.29, positioned just below the overbought threshold, suggesting room for a potential rebound without overheating concerns. If the current correction maintains support above the moving average cluster, particularly the EMA 20 at $0.9557 and EMA 50 at $0.9379, the technical setup favors the formation of a higher low. The projected trajectory indicates a possible short-term consolidation below the July highs, followed by a bullish continuation toward the next major resistance level at $1.6117. Should the price fail to maintain support above the EMAs, it could retreat into the consolidation range between $0.80 and $0.90. However, the current market structure supports a bullish continuation following this temporary pullback.

With countless cryptocurrencies vying for attention, identifying those with a chance to multiply investments dramatically is essential. Among the promising contenders, BeerBear is generating significant buzz as a top choice with extraordinary growth prospects. This article delves into three of these promising coins, shedding light on why they stand out in today’s bullish market. Here is Some BEER: The Meme Coin You’ll Actually Want to Hold Now add crypto rewards, an arcade play-to-earn game, and one very angry bear who’s had enough of rug pulls and scam coins. That’s BeerBear ($BEER), a Solana-based meme coin that’s brewed differently. Who Is BeerBear? BeerBear is a classic 90s action hero in bear form—muscles, sarcasm, and no mercy for scammers. Loves ice-cold beer and one-liners. Smashes frauds and rug pulls with pixelated fury. Rewards holders who back him up with USDT bonuses, perks, and laughs. Think Rambo meets Homer Simpson, but with a mission and a meme coin. Why Buy $BEER? 1. Insanely Cheap During presale, $BEER is just $0.0005. The price will climb to $0.0020 before the presale ends, so early buyers get 4x more tokens for the same cash. Don’t chase pumps. Crack open $BEER instead 2. Rewarding Beer Points: Up to 12% bonus for active buyers. Referral Program: Earn USDT when you bring friends in for a round of $BEER. No fluff, no funny math—you’re rewarded in real value. 3. Entertaining Even before the token hits exchanges, BeerBear already has a demo arcade game—a retro-style brawler where the bear beats up greedy hamsters (because screw tap-to-earn nonsense). The full game Bear ’em All is coming with: Unique NFT skins and power-ups On-chain rewards Co-op mode Real Structure, Not Just Slogans BeerBear has laid down actual foundations that support long-term credibility and growth. The project has undergone audits by three security firms—Beosin, SmartState, and HashEx—all of which reported no critical issues. The tokenomics are clean and finite: the total supply is capped at 10 billion tokens, with no option for future minting, eliminating inflation risk. What’s more, 60% of the entire supply is allocated to the presale, meaning the majority of tokens are in the hands of early adopters—not locked in team wallets or private reserves, which are common red flags in other projects. Want to Grab $BEER? Because once this thing starts pouring, it won’t last long. Treat yourself to something bold. Something brash. Something that has room to 10x. Get $BEER now at $0.0005 before it reaches $0.0020 HBAR Poised for a Surge as Altcoin Season Approaches Hedera (HBAR) is on the move, showing signs of potential growth. It’s priced between $0.23 and $0.31, close to its simple moving average, which holds steady at $0.27. The relative strength index is low, at just under 34, suggesting it’s oversold and might rally. Over the past month, HBAR surged by about 94 percent, hinting at bullish momentum. With the resistance at $0.34 and aiming for the next level of $0.42, HBAR could see a rise of over 35 percent if it breaks through. While the 6-month trend shows a drop, the current dynamics might soon favor an upward trend, hinting at exciting times ahead. Ondo (ONDO) Set for Growth: Eyeing $1.22 Resistance Ondo is gaining momentum, currently in the $0.92-$1.13 range. It’s climbed over 13% this week and jumped nearly 60% this month. Despite a 20.98% drop over 6 months, its growth in recent weeks is promising. The RSI at almost 42 suggests it’s not overbought, leaving potential for further gains. If Ondo breaks the $1.22 resistance, the next target is $1.43, indicating a possible rise of around 27% from current levels. The MACD is positive, showing bullish momentum, but low stochastic could mean it’s ready for an upswing. Ondo seems poised for a rally, setting the stage for a potential bull run. Conclusion While HBAR and ONDO offer interesting prospects, their short-term potential may be overshadowed by BeerBear. With a strong character, an engaging play-to-earn game already in demo mode, rewarding community incentives, and full transparency backed by top-tier audits, BeerBear positions itself as a standout project. Now is an opportune moment to join BeerBear’s mission against scams and be part of something that could make a significant impact.

He framed it as an “internet status game,” similar to how wealthy individuals buy luxury cars and art to show off. Hayes believes investors will likely shift their ETH gains into rare, high-end NFTs like CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks are one of the earliest and most iconic NFT collections, with a fixed supply of 10,000. As such, their deep-rooted cultural significance in Web3 offers scarcity and prestige.

Imagine getting a piece of a promising new project simply for being an early supporter or engaging with a platform. This is precisely the excitement building around the recent announcement regarding the Aspecta airdrop and its detailed tokenomics. What Exactly is Aspecta and Why Does Its Airdrop Matter? Before we dive into the specifics of the Aspecta airdrop , let’s briefly understand what Aspecta is aiming to achieve. While the initial announcement focuses on the token distribution, it’s crucial to grasp the underlying vision. Aspecta positions itself as a forward-thinking project within the blockchain space, designed to foster a robust and engaged community. Its core purpose, often hinted at through its ecosystem focus, is likely to create a decentralized platform or protocol that empowers users and contributors. The significance of an airdrop, especially one from a project like Aspecta, cannot be overstated. It’s not just about free tokens; it’s about: Community Building: Airdrops are powerful tools for distributing tokens widely, ensuring a decentralized ownership base from day one. Awareness & Adoption: They generate buzz and encourage new users to explore the project’s ecosystem. Rewarding Early Supporters: Loyal community members and early adopters are recognized for their belief and engagement. The upcoming Aspecta airdrop is a pivotal moment, marking a significant step in the project’s journey from development to widespread community engagement. Diving Deep into Aspecta Tokenomics: A Blueprint for Growth Aspecta has clearly outlined its tokenomics, providing a transparent view of how its native token, with a total supply of 1 billion, will be distributed. Understanding these allocations is key to grasping the project’s long-term vision and commitment to decentralization and sustainability. Here’s a detailed breakdown: Allocation Category Percentage of Total Supply Purpose & Impact Community and Ecosystem 45% This significant portion highlights Aspecta’s commitment to decentralization and growth. These tokens will likely fuel initiatives like grants, staking rewards, liquidity incentives, and community-driven development, ensuring a vibrant and active ecosystem. Investors 20% Allocated to strategic investors who provide crucial funding for development, marketing, and operational expenses. This ensures the project has the necessary capital to achieve its milestones. Early Contributors 15% Rewards for the foundational team members, developers, and advisors who have been instrumental in building Aspecta from the ground up. This incentivizes long-term commitment and dedication. Foundation 17% This portion is typically managed by a non-profit foundation or DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) dedicated to the project’s long-term health, legal compliance, strategic partnerships, and ongoing development. It acts as a stability reserve. The structure of these allocations demonstrates a thoughtful approach to balancing early funding needs with long-term community empowerment and ecosystem sustainability. The substantial allocation to community and ecosystem, in particular, bodes well for decentralized governance and user participation. The Aspecta Airdrop: Your Opportunity Awaits! The moment many have been waiting for is almost here. Aspecta has confirmed that 7.6% of the total token supply will be distributed to users and supporters at Token Generation Event (TGE). This dedicated allocation for the Aspecta airdrop underscores the project’s commitment to rewarding its early community members and fostering widespread adoption. Here are the crucial details you need to mark on your calendar: Airdrop Inspection Opens: 07:00 a.m. UTC on July 24 Airdrop Claims Available: 10:00 a.m. UTC at TGE (Token Generation Event) This phased approach, with an inspection period before claims open, is a smart move. It allows users to verify their eligibility and allocated tokens, addressing any potential issues before the actual claiming process begins. This transparency is a hallmark of a well-managed airdrop. How Can You Prepare for the Aspecta Airdrop Inspection and Claim? To ensure a smooth experience with your Aspecta airdrop , preparation is key. While specific instructions will likely be released closer to the date, here are general actionable insights and tips based on common airdrop practices: Stay Updated: Always follow Aspecta’s official channels (like their X account, as mentioned in the original announcement) for the latest and most accurate information. Be wary of unofficial sources and potential scams. Secure Your Wallet: Ensure your cryptocurrency wallet is secure and accessible. If the airdrop requires a specific chain or wallet type, make sure you have it set up correctly. Understand Eligibility Criteria: Although not fully detailed in the snippet, most airdrops have specific criteria (e.g., holding certain NFTs, participating in past testnets, being an active community member). Review any past announcements from Aspecta to confirm your eligibility. Prepare for Inspection: On July 24 at 07:00 a.m. UTC, be ready to access the designated inspection portal. This is where you’ll likely connect your wallet to see if you’re eligible and for how many tokens. Be Ready to Claim: Once claims open at 10:00 a.m. UTC at TGE, follow the official instructions precisely. Be mindful of network fees (gas fees) if the airdrop is on an Ethereum-compatible chain. Verify the Source: Double-check URLs before connecting your wallet or signing transactions. Phishing scams are common during airdrop events. Taking these proactive steps will significantly enhance your chances of a successful claim and help you avoid common pitfalls. Why is the Aspecta Airdrop So Important for the Community? The distribution of 7.6% of the total supply via the Aspecta airdrop is more than just a gesture; it’s a strategic move that benefits the community in several profound ways: Democratization of Ownership: By distributing tokens to a broad base of users, Aspecta fosters a more decentralized and democratic ownership structure, preventing concentration in a few hands. Increased Participation: Token holders are more likely to engage with the project, participate in governance, and contribute to its growth, as they now have a vested interest. Fair Launch Principle: Airdrops often embody a ‘fair launch’ principle, giving ordinary users a chance to acquire tokens without needing to participate in high-entry private sales. Enhanced Network Effects: A wider distribution leads to more users interacting with the platform, potentially driving up utility and value for everyone involved. This airdrop acts as a powerful catalyst, igniting community spirit and setting the stage for a truly decentralized and user-driven ecosystem. Looking Ahead: Aspecta’s Future Beyond the Airdrop While the Aspecta airdrop is undoubtedly a major milestone, it’s crucial to look beyond this initial distribution. The success of Aspecta, like any blockchain project, will depend on its continued development, community engagement, and the utility of its token within its ecosystem. The tokenomics, with substantial allocations for community and foundation, suggest a long-term vision focused on sustained growth and innovation. As the project evolves, we can anticipate further announcements regarding partnerships, product launches, and community initiatives that will leverage the distributed tokens. The airdrop is merely the first chapter in Aspecta’s journey to build a robust and impactful presence in the decentralized world. Conclusion: Seizing Your Aspecta Opportunity The announcement of Aspecta’s tokenomics and the impending Aspecta airdrop marks an exciting development in the crypto space. With a clear distribution plan for its 1 billion token supply, Aspecta is setting the stage for a community-centric ecosystem. The airdrop, allocating 7.6% to users and supporters, provides a tangible opportunity for early engagement and participation. Remember to mark July 24th on your calendar for airdrop inspection and prepare for claims at TGE. By understanding the tokenomics and following official guidelines, you can position yourself to be a part of Aspecta’s journey from the very beginning. This isn’t just about receiving tokens; it’s about joining a growing community and potentially contributing to a project with a promising future.

This also drove shares in Japan to a one-year high as investors cheered the news, especially automakers in that country. The agreement followed another deal with the Philippines that demands a 19% tariff rate on imports from that country. Prospects of more tariff negotiations ignite optimism and stock surge This comes as US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Japan on Tuesday that includes paying a lower than 15% tariff on exports to the US. “I just signed the largest trade deal in history, I think maybe the largest deal in history with Japan,” President Trump said at a White House event. According to a Reuters report , President Trump indicated that EU nations will turn up for more tariff negotiations this Wednesday, which ignited hope within the bloc, although the region was reportedly already working on countermeasures . These were to be implemented in the event of a stalemate before the originally set August deadline. In response to the news, the Euro STOXX 600 rose by 1% as auto shares jumped 3.6%. Shares in UK hit a record high after climbing 0.5%. Deutsche Bank analysts acknowledged the renewed hope among investors, explaining that the news of the trade deal “raised hopes that the US might be about to reach deals with other countries that avoid the higher tariffs on August 1.” Elsewhere on Wall Street, the S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.1%. In Japan, the Nikkei jumped 3.7%, spurred by news of the trade deal that will reduce US auto tariffs to 15% from the initially proposed 25%. Strong gains by companies in the motor industry, including Nissan, Toyota and Honda led the rally. Mazda Motor surged by 18% while peers, Toyota, rose by 14%. However, the dollar remained sluggish after it lost ground overnight as it traded flat at 146.71 yen after falling 0.5% on Tuesday. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against major peers, slightly changed at 97.48. Elsewhere, the euro fell 0.1% after it rose 0.5% the previous day as the European Central Bank is expected to hold rates steady on Thursday after eight consecutive rate cuts. The US – Japan deal comes as a relief to the Asian giant’s economy Analysts are of the view that the trade deal was an added advantage to Japan as it reduced a major risk to its economy, while providing more scope for the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to tame inflation. About 25% of Japan’s US exports are from its automotive sector, which accounts for almost 3% of its economy. According to a Reuters report, that hit the bond market, with yields for 10-year JGBs rising 8.5 basis points to 1.585%. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba denied reports that he was planning to step down after a terrible upper house election defeat, arguing the reports were “completely unfounded.” Elsewhere, US and Chinese officials are expected to have another meeting next week in Stockholm as they deliberate on a possible extension to the August 12 deadline for negotiating a trade deal, according Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. As a result, Chinese blue chips jumped 0.7% before slowing down, and MSCI’s broadest index Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan put on 1.2%. In the US, corporate earnings reports showed signs that the trade war was hitting profit margins. General Motors fell 8.1% after reporting a $1 billion hit from tariffs to its quarterly results. Still within the auto industry, investors are looking forward to earnings results from Tesla, while others are eagerly awaiting for Alphabet’s results. The two companies, together with Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia make up the Magnificent 7 stocks. These have spurred much of the market rally driven by AI optimism.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-based-digital-energy-company-mara-holdings-starts-selling-bonds-to-buy-bitcoin-details-here/,"US-based digital energy and infrastructure company MARA Holdings announced plans to sell $850 million in non-interest-bearing convertible bonds due in 2032. MARA Holdings Announces $850 Million Convertible Bond Sale Plan The company will offer the notes exclusively to qualified institutional investors under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. Initial purchasers will also be given the option to purchase an additional $150 million of notes within 13 days of the initial issuance. The bonds will be MARA's senior, unsecured debt instruments. Regular interest payments are not expected, but special interest rates may apply under certain conditions. The bonds mature on August 1, 2032. MARA will have the right to call all or part of these bonds for cash starting January 15, 2030. Investors will be able to sell their bonds back for cash if the MARA share price is below the conversion price on January 4, 2030. The bonds may be converted into cash, shares, or a combination of the two, at MARA's discretion. The full conversion right will be valid in perpetuity, effective May 1, 2032. MARA stated that the proceeds from the sale of bonds will be: To use the $50 million to buy back some of the 1% interest bonds due in 2026 that are currently in circulation, It plans to use the remainder to fund capped calls (anti-dilutive hedges on conversions), purchase additional Bitcoin, and for general corporate purposes (capital, debt repayments, strategic acquisitions). The company anticipates that holders of bonds due in 2026 may purchase MARA shares to hedge their existing positions, which could put upward pressure on the stock price. Similarly, option counterparties under capped call transactions are also expected to purchase shares. These trades could cause volatility in the prices of MARA shares and bonds. About the Company MARA Holdings is a company that develops digital energy technologies and aims to transform energy systems. The company invests in digital infrastructure to increase energy efficiency in areas such as artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. It also supports grid stability by converting excess energy into digital capital. *This is not investment advice.

The 5.1% drop was accompanied by a surge in trading volume, with a peak of 7.73 million tokens changing hands during a particularly heavy sell-off between 09:00 and 14:00 UTC on July 23. The sharp move reinforced resistance around the $5.07-$5.13 range, while accumulation interest surfaced in the $4.78-$4.88 zone, offering tentative support. However, persistent breakdowns below the $5.00 threshold highlighted ongoing distribution pressure that could challenge recovery attempts without sustained buying momentum. During the final hour of trading on July 23, ATOM experienced pronounced volatility. The price tumbled from $4.90 to a session low of $4.78 before rebounding to $4.81. This recovery, while notable, came on declining volume—potentially signaling exhaustion among short-term buyers. Akash Network (AKT), another Cosmos-based project, continues to show strength in long-term forecasts, with a potential target of $6.19 in 2025, contrasting ATOM’s current technical fragility. Technical Analysis Highlights 24-Hour Movement: ATOM fell 5.1% from $5.08 to $4.82 with a total range of $0.35 (6.8%). Peak Liquidation: July 23, 09:00-14:00 UTC saw volumes surge to 7.73M, well above the 1.11M average. Critical Support: $4.78-$4.88 zone showing accumulation on elevated volume. Intermediate Resistance: $4.98-$5.00 level faced multiple rejections. Institutional Pressure: Sustained breakdown below $5.00 signals distribution activity. Intraday Volatility: July 23, 13:10-14:09 UTC saw a sharp dip from $4.90 to $4.78, followed by a rebound to $4.81. Rebound Weakness: Recovery to $4.81 occurred on declining volume, suggesting possible exhaustion.

48800042,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=772363,1753285833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48800042.jpeg,Germany and France are pushing the EU to prepare retaliatory tariffs against the US,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/germany-france-push-eu-tariffs-against-us/,"Germany and France are pushing the European Union to prepare retaliatory tariffs against the United States unless the White House agrees to drop a fresh round of trade penalties by August 1, according to the Financial Times . Both countries have ramped up pressure on fellow EU governments to support hardline action as talks with the Trump administration stall. Until recently, Berlin had been urging patience and direct talks. That’s over. Officials now say they want a real threat on the table. Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz will host French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin on Wednesday, a day after EU ambassadors were called into private meetings with European Commission officials to discuss the bloc’s strategy. Those meetings, known in Brussels as “confessionals,” focused on whether the EU should activate the anti-coercion instrument (ACI), a policy mechanism designed to counter threats from foreign governments by targeting their companies directly. ACI retaliation splits the EU as Germany reverses course The ACI has never been used before. If triggered, it would allow the Commission to ban American companies from bidding on EU public contracts, cancel their intellectual property protections inside the EU, and freeze trade in specific sectors. Both Germany and France back the plan. But not everyone’s sold. One diplomat said , “There is a silent majority against triggering the ACI.” Another added, “That would be nuclear. The situation is too fluid to gauge with any degree of certainty if member states favour it.” Despite hesitation, things have moved fast. Officials say a recent letter from Trump warning of 30 percent reciprocal tariffs by August 1 flipped the tone across EU capitals. Until that point, tariffs were only set to rise to 20 percent. One EU diplomat said the letter “hardened the mood.” Another added, “Germany has turned 180 degrees in a few days,” saying most countries now want the EU to show it won’t fold without leverage. If the Commission does go ahead with the ACI, the first step would be to launch a formal investigation into whether the US is using economic pressure against the EU. No immediate retaliation would follow. But if coercion is confirmed, then the Commission could move to impose penalties—with final sign-off coming from member states. One diplomat described it as “a calibrated response. It can be a bazooka but it can also be a sniper rifle.” Two-stage tariff plan targets $100bn in US goods Beyond the ACI, the Commission already has a more traditional response lined up. If Trump’s administration doesn’t back down by August 1, the EU will activate a set of tariffs on €21 billion worth of American imports. That package, which includes items like chicken and jeans, is scheduled to take effect on August 6. That’s just the first wave. A second round, hitting €72 billion in US goods, including Boeing aircraft and bourbon, will be put to a vote on August 6 and could launch the very next day. According to two diplomats, the decision has already been mapped out, but officials still hope the US will blink before then. As one said, “Of course, they also hurt EU companies and no one wants to see a downward spiral of transatlantic trade.” The Commission is also building a third list. This one targets American services, especially tech and digital sectors. A person involved in the talks said the plan includes taxes on digital services and online advertising revenue, a direct hit to big US platforms. Meanwhile, Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, said in an interview with Fox News that “August 1st is a pretty hard deadline,” adding that tariffs would “boomerang back to the reciprocal level” if no deal is reached. Brussels officials say that the response made clear the US wasn’t open to compromise. The conflict escalated further when Trump rejected a proposed framework deal that would have locked in the current 10 percent tariff rate. Instead, the US wants to hike that rate to a permanent minimum of 15 percent or more. The EU also asked for exemptions from a 25 percent levy on cars and car parts and a 50 percent duty on steel and aluminium. The US refused. So far, no formal retaliation has begun. Olof Gill, spokesperson for the Commission’s trade office, said on Tuesday, “Until then, our laser focus is on negotiations and that will be our priority for the moment.” Whether Washington actually backs down before August is now the only thing that matters.

This isn’t just another corporate milestone; it’s a profound statement about the evolving financial landscape and the undeniable rise of digital assets. For anyone tracking the pulse of finance, especially those invested in the future of decentralized systems, Block’s S&P500 entry is a landmark event. Let’s delve into why this inclusion is so significant, especially considering Block’s substantial holdings of 8,584 Bitcoin (BTC). What Does Block’s S&P500 Inclusion Truly Mean? The S&P500 is more than just an index; it’s a benchmark of American economic prowess, representing 500 of the largest and most liquid U.S. companies. Inclusion in this elite group signifies a company’s robust financial health, market leadership, and consistent growth. For Block, a company that has championed digital payments and embraced cryptocurrency, its entry sends a clear signal: Mainstream Validation: Block’s presence in the S&P500 lends unprecedented legitimacy to a company deeply intertwined with the crypto ecosystem. It suggests that traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the stability and long-term potential of businesses operating in this space. Increased Visibility and Investment: As an S&P500 component, Block will automatically be included in countless index funds and ETFs, leading to passive investment inflows. This broadens its investor base beyond tech-focused or crypto-specific funds. Enhanced Credibility: The rigorous criteria for S&P500 inclusion – including market capitalization, profitability, and liquidity – underscore Block’s operational excellence and financial stability. This can bolster investor confidence and attract new capital. To understand the gravity of this achievement, consider the typical requirements for S&P500 inclusion: Criterion Description Block’s Achievement Market Capitalization Must exceed a specific threshold (currently around $14.5 billion USD). Block comfortably exceeds this, demonstrating significant market value. Profitability Sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ GAAP earnings must be positive. Consistent profitability across its diverse business segments. Liquidity High trading volume to ensure efficient market operations. Actively traded on the NYSE, ensuring high liquidity. U.S. Company Must be a U.S. company listed on a major U.S. exchange. Headquartered in the U.S. and listed on the NYSE. Block’s Bitcoin Bet: A Bold Strategy That Paid Off? One of the most fascinating aspects of Block’s journey is its steadfast commitment to Bitcoin. With 8,584 BTC on its balance sheet, Block stands out as a publicly traded company with significant direct exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic alignment with Jack Dorsey’s vision for a decentralized financial future. Dorsey, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, believes BTC will be the native currency of the internet. Block’s decision to hold Bitcoin reflects this conviction, viewing it as a long-term investment and a key component of its future offerings. This move has been both praised for its foresight and questioned for its volatility exposure. However, with the rising institutional interest in Bitcoin, Block’s early and significant bet appears increasingly validated. Beyond its balance sheet holdings, Block facilitates Bitcoin adoption through its popular Cash App , allowing millions of users to buy, sell, and send BTC. This integration not only generates revenue but also positions Block as a pivotal player in mainstream crypto adoption. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Landscape? The inclusion of a company like Block in the S&P500 has far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It serves as a powerful testament to crypto’s growing legitimacy and integration into the global financial system. Catalyst for Institutional Adoption: When a major index like the S&P500 includes a crypto-friendly company, it subtly encourages other traditional institutions to re-evaluate their stance on digital assets. It normalizes the idea of companies holding or facilitating crypto. Validation for Bitcoin: Block’s substantial Bitcoin holdings, now part of an S&P500 company’s assets, provide a layer of indirect validation for BTC itself. It demonstrates that a reputable, large-cap company sees strategic value in the digital asset. Shifting Narratives: This event helps to shift the public and regulatory narrative around cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to legitimate components of the future financial infrastructure. Precedent for Future Inclusions: Block’s success could pave the way for other crypto-native or crypto-adjacent companies to eventually qualify for similar prestigious indices, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. Beyond the Index: Block’s Vision for Decentralized Finance Block’s ambition extends far beyond simply being an S&P500 company or holding Bitcoin. Jack Dorsey’s company is actively building the infrastructure for a more open and decentralized internet. Projects like TBD, focused on building open-source developer platforms for Bitcoin, and Spiral, a Bitcoin-focused open-source initiative, underscore this commitment. More recently, the announcement of Web5, a decentralized web platform built on Bitcoin, showcases Block’s long-term vision to empower individuals with greater control over their data and identity. This holistic approach — from facilitating everyday payments with Cash App, to building foundational decentralized technologies, and holding significant crypto assets — positions Block as a unique hybrid in the financial world. Its S&P500 inclusion is not just about its past achievements, but also about the potential for its future contributions to a more inclusive and decentralized global economy. Block’s journey from a payments processor to an S&P500 component reflects a broader shift in the financial landscape, showcasing robust growth and strategic foresight. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts What does Block’s S&P500 inclusion mean for you? For Traditional Investors: This event highlights the increasing intertwining of traditional finance and the digital asset space. Diversifying portfolios to include companies like Block, which have a foot in both worlds, could offer exposure to growth areas. For Crypto Enthusiasts: It’s a validation point. Continue to research and support projects and companies that are building real-world utility and adoption for cryptocurrencies. Block’s success demonstrates that fundamental business principles combined with crypto innovation can yield significant results. Market Observation: Keep an eye on how other major indices and institutional investors react to the success of crypto-adjacent companies. This could be a leading indicator for broader market trends. In conclusion, Block’s official inclusion in the S&P500 index is a monumental achievement, not just for the company itself, but for the entire digital asset ecosystem. It underscores the growing maturity and acceptance of cryptocurrency-aligned businesses within mainstream finance. With its substantial Bitcoin holdings and forward-thinking decentralized initiatives, Block is not just participating in the future of finance; it’s actively shaping it. This event serves as a powerful reminder that the lines between traditional and decentralized finance are blurring, paving the way for a more integrated and innovative global economy.

ICP struggled to maintain bullish momentum, encountering firm resistance in the $6.00–$6.10 zone that had capped multiple breakout attempts. The sharpest decline came during the 13:00 UTC hour on Thursday, when ICP slid to $5.62 from $5.97 in just a few minutes, driven by an outsized surge in trading volume. Total daily turnover reached 2.58 million tokens — nearly four times the 24-hour average — underscoring institutional-scale distribution pressure, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. The broader market showed similar dynamics , with altcoins such as SOL, AVAX and ADA pulling back amid profit-taking and regulatory developments. Analysts characterized the retracement as a healthy rotation following President Donald Trump-related rallies and renewed attention to stablecoin legislation. Despite individual bullish catalysts, many tokens failed to sustain upside traction, with traders reallocating capital and defending key support zones.

According to its official press release , the Miami-based digital energy company expects to grant initial purchasers an additional $150 million option, potentially bringing the total offering to $1 billion. MARA will allocate up to $50 million of net proceeds to repurchase existing 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2026, while dedicating the remainder to Bitcoin purchases, capped call transaction costs, and general corporate purposes. The convertible notes will carry no regular interest payments and mature on August 1, 2032, with holders gaining conversion rights into cash, MARA common stock, or a combination at the company’s discretion. MARA Holdings, Inc. Announces Proposed Private Offering of $850 Million of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes https://t.co/vsJOqj2Svj — MARA (@MARA) July 23, 2025 Strategic Treasury Expansion Amid Mining Headwinds The capital raise represents MARA’s response to mounting profitability pressures following Bitcoin’s April halving event, which cut mining rewards in half while energy and equipment costs continue to rise. MARA’s Q1 2025 results revealed these industry challenges, with the company reporting a net loss of $533 million despite achieving a 30% increase in revenue to $214 million. CEO Fred Thiel has previously advocated for a hybrid approach combining mining operations with strategic Bitcoin purchases during market declines to optimize acquisition costs. “As a miner that mines and buys Bitcoin, the hybrid approach provides us significant flexibility to acquire Bitcoin at attractive prices,” Thiel stated in the company’s December 2024 report. @fgthiel , CEO of Bitcoin miner @MARAHoldings , has suggested retail investors to adopt a ""buy and hold"" Bitcoin strategy. #Bitcoin #MARA $BTC https://t.co/lpbyVi7Mp0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 3, 2025 The strategy positions MARA alongside other major miners as they shift their operations, with Core Scientific facing potential divestiture of crypto assets following its $9 billion acquisition by CoreWeave, while HIVE Digital explores AI data center hosting to supplement its mining revenues. MARA’s convertible note structure includes provisions that allow the company to redeem notes for cash after January 15, 2030, while holders retain repurchase rights if stock prices fall below specified conversion thresholds. The company expects to enter capped call transactions with initial purchasers to mitigate potential dilution upon note conversion, utilizing established hedging mechanisms commonly employed in corporate convertible offerings. Divergence in Digital Treasury Strategies as Corporate Adoption Accelerates MARA’s Bitcoin-focused approach contrasts sharply with emerging trends in treasury diversification among public companies entering the digital asset space. Over 273 companies now maintain Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 124 companies as of June, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Yet, corporate strategies increasingly diverge from simple Bitcoin accumulation. NYSE-listed Sequans Communications recently purchased 1,264 Bitcoin for $150 million , bringing its total holdings to 2,317 BTC as part of a pure Bitcoin treasury strategy similar to MARA’s approach. NYSE-listed @Sequans buys 1,264 Bitcoin for $150 million bringing total holdings to 2,317 $BTC as corporate adoption surges 120% since July 2024. #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/LlzHhB7sA8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 21, 2025 Meanwhile, some firms have abandoned Bitcoin entirely in favor of Ethereum’s staking yield potential, with Bit Digital recently selling 280 BTC to build a treasury of over 100,000 ETH, targeting staking rewards. BIT Mining also announced plans to raise $200$300 million for a Solana treasury , while other firms explore altcoin strategies including XRP, ADA, and emerging DeFi tokens, according to Animoca Brands Research. However, growing skepticism has surrounded the sustainability of any digital asset treasury approach, with Glassnode’s James Check warning that “the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect.” VanEck’s Matthew Sigel has similarly questioned the mechanics of Bitcoin treasury strategies, particularly criticizing at-the-market share issuance programs that can become dilutive when stock prices approach Bitcoin’s net asset value. The class-action lawsuits filed against MicroStrategy for allegedly misleading investors about the profitability of crypto investments have introduced fresh uncertainty into the corporate treasury’s use of digital assets. These contrasting developments have raised profound questions about whether corporate crypto adoption will lead to lasting financial innovation or a short-term speculative trend.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-285600-xrp-price-rally-isnt-speculation-but-math-heres-why/,"In a bold claim shared on X, prominent crypto analyst Pumpius stated that XRP’s path from $3.50 to $10,000 is not a speculative dream; it’s a mathematical inevitability. According to Pumpius, the forces behind XRP’s rise are already in motion: institutional infrastructure, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and suppressed price action designed to shake out retail investors before a paradigm shift. With XRP currently trading around $3.34, down slightly from its recent highs of $3.57, this prediction may seem far-fetched. But Pumpius insists that this isn’t about hype, it’s about control. Institutional Money Is Already Here Contrary to popular belief, institutional entry into XRP has already begun. ETFs, futures products , and commodity-backed financial instruments are quietly integrating Ripple’s payment corridors. Wall Street isn’t chasing “crypto”; they’re buying the underlying rails that move money across borders. $XRP to $10,000 ISN’T A MOONSHOT—IT’S A GUARANTEE From $3.50 → $10,000, XRP’s trajectory isn’t speculation — it’s mathematics. This isn’t about price. It’s about control. Here’s how pic.twitter.com/FvKS3WCcft — Pumpius (@pumpius) July 22, 2025 CME’s launch of XRP futures in May 2025 marked a turning point, followed by multiple XRP-linked ETFs like Teucrium’s 2× XXRP and the unleveraged XRPI. These instruments have drawn significant institutional capital, signaling growing confidence in XRP’s long-term role as a settlement layer for tokenized assets. On-chain data backs this up. Roughly 47 billion XRP, nearly 80% of the circulating supply, is held by custodians and whales. That’s not speculation; it’s positioning. XRP and the Real-World Asset Revolution XRP’s true utility is emerging in the tokenization of real-world assets. From U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds to real estate and even identity-linked bio-data, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is evolving far beyond its original remittance use case. Notably, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and integrations with platforms like Ondo Finance have enabled the tokenization of yield-generating U.S. Treasuries directly on XRPL . Meanwhile, projects like DNA Protocol are introducing bio-data tokenization, tying financial access to one’s digital identity, merging finance with genetics. Pumpius argues this layered utility dwarfs even Bitcoin’s impact, claiming it’s “bigger than Bitcoin + the Internet combined.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Suppression Theory and ISO 20022 Pumpius also alleges a long-running strategy to suppress XRP’s price. FUD campaigns, coordinated lawsuits, including the drawn-out SEC case, and deliberate market manipulation were all, according to him, designed to discourage retail investors from holding long-term. But with ISO 20022, the global standard for financial messaging, going live, XRP is positioned as a key liquidity token in the future of cross-border finance. Once that switch flips, Pumpius believes the suppression ends, and price discovers its real value. $10,000 XRP: Vision or Delusion? While the thesis is compelling, the math remains extreme. A $10,000 XRP would result in a market cap of nearly $600 trillion, far beyond global GDP. Still, the momentum is real. Legal clarity, expanding utility, and massive on-chain positioning suggest that XRP is no ordinary crypto asset. Pumpius ends with a warning: “You won’t be invited to the table. You have to seize your seat.” Whether or not XRP reaches $10,000, history is being written, and XRP is playing a central role.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a newly emerging token in DeFi and it is capturing the attention of investors. The 5th round of the Mutuum Finance presale has already sold out over 85% of its total allocation. At this phase, MUTM is priced at $0.03 and it will increase by 16.67% in the following stage. The funds accumulated so far amount to more than $12.9 million. As market participants dig deeper into liquidity and the adoption rate intensifies, the question being bantered is whether Mutuum Finance would be the one to push a 10x breakout long before the Ethereum rally peaks. The Inflows of Ethereum ETF Since Price Strength Ethereum (ETH) which is now trading at $3,788, has experienced a steady rise in July with spot ETFs still attracting new funds. According to recent data, there were net inflows of more than $2 billion this month, and there even have been a number of days when ETH-oriented funds were more popular than Bitcoin-ETFs. Increase in institutional activities has assisted ETH in trading at critical support levels and have given it further impetus following early-summer consolidation. Analysts indicate that further ETF demand might help the coin to reach the level of $4,000 as long as the inflows stay at the same level, and Ethereum stays in spotlights among the main assets during this market cycle. Mutuum Pioneers Its Next-Generation Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a two-way lending ecosystem that benefits both active and passive DeFi users. Passive income can be generated from lending users’ USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools. This is known as Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. Aside from that, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables lenders and borrowers to swap as much as they would like since there is no intermediary. That is usually typical with clients of less stable assets like meme coins. Investor Sentiment Remains in Favor of Mutuum Presale More than $12.9 million has been committed and more than 13900 investors have already invested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This shows investor confidence in the project at its early stages is increasing. MUTM can be bought at $0.03 before a 16.67% increase during phase 6. Smart investors are acting quickly to capture this price floor. Security Verified: CertiK Audit with $50K Bug Bounty Protection Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin that is USD-pegged on the Ethereum network. Apart from that, the project is audited by CertiK with a trust score of 95.0. Such auditing shows the platform’s willingness to be institution-graded open and reliable. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. It will reward on a four-level severity scale: critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Launches $100,000 Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will give 10 winners $10,000 MUTM as appreciation for the investor’s first time believing in the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering unstoppable momentum, boasting $12.9 million raised, 13,900+ investors, and a Phase 5 presale already 85% sold out at $0.03 before a scheduled 16.67% price increase in Phase 6. With a CertiK-audited trust score of 95.0/100, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 token giveaway, the project is setting new standards in DeFi security and adoption. Secure your MUTM allocation today while Phase 5 lasts and position yourself for the 10x breakout analysts believe could arrive before Ethereum’s rally unfolds.

After a month of strong gains, this temporary correction may be setting the stage for another major leg up—potentially targeting the $4.00 level and beyond. In this article, we dive into XRP’s current technical landscape and highlight other coins that could follow a similar growth trajectory as investor sentiment begins to rebound. XRP Prepares for Next Leg Up as Bullish Energy Builds Source: tradingview Ripple’s XRP is showing renewed strength, currently trading in the range of $2.95 to $3.81, following a sustained period of upside momentum. Over the last month, the token has delivered an impressive 64% surge, signaling strong interest from buyers and reinforcing its position as a key altcoin to watch. Despite this rally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains relatively low, suggesting that XRP may still be undervalued and has room to run before hitting overbought territory. The next major test lies at the $4.16 resistance level. A successful breakout above this barrier could open the door to a push toward $5.02—representing a potential upside of around 30% from current highs. Holding support above $2.95 is crucial for maintaining the bullish structure, while a drop below the $2.45 level could trigger a reassessment of the recent rally. With rising volume and technicals pointing to continued interest, XRP appears to be positioning itself for another wave of upward movement, especially if overall market sentiment continues to favor risk-on assets. Conclusion With XRP holding firm above key support and showing signs of renewed buying interest, the path to $4.00 looks increasingly realistic. Momentum indicators and recent price action suggest the dip may be short-lived, offering a potential entry point for traders. As bullish momentum returns, XRP and similar altcoins could lead the next wave of crypto market gains, making this a crucial time to watch for breakout setups across the board.

As attention drifts toward affordable coins with strong upside, a few standout names are quietly gaining traction. Projects such as BlockDAG, HBAR, CRO, and POL are sparking discussions as they prepare for what could be a big year ahead. These are currently viewed among the best long-term cryptos due to a mix of tech advancement, ecosystem strength, and active fundraising. Let’s take a closer look at four coins under $0.50 that could show solid growth through 2025 and why they’re gaining attention right now. BlockDAG: $350M Presale Project With 2,660% Growth for Early Buyers BlockDAG has turned heads with a record-breaking presale that’s brought in $350 million so far. With 24.1 billion BDAG coins sold and its current presale running in Batch 29, it remains priced at $0.0016 until August 11 as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. What’s remarkable is that early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since Batch 1, underlining the explosive momentum. A major feature fueling this excitement is BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS, which allows users full access to their holdings from Day 1, without wait periods or staggered releases. This has changed how buyers interact with presale crypto, giving them more freedom to use their coins immediately and join the ecosystem without delay. With a future listing price set at $0.05, BDAG now offers a potential return of 3,025% for current buyers. Its rapid fundraising, strong community growth, and unique blockchain model make BlockDAG (BDAG) one of the best long-term cryptos attracting attention in 2025. As batch sales speed up, it’s clear the project is already setting itself apart from the rest. HBAR: Enterprise-Level Technology with Practical Use Cases Hedera’s HBAR, priced around $0.24, is known for its speed and secure structure. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera uses a hashgraph consensus that handles thousands of transactions per second with low fees. With support from major players like Google and IBM, HBAR has built strong credibility in sectors such as identity, supply chain, and environmental tracking. Thanks to its growing adoption among enterprises and continuous technical development, HBAR is being counted among the best long-term cryptos. As markets shift toward real-world use, coins like HBAR, backed by powerful partnerships, could be the ones to break out in 2025. CRO: Crypto.com’s Utility Powerhouse with Wide Reach Currently hovering near $0.11, CRO is tied directly to Crypto.com’s global platform. Whether it’s trading fees, cashback on Visa cards, or access to NFTs and DeFi, CRO plays an important role in the user experience. This broad integration within one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges gives CRO a lasting presence in the market. The token benefits not only from consistent visibility but also from its value within an expanding suite of services. That’s why CRO is increasingly recognized among the best long-term cryptos, particularly as Crypto.com’s reach widens and more users interact with its features across different regions. POL: Future of Polygon’s Ecosystem Through zkEVM Scaling POL is emerging as a key player in Polygon’s 2.0 update, where it will serve in governance, staking, and network security roles. Linked to the zkEVM Layer-2 upgrade, this token is part of Polygon’s larger push toward a multichain future. Even though it’s still in early phases, POL’s low supply and deep connection to the project’s scaling goals are drawing attention. With one of the most active developer ecosystems in crypto, Polygon’s plans for POL are aligned with its growth path. That’s why POL is making its way into lists of best long-term cryptos, seen as a hidden asset tied to the technical evolution of the network. Final Remarks! All four projects, HBAR for enterprise-grade infrastructure, CRO for platform utility, and POL as a part of Polygon’s scaling strategy, bring something unique to the table. Each has reasons for being called one of the best long-term cryptos right now. But BlockDAG is on another level. With its $350 million presale haul, ongoing batch momentum, and user-first model with no vesting limits, BlockDAG is already delivering major results. Current buyers can still get in at $0.0016 until August 11, with a projected 3,025% return. While other coins rely on adoption forecasts or system upgrades, BlockDAG has already set a new standard. For anyone searching for the best long-term cryptos with real potential, this lineup deserves serious attention, especially BlockDAG, which continues to outperform expectations.

The company’s retro‑themed diner in California may be drawing record crowds, but the automaker’s core business is cooling off. This represents Tesla’s seventh straight quarterly downturn in California, the country’s top electric‑vehicle region, even as the broader market for new cars in the state expanded during the first six months of the year, per Business Insider . Dealership representatives cautioned that Tesla’s slump is dragging down California’s zero‑emission segment, where battery‑powered models constituted just 18.2% of new sign‑ups in Q2 2025, a decrease from 22% a year earlier. Observers attribute part of the slowdown to buyer discomfort with CEO Elon Musk’s prominent political involvement. It’s worth noting that California, a predominantly liberal state, was the initial hub for the Tesla Takedown protest movement. Tesla is scheduled to publish its Q2 financial results after Wednesday’s trading session. In early July, the automaker reported a roughly 13.5% decrease in deliveries from the prior year, its second consecutive quarterly dip worldwide. Although an updated Model Y reached dealers in recent months, it failed to stimulate demand. Tesla hasn’t introduced a new lineup since the Cybertruck debut in 2023, and sales of that divisive truck stand at only 11,000 units year‑to‑date by Cox Automotive’s count. Tesla’s federal tax credit set to expire The removal of a $7,500 federal incentive for domestically manufactured EVs in September poses another hurdle. Tesla introduced perks such as complimentary supercharging for Model 3 buyers and gratis Full Self‑Driving feature transfers to boost purchases before the incentive expires. Even with intermittent gains in its share value, Tesla faces mounting global challenges, and a vital source of income is on the verge of disappearing. The regulatory credit scheme, which enables conventional auto manufacturers to purchase emissions offsets from EV producers, ends on September 30. Over the past ten years, this arrangement has generated over $10 billion in revenue for Tesla, roughly a third of its total profit, and it was the primary contributor to Tesla’s earnings in Q1 2025. Musk says those credits kept Tesla afloat and even stopped it from going bankrupt in 2019. However, President Trump’s recent “One Big Beautiful Bill” removed the EV mandate, backed more consumer options, cut the credit program, and ignited a public feud with Musk. William Blair analysts have questioned the longevity of this credit‑driven boon. Reuters has cautioned that criticizing Trump alone won’t save Tesla, and the automaker’s recent discounts and promotions have yet to generate noticeable gains. Tesla officially launched its retro-themed diner in West Hollywood on July 21. The spot offers large outdoor screens for drive‑in movies, dozens of Supercharger stations, and an Optimus robot that hands out popcorn. Anti-Musk activists plan July 26 protest at Tesla diner Activists from the Tesla Takedown campaign plan to rally outside on July 26 to voice their opposition. Action Network, which helps coordinate the protests, describes Musk’s new venue as evidence of “[Elon Musk] wants to celebrate his reign of terror in OUR CITY, Occupied Los Angeles, with a cheesy Tesla‑branded diner exclusively for his legion of conmen stock‑pumpers and MLM influencer tryhards?” and closes with “WE SAY HELL NO.” Organiser Joel Lava told The Verge that the movement remains active despite a dip since spring and expects “a large crowd” outside the diner this Saturday. “I think it’s safe to say that Elon Musk is not a popular figure in West Hollywood. So I don’t think it’s going to be hard to protest it,” he told The Verge. Each week, about two dozen people still gather at Tesla sites in Los Angeles, rallied by news of falling sales, a weak earnings report, and reports that DOGE cuts left USAID food to spoil in storage. Rumours of a Musk political party have spurred protesters. “Yes, our numbers have dwindled, but they have stayed strong,” Lava said. “Tesla funds fascism. By giving money to a $300 billion man, you help destroy the fabric of our country. That’s why you shouldn’t go into this cafe.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech|Tesla,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|DOGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-23 16:00:25

The token traded within a volatile $0.28 range, peaking at $3.04 before slumping to an intraday low of $2.76. The sharpest selloff emerged during the July 23 13:00 hour as NEAR tumbled from $2.84 to $2.76, with trading volumes spiking to 14.19 million tokens—nearly five times its 24-hour average. This dynamic established significant resistance at $2.84, suggesting traders will be watching that level for signs of reversal. During a critical hour from 13:10 to 14:09 UTC, NEAR briefly stabilized after plunging 2.46% from $2.84 to $2.77, before recovering to $2.80. Trading intensity peaked between 13:41 and 13:51 when over 850,000 units changed hands per minute, highlighting the fragility of support near $2.76. While the rebound hints at a potential short-term consolidation, the wider altcoin market’s softness raises questions about whether NEAR can sustain upward momentum. Adding to the mix, NEAR Foundation’s partnership with Everclear to develop cross-chain settlement infrastructure could act as a catalyst for renewed interest. Meanwhile, traders continue to eye the rise of narrative-driven projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has diverted speculative capital as NEAR contends with development delays heading into Q4 2025. Technical Analysis Price Action: NEAR fell 5.41% from $2.97 to $2.81 (July 22–23), with a trading range of $3.04 (high) to $2.76 (low). Volume Spike: 14.19M tokens exchanged during peak selloff, far above the 2.89M daily average. Resistance Level: $2.84 established as significant overhead resistance after multiple failed retests. Support Level: $2.76 held as a key floor during high-volume volatility. Altcoin Context: Broader market weakness weighs on NEAR’s recovery prospects.

As more companies adopt BTC as part of their treasury strategy or payment infrastructure, price forecasts are pushing higher—many now eyeing a move to $130,000. But Bitcoin isn’t the only asset poised to benefit from this institutional wave. Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) are also gaining traction, showing strong technical setups and renewed investor interest. In this article, we explore how this growing corporate adoption could drive the next leg up for BTC and spotlight altcoins that may follow its lead. Bitcoin Holds Strong Around $120K as Bulls Eye Breakout Source: tradingview Bitcoin continues to trade confidently between $114,000 and $121,000, showing resilience even amid a relatively quiet week, with gains under 0.5%. On a broader scale, however, BTC has posted a solid 17% increase over the past month—fueling optimism that a larger move could be imminent. The next key level to watch is the $125,000 resistance. A successful break above this threshold could propel Bitcoin toward the $131,000 zone, marking an additional 9% climb. Strong support at $112,000 is helping reinforce bullish sentiment, offering a reliable buffer against short-term volatility. With the RSI still sitting in a neutral range, there's plenty of room for further upside without triggering overbought signals. Having already gained 14% over the last six months, Bitcoin is gaining steady traction, and many traders are watching closely for signs of an imminent breakout as institutional demand continues to build. Solana's Surge: Potential Upswing as Investors Eye Key Resistance Source: tradingview Solana's price currently hangs between $164 and $192. It faces resistance around $202, with support near $147. In a week, it's up about 17%, and over the last month, it climbed nearly 46%. However, its longer six-month performance shows a 24% drop, hinting at past struggles. The coin could push to $230 if the momentum continues, marking a climb of about 44% from its lower range. With its RSI at 35, it seems relatively undervalued, suggesting room for growth. Investors are watching closely, hoping it can maintain its recent upward trend and breach the $202 resistance, targeting that $230 mark for potential gains. Ondo Coin Faces Resistance, Eyes Potential Breakout Source: tradingview Ondo (ONDO) is trading in a stable range between just under a dollar and slightly above a dollar. It's getting close to its resistance level at about $1.22. If Ondo breaks through this, it might move to the next level of around $1.43. This would mark a potential rise of approximately 26% from its lower range. The coin's support level near $0.79 is keeping it stable, preventing any sharp drops. Its 10-day and 100-day moving averages are closely matched, hinting at potential sideways movement. But if momentum shifts favorably, Ondo could see solid growth. Conclusion Bitcoin’s steady climb, bolstered by rising corporate adoption, is building a foundation for a potential breakout toward $130K. As confidence spreads, altcoins like Solana and Ondo are gaining momentum of their own, fueled by technical signals and favorable market sentiment. With resistance levels in sight and room for further upside, these assets are worth watching closely as the market braces for another potential surge. The convergence of institutional interest and altcoin resilience could define the next phase of crypto’s bull cycle. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Analyst sees WIF breakout targets at $1.75, $2.20, $2.85, and $3.70 if structure holds. Whale buys and rising Open Interest fuel bullish momentum as the price reclaims the $1.20 neckline. Pattern Suggests Shift in Trend Dogwifhat (WIF) is trading near a key level after forming a cup and handle on the daily chart. This setup began in March with a rounded base and continued with a sideways range into July. The price now sits just above the neckline between $1.20 and $1.25. At press time, WIF trades at $1.23, showing an 11% increase in the past week. If the price stays above this level, it may confirm a breakout. Support from the 100-day simple moving average, around $0.84, has helped shape the pattern over the last few weeks. Levels to Watch Closely Notably, the first area of support is near $1.00. Below that, the $0.84 mark lines up with the moving average. A deeper pullback could bring the price back to $0.70, which acted as a floor during earlier consolidation. If momentum continues, targets to monitor are $1.75, $2.20, $2.85, and $3.70. These numbers reflect earlier price reactions and the depth of the cup formation. Analyst Jonathan Carter wrote, “If the pattern holds, we could see the price surge toward targets at $1.75, $2.20, $2.85, and $3.70.” #WIF Dogwifhat is ready to breakout off the neckline of a cup and handle pattern on the daily chart If the pattern holds, we could see the price surge toward targets at $1.75, $2.20, $2.85, and $3.70 pic.twitter.com/11DMO5pq9B — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) July 22, 2025 Trading Activity and Chart Signals The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now near 70. This level often shows strong demand, though it may also suggest the need for a short rest. On the volume profile, there is a lighter zone above $1.30, which could allow faster movement if the breakout continues. Open Interest in WIF futures has grown to $660 million, according to CoinGlass. That’s an 11.5% increase from the previous week. More interest in futures often points to rising capital inflows from both sides of the market. Source: Coinglass A recent purchase by the firm WIFStrategy added to the momentum. On July 13, they acquired 500,000 WIF tokens. The price jumped 30%, hitting $1.30 before settling near $1.22. This move pushed WIF above its earlier channel, where it remains at the time of writing.

For the first time since June 2024, data from CryptoQuant on X reveals that Ethereum’s spot trading volume surged to an impressive $25.7 billion last week, comfortably surpassing Bitcoin’s $24.4 billion. This shift has pushed the ETH/BTC spot volume ratio above 1, a clear indicator of increased investor rotation and a potential rebalancing of market interest. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio, and are we witnessing the early signs of a broader altcoin resurgence? What’s Driving the Ethereum Spot Volume Surge? This recent flip in trading volume isn’t just a fleeting anomaly; it reflects a confluence of factors that have been steadily building momentum for Ethereum. Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the significance of the Ethereum spot volume overtaking Bitcoin’s. Anticipation of Spot Ethereum ETFs: The most immediate catalyst is undoubtedly the growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. Following the landmark approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, institutional interest has been piqued, and many analysts believe Ethereum is next in line. The prospect of easier access for traditional investors is a powerful magnet for capital. Robust Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the foundational layer for a vast and dynamic ecosystem. From Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the proliferation of Layer 2 scaling solutions, Ethereum’s utility continues to expand. This inherent utility and ongoing innovation make it an attractive long-term investment. Network Upgrades and Efficiency: Continuous improvements to the Ethereum network, such as the recent Dencun upgrade and upcoming enhancements like Pectra, are improving its scalability, security, and efficiency. These technical advancements reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, making the network more appealing for developers and users alike. Bitcoin’s Consolidation Phase: While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, it has entered a period of consolidation after its post-halving rally and initial ETF excitement. This natural market cycle often sees capital flow from established assets like Bitcoin into higher-beta altcoins, particularly those with strong fundamentals like Ethereum, as investors seek new growth opportunities. Decoding the ETH/BTC Spot Volume Ratio: Why Does it Matter? The ETH/BTC spot volume ratio is more than just a number; it’s a critical barometer for market sentiment and capital flow. When this ratio rises above 1, as it has now, it signals a significant shift in investor preference. Historically, such movements have often preceded periods where altcoins, led by Ethereum, outperform Bitcoin. Consider the implications: Investor Rotation: A higher ratio indicates that a greater proportion of new capital and existing funds are being allocated to Ethereum rather than Bitcoin. This suggests investors are actively diversifying their portfolios or seeking higher potential returns in the altcoin market. Market Leadership: While Bitcoin often leads the initial phases of a bull run, Ethereum frequently takes the baton in subsequent phases, driving broader market rallies, especially across the altcoin spectrum. This recent surge in Ethereum spot volume could be a precursor to such a phase. Liquidity and Depth: Increased trading volume for Ethereum also signifies deeper liquidity, making it easier for large institutional players to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. This enhanced liquidity further reinforces its position as a mature and attractive asset. Is This the Dawn of an Altcoin Season, Fueled by Ethereum’s Momentum? The question on every crypto investor’s mind is whether this surge in Ethereum spot volume is the harbinger of a full-blown altcoin season. While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current dynamics certainly paint a promising picture. An “altcoin season” typically occurs when altcoins, as a group, significantly outperform Bitcoin. Ethereum, being the largest altcoin by market capitalization and the backbone of many decentralized applications, often leads this charge. When ETH demonstrates strength, it often creates a ripple effect across the broader altcoin market, pulling smaller cap projects higher. However, it’s crucial to consider potential challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains dynamic. While progress is being made, unexpected regulatory hurdles could dampen market enthusiasm. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic factors, such as inflation, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events, can influence investor risk appetite across all asset classes, including crypto. Market Volatility: Even with strong fundamentals, cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Sharp price swings remain a possibility, and investors should be prepared for this. Actionable Insight: For investors looking to capitalize on this potential shift, now might be a prudent time to research promising altcoin projects within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Layer 2 solutions, DeFi protocols, or emerging dApps, that stand to benefit from Ethereum’s increased prominence and utility. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges for Ethereum Investors The ascendancy of Ethereum spot volume presents both compelling opportunities and inherent challenges for investors. Understanding these aspects is vital for making informed decisions in this evolving market. Opportunities: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: For portfolios heavily weighted towards Bitcoin, this shift provides a compelling case for increasing exposure to Ethereum and other high-potential altcoins, diversifying risk and potentially enhancing returns. Exposure to Innovation: Investing in Ethereum means investing in the forefront of blockchain innovation. Its ecosystem is a hotbed for new technologies, applications, and business models that could redefine various industries. Potential for Higher Gains: While Bitcoin offers stability, Ethereum and other altcoins often present greater upside potential during bull cycles due to their smaller market caps and higher growth trajectories. Challenges: Increased Volatility: With higher potential returns comes higher risk. Ethereum, like most altcoins, is subject to more pronounced price swings than Bitcoin. Competitive Landscape: The blockchain space is highly competitive, with numerous “Ethereum killers” vying for market share. While Ethereum maintains a dominant position, it must continue to innovate to stay ahead. Technological Complexity: Understanding Ethereum’s technical upgrades, staking mechanisms, and ecosystem intricacies can be more complex for new investors compared to simply holding Bitcoin. Example: Consider the growth of Arbitrum or Optimism, leading Layer 2 solutions built on Ethereum. As Ethereum’s scalability improves and its ecosystem thrives, these projects directly benefit from increased user adoption and transaction volume, offering indirect exposure to Ethereum’s success. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Ethereum and the Crypto Market The recent surge in Ethereum spot volume , surpassing Bitcoin’s for the first time in over a year, marks a significant milestone. It’s not merely a statistical anomaly but a strong signal of shifting investor sentiment, driven by the anticipation of spot ETH ETFs, Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, and ongoing network advancements. This pivotal moment suggests a potential rotation of capital into Ethereum and the broader altcoin market, potentially heralding a new phase of growth and innovation. While opportunities abound, investors should remain mindful of market volatility and conduct thorough research. As Ethereum continues to mature and expand its influence, its role as a cornerstone of the decentralized future becomes increasingly clear. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for Ethereum spot volume to surpass Bitcoin’s? A1: It signifies that the total value of Ethereum traded on spot markets (where assets are exchanged for immediate delivery) exceeded that of Bitcoin within a specific period. This indicates increased investor interest and capital flow into Ethereum. Q2: How does the ETH/BTC spot volume ratio relate to market sentiment? A2: When the ETH/BTC spot volume ratio goes above 1, it suggests that investors are actively rotating capital from Bitcoin into Ethereum and potentially other altcoins, indicating a shift in market sentiment towards higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Q3: Is the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs the main reason for this surge? A3: While the anticipation of spot Ethereum ETF approval is a significant catalyst, it’s one of several factors. Ethereum’s strong ecosystem growth, ongoing network upgrades, and Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase also play crucial roles. Q4: Does this mean an altcoin season is guaranteed? A4: While the surge in Ethereum spot volume is a strong indicator, an altcoin season is not guaranteed. It suggests a higher probability, but market dynamics are complex and influenced by various factors, including regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing in Ethereum and altcoins? A5: Key risks include high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, intense competition from other blockchain platforms, and the inherent complexities of the decentralized ecosystem. Investors should conduct thorough research and manage their risk exposure. Did you find this analysis insightful?

Its French branch, CoinShares Asset Management, has received authorisation under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. This makes CoinShares the first regulated asset management firm in continental Europe to hold this licence. This achievement strengthens the company’s position as a trusted and compliant provider of digital asset services across the European Union. Full Regulatory Coverage Across Traditional and Digital Assets The MiCA framework, signed into law in 2023 , is a key part of Europe’s plan to create clear rules for crypto services across the EU. By gaining this approval, CoinShares can now offer portfolio management and advisory services for crypto-assets across member states in a legally compliant manner. CoinShares now holds all three major financial licences in Europe. This makes it one of the most fully regulated asset managers on the continent. With its Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) license, the company can manage alternative investment funds and participate in activities related to UCITS funds. The investment firm holds a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license, enabling it to offer investment advice and manage portfolios in traditional finance. The latest licence, MiCA, gives CoinShares the legal right to provide services for crypto-assets across Europe. Setting a New Standard for Crypto Compliance With this recent approval, CoinShares can offer its services across many EU countries, including France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, and the Netherlands. This wide access is known as “passporting.” It enables the firm to reach investors across the region without requiring separate licenses in each country. CoinShares is now well-positioned to grow in both traditional finance and the rapidly evolving world of crypto. Furthermore, CoinShares’ achievement comes as more crypto firms across Europe seek regulatory approval under MiCA. According to Patrick Hansen, Circle’s Policy Head, 59 MiCA authorisations have already been granted. These include 39 for Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and 14 for stablecoin issuers. Now, CoinShares is well-positioned to become a trusted counterparty for institutional investors seeking crypto exposure that meets stringent compliance requirements. This move strengthens the legitimacy of crypto assets as part of professional investment strategies. CoinShares Plans to Expand to U.S. Markets CoinShares is also working to extend its influence beyond Europe. In June, the firm filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, this ETF will be listed on Nasdaq and will give investors direct access to Solana’s native token, SOL. The filing also includes a plan to stake a portion of the SOL holdings, allowing the fund to earn staking rewards while also tracking SOL’s market price. As of July 2025, the SEC is still reviewing the proposal.

This was a bold and unexpected move for a country that, just two years prior, declared cryptocurrencies would “never be legalized.” Tasked with licensing exchanges, setting standards for tokenization and mining, and aligning with global best practices, PVARA is now positioning Pakistan as one of the first movers in structured digital asset regulation across South Asia. The global ripple effect was immediate. Just a day later, Israel’s Knesset held its first informal parliamentary discussion on Bitcoin. While the session didn’t yield immediate policy proposals, it echoed many of the same questions that Pakistan is already beginning to tackle: How can decentralized technologies support trade, inclusion, and resilience in regions facing macroeconomic pressure? What does national security look like in a world where financial infrastructure is no longer tied to borders? Pakistan’s pivot has pushed even countries like India and Israel to think about their own crypto narratives. These conversations are surfacing at a pivotal moment. Bitcoin is trading above $115,000, driven by a renewed wave of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity in some markets, and post-conflict recalibration in geostrategic regions like the Middle East. At the same time, the U.S. is moving forward with comprehensive federal legislation on crypto, while countries like Turkey, Nigeria, and Argentina are recalibrating their own financial architectures in response to inflationary stress and currency volatility. Each of these countries, in their own way, is acknowledging the growing legitimacy and inevitability of decentralized financial systems. Pakistan isn’t alone in this shift. Nigeria has embraced regulatory sandboxes to encourage fintech experimentation. Argentina’s leadership is considering open frameworks to integrate stablecoins and crypto wallets into its national economy. India, meanwhile, is quietly reconsidering its hardline stance, as its burgeoning developer ecosystem and digital commerce sector push for policy reforms. But what makes Pakistan’s pivot particularly noteworthy is the pace and intentionality with which it moved from prohibition to policy. In under four months, the country transitioned from a total crypto ban to announcing a sovereign Bitcoin reserve, drafting legislation, setting up a new regulatory body, and inviting both domestic and international exchanges to seek licensing under its jurisdiction. All of this while signaling compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and building institutional muscle for digital asset governance. This shift didn’t happen in a vacuum. It reflects broader generational and economic realities. With over 116 million internet users, 50,000 annual computer science graduates, and a digital freelance workforce of over 4 million, Pakistan is home to one of the most internet-native and globally connected populations in Asia. For many young Pakistanis, crypto isn’t some abstract investment vehicle — it’s a utility. A tool to receive remittances, pay for services, and store value in the face of a volatile rupee and limited access to foreign banking infrastructure. For the government, the pivot also serves a strategic purpose. By embracing structured regulation, Pakistan is asserting itself in a space where few developing countries have managed to lead. It’s a geopolitical signal: that digital sovereignty and economic inclusion can coexist. And emerging markets don’t have to wait for Washington or Brussels to set the tone. In fact, by working with nations like El Salvador, initiating knowledge-sharing agreements, and engaging directly with global crypto leaders, Pakistan is helping to write the next chapter of crypto diplomacy. As the world moves toward greater fragmentation in economic, political, and technological spheres, digital assets offer a rare, if still volatile, path toward borderless collaboration. Whether this moment triggers a global cascade of crypto legislation or merely inspires a season of experimentation, one thing is clear: crypto is no longer just an economic debate. It’s a strategic one. A matter of policy, sovereignty, and future-readiness. In 2025, the leaders may not be the usual suspects like Washington, Tel Aviv, or Brussels. It may very well be Islamabad. And for the first time, the global crypto narrative is being reshaped not from the center of the old financial order, but from the periphery — with clarity, speed, and conviction.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|ASIA|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-23 16:12:11

The token smashed through $809, climbing 29% in the last 30 days. Traders are buzzing. Charts are flashing green. This isn’t just another crypto hype cycle , this is backed by volume, fundamentals, and momentum. Just yesterday, @NanoLabsLtd made waves, scooping up 46,000 BNB worth roughly $35 million. That massive buy sent shockwaves through the market. Bids surged. Shorts scrambled. Momentum locked in. Then came the catalyst: @cz_binance tweeted, “FOMO season is here.” Crypto Twitter erupted. Sentiment flipped bullish. Trading volume exploded. And just like that, the rally went vertical. But this isn’t a pump based on vibes alone , real utility on BNB Chain is driving the move. Since June, BNB Chain has led all blockchains in DEX volume, overtaking both Solana and Ethereum. Daily transactions have tripled since the beginning of Q2, and the number of active addresses has surged 130% since April. $BNB reaches new ATH @BNBCHAIN 's token hit $803, which means $BNB grew over 29% in the last month. One of the main growth catalysts is yesterday's 46K BNB (~$35M) buy by @NanoLabsLtd . @cz_binance 's comment about the upcoming FOMO season added extra fuel to the growth. pic.twitter.com/7UxMVCHlZL — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 23, 2025 Users are flooding into the ecosystem. DeFi protocols are swelling with liquidity, total value locked (TVL) is climbing fast, and launchpads are buzzing with demand. Currently, BNB trades at $809, with a market capitalization of $124.6 billion, 24-hour trading volume of $4.1 billion, and a CoinMarketCap rank of #4. This breakout is no fluke , it tops BNB’s previous all-time high of $690 from May 2021 by 17%, marking a clear and decisive move upward. And it’s not just retail investors fueling the momentum. Builders are returning to the BNB ecosystem in full force. A fresh wave of projects is launching across lending, yield aggregation, gaming, and even memecoins. PancakeSwap’s TVL is rising, Venus Protocol is locking in more collateral, and launchpad sales are selling out in seconds. The chain’s infrastructure is also helping its case. Fees remain low, throughput is high, and compared to competitors battling congestion, BNB Chain offers a smooth and responsive user experience. $BNB Next Target As Altseason Signals Fresh Run This rally coincides with a broader macro trend as well. Altseason signals are flashing green. With Bitcoin stalled in a consolidation range, large-cap tokens are beginning to lead the charge , and $BNB is now front and center. Analysts point to a rare alignment of catalysts: massive whale accumulation, bullish sentiment from Binance insiders, explosive on-chain growth, and supportive macro market conditions. If current momentum holds, the next key milestone is $1,000. Support looks strong around $750. While short-term corrections are likely , and even healthy , any dips may be quickly bought up as FOMO continues to build. Investors and traders should keep an eye on several key trends: further whale accumulation, developer activity and new project launches, and DeFi TVL surpassing $15 billion. Of course, risks remain. A sudden macro sell-off, regulatory headwinds, or profit-taking from yield chasers could dampen momentum. But for now, $BNB remains red-hot, and the charts tell the story. The Binance ecosystem is thriving. Momentum is real. Big players are buying. And $BNB just made history. This bull run just kicked into a higher gear.

In a development poised to send ripples across global financial landscapes, the Financial Times has reported that the United States and the European Union are on the cusp of finalizing a pivotal 15% tariff agreement. This impending US EU trade deal signifies a significant step towards de-escalating long-standing trade tensions between two of the world’s largest economic blocs. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, such macroeconomic shifts are never just distant headlines; they often serve as crucial indicators of broader market sentiment and liquidity flows that inevitably influence the digital asset space. Let’s delve into what this agreement entails and its potential implications for the global economy and, by extension, your crypto portfolio. Understanding the Imminent US EU Trade Deal The core of the reported agreement revolves around a 15% tariff, signaling a concerted effort by both the US and the EU to foster greater economic cooperation and reduce trade barriers. This move comes after years of sporadic disputes, ranging from steel and aluminum tariffs to disagreements over digital services taxes and agricultural subsidies. An agreement of this magnitude underscores a renewed commitment to a more stable and predictable international trade environment. Historically, trade relations between these two giants have often dictated the pace of global economic growth. When the US and EU align, it sends a powerful message of stability and collaboration. Conversely, friction can introduce significant uncertainty, impacting everything from supply chains to investor confidence. This reported US EU trade deal is not just about tariffs; it’s about rebuilding trust and setting a precedent for future bilateral and multilateral economic engagements. Why is This US EU Trade Deal a Game-Changer for Global Markets? The potential finalization of this agreement holds immense promise for various sectors, promising a ripple effect that could benefit businesses and consumers alike. But why exactly is this particular US EU trade deal being hailed as a potential game-changer? Reduced Business Costs: For companies operating across the Atlantic, a 15% tariff reduction translates directly into lower import and export costs. This can boost profit margins, encourage cross-border investment, and make goods and services more competitive. Smoother Supply Chains: Predictable trade policies reduce supply chain disruptions. Businesses can plan more effectively, leading to greater efficiency and potentially lower prices for consumers. Economic Growth Stimulus: Increased trade volume and reduced friction can stimulate economic growth in both regions, fostering job creation and innovation. Enhanced Geopolitical Stability: A stronger economic alliance between the US and EU provides a united front on global challenges, contributing to overall international stability. This stability often correlates with increased investor confidence in traditional and emerging markets. Consider the broader implications: if two of the world’s largest economies can find common ground on contentious trade issues, it sets a positive tone for global commerce, potentially encouraging other nations to resolve their own trade disputes. This creates an environment where capital can flow more freely and with less apprehension. The Crypto Connection: How the US EU Trade Deal Might Influence Digital Assets While a trade deal between traditional economic powers might seem far removed from the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, the reality is that macroeconomics plays a significant role in shaping the crypto landscape. The impending US EU trade deal could influence digital assets in several indirect but profound ways: Macroeconomic Stability and Investor Confidence A more stable global economic outlook, fueled by reduced trade tensions, tends to increase overall investor confidence. When traditional markets are perceived as less risky, institutional investors and even retail participants may feel more comfortable allocating capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, periods of high economic uncertainty often see investors retreat to safer havens, pulling funds from more volatile assets. Inflationary Pressures and Monetary Policy Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, which can contribute to inflationary pressures. A reduction in tariffs, such as the 15% agreement, could lead to lower import costs, potentially easing inflation. If inflationary pressures subside, central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank might adopt less aggressive monetary tightening policies (e.g., slower interest rate hikes or even cuts). Such shifts in monetary policy directly impact liquidity in financial markets, including crypto. A more accommodative monetary environment is generally bullish for digital assets, as it makes borrowing cheaper and encourages investment in growth-oriented sectors. Currency Dynamics and Global Capital Flows The strength of the U.S. Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR) is often influenced by economic news. A stronger transatlantic economic relationship could lead to shifts in currency valuations. For instance, if the deal strengthens the Euro, it could affect global capital flows, potentially influencing the price of Bitcoin (often seen as a hedge against fiat instability) and other cryptocurrencies, particularly those paired against these major fiat currencies. Precedent for Digital Trade Frameworks While this deal focuses on traditional goods, its success could pave the way for future agreements on digital trade, data governance, and even blockchain technology standards. As major economies collaborate more closely, it might accelerate the development of clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets, which could foster greater adoption and legitimacy for the crypto industry in the long run. Navigating Potential Challenges and Nuances of the US EU Trade Deal While the prospect of a comprehensive US EU trade deal is largely positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge that no major international agreement is without its complexities and potential challenges. The implementation phase itself can reveal unforeseen hurdles. Detailed Implementation: The broad agreement must be translated into specific legal and logistical frameworks, which can be a painstaking process. Disagreements over technical details could still arise. Impact on Specific Industries: While the overall economic impact is expected to be positive, certain niche industries within the US or EU might face increased competition or need to adapt significantly, potentially leading to localized economic adjustments. Global Trade Dynamics: The deal’s success could shift global trade patterns, potentially affecting relations with other major trading partners like China. New alliances and rivalries could emerge. Political Will and Durability: The long-term success of the agreement hinges on sustained political will from both sides, which can be influenced by future elections and shifting domestic priorities. Understanding these nuances is key to a balanced perspective. A deal is a framework, and its true impact will unfold over time as it is put into practice. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amidst the US EU Trade Deal News As a crypto investor, how should you react to news of an impending US EU trade deal ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Pay closer attention to global economic news, inflation reports, central bank statements, and international trade developments. These macro trends often precede significant movements in the crypto market. Diversify Your Portfolio: While a positive macro environment can boost crypto, volatility remains. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of different crypto assets and potentially traditional assets, can help mitigate risks. Understand Correlations: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react to news in traditional financial markets. Sometimes crypto acts as a safe haven, sometimes it correlates strongly with tech stocks. Understanding these dynamics is crucial. Long-Term Vision: Major trade deals like this one have long-term economic implications. While short-term crypto price action might be volatile, a more stable global economy generally supports the long-term growth and adoption of digital assets. Stay Informed on Regulatory Trends: Keep an eye on how increased international cooperation might influence global crypto regulation. Harmonized regulations could be a significant positive catalyst for the industry. This is not financial advice, but rather a guide to help you contextualize significant global events within your crypto investment strategy. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Global Trade and Crypto’s Future The reported imminent US EU trade deal , particularly the 15% tariff agreement, represents a monumental step towards fostering greater economic stability and cooperation between two of the world’s most influential economic powers. Its potential to reduce trade friction, stimulate growth, and ease inflationary pressures cannot be overstated. While the direct impact on cryptocurrency markets may not be immediate or obvious, the indirect effects through enhanced macroeconomic stability, altered monetary policy trajectories, and shifts in investor sentiment are profoundly significant. As the global economy continues to intertwine with the burgeoning digital asset space, understanding these major geopolitical and economic shifts becomes paramount for any astute crypto investor. This deal could indeed mark a new, more collaborative chapter for global trade, potentially laying a more stable foundation upon which the future of finance, including cryptocurrency, can flourish.

The core principle here is not to chase after short term profits; instead it’s about identifying enduring stories that make a difference. As we move deeper into 2025, four coins stand out as high-upside bets for the next half-decade. One of them, Little Pepe, might be the Solana of this meme-powered generation. Little Pepe – Where Memes Meet Infrastructure Little Pepe isn’t playing the same game as most meme coins. While others ride waves of hype and vanish, LILPEPE is laying down infrastructure—fast, Ethereum-compatible, and built to scale. Picture Solana being launched in today's world of dank memes and social media hype. Solana’s speed and scalability gave Solana a competitive edge which allowed it to go from unknown to one of the top 10 coins. LILPEPE is following in its footsteps, but with a unique twist. Now priced at $0.0015, LILPEPE is in Stage 6 of its presale and already pushing past $7.8 million raised, with over 6 billion tokens gone. More than 89% of the current round has already sold out. Its early momentum is being fueled by a mix of retail FOMO and whale-level conviction, backed by community support and viral traction across X and Telegram. Tokenomics are designed for long-term sustainability, with 10% reserved for liquidity, 30% allocated to reserves for ecosystem development, and 13.5% dedicated to staking rewards. Listing on CoinMarketCap has added legitimacy, and a $777K giveaway with over 40,000 entries is accelerating visibility. The design here is clear: blend meme culture with real blockchain speed, and you’ve got something that doesn’t just trend—it transforms. For those hunting a next-cycle giant, this could be the one worth front-running. Bonk (BONK) – Solana’s Comeback Mascot Bonk is Solana’s loudest meme token and recently spiked 18% in a single day. Priced around $0.000035, it’s gained traction as the face of Solana’s meme revival. Its integration with Solana’s “LetsBonk” launchpad—doing $8M+ in weekly volume—gives it ongoing utility and exposure to new projects. Whale accumulation is growing, and token burns have triggered 7–10% mini-rallies. As the broader Solana network continues gaining attention—especially with upcoming upgrades and ETF buzz—BONK stands as the flagship meme token likely to ride that wave. Its ultra-low price and loyal holder base give it serious upside in a bullish cycle. Arbitrum (ARB) – Utility Meets Adoption Arbitrum, trading around $0.45, continues to dominate the Layer 2 DeFi scene. Real-world adoption is picking up—PayPal’s stablecoin (PYUSD) now runs on Arbitrum, and its TVL in tokenized real-world assets just passed $310M. The network also handled a large token unlock (92.65M ARB) without tanking, showing maturity in its liquidity base. Beyond the charts, Arbitrum’s team is hosting Latin American developer events and hackathons to bring in new builders and users. Technically, it has broken above key resistance levels and is poised to test the $0.50 range soon. If DeFi and RWA trends continue into 2026, Arbitrum’s token could emerge as a blue-chip bet for real-world blockchain utility. Fetch.ai (FET) – AI Meets Institutional Money Fetch.ai, currently near $0.70, is riding the AI trend—but this isn’t just a narrative. A $50 million token buyback recently pushed prices higher, and institutional interest is booming. FET also grabbed headlines when a Nasdaq-listed fitness firm announced plans to acquire up to $500 million in FET as part of its treasury diversification strategy. Corporate interest at this level is rare, especially in AI crypto. Meanwhile, Fetch.ai continues to release new decentralized AI agents and data services, positioning itself as an essential infrastructure player for machine-to-machine interactions. With real-world use cases, corporate backing, and bullish price structure, FET might be one of the most underrated mid-cap plays in the AI sector. Conclusion There’s no shortage of crypto projects claiming big upside. But few combine narrative, community, and infrastructure like these four. Bonk has Solana’s attention, Arbitrum has real-world traction, and Fetch.ai is bridging crypto with corporate AI. Still, Little Pepe stands out, fusing meme momentum with Layer 2 technology and robust tokenomics. With over $7.8M already raised and nearly 90% of the current presale stage filled, this is one of the last early entries before full launch.

Three insiders told the FT that EU negotiators may accept the 15% levy to stop Trump’s 30% tariff hike on August 1. They also indicate that negotiators would eliminate fees on certain products, including airplane components, spirits, and healthcare devices. This past Wednesday, the European Commission, responsible for trade across all 27 member states, updated EU representatives following recent meetings with American trade delegates. European exporters have faced a supplementary 10% surcharge on shipments to the U.S. since April, in addition to standard tariffs that average around 4.8%. A flat 15% tariff would cut car duties from 27.5% to15%. Recently, Trump posted on Truth Social that he will “ONLY LOWER TARIFFS IF A COUNTRY AGREES TO OPEN ITS MARKET. IF NOT, MUCH HIGHER TARIFFS!”. He added that “Japan’s Markets are now open!” for the very first time, and this will be a boost to U.S businesses. EU’s retaliation plan still on standby Earlier, the Commission asked member governments to approve its €93 billion list of U.S. goods for possible retaliation, and its trade chief arranged talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The plan simply merges the earlier €21 billion and €72 billion proposals into one package of reciprocal tariffs. It pledged to continue refining its own response plan until a settlement is reached, and officials stressed they would promptly deploy those countermeasures should negotiations collapse. Markets reacted quickly. European equity benchmarks rose roughly 1 percent, led by automotive shares, as Trump’s Japan deal revived expectations for a comparable EU pact. Analysts said the news lifted market confidence by suggesting U.S.‑EU trade tensions might ease. The deal cuts the U.S. car tariff from 25% to 15%. EU officials see it as a template, since last year the U.S. bought over $55 billion of Japanese vehicles and parts, and about €47.3 billion (around $55.45 billion) from Europe. EU sources report limited movement on U.S. auto tariffs, though the Tokyo accord could provide a potential blueprint. A spokesperson for the German government pointed out that U.S.‑Japan relations differ significantly from U.S.‑EU dynamics. UBS analysts warned that without a similar deal, Japanese carmakers would benefit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-buy-2000-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"In a recent video shared on his X handle, crypto educator Levi of Crypto Crusaders made a bold appeal: “Everyone should have at least 2,000 XRP today.” According to Levi, this is not financial advice; it’s strategic positioning for what he believes is an inevitable financial transformation powered by XRP. Levi breaks down the mathematics of wealth accumulation using XRP. To become a millionaire solely through XRP, he argues, the token would need to reach $1,976 per coin, equating to a staggering $114 trillion market cap. While such a figure is speculative, he proposes a more attainable benchmark: $100,000 in XRP wealth. To achieve that, XRP would need to trade around $198, assuming a holder has 506 XRP. This would imply a market cap of roughly $11.4 trillion, still ambitious, but within the realm of possibility if global XRP adoption reaches 30%. BUY 2000 #XRP ASAP!!! pic.twitter.com/JKv1zaZM99 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 22, 2025 XRP Price and Market Momentum As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.29, hovering near recent highs of $3.57. While the price has cooled slightly, technical analysts remain optimistic, provided current support levels hold. On-chain data continues to support the bullish narrative. Whale wallets and custodians now hold nearly 47 billion XRP, indicating strong institutional positioning. Ripple’s growing stablecoin ecosystem and its deepening ties to tokenized treasuries and CBDCs have helped frame XRP not just as a currency, but as infrastructure for a new financial order. Levi’s Vision: XRP as a Global Asset Levi’s thesis is grounded in the belief that XRP will become integral to global value exchange. His call for 2,000 XRP holdings is based on expectations of rising adoption and utility across tokenized financial instruments, ranging from treasuries and real estate to identity-linked bio-data. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 With the continued rollout of ISO 20022 and Ripple’s increasing foothold in cross-border settlement, Levi sees XRP evolving from a speculative asset to a liquidity bridge for tokenized global finance. He notes that, to be in the top 1% of holders when XRP reaches its full potential, one would need to accumulate between 1,000 and 10,000 XRP today. Is $198 XRP Realistic? While Levi’s projections may seem aggressive, they are not without precedent in crypto. Multiple analysts suggest XRP could reach $10–$100 within the decade if adoption accelerates. A $198 valuation implies a financial system transformed by tokenized assets and Ripple-powered corridors. It’s not guaranteed, but it’s plausible, given the trajectory of financial innovation and blockchain integration. Levi’s message is simple: Don’t wait for permission. His call to “buy 2,000 XRP ASAP” is a bet on where the world is heading, not where it stands today.

The best long-term cryptos in 2025 are not just Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. This cycle is being led by bold new players that are rewriting the rules and drawing attention in ways the old guard is not. Aptos, BlockDAG (BDAG) , Pudgy Penguin, and Sei are each making noise for very different reasons. From explosive presale performance to real-world asset growth, NFT-fueled brand moments, and regulatory-driven DeFi expansion, these projects are not just following trends; they are creating them. As the market shifts from speculation to structure, these names are gaining real traction. They are not just part of the conversation; they are helping define it. Here is how they are standing out in 2025. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Expands Global Reach While Presale Hits Record Heights BlockDAG is rewriting the playbook on crypto launches. With over $350 million raised and 24.2 billion coins sold, it now holds the title for the biggest presale in crypto history. Add in more than 18,600 miners already in circulation, and the momentum becomes impossible to ignore. But it is the global expansion strategy that is truly setting BlockDAG apart. Recent partnerships with Inter Milan, HackerEarth, and now the Seattle Seawolves and Orcas have expanded BlockDAG’s visibility across both tech and sports. These collaborations are not just branding moves; they are part of a broader push to bring Web3 tools into real-world spaces. Another US-based partnership is reportedly on the way, signaling that BlockDAG is not slowing down. With the BDAG price currently locked at $0.0016 until August 11 and a launch target of $0.05, early participants are looking at a 3,025% gain. With over 2 million users already mining through the X1 app and 200,000 holders onboard, BlockDAG is cementing its place among the best long-term cryptos in the market today. 2. Aptos (APT): Expands RWA Reach with Government Support Aptos is quickly rising in the world of real-world assets, securing its position as one of the best long-term cryptos to monitor. With over $538 million locked across tokenized U.S. Treasuries, private credit, and institutional-grade funds, it now ranks third in RWA total value locked, following only Ethereum and zkSync. Its mission to bridge DeFi with traditional finance is gaining real traction. Recent ecosystem upgrades and key partnerships are helping drive adoption. The state of Wyoming’s selection of Aptos to host its WYST stablecoin is a major confidence boost. Rather than chasing headlines, Aptos is building the kind of foundation that supports sustainable long-term value. 3. Pudgy Penguin: Crosses Over from NFTs to Institutional Buzz Pudgy Penguin is moving beyond NFT circles and into the broader spotlight, becoming one of the best long-term cryptos with a strong narrative. The spark came when Coinbase changed its social profile to a Pudgy NFT, which triggered a 60% surge in PENGU’s price and drove its floor price to 11.5 ETH. Momentum continued with the SEC acknowledging an ETF filing from Canary Capital and Coinbase, bringing in NFT influencer AlexOnChain. Pudgy Penguin is blending internet culture, financial relevance, and brand recognition in a way that stands out, especially in a meme-heavy market. Its growing reach is drawing attention from both collectors and institutions. 4. Sei: Gains Ground with Regulatory Approval and DeFi Expansion Sei has seen massive growth in just a few months, jumping from $60 million to over $626 million in total value locked. With full regulatory approval in Japan and a focus on developer-first upgrades, Sei is now one of the best long-term cryptos for those watching real infrastructure take shape. The network’s move to an EVM-only structure is designed to support faster deployment and wider compatibility. A U.S.-backed stablecoin pilot is already live, adding further legitimacy. While SEI’s price remains modest, rising activity and adoption levels suggest that the groundwork is being laid for a meaningful breakout in the next cycle. Key Insights From presale milestones to regulatory approval and breakout brand moves, these four projects are not just riding waves; they are building lasting impact. BlockDAG, Aptos, Pudgy Penguin, and Sei each bring something different to the table, and all are entering the next phase of the market with serious momentum. Still, BlockDAG continues to stand out. Its unmatched presale numbers, expanding global partnerships, and growing user base reflect a strategy built for sustainability. Among the best long-term cryptos, BlockDAG is proving it has both the vision and traction to lead well into 2025 and beyond.

Initial participants include BlackRock, Fidelity, Federated Hermes, and the asset arms of both banks. The platform allows real-time ownership tracking and may support future use in collateral management and settlement. Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon have launched a system allowing institutional clients to access tokenized money market funds. According to a CNBC report published on July 23, the offering targets the $7.1 trillion market, uses Goldman’s blockchain platform to record fund ownership, and is integrated with BNY’s custody services. BlackRock and Fidelity Funds Already Available Clients can invest in tokenized share classes of money market funds managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Federated Hermes, and the asset management divisions of both Goldman and BNY. The product is built for institutional users, including hedge funds, pension funds, and corporates. BNY’s LiquidityDirect and @GoldmanSachs ’ Digital Asset Platform have collaborated to launch tokenized money market funds (MMFs). This significant initiative sets our clients on a path to access a new capability to increase the utility and potential transferability of MMFs in… pic.twitter.com/WJ1lv7m6T4 — BNY (@BNYglobal) July 23, 2025 “We have created the ability for our clients to invest in tokenized money market share classes across a number of fund companies,” said Laide Majiyagbe, Global Head of Liquidity, Financing, and Collateral at BNY. “The step of tokenizing is important, because today that will enable seamless and efficient transactions, without the frictions that happen in traditional markets,” said Majiyagbe. Unlike stablecoins, which serve primarily as a medium of exchange, tokenized money market funds offer yield and may function as cash-equivalent holdings for large financial institutions. According to Goldman and BNY, the funds could eventually be transferred between financial intermediaries without first converting to fiat currency. Goldman Sachs and BNY Target $7.1 Billion Market Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, said the structure supports future use in collateral and trade settlement. “The sheer scale of this market just offers a huge opportunity to create a lot more efficiency across the whole financial plumbing,” he said. “That is what’s really powerful, because you’re creating utility in an instrument where it doesn’t exist today,” said McDermott. The firms see this step as supporting real-time settlement and reducing operational frictions tied to traditional finance infrastructure. They also framed it as complementary to regulatory developments such as the recent GENIUS Act , which establishes a federal framework for stablecoins. According to the report, U.S. money market funds hold about $7.1 trillion in assets, with roughly $2.5 trillion flowing into the space since the Federal Reserve began raising rates in 2022. Most are backed by short-term government or commercial debt. The service is currently limited to institutional users and fund providers participating in the platform. Institutional interest in programmable finance is growing, and assets like money market funds can be embedded into automated workflows across settlement, margining, and treasury operations. Such tokenized instruments could play a central role in modernizing how institutions manage liquidity and collateral across global markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the tax implications for institutions holding tokenized fund shares? While ownership structure remains similar to traditional funds, the digital nature may raise questions around jurisdiction, timing of income recognition, and reporting obligations. Could tokenized funds allow 24/7 liquidity access? If integrated with global custodians and interoperable ledgers, institutions may eventually move capital between regions outside of standard market hours. What legal structures govern these digital fund shares? Each share remains subject to existing securities regulation, but the ownership ledger is now maintained on a permissioned blockchain, allowing traceability without changing asset classification.

According to its announcement , the company will offer $850 million of these notes to qualified institutional purchasers. The notes are due to mature in 2032. In addition, investors can purchase up to $150 million more in principal, which could raise the total proceeds to $1 billion if the option is exercised. Mara said the company plans to use up to $50 million of the net proceeds to repurchase a piece of its outstanding 1.00 percent convertible senior notes that mature in 2026. The balance of the funds will be set aside for capped‑call transaction fees, the purchase of Bitcoin at roughly $118,487 a coin, and general corporate expenses. The new notes will rank as Mara’s senior unsecured obligations and won’t carry any interest payments. The offering remains subject to conditions such as the market, the company said, and it has not set a final date for pricing or completion of the sale. Mara reiterated that BTC is central to its treasury strategy In its latest remarks, the company reiterated that Bitcoin is central to its treasury strategy and that accumulating digital currency is a key part of its long‑term plan for growth. This news follows Mara’s minority investment completion in Two Prime, an institutional adviser that oversees $1.75 billion in assets. The deal will significantly boost Bitcoin managed by Two Prime for Mara, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. In early June, Mara reported that its Bitcoin output rose by 35 percent in May, despite ongoing higher difficulty in mining and a rising network hashrate. Figures from late May released by the company also showed its annual revenue from mining exceeded $752 million, setting a new record for its operations. As of this publication, Mara is holding 50,000 BTC, serving as part of its digital asset reserve. With that amount, Mara ranks as the second-largest corporate BTC holder, behind Strategy, which reports 607,000 BTC in its own treasury. The announcement follows a late‑March filing in which Mara said it had agreements with institutional investors to sell $2 billion of its stock. “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the firm added. Trump Media acquired $2 billion in BTC again Trump Media, the parent of Truth Social, acquired about $2 billion in BTC this week and related securities to solidify its position as a company with a crypto treasury. It also allocated roughly $300 million for securities related to Bitcoin. Trump Media said it will continue adding to its Bitcoin holdings and may convert the company’s options into BTC based on the conditions of the market. In May, the firm joined a growing list of companies following the crypto treasury model from Michael Saylor’s Strategy. PSQ Holdings, in which Trump Jr. serves as a member of the board, has also said that it will be exploring a treasury strategy involving digital assets. “These assets help ensure our company’s financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we’re planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,” said Devin Nunes, chief executive officer and president of Trump Media. Based in Sarasota, Florida, Trump Media said it will use its BTC holdings to bring revenue. It may also purchase more crypto coins. Shares of Trump Media rose more than 7 percent following the announcement, though the company’s stock has fallen about 45 percent in 2025. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

With explosive daily gains and increasing institutional curiosity, meme tokens are once again taking center stage. While some investors chase old legends like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, the real money is now being made in the newer, faster-growing meme coins with actual utility or unique narratives. If timed right, a $10,000 bet on the right meme coins today could easily balloon to $500,000 within the next four months. After analyzing momentum, market cap potential, trading volume, and future roadmap catalysts, three tokens stand out as the top contenders for exponential gains: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and Floki (FLOKI). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin with a Layer 2 Brain Topping the list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme token that’s far more than just hype. It’s the only meme coin powered by its own Layer 2 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain, purpose-built for memes and lightning-fast decentralized apps. With zero taxes, sniper bot protection, and sub-cent gas fees, LILPEPE isn’t just another meme; it’s infrastructure. The presale is currently 88.00% complete in Stage 6, where 1 LILPEPE is valued at $0.0015, with the following price adjustment set to $0.0016. So far, over $7.60 million has been raised, and 5.93 billion tokens have already been snapped up. Even more promising, LILPEPE is now officially listed on CoinMarketCap, a significant credibility boost ahead of its debut on centralized exchanges (CEX). Given its launch price of just $0.003 and considering its unique blockchain utility, many analysts believe LILPEPE could 50x. That kind of growth would turn a $3,000 investment into $150,000. However, for those who invest more deeply, say, a $4,000 allocation, the upside could push your returns to over $200,000 if the coin reaches even $0.10. With a viral community, top exchange listings on the way, and a live $777K giveaway campaign, LILPEPE is clearly in beast mode. Don’t wait, buy LILPEPE now at presale price before it moons. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): Crude, Loud, and Up 20% Today It may be the most ridiculous-sounding crypto in the market, but Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is making some serious noise and profits. Up 20.15% in the last 24 hours and now sitting at $1.48 per token, FARTCOIN is turning heads with a $1.48 billion market cap and an extremely tight supply of just 1 billion tokens. What’s driving this surge? Viral momentum. FARTCOIN is fully embracing shock humor and absurdity, resonating with Gen Z and meme investors alike. With over $493 million in 24-hour volume and a Vol/Mkt Cap ratio of 33.69%, it’s clear that whales and retail traders are piling in hard. A $3,000 bet on FARTCOIN today could easily balloon to $75,000–$90,000 if the coin manages to triple or quadruple over the next market leg a, which is a very realistic target given its current trajectory and cult following. Floki (FLOKI): Smart Branding Meets DeFi and Utility Floki (FLOKI) is the most established of the three, but still has plenty of room to run. Trading at $0.0001330, FLOKI has surged 32% in a single day and now boasts a market capitalization of $1.26 billion. But it’s not just hype. FLOKI boasts a growing DeFi ecosystem, a metaverse project, and educational initiatives focused on blockchain literacy. With 553,600 holders, a daily trading volume of $811 million, and plans to burn tokens aggressively, FLOKI is reigniting investor interest in a big way. FLOKI could see a 4–6x increase in the short term, as it gains momentum across exchanges. Given the upcoming demand-driven narratives, it’s highly probable that a $3,000 investment in FLOKI could increase to $30,000-$50,000 in a matter of months. Conclusion: From $10K to $500K? It’s Within Reach The meme coin market has proven that life-changing gains are possible, but only if you get in before the crowd. Investing $3,000–$3,500 in each of Little Pepe, Fartcoin, and Floki gives a well-balanced meme portfolio primed for asymmetric returns. With the right market conditions and continued viral traction, a $ 10,000 investment today could reasonably grow into $500,000 or more within four months. Little Pepe is the highest-upside contender, still under $0.002, with blockchain utility and major CEX listings on the horizon. Don’t miss the next 50x opportunity. Join the LILPEPE presale now and position yourself before it takes off.

Whales are accumulating aggressively while NFT activity continues to rocket. The Solana meme coin’s recent pullback follows a wild rally, leaving traders on the lookout for the next big move. Behind the price action, $PENGU continues to evolve beyond its meme coin roots, with growing utility across gaming and digital collectibles fueling its volatile rise.

Trading activity has exploded alongside the price, with market data reporting daily volumes of $2.47 billion, which peaked above the $2.5 billion mark during the token’s most frenzied days.

Institutional interest has also been on the rise, especially with speculation surrounding a landmark ETF approval. Last month, Canary Capital filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC/Cboe to list the first product of its kind: an actively managed “Canary PENGU ETF” allocating 80–95% of its assets to PENGU tokens and the remainder to Pudgy Penguins NFTs. CANARY FILES S-1 FOR FIRST OF ITS KIND $PENGU AND PUDGY PENGUINS NFT ETF — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 20, 2025 What began as a niche meme coin embedded within an NFT project has evolved into a multifaceted phenomenon, combining cultural appeal with new financial products. PENGU Pulls Back Into Key Fib Levels as Sellers Press the Tape $PENGU/USDT is retracing after a strong advance, and the charts show the market now probing deeper support zones. The recent high near $0.0466 has given way to a steady drift lower, with the price currently sitting around $0.0410. This move is not yet a complete trend break, but it indicates that momentum has cooled as traders unwind positions after a sharp push. $PENGU/USDT price chart, July 23 (Source: TradingView) Momentum indicators have already flipped to a weaker stance. The RSI, now near 35, has rolled down from overbought levels, indicating that buying pressure has faded. The MACD lines have crossed to the downside, and the histogram is printing red bars, a visual cue that short‑term bearish momentum is in play. On the Fibonacci retracement plotted from the breakout base ($0.0307) to the recent peak ($0.0466), the market has slipped through the 23.6% level and is hovering just above the 38.2% mark near $0.0405. This zone is important to the setup. If buyers step in here, it could still be interpreted as a normal corrective pullback within an uptrend. However, a decisive drop below the 50% retracement near $0.0386 would tilt the bias more clearly toward a deeper correction. The volume footprint provides insight into what’s happening under the hood. Earlier in the session, heavy red deltas appeared on the $PENGU chart, such as –19.65M on 104.52M traded and –7.91M on 166.6M, showing sustained sell‑side aggression. Yet there are also bright spots: a later candle printed a +9.28M delta on 152.72M total, suggesting that dip buyers are at least starting to show interest around these levels. In the near term, PENGU’s ability to stabilize around the $0.0400–$0.0405 area will be key. A rebound with stronger volume could reassert the bullish trend, while failure to hold these Fib levels opens the door for a test of deeper support near $0.0368.

This move by giant investors significantly reduced liquidity on the platform, briefly pushing borrowing rates above 10%. While this increase meant short-term gains for users who deposited their Ethereum to lend on Aave, it turned into a full-blown crisis for investors who implemented strategies to increase their Ethereum staking returns, called “looping.” Looping investors were earning profits by reinvesting Ethereum they had borrowed at low interest rates. However, a sudden increase in interest rates made this strategy unprofitable and led to losses. As a result, many investors quickly closed their positions and began unstaking their Ethereum through liquid staking providers. With these developments, the Ethereum network's outflow queue has reached a record high. According to data from Beaconcha.in, as of Wednesday, the amount of Ethereum waiting to be unstaking had risen to 627,944 (approximately $2.3 billion). It will take the network approximately 11 days to process this volume of transactions. Related News: Company Managing Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Cryptocurrency Sold One Altcoin and Purchased Another in Its Place - Here's Its Portfolio The majority of the withdrawals reportedly belonged to a few large investors. Aave developer Marc Zeller said he believes cryptocurrency billionaire and Tron founder Justin Sun is behind these transactions. Zeller noted that Sun frequently deposits and withdraws large amounts of money from Aave and that his behavior is unpredictable. Wallets associated with Sun on the Arkham platform have withdrawn $646 million worth of Ethereum from Aave over the past three days. Additionally, a wallet belonging to HTX, the crypto exchange for which Sun is an advisor, has withdrawn a net $455 million worth of ETH over the past week. Wallets attributed to Sun still hold $80 million worth of Ethereum on Aave, according to Arkham data. Sun declined to comment. Not only large investors, but also smaller funds like London-based Abraxas Capital Management have withdrawn ETH from Aave.

This strategy, prioritizing aggressive growth and deregulation, promises to reshape the AI landscape, impacting everything from critical infrastructure to innovation and even the competitive stance against global rivals like China. It’s a move that could have profound implications for the future of digital assets and the broader tech ecosystem. How Does Trump’s AI Strategy Prioritize Growth? The Trump administration’s AI strategy , as outlined in its much-anticipated AI Action Plan, marks a significant departure from previous cautious approaches. Instead of primarily focusing on addressing the risks of artificial intelligence, it champions rapid development, infrastructure expansion, and reduced bureaucracy. The core tenet of this Trump AI philosophy is clear: a resounding call to “Build, Baby, Build!” This aggressive stance downplays immediate concerns about AI’s potential harms, instead focusing on an ambitious build-out of data centers and related infrastructure. The administration envisions this as the definitive path to a “new golden age of human flourishing,” justifying significant taxpayer investment in the process. This forward-looking approach also includes initiatives for upskilling the American workforce and partnering with local governments to create jobs within the burgeoning data center sector, aiming to ensure that economic benefits are broadly distributed. Boosting AI Data Centers : What’s the Deregulatory Drive? A cornerstone of the Trump administration’s plan is the expedited development of AI data centers , semiconductor fabrication facilities, and robust power sources. The administration contends that existing environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act, currently impede this crucial progress. To overcome these perceived obstacles, the plan advocates for streamlining permitting processes, creating categorical exclusions, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41. This includes leveraging federal lands, even national parks and military bases, for critical infrastructure development. The strategy also addresses America’s energy grid stability, urging large power consumers, such as AI companies, to manage their consumption during critical grid periods. This point has drawn scrutiny, given past criticisms of companies like xAI and Meta for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities with their energy-intensive operations. Navigating AI Regulation : Will States Lose Control? The AI Action Plan signals a clear intent to limit state-level AI regulation . While a controversial provision in the budget bill that would have barred states from regulating AI for 10 years was recently removed from Senate consideration, the Trump administration proposes alternative mechanisms to achieve similar aims. The plan suggests a direct linkage between states’ federal funding and their compliance with AI regulatory limits. Furthermore, it directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to evaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with its existing obligations and authorities, particularly concerning radio, television, and the internet, opening a potential avenue for federal intervention. On the federal level, the Office of Science and Technology Policy will solicit feedback from businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that might hinder AI innovation and adoption, with the ultimate goal of further deregulation. The Intensifying US China AI Race : What’s at Stake for National Security? Central to the Trump administration’s AI strategy is the intensifying US China AI race . The plan explicitly targets national security threats, aiming to prevent “adversarial technology,” such as Chinese-made chips and hardware, from entering the U.S. supply chain. It mandates federal agencies to work collaboratively to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one notable effort, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. “National security” is a recurring theme throughout the document, appearing 23 times, underscoring the deep integration of AI into U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus. The plan calls for regular assessments of U.S. AI adoption compared to rivals like China, adapting strategies accordingly, and evaluating risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the Department of Defense, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies, solidifying America’s competitive edge. Beyond Infrastructure: What Defines Trump’s Broader AI Strategy ? Beyond infrastructure and international competition, Trump’s broader AI strategy places significant emphasis on protecting free speech and “American values.” This includes a directive to eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), and climate change from federal risk assessment frameworks, aiming for what it describes as “objective” AI systems. The plan states that it is essential for AI systems to be “built from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind.” It also suggests updating federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who “ensure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” This stance, however, raises complex questions about defining and enforcing “neutrality” in AI models, a challenge highlighted by experts. Furthermore, the plan actively encourages the development and adoption of open AI models, particularly those created with American values in mind. This move is largely seen as a direct reaction to the rise of open-source AI models from Chinese AI labs like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen. To foster this, Trump’s plan aims to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large, expensive computing clusters, resources typically only available to major tech companies through multi-million or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. This aspect could significantly benefit American AI companies and organizations that have embraced an open approach, including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face. Balancing Innovation with Responsibility: Challenges Ahead While the Trump administration’s AI Action Plan outlines an ambitious vision for American AI leadership, it also presents significant challenges and potential points of contention. The strong emphasis on deregulation and rapid infrastructure build-out, particularly concerning AI data centers , raises environmental concerns and questions about community impact. Critics have pointed to instances where rapid development has bypassed environmental safeguards, leading to localized pollution. The “war on biased AI” and the push for “objective” systems could lead to complex legal and ethical debates regarding free speech, censorship, and the very definition of neutrality in artificial intelligence, as legal scholars like Eugene Volokh have noted. Defining and enforcing “neutrality” in AI models remains a formidable task, with some experts suggesting that true neutrality might be “literal non-engagement.” While the plan includes some provisions for AI safety and security, such as research into interpretability and adversarial robustness, it generally reduces the reporting burden on tech companies compared to previous administrations, which could raise questions about accountability and risk mitigation. The plan’s focus on integrating AI into national security also necessitates careful consideration of ethical AI use in defense and intelligence. The success of this ambitious AI strategy will ultimately hinge on its execution and its ability to balance rapid innovation with responsible development and addressing the societal implications of AI. Conclusion: A New Era for American AI? The Trump administration’s AI Action Plan undeniably charts a bold, growth-centric course for American AI. It signals a readiness to invest heavily in infrastructure, cut bureaucratic hurdles, and aggressively compete on the global stage, particularly against China in the burgeoning US China AI race . For those tracking the broader tech and crypto markets, this shift could mean new opportunities in data center development, AI-driven applications, and potentially a redefinition of regulatory frameworks. The emphasis on deregulating the development of AI data centers and limiting state-level AI regulation could accelerate technological progress but also ignite debates over environmental and ethical safeguards. However, its execution will be key, and the delicate balance between rapid innovation and addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns will define its ultimate success. The plan sets the stage for a transformative, albeit potentially contentious, era in American AI development, one that promises to reshape the technological landscape for years to come.

Numerous other cryptocurrencies have benefited from the exchange’s support over the past several months, while some have been negatively impacted due to delisting efforts. The Coinbase Effect The US-based cryptocurrency exchange added BankrCoin (BNKR), Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL), and Metaplex (MPLX) to its roadmap on July 22. The section comprises digital assets that may be officially listed on the platform if they meet certain criteria. “The launch of trading for these assets is contingent on market-making support and sufficient technical infrastructure. We will announce the launch of trading separately once these conditions have been met ,” the company clarified. Backing from one of the biggest crypto exchanges typically has a positive effect on the prices of the involved tokens due to increased liquidity, better accessibility, and a boosted reputation. BNKR and MPLX were no exceptions, with their valuations rising by 27% and 18%, respectively. JITO initially pumped but later erased the gains and is currently in the red zone on a daily scale. BNKR Price, Source: CoinGecko An even more impressive price jump was observed last week when Coinbase added Caldera (ERA) to its iOS and Android applications with the “Experimental” label. The move enabled users of the exchange to buy, sell, convert, send, or receive the asset. ERA’s valuation skyrocketed by 75% to surpass $1.80. In the following days, however, the bears stepped in, and as of this writing, the token trades at roughly $1.26. Other Examples More than a month ago, Coinbase officially embraced Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Subsquid (SQD). All of the involved cryptocurrencies experienced a price uptick. In January, the popular meme coin Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) headed north after the exchange enabled trading services with it, whereas Toshi (TOSHI) experienced a triple-digit surge after the company added it to its roadmap. It’s a different story when Coinbase delists cryptocurrencies. In May, Helium Mobile (MOBILE), Render (RNDR), Ribbon Finance (RBN), and Synapse (SYN) witnessed significant crashes after the platform announced it would no longer provide trading services with them.

The company holds 607,770 Bitcoins worth ~$71.96 billion, while trading at a ~$120.87 billion market capitalization. The $84 billion ""42-42 Capital Plan"" aims to raise $42B in equity and $42B in debt to scale. A prolonged crypto winter could cripple MSTR’s capital flywheel, with $12B in liabilities and no organic cash flow to cover them. Despite $12B in liabilities, including debt and preferred stock, MSTR uses leverage to boost Bitcoin-per-share growth. Investment Thesis Since initiating coverage on MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), the stock has surged ~25%, far outperforming the S&P 500’s 9% price return. The analysis was focused on the company’s Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) accumulation strategy through capital markets that generated $15.7 billion in unrealized gains. Today, that thesis has evolved into a capital flywheel. Strategy’s main strength lies in its systematic use of equity and debt at a premium to its Bitcoin NAV that is allowing it to outperform even BTC itself. This strategy, combined with new fair-value accounting standards and $84 billion capital plans push MSTR as the most leveraged, and potentially rewarding, Bitcoin proxy. seekingalpha.com Strategy Targets Bitcoin Per Share Growth via $84 billion Capital Flywheel Strategy's main strength is in its execution of a strategic capital-to-Bitcoin acquisition flywheel. This is far more than a simple corporate treasury strategy of buying and holding an asset. It is a self-reinforcing mechanism to leverage the public capital markets to systematically increase its Bitcoin holdings per share. The entire operation is predicated on the significant premium at which its stock trades relative to the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium expressed as the mNAV multiple (Market Capitalization divided by Bitcoin NAV) serves as the value-creation machine that separates Strategy from any passive investment vehicle, including the big spot Bitcoin ETFs. By converting its inflated equity value into additional Bitcoin, the company creates a narrative for investors that can continue to outpace the performance of Bitcoin itself. This flywheel is not a byproduct of its stock performance. It is an architected and transparently communicated corporate strategy that may continue to support its growth. strategy.com/charts The mechanics of this flywheel is in fundamental market arbitrage. Based on the provided data, Strategy's market capitalization stands at ~ $120.87 billion with the market value of its 607,770 bitcoins is ~$71.96 billion as of writing. This yields an mNAV multiple of roughly 1.68x that means the market values the company at a 68% premium to its direct Bitcoin holdings. It is the gap that the company exploits. When Strategy executes an at-the-market (ATM) offering, as observed in its recent sale of 1.64 million shares for $736.4 million , it is effectively selling its equity at this 1.68x premium. For every dollar of underlying Bitcoin value that a new share represents, the company receives $1.68 in cash. This additional $0.68 refers to as a ""BTC Gain,"" that represents an immediate and direct value accretion for existing shareholders. The capital raised is then deployed to purchase more Bitcoin that is increasing the total size of the company's treasury. Because the capital was raised at a premium, the number of Bitcoins acquired with that capital outpaces the dilutive effect on a value-for-value basis. In short, this is increasing the total amount of Bitcoin for each pre-existing share. strategy.com/history The Q1-FY25 earnings call reveals the $84 billion ""42-42 Capital Plan"" that is a framework to raise $42 billion in equity and $42 billion in fixed income . This plan solidifies the flywheel and signaling that the company intends to continue this process at scale. Michael Saylor’s aim on framing the company as a ""crypto reactor"" that runs on volatility and market premiums is a source for continued stock value growth. He argues that this active management and value creation is the reason why investors should pay a premium for MSTR over a passive spot ETF. An ETF merely provides exposure to Bitcoin's price movement. However, Strategy holds the potential for leveraged outperformance through its treasury operations. This active, value-accretive process creates a loop and justifies the stock's premium, and this premium enables the flywheel to continue operating, driving further accretive acquisitions and supporting the company’s long-term growth beyond the passive appreciation of its core asset. Strategy Q1 Strategy Bets $12 Billion on Leverage to Amplify Bitcoin Gains Strategy's most vital problem is its aggressive and ever-expanding use of leverage that has become an indispensable component of its growth. From a traditional perspective, the company’s balance sheet exhibits numerous red flags that signal excessive risk and potential instability. The debt and preferred equity need the dependence on capital markets to service its obligations rather than organic cash flow. The multi-layered nature of its financing instruments create a weakness. However, Strategy has not sought to mitigate this weakness but has instead supported it. The company is transforming leverage from a source of risk into a tool for expanding returns for its stockholders. This calculated move, that the rewards of leveraged Bitcoin acquisition will outweigh the associated financial risks, is a main feature of its corporate strategy. The company carries a big burden of +$8 billion in debt, primarily structured as convertible notes,and an additional +4 billion in various series of preferred stock (including STRC). This is a total of ~$12 billion in liabilities that hold a claim on the company’s assets senior to that of its common stock. This figure represents a material ~17% of the company's entire Bitcoin NAV with fixed annual obligations for interest and dividend payments. Critically, these obligations are not covered by the cash flow from its legacy software business but rather by the proceeds from ""new stock issuances."" This practice of issuing new equity/debt to pay the interest on old debt is a hallmark of financial distress in conventional sense. Why? The company has a complete dependence on favorable capital market conditions to remain solvent. The capital is stacked with the stock and four distinct series of preferred stock (STRK, STRF, STRD, STRC), each with unique dividend yields and terms, in addition to multiple tranches of convertible bonds. This complex structure can make it hard to determine the actual risk profile of the company. strc-investor-presentation Despite these risks, Strategy has inverted this weakness into a growth driver. The company’s leadership, particularly Michael Saylor, has a clear framework for how this leverage generates superior returns (""BTC Torque"") on common stock. The logic is that raising capital through debt + preferred stock is more accretive than issuing equity when the mNAV premium is high. When Strategy issues $100 million of its 10% perpetual preferred stock (Strife), it acquires $100 million in cash to purchase Bitcoin without any immediate dilution to the common share count. The entire upside from these newly acquired Bitcoins accrues to the benefit of existing stockholders with the only cost being the 10% annual dividend. This single transaction generates a ""BTC dollar gain"" of the full $100 million and a BTC yield of 0.19%-points. Whereas, raising the same $100 million via common stock at a 2x mNAV would yield a gain of only $50 million and a yield of just 0.09%-points. Overall, this comparison points to how the weakness of leverage is wielded as a tool for amplification. This entire strategy is a high-stakes move on the forward price of Bitcoin. The company is borrowing capital at a fixed and known cost to invest in a highly volatile asset that it believes will appreciate at a far greater rate. The spread between Bitcoin's return and the cost of servicing its complex capital structure represents the pure profit generated for MSTR stock. By deliberately taking on the risk associated with this leverage, Strategy aims to grow its Bitcoin-per-share holdings at an accelerated pace for outsized growth that would be impossible to hit through unlevered financing. Built for Bull Runs, Exposed to Crypto Winters MicroStrategy’s strategy is genius in upmarkets but vulnerable in downtrends. A key risk to the thesis is an extended crypto winter where Bitcoin prices stagnate or drop for several months. Bitcoin typically loses momentum 12-18 months after the halving cycles and usually goes on multi-quarter pullbacks. We’re about 15 months out from the prior halving cycle , and the risk of Bitcoin losing momentum, especially should macro tightening re-engage or retail sentiment die back, is rel. MSTR’s entire capital flywheel is based on maintaining a healthy market premium over its Bitcoin NAV. If Bitcoin prices drop sharply, or the mNAV multiple contracts due to broader crypto pessimism, the company’s ability to raise accretive capital (via equity or preferreds) dries up. Worse, its $12 billion in fixed liabilities (this is mostly debt and preferred dividends) don’t pause when crypto pauses. Unlike a passive ETF, MSTR has actively committed funding with little recurring operating cash flow to fund them. If the capital markets lose faith and Bitcoin drops, MSTR could face a squeeze both ways: falling asset values and tightening funding options. The flywheel that amplifies upside could just as easily magnify the downside. calebandbrown.com Takeaway MicroStrategy isn’t just buying Bitcoin, it’s engineering a capital flywheel that converts market premiums into accelerated Bitcoin-per-share growth. By strategically using leverage and equity at a premium, MSTR is outperforming Bitcoin itself. For investors seeking amplified BTC exposure, this is arguably the boldest, and potentially most rewarding, Bitcoin proxy on the market.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-23 17:18:13

The platform is joining forces with Everclear, a recognized protocol for cross-chain settlements. The move comes as stablecoin sees an uptick in demand after the US signed the GENIUS Act into law last week. Meanwhile, NEAR’s latest collaboration is more than shared goals. The deal includes Near Protocol making a significant investment in Everclear to boost operations in response to the increasing demand for reliable multi-chain liquidity. Stablecoins have witnessed remarkable growth over the past few sessions, with their market capitalization soaring steadily past $260 billion ( Coinmarketcap data ). That has boosted demand for clearing markets, which the NEAR Foundation believes would grow into a massive industry in the coming years. The team stated: As the clearing market for digital assets grows to a trillion-dollar industry, Everclear’s adoption of NEAR’s tech will be key to solving liquidity fragmentation across chains. NEAR Protocol @NEARProtocol · Follow The NEAR ecosystem is excited for this strategic partnership with Everclear ( @EverclearOrg )!As the clearing market for digital assets grows to a trillion dollar industry, Everclear’s adoption of NEAR’s tech will be key to solving liquidity fragmentation across chains 🤝 4:01 PM · Jul 23, 2025 244 Reply Copy link Read 55 replies Streamlining cross-chain transactions If you have ever transferred coins or stablecoins across different blockchains, you may know how clunky and fragmented the process feels at times. Swap fees, manual rebalancing, bridges, and potential human error often dent the user experience. That’s what NEAR Foundation and Everclear promise to solve. Everclear will leverage Near’s Chain Abstraction stack and Intents ecosystem to access tools needed for seamless cross-chain liquidity management. The platform can automatically rebalance massive transactions up to $5M without manual transactions or centralized exchanges (CEXs). Moreover, users will enjoy near-zero costs. Illia Polosukhin, NEAR co-founder, added that the objective is to ensure AI agents and humans can seamlessly access liquidity, regardless of where the stablecoin lives or the minting chain. Polosukhin said : Unifying liquidity for both human and AI users is a key mission for NEAR and the Intents ecosystem. We’re happy that Everclear will utilize NEAR Intents for cross-chain clearing and settlement amid the proliferation of stablecoins, chains, and new asset types in the market today – we see a great opportunity in our work together. Notably, Everclear leverages netting and clearing to ensure an efficient financial system. Instead of moving each transaction one by one, its systems explore the difference between them and only transfer what is necessary. For context, if you owe a friend $100 and he owes you $90, Everclear only clears the net difference ($10) rather than sending $90 and $100 separately. Everclear CEO Dima Khanarin trusts the cross-chain clearing market for cryptocurrencies will skyrocket above $1 trillion amid intensifying demand for stablecoins. According to Dima Khanarin: Partnering with the NEAR Foundation enables Everclear to scale liquidity in the system and target billions in monthly volume over the next 12 months. With hundreds of stablecoins and new appchains like Robinhood launching, the cross-chain clearing market for digital assets is poised to surpass $1 trillion. NEAR price outlook Near’s native coins displayed bearishness today. It has lost more than 6% in the past 24 hours to hover at $2.79. The declining daily trading volume signals weakness, positioning NEAR for further dips.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-23 17:22:00

In a move that has certainly turned heads, Jim Cramer recently declared his surprising desire to hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) for his children, viewing them as a crucial hedge against burgeoning U.S. debt. This statement is particularly intriguing given Cramer’s well-known, and sometimes contrarian, market forecasting track record. But what exactly drives this unexpected pivot towards digital assets, and what does it mean for the broader discussion around cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment for the future? Why Jim Cramer Sees Bitcoin and Ether as a Hedge? Jim Cramer’s rationale for embracing digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether is rooted in a fundamental concern about the future of traditional finance, specifically the escalating U.S. national debt. A “hedge” in financial terms is an investment intended to offset potential losses or gains that may be incurred by a companion investment. In this context, Cramer views Bitcoin and Ether as potential safeguards against the devaluation of fiat currency and the erosion of purchasing power that could result from unchecked government spending and increasing debt burdens. Inflationary Pressures: As national debt grows, governments may resort to printing more money, which can lead to inflation. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin with its capped supply, are often seen as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin and Ether operate on decentralized networks, making them less susceptible to government interference or policy shifts that could impact their value. Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” serves as a robust store of value due to its scarcity and global accessibility, preserving wealth across generations. Long-Term Vision: Cramer’s emphasis on holding these assets for his children underscores a long-term investment perspective, suggesting he believes in their enduring value proposition beyond short-term market volatility. This perspective aligns with a growing sentiment among some investors who are seeking alternatives to traditional assets in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. The idea that digital assets could serve as a modern-day financial ark against the flood of national debt is gaining traction, even if the volatility of these assets remains a significant consideration. The Jim Cramer Effect: Navigating Market Predictions Jim Cramer is undeniably a polarizing figure in financial media. His enthusiastic, often theatrical, market predictions have earned him a loyal following, but also a reputation for being a “contra-indicator.” This phenomenon, humorously dubbed the “Jim Cramer effect,” suggests that the opposite of his predictions often comes true. This makes his recent endorsement of Jim Cramer Bitcoin and Ether all the more fascinating for observers. For years, Cramer has offered advice across various asset classes, from stocks to commodities. While he has had notable successes, some of his more high-profile calls have famously gone awry, leading to the creation of inverse Cramer ETFs and online memes. This history prompts a critical question: should investors take his crypto endorsement seriously, or is it another signal to do the opposite? It’s crucial to differentiate between an individual’s personal investment philosophy and general market advice. Cramer’s decision to hold Bitcoin and Ether for his children speaks to his personal conviction about long-term wealth preservation, rather than a short-term trading tip. His evolving stance on cryptocurrencies also reflects a broader shift in mainstream financial perception, where once-skeptical figures are beginning to acknowledge the potential of digital assets. Ultimately, the “Jim Cramer effect” serves as a reminder for all investors to conduct their own thorough research and not rely solely on any single personality’s pronouncements, regardless of their prominence. Personal financial decisions, especially regarding volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, should always be based on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and independent analysis. Understanding Digital Assets: Bitcoin and Ether’s Role To fully grasp Jim Cramer’s interest, it’s essential to understand what Bitcoin and Ether are and why they stand out in the vast digital asset landscape. Both are foundational cryptocurrencies, but they serve different, albeit sometimes overlapping, purposes. Bitcoin (BTC): The Pioneer Digital Gold Scarcity: Capped supply of 21 million coins, making it deflationary by design. Decentralization: Operates on a proof-of-work blockchain, secured by a global network of miners. Primary Use Case: Primarily functions as a store of value and a medium of exchange. It’s often compared to digital gold due to its scarcity and perceived hedge properties against inflation and economic uncertainty. Ether (ETH): The Fuel for Decentralized Applications Smart Contracts: Powers the Ethereum blockchain, which enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Utility: ETH is used to pay for transaction fees (gas) on the Ethereum network and is central to the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ecosystems. Evolving Supply: While not capped like Bitcoin, Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge) and subsequent upgrades have introduced deflationary mechanisms, making its supply more dynamic. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ether (ETH) Primary Purpose Store of Value, Digital Gold Utility, Fuel for dApps, DeFi, NFTs Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Supply Cap 21 Million No fixed cap, but deflationary mechanisms Innovation Focus Security, Scarcity, Decentralization Scalability, Programmability, Ecosystem Development Both assets represent significant innovations in finance and technology. Jim Cramer’s interest in both suggests a recognition of their distinct yet complementary roles in a diversified digital asset portfolio, particularly one aimed at long-term wealth preservation. Is Jim Cramer’s Crypto Vision Right for Your Family? Actionable Insights While Jim Cramer’s personal conviction about holding Bitcoin and Ether for his children is noteworthy, it prompts a broader question for every individual and family: are digital assets a suitable addition to your long-term investment strategy? The decision to invest in cryptocurrencies should be approached with caution, comprehensive research, and a clear understanding of the associated risks and potential benefits. Benefits of Considering Crypto as a Long-Term Asset: Potential for High Returns: Historically, cryptocurrencies have offered significant returns, though past performance is not indicative of future results. Diversification: They can offer diversification from traditional asset classes, as their price movements may not always correlate with stocks or bonds. Technological Advancement: Investing in crypto is also an investment in a burgeoning technology that could reshape global finance and digital interactions. Challenges and Risks to Be Aware Of: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for extreme price swings, which can lead to substantial losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving globally, posing risks for investors. Security Concerns: Digital assets are susceptible to hacking, fraud, and loss if not stored securely. Complexity: Understanding the underlying technology and market dynamics can be challenging for new investors. Actionable Insights for Your Investment Journey: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on celebrity endorsements. Understand the technology, market cap, use cases, and risks of any crypto asset. Start Small: Begin with a small percentage of your overall portfolio that you are comfortable losing. Long-Term Horizon: If you’re considering crypto as a hedge, adopt a long-term investment mindset to ride out short-term volatility. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Continuously educate yourself on market trends, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and risk tolerance, seek guidance from a qualified financial professional. Jim Cramer’s endorsement is a sign of growing mainstream acceptance, but it should serve as a starting point for your own diligent exploration, not as a definitive guide. Investing for your children’s future requires a thoughtful and responsible approach, prioritizing education and risk management above all else. Summary: Jim Cramer’s surprising revelation about wanting to hold Bitcoin and Ether for his children as a hedge against U.S. debt highlights a fascinating intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. While Cramer’s market predictions often invite skepticism, his personal long-term conviction underscores a growing narrative around cryptocurrencies as potential safeguards against economic uncertainty. Both Bitcoin and Ether offer distinct value propositions, from Bitcoin’s role as digital gold to Ether’s utility in decentralized ecosystems. However, for any investor, particularly those considering digital assets for their family’s future, thorough research, understanding of volatility and risks, and a long-term perspective are paramount. Ultimately, Cramer’s move serves as a powerful catalyst for a broader discussion on how digital assets might fit into a diversified portfolio aimed at preserving wealth across generations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why does Jim Cramer believe Bitcoin and Ether are a hedge against U.S. debt?

The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to reclaim $118,000 and reach $119,980 on Tuesday. However, it could not cross $120,000 and retreated during the ongoing session. BTC is down 1.48% during the ongoing session, trading around $118,201. Bitcoin ETFs Snap 12-Day Inflow Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs broke their 12-day inflow streak amid profit-taking, registering a net outflow of $131.5 million on Monday. The 12-day inflow streak had seen investors pour $6.6 billion into the ETFs. ARK Invest saw the largest outflow, shedding $77.6 million, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, which registered $36.7 million worth of inflows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC registered outflows of around $12.75 million. Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL also registered nominal outflows of $1.91 million and $2.48 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT did not register any inflows or outflows. The cumulative net inflows stand at a healthy $54.62 billion, while total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $151 billion, 6.52% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The outflows came as investors and institutions locked in their profits to manage risk. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, stated, “The recent ETF outflows reflect profit-taking near the highs and measured institutional rebalancing to lock in gains.” Strategy Owns 3% of Bitcoin (BTC) Supply Michael Saylor’s Strategy owns 3% of the Bitcoin (BTC) supply after completing its latest purchase of the asset earlier this week. The firm announced its latest purchase earlier this week, acquiring 6,220 BTC for $739 million, taking its total Bitcoin holdings to 607,770 BTC , worth $72 billion at current prices. Strategy has used a combination of common and preferred shares, along with debt, to fund its Bitcoin purchases. The company began accumulating the asset in late 2020 as a hedge against inflation. In a separate announcement, Strategy stated that it planned to offer 5 million variable-rate Series A perpetual Stretch preferred shares to finance future Bitcoin purchases. Bitcoin (BTC) Unlikely To Hit $200,000 In 2025 Glassnode lead analyst James Check believes Bitcoin is unlikely to reach $200,000 this year as buying volume is not increasing enough to push prices higher. The observation comes amid several industry executives predicting a rally to $200,000. Check stated in an interview, “How on earth can we be going up when there is no volume? $200,000 in six months is a big move — that’s a big move.” Check added that a rally would double Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of around $2.38 trillion. However, he said he does not see such a move materializing until volumes increase. “Could it happen? Absolutely. Is it likely to happen? Very improbable. Until I see that volume kick in, until I feel a bit more confident, I am certainly not going to put on any levered positions. I’m probably not going to go out on the risk curve until I see that the market is stabilized.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) failed to reclaim $120,000 on Tuesday despite building on Monday’s positive start. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday before losing momentum and settling at $117,387. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 2%, crossing $119,000. However, it fell short of the $120,000 mark, settling at $119,980 before declining during the ongoing session. While BTC continues consolidating below $120,000, market analysts believe the bull cycle has some way to run. According to analytics firm Bitcoin Vector, although momentum has slowed, on-chain metrics indicate that the bullish structure remains intact. The firm stated in a post on X, “Momentum has cooled, but structure and fundamentals remain solid. This isn’t a top. It’s a coiled setup with support beneath it.” Bitcoin Vector explained that with the BTC price compressed, fundamentals have paused and are not weakening. Buyers could simply be waiting for confirmation of the breakout. Meanwhile, Swissblock analyzed Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) cost basis, stating that STHs were active and not exhausted. The STH cost basis is the average purchase price of investors who have held BTC for less than 155 days. According to Swissblocks, the price reached the “heated” band of this metric on July 14, but did not push into the overheated zone. Swissblock added, “Profit-taking is present, but the STH risk zone at $138K hasn’t been reached. This suggests there's still room for expansion before we see any panic selling or euphoria.” BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 2% to $118,626. It soared past $120,000 on Monday, surging to a new all-time high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,716, ultimately registering a 0.92% increase. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday as traders began locking in their gains. As a result, it fell almost 2%, dropping to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.82% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. BTC encountered volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose 0.39% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Friday as BTC fell 1.03% to $117,877. The price remained bearish over the weekend, registering a marginal decline on Saturday and dropping 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240. BTC reached an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday, making a positive start to the week. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $117,397, ultimately registering a marginal increase.

The case, originally filed publicly by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on July 11, was accompanied by a press release outlining charges against a Nigerian national accused of impersonating Steve Witkoff , a prominent real estate figure and co-chair of Trump’s inaugural committee, to convince two victims to transfer $250,000 worth of Ethereum. But hours later, the entire docket vanished from public view. A Nigerian scammer posed as Steve Witkoff, co-chair of the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, to steal $250,300 in Ethereum-based USDT. #CryptoScam #CryptoScheme #FBI https://t.co/vqGv6Awtq3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 Legal experts flagged the full sealing as highly unusual. While redacting victim names is standard in DOJ filings, complete case sealing is typically reserved for matters involving national security or ongoing covert investigations. The fact that the DOJ had already publicized the complaint suggests the seal was never intended or authorized. DOJ Error Raises Questions on Transparency, Privacy, and MoonPay’s Role The original complaint, briefly visible before the sealing, identified the victims by first names: “Ivan” and “Mouna.” The crypto community immediately recognized the importance: those are the same first names as MoonPay’s CEO Ivan Soto-Wright and CFO Mouna Doumani. As NOTUS first reported , blockchain wallet addresses tied to the scam were previously linked to Soto-Wright in a 2023 lawsuit, further deepening the intrigue. While the DOJ has maintained that the executives were victims of identity fraud, the sealing chaos and MoonPay’s growing political affiliations have prompted fresh scrutiny. The company has recently positioned itself as an exclusive partner in the rollout of Trump-themed meme coins. Acting U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro confirmed to NOTUS that the full case seal was never requested by prosecutors. Instead, she said, a clerical mistake by court staff triggered the temporary blackout. “The court made a ministerial, clerical error that, as soon as we realized it, within hours, the whole docket was unsealed,” Pirro stated. “They admitted we never asked for the docket to be sealed.” According to Pirro, the DOJ only requested that the original complaint be sealed to redact a company’s name. An amended, public version was then submitted, though observers noted no clear difference in corporate naming between versions. “This is the type of case where victims—including individuals, employees of a company, as well as a victim company—have a right to not have their names included in a complaint,” Pirro added. As of now, MoonPay has not issued a public statement on the filing. Meanwhile, critics are pointing to the DOJ’s handling of the complaint as a troubling example of selective transparency, especially in a case involving influential crypto executives and political operatives. MoonPay Donates $1M to Pro-Crypto PAC During the 2024 Election In May 2024, MoonPay donated $1 million to Stand With Crypto , a political group backing pro-crypto legislation. The company cited growing regulatory pressure as its reason for supporting the PAC, which was launched to fund crypto-aligned candidates . MoonPay said the 2024 election will shape the industry’s future and called for support of lawmakers pushing for clear crypto rules. The move follows a broader trend of crypto firms donating to candidates, including Trump’s 2024 campaign. Federal Election Commission filings from April showed that several crypto firms and executives made large donations to President Donald Trump’s 2024 inauguration fund. These included $1 million from Solana Labs, over $245,000 from Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, and $100,000 from Consensys. Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple Labs, Robinhood, and Ondo Finance were also listed among donors. Following Trump’s re-election, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by acting chair Mark Uyeda, has closed a number of enforcement cases involving donors, including those against Uniswap and Consensys.

On July 23, the company announced that it began trading stock options on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol BMNR. Investors can now buy and sell options on BitMine shares. This gives them more ways to invest in the company. The new options listing indicates that more people are interested in BitMine and its plans for the expanding Ethereum market. Stock Options Give Investors More Choice The listing of BitMine stock options allows investors to trade the company’s shares more flexibly. Options give people the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain price by a specific date. This helps investors manage risk, plan future moves, and capitalize on price changes. The options for BitMine are listed on the NYSE and follow the rules of the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which helps maintain fair and safe trading. These options are available with various expiration dates and strike prices, allowing both small and large investors to select the option that best suits their needs. Ethereum’s Supply is Tight, and Demand is Growing The listing comes at a time when the Ethereum market is seeing a strong rally in the crypto market. Since mid-May 2025, investors have purchased over 2.83 million ETH, valued at approximately $10 billion. This is more than 30 times the amount of new ETH created in the same time. Most of this buying has come from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries. BitMine is one of those companies. These large purchases have pushed the price of Ethereum up by over 160% since April. Experts say the rise is not just about hype; it is mainly due to real demand. At the same time, only around 800,000 new ETH are expected to be released over the next year. This creates a big gap between supply and demand, which is expected to keep pushing the coin’s prices higher. BitMine’s Long-Term Plan for Ethereum Leadership BitMine is not just mining cryptocurrency. It has a clear and long-term strategy. The company aims to establish one of the most extensive Ethereum holdings in the world by acquiring 5% of the total ETH supply. This goal gives the company a strong position and continues to attract institutional investors, such as Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, as the market evolves. Other companies, such as Bit Digital and SharpLink Gaming, are also adding ETH to their balance sheets . Together, they are helping to change how Ethereum is seen, not just as a currency, but as a valuable asset for long-term growth.

He said that the SEC was initially hesitant. They asked Teucrium and others to withdraw their filings, citing low liquidity in the futures market. Sal recalled that the government’s stance at the time forced firms like his to comply. Yet, he and his team continued to track the market closely. When they believed liquidity had improved, they refiled. SEC Changes the Rules Midway Teucrium filed its Bitcoin futures ETF under the 1933 Act, which came with a long 270-day approval timeline. Later that same year, former SEC ChairmanGary Gensler changed the rules and allowed filings under the 1940 Act, a quicker, 75-day process commonly used for mutual funds. Many large firms like BlackRock and Fidelity jumped in under this structure and got approvals faster, even though Teucrium had filed first. Talking to Thinking Crypto, Sal described this sudden shift as “very disconcerting,” explaining how it cost his firm valuable market opportunities. Despite this, Teucrium’s approved filing played a key role in Grayscale’s legal battle against the SEC. Sal said that Teucrium’s approval was referenced in the lawsuit, which Grayscale ultimately won.. Why Teucrium Is Betting on XRP Sal also shared why his firm has now filed for a leveraged XRP ETF, called “Double XRP.” While he doesn’t consider himself a fan of coins like Ethereum or Solana, he understands and supports the mission behind XRP. According to him, Ripple’s focus on modernizing cross-border payments and replacing the outdated SWIFT system is both practical and powerful. He believes Ripple has consistently demonstrated professionalism and long-term strategy, particularly in improving the speed and efficiency of asset transfers. He said, “Anything that speeds up the system makes sense.” Rather than compete head-to-head with big firms like BlackRock and Fidelity for a basic spot XRP ETF, Teucrium filed for a more specialized leveraged XRP ETF. This plays to their strength in derivatives and allows them to stand out in a crowded field.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-23 17:27:27

According to data, Nintendo Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in June 2025. This surpasses the previous record set by the PlayStation 4 in November 2013 with 1.1 million consoles. Nintendo Switch 2 sales began on June 5, 2025. The best-selling device in terms of dollar sales was the Pro Controller for the Nintendo Switch 2. Circana data from Executive Director Mat Piscatella on Bluesky estimates that over 1 million Switch 2 consoles were sold in North America. According to a list of the best-selling games each month, four of the games featured in the top 20 have native Switch 2 ports, with several others having backward-compatible Switch 1 releases. Mario Kart World came in third on the list, which is quite an achievement given that neither digital sales nor console bundle sales were counted. Meanwhile, Nintendo Switch 2 is not constantly in stock, but there are positive signs that supply is catching up with demand. Switch 2 restocks are becoming more frequent and lasting longer before the console returns to its default state of being sold out. The gaming industry saw a surge amid tariffs The Switch 2 has way more storage , higher quality video output, maximum frame rates, and a bigger screen than both the original Switch and 2021’s Switch OLED. The original Switch cost $300, the OLED $350. Now the price of Switch 2 is $449.99. When asked if Nintendo priced the console correctly, Piscatella said, “Day 1 buyers are going to be the least price sensitive. They still would have bought if the Switch 2 launched at an even higher price,” he said. “The real test will be during the holiday, when more mass market/gift buyers will be considering a purchase.” In addition, due to Trump’s tariffs, the cost of all accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 went up. This shows the effort to evaluate the potential impact of Trump’s tariffs. However, this was also across the board. After the tariffs, the Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage costs $379.99 in the US, up from $299.99. The Xbox Series X goes for $599.99 instead of $499.99. Meanwhile, the special edition of the Xbox Wireless Controller increased $10 to $79.99. However, even after the rocky tariff period, the total spending in the US on gaming hardware in June 2025 showed year-over-year growth of 249%, reaching $978 million according to Circana. This set a new record for hardware spending in June in the US, surpassing the $608 million recorded in June 2008. Also, across the board, $4.4 billion was spent on video games in June, with the Switch 2 helping bolster this figure with its launch lineup. Nintendo Announces Pokémon Legends Switch 2 Bundle Nintendo has officially revealed a brand-new Switch 2 bundle with its upcoming hit game, Pokémon Legends: Z-A. After the limited-time Mario Kart World bundle, this is the second big bundle for the new system.

The next breakout altcoins are already heating up. With July ticking away, the window to get in early is closing fast, and all eyes are turning to two names making serious noise, Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is $0.03 in presale phase 5. It will never dip below that, and there is a 16.67% token price increase that will be activated in phase 6. Mutuum Finance’s fifth presale phase is over 85% sold out and has attracted over $12,900,000, and 13,900 unique holders now possess the token. These two tokens could be the ones everyone will wish they grabbed sooner. Cardano Outpacing Solana in Strategic Rotation Cardano (ADA), currently trading around $0.88, has emerged as a favored choice for investors seeking a robust and active Layer‑1 ecosystem this summer. Its growth is underscored by steady ecosystem expansion, with over 2,006 projects and 1.33 million staking wallets active, and daily transaction volumes topping $111 million. ADA has also seen solid technical and market momentum, climbing about 15–20% in recent weeks and outperforming many peers, while development updates like firmware and Hydra scaling draw increased institutional attention. With growing regulatory clarity ahead of a possible U.S. ETF decision in August, ADA stands out as a structured, scientifically grounded alternative to Solana’s faster-paced narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Hits $12.9 Million Milestone Mutuum Finance presale is blazing hot. Over 13900 investors have already invested in the presale and have raised over $12.9 million, definitely a sign of more hype. Price hikes are on their way because Phase 5 has already reached 85%. Investing now helps investors get the lowest price for the highest Return on Investment. Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto community, not through hype but through actual utility and security at scale, with its innovative dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin. Improving Security: Mutuum Finance Launches $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance in its security and transparency aspect has introduced its official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK for a bounty of $50,000 USDT. It rewards in four classes i.e., critical, major, minor and low where there is reward for each type of vulnerability. This is yet another feature which expresses the proactive approach of Mutuum in establishing trust in terms of solid infrastructure and secure security. Additionally, the project is in the process of creating an Ethereum-based stablecoin, pegged on the USD. The asset will remain stable during volatility periods unlike algorithmic stablecoins that depeg during periods of volatility. Mutuum Finance $100,000 Giveaway The project is audited and certified by CertiK paving the way towards mass adoption. MUTM is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway and 10 lucky winners will get $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) are proving to be the altcoins investors wish they had gotten sooner, with Mutuum already raising $12.9 million from over 13,900 holders and Phase 5 presale 85% sold out at $0.03. A 16.67% price increase is locked in for Phase 6, leaving a narrow entry window for those seeking maximum upside. ADA’s ecosystem expansion and MUTM’s dual-lending innovation, $50,000 CertiK-backed security bounty, and $100,000 giveaway all point toward accelerating growth.

Key Takeaways: Tether has expanded its partnership with INHOPE to combat the use of crypto in child exploitation. The company has frozen $225 million in USDT linked to human trafficking and romance scams. Tether says it has blocked $2.7 billion to date. In a Wednesday press release , Tether, issuer of the world’s most widely used stablecoin, said it has implemented monitoring tools and compliance protocols to identify and disrupt suspicious financial activity linked to CSAM. The move deepens a relationship that began in 2023, when Tether became INHOPE’s first cryptocurrency partner. Tether Teams Up With Regulators to Tackle Crypto Crime Tether said it works with exchanges, law enforcement, and international regulators to trace and prevent such abuse. “Blockchain technology has the power to bring transparency and accountability to financial transactions,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. “By expanding this initiative, we reinforce our commitment to responsible innovation and safeguarding the integrity of digital assets.” The collaboration comes amid Tether’s growing role in efforts to dismantle criminal networks. INHOPE is excited to expand our partnership with @Tether_to in the fight against CSAM. As our first crypto partner in 2023, their ongoing commitment shows how vital financial companies are in this fight. Proud to welcome them as a Gold Partner https://t.co/QGPAzjl65P — INHOPE (@INHOPE_PR) July 23, 2025 As reported, Tether has frozen $225 million worth of USDT linked to a large-scale “pig butchering” romance scam and international human trafficking operation, marking the largest USDT confiscation to date. The action followed a months-long investigation in collaboration with crypto exchange OKX and the U.S. Department of Justice. The seized funds were traced using blockchain analytics tools provided by Chainalysis, allowing investigators to follow the movement of illicit tokens and prevent further misuse. The wallets involved were self-custodial, requiring extended tracking efforts across multiple jurisdictions. In May, a Tether representative told Cryptonews.com that the company has successfully frozen and blocked $2.7 billion in USD₮ to date. The statement came in response to a report that claimed a delay in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions could be executed. “While any delay in enforcement should be examined, the idea that this represents a systemic loophole is both misleading and lacking perspective as Tether collaborates with law enforcement to freeze addresses on a daily basis,” the representative said. Stablecoins Surge to $252B, but Security Lags Behind The first half of 2025 saw the stablecoin market grow substantially, with total supply rising from $204 billion to $252 billion and monthly settlement volumes hitting $1.39 trillion, according to CertiK’s latest report. Despite this momentum, the firm warned that many projects remain vulnerable due to uneven security measures and inconsistent regulatory readiness. CertiK’s Skynet Stablecoin Framework assessed top stablecoins based on compliance, transparency, and operational risks. USDT maintained dominance, especially on Tron, while USDC strengthened its position with a MiCA license and IPO. Other strong performers included PYUSD, RLUSD, and FDUSD. However, the sector recorded $2.47 billion in losses across 344 incidents, largely due to poor key management and flawed DeFi logic, not smart contract bugs. One of the most alarming events was FDUSD’s temporary depeg to $0.76 in March, triggered by concerns over reserve quality.

Today, we delve into a significant development that promises to reshape how data is managed on-chain: the launch of Walrus Protocol Quilt on the Sui Blockchain. This isn’t just another update; it’s a pivotal moment for developers and users alike, offering a dedicated solution for storing small, yet critical, digital assets directly on a decentralized ledger. If you’ve ever wondered about the practicalities of housing NFTs, AI data, or even system logs securely and scalably on a blockchain, then this breakthrough is set to capture your attention. What is Walrus Protocol Quilt and Why Does it Matter? The announcement from the Layer-1 blockchain Sui on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted the arrival of Walrus Protocol Quilt , a native storage solution specifically engineered for compact data. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it such a significant step forward for the blockchain ecosystem? At its core, Quilt is designed to address a long-standing challenge in decentralized applications: the efficient and cost-effective storage of small files directly on the blockchain. Native Integration: Unlike off-chain storage solutions that require bridges or external services, Quilt is built directly on Sui, ensuring seamless integration and enhanced security. Optimized for Small Files: While traditional blockchain storage can be expensive and inefficient for small data packets, Quilt is purpose-built to handle items like NFTs, AI model parameters, game assets, and application logs with greater efficiency. Scalability at its Core: Designed to support highly scalable, on-chain applications, Quilt provides the foundational layer for complex dApps that demand reliable and persistent data storage. The importance of Walrus Protocol Quilt cannot be overstated. It unlocks new possibilities for developers who previously faced limitations in storing certain types of data directly on-chain, often resorting to less decentralized or more complex hybrid solutions. This native capability streamlines development, reduces complexity, and enhances the overall integrity of on-chain applications. How Does Walrus Protocol Quilt Enhance Sui’s Ecosystem? Sui, known for its high throughput and low-latency capabilities, provides a robust foundation for innovative decentralized applications. The integration of Walrus Protocol Quilt further solidifies Sui’s position as a leading Layer-1 blockchain by filling a crucial gap in its infrastructure. This synergy creates a more complete and powerful ecosystem for developers and users. Consider the following aspects of how Quilt enhances Sui: Feature Impact on Sui Ecosystem Traditional Approach (Challenges) Native On-Chain Storage Enables direct, secure storage of small files, reducing reliance on centralized services and improving data integrity. Off-chain storage (e.g., AWS, IPFS) requires external links, potential for data availability issues, and less decentralization. Optimized for Small Data Cost-effective and efficient storage for NFTs, AI data, and logs, making complex dApps more viable on Sui. Storing small files directly on many blockchains can be prohibitively expensive due to high gas fees and block size limitations. Scalability Support Provides a scalable storage layer that complements Sui’s high transaction throughput, fostering the growth of data-intensive applications. Scalability bottlenecks arise when dApps need to store significant amounts of small, frequently accessed data on a blockchain not optimized for it.

In the world of global finance, a seismic shift may be underway. According to crypto pundit Pumpius, the traditional SWIFT banking system is nearing its twilight, and XRP is positioning itself as the strategic successor. As the backbone of international money transfers, SWIFT is used by over 11,000 financial institutions and has long dominated the cross-border payments space. However, it has been criticized for being slow, costly, and outdated in an era that increasingly values speed and transparency. This is where XRP enters the picture. Pumpius argues that XRP is emerging as the ”new chesspiece” in global finance due to its ability to settle transactions in seconds, at fractions of a cent, and without the need for intermediaries. Unlike SWIFT, which simply sends payment instructions, XRP enables actual value transfer, offering finality and liquidity in real-time. At the heart of Pumpius’ thesis is RippleNet’s growing adoption. For instance, more than 100 financial institutions worldwide have partnered with Ripple, using its blockchain-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system, which leverages XRP to bridge fiat currencies across borders. Countries exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are also considering the XRPL technology to enable cross-border interoperability. Geopolitical developments is another factor that might fuel the XRP Ledger adoption. With rising tensions between East and West and the weaponization of SWIFT, such as its exclusion of certain nations from the network, there’s growing demand for a politically neutral, decentralized alternative. XRP, with its global reach and increasing regulatory clarity, fits that profile. SWIFT’s last sunset isn’t just about technology, it’s about control,” says Pumpius. “As power shifts away from legacy institutions to decentralized networks, XRP stands as the most viable bridge between old money and the new digital economy.” XRP Ledger Wallets Soar to a Record High of 7.24 Million According to CryptoQuant data, the XRP Ledger has hit an exceptional milestone of more than 7.24 million active wallets, marking the strongest surge in its history. Therefore, this breakthrough reflects a dynamic fusion of retail enthusiasm, institutional backing, and robust network upgrades. Given that cross-border adoption, real-world asset tokenization, and prominent endorsements are converging to transform XRPL’s ecosystem, crypto-on-chain analytics are bullish. As a result, experts now view XRPL as a viable alternative to SWIFT, projecting as much as 14% of global payments volume could shift onto the ledger in coming years. Conclusion Renowned analyst Pumpius predicts a turning point in global finance because as the legacy SWIFT system fades, XRP is rising as the new strategic linchpin for cross-border value transfer, thanks to the XRP Ledger. As a result, with wallet growth at 7.24 million, active usage at unprecedented levels, whale accumulation breaking records, and powerful institutional validation unfolding, the XRPL stands at the threshold of accelerated mainstream adoption.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|WALLET|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-23 17:42:18

In the fast-paced world of digital assets, such dramatic shifts are not uncommon. Recently, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant event: a massive crypto futures liquidation wave. Within a single hour, major exchanges processed liquidations totaling an astonishing $110 million. Zooming out, the past 24 hours saw an even more staggering figure, with over $607 million worth of futures positions wiped out. These numbers aren’t just statistics; they represent substantial capital shifts and a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in leveraged trading. But what exactly is a crypto futures liquidation , and what does such a rapid and large-scale event signify for traders and the broader market? Understanding the Mechanism of Crypto Futures Liquidation To truly grasp the gravity of recent events, it’s essential to understand the mechanics behind crypto futures liquidation . Futures contracts in cryptocurrency trading allow investors to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. A key characteristic of futures trading is the use of leverage. Leverage: This allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital, known as margin. For example, 10x leverage means you can control $10,000 worth of Bitcoin with just $1,000 of your own money. While leverage can amplify profits, it also dramatically amplifies losses. Margin: The collateral you put up to open and maintain a leveraged position. It acts as a safety net for the exchange, ensuring you can cover potential losses. Liquidation Price: Every leveraged position has a specific price point at which, if the market moves against your trade sufficiently, your margin falls below the maintenance margin requirement. At this point, the exchange automatically closes your position to prevent further losses to your account and to protect itself from potential bad debt. This forced closure is what we call a crypto futures liquidation . When prices move sharply and unexpectedly, many leveraged positions can hit their liquidation prices simultaneously, leading to a cascade of forced selling. This often exacerbates price movements, creating a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘long squeeze’ (if prices fall rapidly) or ‘short squeeze’ (if prices rise rapidly). The Immediate Impact: What Caused the $110 Million Crypto Futures Liquidation? The recent $110 million crypto futures liquidation in just one hour highlights the extreme sensitivity of the market to sudden price swings. While the exact trigger for such an immediate and brutal flush can be multifaceted, it typically stems from a confluence of factors: Sudden Price Movement: A sharp, unexpected price drop (or rise) in a major cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum can quickly push numerous leveraged positions to their liquidation thresholds. This initial move might be triggered by a large sell order from a whale, negative news, or even a technical breakdown of a key support level. High Leverage: The prevalence of high leverage options (e.g., 50x, 100x) on many exchanges means that even small price movements can lead to significant losses for traders, making them highly vulnerable to liquidation. Market Depth and Liquidity: In moments of extreme volatility, market depth can thin out, meaning there aren’t enough buy or sell orders to absorb large trades without significant price impact. This can accelerate the liquidation process, as orders are filled at rapidly declining prices. The speed at which $110 million was wiped out underscores the ‘flash crash’ potential in highly leveraged markets, where algorithms and automated trading systems react instantly to market shifts, often triggering further liquidations and exacerbating the price movement. Beyond the Hour: The Broader Implications of $607 Million in Crypto Futures Liquidation While the hourly figure was striking, the broader context of $607 million in crypto futures liquidation over 24 hours paints a clearer picture of sustained market pressure. This larger figure indicates that the initial shockwave extended, affecting a wider range of traders and positions across various cryptocurrencies. Trader Sentiment: Such large-scale liquidations can significantly dampen market sentiment. Traders who have been liquidated often become more cautious, leading to reduced trading activity or a shift towards less risky strategies. This can create a period of fear and uncertainty in the market. Price Volatility: The forced selling from liquidations can create a downward spiral, pushing prices even lower as more positions are liquidated, creating a feedback loop. Conversely, a ‘short squeeze’ can drive prices higher, leading to liquidations of short positions. Market Health Indicator: While painful for individual traders, large liquidation events can sometimes be seen as a ‘cleansing’ of excessive leverage from the market. After a significant deleveraging, the market might be in a healthier position for more sustainable growth, as speculative froth is removed. Exchange Stability: Major exchanges are generally equipped to handle these events due to robust risk management systems. However, extreme volatility tests their infrastructure, ensuring proper risk management protocols are in place to prevent systemic issues. Understanding these broader implications is crucial for anyone participating in or observing the crypto market, as liquidation events are powerful indicators of market stress and the overall level of leverage in the system. Why Do Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations Keep Happening? The recurring nature of massive crypto futures liquidation events isn’t a coincidence; it’s a byproduct of the market’s structure and participant behavior. Several factors contribute to their frequency and scale: High Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently more volatile than traditional assets. This high volatility, combined with the widespread use of leverage, creates fertile ground for rapid liquidations. Even small news events or shifts in sentiment can trigger significant price swings. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets, crypto markets never close. This constant activity means price movements can occur at any time, catching traders off guard, especially those not actively monitoring their positions or those relying on sleep. Retail Dominance and Emotional Trading: A significant portion of crypto traders are retail investors who may be less experienced with risk management. Emotional trading driven by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) during rallies or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) during downturns can lead to overleveraging and poor decision-making. Cross-Market Correlation: Crypto markets can sometimes react to macro-economic news or movements in traditional financial markets (e.g., stock market downturns, interest rate changes), creating unexpected shocks that ripple through the crypto space. Whale Activity and Market Dynamics: Large holders (whales) can sometimes execute significant buy or sell orders that deliberately trigger liquidations. By pushing the price past key support or resistance levels, they can force the closure of numerous leveraged positions, often benefiting from the subsequent price movement. While not always manipulative, large institutional moves can have disproportionate impacts. Cascading Effects: Once an initial wave of liquidations begins, the forced selling (or buying) from these liquidations can further accelerate the price movement, pushing more positions into their liquidation zone. This creates a powerful feedback loop, leading to a ‘liquidation cascade’ that can dramatically amplify the initial price shock. This domino effect is why liquidations often appear to happen so rapidly and in such large volumes. These factors combine to create a dynamic environment where significant price swings are not just possible, but often probable, making effective risk management paramount for anyone involved in futures trading. Navigating the Storm: Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks For traders looking to participate in the futures market, understanding and mitigating the risks associated with crypto futures liquidation is paramount. Here are some actionable strategies to protect your capital: Manage Your Leverage Wisely: This is arguably the most critical advice. While high leverage can offer tempting returns, it dramatically increases your liquidation risk. Consider using lower leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading or during periods of high market uncertainty. A lower leverage ratio provides a wider buffer before liquidation. Implement Strict Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses and preventing liquidation. This is your primary defense mechanism against unexpected market moves. Always place a stop-loss when opening a leveraged position. Understand Margin Requirements: Always be aware of your initial margin (the capital required to open a position) and maintenance margin (the minimum equity needed to keep a position open). Ensure you have sufficient funds in your account to cover potential drawdowns. Consider adding more collateral (margin top-up) if your position is nearing liquidation, known as ‘margin call’. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into a single leveraged trade or a single asset. Diversifying across different assets or trading strategies can help spread risk and prevent a single liquidation event from wiping out your entire portfolio. Stay Informed and Monitor the Market: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and sentiment. Unexpected announcements, regulatory changes, or major economic data releases can trigger rapid price movements. Constant vigilance is key in the 24/7 crypto market. Practice Sound Risk Management: Define your risk tolerance before entering any trade. Only risk a small percentage of your total capital on any single trade (e.g., 1-2%). This helps ensure that even if a trade goes wrong, it doesn’t severely impact your overall trading capital. Consider Isolated vs. Cross Margin: Understand the difference between these margin modes. Isolated margin limits the risk to a specific position, meaning only the margin allocated to that position is at risk of liquidation. Cross margin uses your entire account balance as collateral, which can lead to larger losses if not managed carefully, but also provides more flexibility. Choose the mode that aligns with your risk strategy. Psychological Preparedness: Trading, especially leveraged trading, is as much about psychology as it is about strategy. Emotions like greed and fear can lead to impulsive decisions. Developing emotional discipline, sticking to your trading plan, and avoiding revenge trading after a loss are vital. Recognize that losses are part of trading, and focus on long-term consistency rather than short-term wins. Continuous Learning and Adaptation: The crypto market is constantly evolving. New protocols, regulatory changes, and technological advancements can all impact market dynamics. Successful traders continuously learn, adapt their strategies, and stay updated on market trends and risk management techniques. Analyzing past liquidation events, understanding their triggers, and learning from your own trading mistakes can provide invaluable insights for future trades. By adopting these disciplined approaches, traders can significantly reduce their exposure to the devastating effects of a sudden crypto futures liquidation and navigate the volatile crypto landscape with greater confidence. The recent event, where $110 million in crypto futures liquidation occurred in an hour, and over $607 million vanished in 24 hours, serves as a powerful reminder of the high stakes involved in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. While futures offer incredible opportunities for profit, they come with amplified risks, primarily the threat of liquidation. For both seasoned traders and newcomers, the key takeaway is clear: knowledge, discipline, and robust risk management are not just recommendations but absolute necessities. The crypto market will continue to be volatile, but by understanding its mechanisms and preparing for its inherent risks, traders can navigate its complexities with greater confidence and resilience. Stay informed, stay cautious, and trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a crypto futures liquidation? A crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin (collateral) falls below a certain level due to adverse price movements. This happens automatically to prevent the trader from incurring further losses and to protect the exchange. 2. Why do crypto liquidations happen so quickly? Liquidations occur rapidly due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, the widespread use of high leverage, and the automated nature of trading systems. A small, sudden price swing can trigger a cascade of liquidations as stop-loss levels are hit and margin calls are activated, leading to a domino effect. 3. How can traders avoid crypto futures liquidation? Traders can minimize liquidation risk by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, understanding and maintaining sufficient margin, diversifying their portfolio, and staying informed about market conditions. Emotional discipline and a robust risk management plan are also crucial. 4. What is the difference between isolated and cross margin? Isolated margin limits the risk of liquidation to a specific position, meaning only the margin allocated to that trade is at risk. Cross margin, on the other hand, uses your entire available account balance as collateral for all open positions, which can lead to larger losses but offers more flexibility in managing margin across trades. 5. Do large liquidations impact the overall crypto market? Yes, large-scale liquidations can significantly impact the overall crypto market. They often lead to increased price volatility, can dampen trader sentiment, and contribute to broader market downturns or sharp rebounds as excessive leverage is flushed out. While painful, they can sometimes ‘cleanse’ the market, potentially leading to healthier, more sustainable growth.

The dramatic policy flip comes as 72 crypto-related ETF applications await regulatory approval from providers including Grayscale, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Bloomberg Intelligence assigns 95% approval odds for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs this year, while existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue attracting billions in institutional inflows. Ethereum ETFs recorded $533.87 million in net inflows on July 22 , marking the third-largest single-day inflow since inception, while Bitcoin ETFs experienced $67.93 million in outflows. Regulatory Confusion Emerges as Multi-Asset Approval Process Stalls The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF approval represented a major expansion beyond existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products, with holdings weighted by market capitalization and monthly rebalancing. As of June 30, Bitcoin comprised 78.72% and Ethereum 11.10% of the proposed fund, with the remaining eight cryptocurrencies making up the rest. The SEC’s accelerated approval process typically applies to non-controversial rule changes that align with existing regulations. The Commission found Bitwise’s 85% allocation requirement for previously approved components to be sufficient to mitigate fraud and manipulation risks, consistent with prior 80% thresholds for similar products. NYSE Arca’s rule amendments would have allowed Trust Units issued by limited liability companies and explicitly permitted index-based investments. The changes included conforming corporate governance policies and eliminating shareholder meeting requirements, aligning with existing treatment of investment vehicles. The Division of Trading and Markets took the initial approval action under delegated authority before senior Commission officials intervened with the stay order. The reversal suggests disagreement within the SEC about multi-asset crypto product approvals despite technical rule compliance. Coinbase Custody Trust Company would have served as a digital asset custodian, while Bank of New York Mellon provided cash custody and administration services. The ETF structure included cash-based creation and redemption in 10,000-share units, with daily net asset value calculations using CF Benchmarks pricing data. Institutional Demand Surges Despite Regulatory Uncertainty Existing crypto ETFs continue to experience massive institutional adoption despite regulatory confusion. Ethereum ETFs have attracted $8.32 billion in cumulative inflows since their inception, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading Tuesday’s surge with $426.22 million. The fund now manages over $10 billion in assets, representing 2.24% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. Bitcoin ETFs hold a total of $154.77 billion in assets , despite recent outflows, accounting for approximately 6.5% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $7.51 million in inflows, while Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB experienced outflows exceeding $30 million each. The pending ETF pipeline includes applications for Dogecoin, MELANIA, TRUMP, and other meme tokens alongside serious institutional products. Most recently, 21Shares filed for an ONDO token ETF that tracks the native token of Ondo Finance, a layer-1 blockchain designed for institutional finance and the tokenization of real-world assets.

Why Are Entities Like World Liberty Financial Looking at ETH? Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is far more than just a digital currency. It’s a decentralized platform that underpins a vast ecosystem of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and enterprise blockchain solutions. This multifaceted utility is a primary draw for institutional investors like World Liberty Financial. Several factors contribute to Ethereum’s appeal: Technological Foundation: Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities allow for the creation of complex, self-executing agreements, enabling a wide array of decentralized applications. DeFi Dominance: The majority of decentralized finance protocols operate on the Ethereum blockchain, making it a critical infrastructure layer for the burgeoning DeFi sector. NFT Market Leader: Ethereum is the dominant blockchain for NFTs, a rapidly growing market for digital collectibles and art. Upcoming Upgrades: Continuous network upgrades, such as the transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) and subsequent enhancements like the Dencun upgrade, aim to improve scalability, security, and efficiency, making the network more robust for future growth. Inflation Hedge & Diversification: In an era of economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, digital assets like ETH are increasingly viewed as potential hedges against traditional currency devaluation and as a means of diversifying investment portfolios beyond conventional assets. The decision by World Liberty Financial to acquire more ETH suggests a belief in these fundamental strengths and the potential for significant returns as the Ethereum ecosystem continues to mature and expand. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The purchase of World Liberty Financial ETH is more than just a single transaction; it contributes to a broader narrative of institutional acceptance that is crucial for the crypto market’s long-term growth and stability. When high-profile entities, especially those with ties to political figures, make such investments, it can significantly influence public perception and investor confidence. Key impacts include: Validation for Ethereum: It serves as a strong vote of confidence for Ethereum as an investment asset, distinct from Bitcoin. It highlights ETH’s role as a core component of the future digital economy. Shifting Narratives: It helps to shift the narrative around cryptocurrencies from speculative, niche assets to legitimate, investable commodities for serious financial players. Potential for Further Inflows: Such high-profile moves can inspire other institutional and high-net-worth individuals who may have been on the fence to consider allocating capital to crypto. Political & Regulatory Implications: The involvement of politically connected entities in crypto could subtly influence future regulatory discussions, potentially leading to more favorable frameworks as policymakers become more familiar with the asset class. While the immediate price impact of a single purchase might be limited, the long-term psychological and signaling effects of World Liberty Financial ETH accumulation could be substantial, paving the way for greater mainstream adoption. The Transparency of On-Chain Data: A Game Changer? The fact that this acquisition by World Liberty Financial ETH was reported by Onchain Lens highlights the revolutionary transparency offered by blockchain technology. Unlike traditional financial markets where large institutional trades can often remain opaque or are only revealed much later through regulatory filings, blockchain transactions are publicly verifiable. On-chain analytics platforms continuously monitor blockchain activity, allowing for real-time tracking of significant movements. This level of transparency provides: Fairness: All market participants, regardless of their size, have access to the same fundamental data about transactions. Accountability: It creates an immutable record of transactions, enhancing accountability. Market Insights: It offers unparalleled insights into market trends, whale movements, and institutional interest, which can be invaluable for investors. The ability for platforms like Onchain Lens to identify and report on such specific transactions underscores the power of this open ledger system, contrasting sharply with the often-secretive world of traditional finance. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities for World Liberty Financial in Crypto? While the purchase of World Liberty Financial ETH signals confidence, investing in cryptocurrencies, even for seasoned financial entities, comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Volatility: Crypto markets are notoriously volatile, with significant price swings common. Managing this risk requires robust strategies and a long-term perspective. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in policy could impact valuations and operational frameworks. Security Risks: While blockchain itself is secure, managing digital assets requires sophisticated cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, a segment of the public and policymakers still views crypto with skepticism, which can create reputational risks. Opportunities: High Growth Potential: The cryptocurrency market is still relatively nascent compared to traditional assets, offering significant potential for capital appreciation. Diversification: Digital assets offer a low correlation to traditional asset classes, providing valuable diversification benefits to a portfolio. Innovation Exposure: Investing in ETH provides exposure to the cutting-edge innovation happening within Web3, DeFi, and other blockchain-based technologies. First-Mover Advantage: Entities entering the space early can position themselves to benefit from future market maturation and infrastructure development. World Liberty Financial’s continued engagement suggests they are weighing these factors and finding the opportunities compelling enough to increase their exposure to Ethereum. A Strategic Bet on the Digital Future The latest acquisition of 560.71 ETH by World Liberty Financial is a compelling indicator of growing institutional conviction in the digital asset space. It’s a move that transcends mere speculation, hinting at a strategic belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value and its integral role in the evolving digital economy. As more entities, especially those with high visibility and influence, publicly embrace cryptocurrencies, the bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world continues to strengthen. This ongoing institutional adoption, exemplified by World Liberty Financial ETH purchases, is a powerful signal that digital assets are becoming an undeniable part of the global financial landscape, setting the stage for what could be a transformative era for both investors and the broader economy.

Roughly 20% of the global adult population is unbanked, according to the World Bank; Bitcoin enables such people to make online payments, and manage their savings . It’s also incredibly efficient in terms of sending money abroad . A wire transfer will usually take three to five business days (if not more) to arrive, whereas a Bitcoin transaction will generally be sorted within 10 minutes to an hour (or a couple of seconds if you’re using the Lightning Network). This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here . Still, Bitcoin is now a 16-year-old piece of technology, and there are plenty of sleeker, more efficient blockchain projects out there. Yet, Draper says that anything new in crypto will eventually make its way back to Bitcoin. “There's this gravitational pull towards Bitcoin. All of the innovation from other tokens is now getting ported over Bitcoin. It’s like Microsoft with WordPerfect and Lotus 123,” Draper said, referring to how the computer company developed its own word processor (Microsoft Word) and spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel) by replicating technologies from other firms. “Smart contracts, DeFi, that's all moving over to Bitcoin. And bitcoin’s market share has gone from 40% in 2022 to 61% today ,” Draper said. “If you're a retailer, you put up a sign that says, ‘We take bitcoin.’ You're not going to say ‘We take gozo coin,’ or whatever.” The technology’s superiority is one of the reasons why the federal government’s prior hostility to crypto was so maddening, Draper said. How can you compete if you don’t make use of all of the innovations at the tip of your fingers? The U.S. probably lost 10 years of value in the whole ordeal, according to Draper, and while the new Trump administration is firmly pro-innovation, the country still needs to catch up. U.S. users are still geofenced by a lot of crypto projects; nor can they receive airdrops, or tokenize things with the same liberty as most people around the globe. “I met with the leaders of El Salvador and I got jealous,” Draper said. “ Everyone on the street knows how a smart contract works. They build DAOs. They have blockchain everything. It's crazy. El Salvador, which used to be one of the poorest places in the world, could end up being like Singapore.” Draper’s thesis, down the line, is that retailers ( already slowly adopting bitcoin in some parts of the world ) will someday refuse to accept payments in U.S. dollars. “I don't know how long it'll take to get there, maybe 10 years. But there will be a moment there where the dollar and other fiat currencies go extinct,” he said.",Opinion|Tim Draper|Bitcoin|El Salvador|Opinion,EN,0,0,BTC|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-23 17:58:21
48805386,https://timestabloid.com/?p=75314,1753293643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Latest Rumor: 70-90% Chance of Ripple (XRP) and SEC Settlement by This New Date,https://timestabloid.com/latest-rumor-70-90-chance-of-ripple-xrp-and-sec-settlement-by-this-new-date/,"A post by WF on X has sparked renewed enthusiasm in the XRP community, claiming there is a 70–90% probability that a settlement between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be finalized by August 15, 2025. However, beneath the surface, the case remains complex, procedural nuances dominate, and regulatory deadlines, not rumors, will determine the outcome. Why August 15 Is Significant but Not Decisive August 15 marks the deadline for both Ripple and the SEC to file a joint status report, a regular court requirement, not a settlement trigger. XRP enthusiasts interpret it as a sign that both parties are moving toward a final resolution. JUST IN: The latest rumor claims that there’s a 70–90% chance of a settlement between Ripple and the SEC by August 15 — WF (@WhaleFUD) July 23, 2025 Rather than judgment, August 15 may bring clarity on intent: if courts receive filings showing both parties have withdrawn their appeals, the case could move swiftly toward closure. However, the SEC’s internal process still needs to culminate in a commissioner’s vote before any official settlement is finalized. Legal Realities: Appeals, Withdrawals, and Bureaucratic Timing In a significant development, Ripple has announced its intention to withdraw its cross-appeal , and CEO Brad Garlinghouse has indicated that the SEC is expected to follow suit. This signals that both parties favor an end to litigation, potentially making the release of dismissal papers more likely following the August status update. Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel has clarified that any dismissal hinges on internal SEC steps, including preparing a formal enforcement recommendation followed by a vote from its five commissioners, a process that typically takes one to two months, and sometimes longer. Broader Consequences for XRP and Crypto A true settlement would close the chapter on a legal saga beginning in December 2020, in which Judge Analisa Torres previously ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges were not securities, while institutional sales were. This outcome would significantly reduce uncertainty around XRP’s regulatory classification and could pave the way for clearer rules across the crypto sector. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Conversely, delays, if either party fails to officially withdraw or the SEC commission stalls, risk extending the litigation into 2026, dampening investor sentiment. The Takeaway WF’s claim of a 70–90% settlement probability reflects true optimism in the XRP community, but remains speculation. August 15 brings procedural transparency, not confirmation. The fate of XRP now rests on formal court filings and the pace of SEC internal processes. As investors and observers await the joint status report, it’s wise to treat the rumor as hopeful, yet speculative, and to remain grounded until official filings confirm the next step. Watch for updates around mid‑August, but expect that true resolution may arrive only after internal regulatory procedures play out.

He also outlined factors that could drive the ETH rally to this target. Ethereum Price Eyes Rally To $5,500 In The Short Term In a TradingView post, Xanrox predicted that the Ethereum price could rally to $5,500 in the short term because banks and states are buying. He also claimed that ETH is part of the USA crypto reserve, which is bullish for the altcoin. Meanwhile, the analyst also alluded to the Ethereum ETFs, as another factor that could drive demand for ETH. Related Reading: Ethereum ATH Above $4,800? Here’s How High It Will Go If 2021 Repeats According to him, these institutional investors count ETH as the future of the crypto industry, which is a positive for the Ethereum price. These institutional investors have recently been warming up to ETH amid optimism that these funds could soon include a staking feature following the SEC’s approval. For the first time last week, these funds beat the Bitcoin ETFs in daily flows. Xanrox is also bullish on the Ethereum price from a technical analysis perspective. He noted that the altcoin is currently inside an ascending channel and breaking out with strong bullish momentum. The analyst also indicated that this was still a good time to buy ETH despite how much it has rallied this month, reaching a six-month high. He claimed that the Ethereum price is somewhere in the middle. As such, those who buy now can get to sell when ETH reaches $5,500. Xanrox added that the $5,500 level is likely where the altcoin will consolidate for a long time before going higher. Interestingly, his accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could even rally to as high as $113,000 at some point. A Demand Shock Is Coming For ETH In an X post, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan declared that a demand shock is coming for ETH, which is why he predicts that the Ethereum price will continue to rally. He noted that the altcoin is up over 50% in the past month and more than 150% since its lows in April, thanks to overwhelming demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries. Related Reading: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May’s Playbook Predicts Another Breakout Matt Hougan expects this demand to keep rising. He noted that ETF investors remain significantly underweight in terms of their ETH-to-BTC holdings ratio. The market expert further stated that although ETH’s market cap is about 19% the size of BTC, the Ethereum funds have amassed less than 12% of the assets that the Bitcoin ETFs hold. As such, he expects these investors to allocate more ETH, which is bullish for the Ethereum price. The Bitwise CIO predicted that Ethereum ETFs and treasury companies could purchase up to $20 billion of ETH in the next year, equivalent to 5.33 million ETH at today’s prices. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network is expected to produce around 800,000 ETH over the same period, resulting in demand that is seven times greater than supply. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,700, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

New data suggests that the distribution of Tether (USDT) supply between Tron and Ethereum networks appears to alongside Bitcoin’s price cycles. USDT Rivalry In its latest post, CryptoQuant revealed that Tron’s USDT supply was just a fraction of Ethereum’s, with a ratio of 0.3 in 2019. However, by 2022-2023, the ratio climbed above 1.0, as a result of Tron’s rise due to lower transaction fees. Interestingly, Tron first surpassed Ethereum’s USDT supply in 2021, which coincided with Bitcoin’s $64,000 peak. In the current cycle, the ratio has declined as Bitcoin crossed $100,000. CryptoQuant explained that this indicates investors lean towards Ethereum for its security during bull markets despite higher fees. Data also shows that while Ethereum initially led USDT supply growth, Tron’s supply surged to $60 billion and exceeded $80 billion in 2025, demonstrating massive adoption. These supply peaks align with Bitcoin highs, which means that USDT expansion often mirrors broader market optimism. Ethereum remains a stable anchor during periods of volatility and benefits from its established DeFi infrastructure. The USDT supply delta further revealed a notable change. Until 2021, the delta was negative and favored Ethereum. However, it flipped positive in 2022-2023, signaling Tron’s leadership with an edge of $3-8 billion. In 2025, the delta briefly turned negative, indicating Ethereum’s resurgence, but has since swung back, with Tron now holding $3.9 billion more USDT than Ethereum. USDT Transfers Tron’s growing dominance extends to USDT transactions as well. On June 29, the network handled $6.94 million in USDT transfers, which is more than five times Ethereum’s $1.31 million on the same day. This surge was indicative of its appeal in emerging markets facing hyperinflation and currency instability, where TRC-20 USDT functions as a practical alternative banking system accessible via mobile devices in countries like Venezuela, Turkey, Nigeria, and Argentina. In addition, major crypto exchanges now default to TRC-20 for USDT deposits and withdrawals. Beyond transactional dominance, Tron is reportedly exploring a public listing through a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, although rumors of Eric Trump’s involvement have been denied. Tron’s momentum in handling daily USDT flows underscores its expanding role in the stablecoin ecosystem, reflecting practical utility in global transactions as stablecoins continue to mirror broader crypto market cycles.

In a new newsletter, Pantera general partner Franklin Bi says “the rise of tokenized assets today mirrors the early days of ETFs (exchange-traded funds).” Says the investor, “When the first U.S. equity ETF (SPY) launched in 1993, it crossed $1 billion in AUM (assets under management) within a year. But the real inflection point wasn’t its size. It was when ETF volumes began consistently matching and eventually exceeding mutual fund flows. That’s when market structure changed and investor behavior soon followed. We believe tokenization will hit a similar moment in broad market structure transformation and issuer and investor behavior.” Bi says that when any one of four things happens, the tipping point for tokenization will have arrived. Those things include daily on-chain equity volume exceeding $1 billion, tokenized equity AUM crossing $100 billion, a top public company seeing more liquidity on-chain than its home exchange, and a global IPO listing bypassing New York entirely and issuing shares on-chain directly. “When it happens, it will feel obvious in hindsight as tokenization’s ‘ETF moment.’ Today’s early adopters are focused on applying a better set of rails, but the biggest story is the structural shift in the future of capital markets. Once the migration is complete, blockchains will be recognized as the default destination for capital formation, price discovery, and value transfer.

Investors are rotating to ETH and Altcoins. pic.twitter.com/X7mBFVCg5Y — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 23, 2025 Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin by 72% since April, with its ETH/BTC ratio climbing from 0.018 to 0.031—the highest point since January 24, reports CryptoQuant. This upward trend aligns with earlier analyses showing Ethereum’s undervaluation relative to Bitcoin and growing demand for ETH-based assets. The reduced selling pressure on Ethereum, alongside greater accumulation by institutional and retail investors, is fueling this momentum. Data from CryptoQuant shows that fewer ETH tokens are being transferred to exchanges compared to Bitcoin, pointing to confidence in Ethereum’s price stability and future potential. Spot Volume and ETF Trends Reflect Investor Rotation Trading volumes show a change in market sentiment. For the first time since June 2024, Ethereum’s weekly spot volume surpassed Bitcoin’s, with ETH reaching $25.7 billion versus Bitcoin’s $24.4 billion.

Additionally, ETF data reinforce this pattern. The ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio has more than doubled, moving from 0.05 to 0.12, indicating that funds are allocating more capital to Ethereum than to Bitcoin. Altcoin Market Sees Renewed Momentum It’s not just Ethereum that’s benefiting. The broader altcoin market is showing renewed strength, with spot trading volume reaching $67 billion on July 17—the highest level since March. This surge suggests that investor interest is broadening beyond the two dominant cryptocurrencies, reports CryptoQuant. Traders appear to be diversifying their portfolios, taking positions in assets they perceive as undervalued or primed for growth during the next leg of the crypto market cycle. The combined factors of Ethereum’s price surge, reduced exchange inflows, and growing ETF demand indicate a market shift that may continue to favor altcoins in the near term.

In a development that has captured the attention of the entire world, the much-anticipated Russia-Ukraine talks have officially commenced. This pivotal moment, reported by the Russian state outlet TASS and shared widely by Walter Bloomberg on X, marks a significant diplomatic overture in a conflict that has profoundly impacted global stability and economies. For those navigating the often-volatile cryptocurrency markets, news of these Russia-Ukraine talks carries immense weight, influencing sentiment and price action across digital assets. The initiation of these discussions, however preliminary, offers a glimmer of hope amidst ongoing tensions, prompting observers to consider the potential ramifications for both the geopolitical landscape and financial markets. What Do These Russia-Ukraine Talks Entail? The commencement of the Russia-Ukraine talks signals a critical juncture in the ongoing conflict. While initial details remain sparse, the very act of sitting down at the negotiation table represents a shift from outright confrontation to a potential pathway for dialogue. According to the initial reports, representatives from both nations have gathered to discuss possible resolutions, though the specific agenda and participants are often kept under wraps to facilitate sensitive discussions. Key Participants: While not always publicly disclosed in full, these talks typically involve high-level diplomatic and political figures authorized to represent their respective governments’ interests. Stated Objectives: Both sides usually enter such discussions with a set of demands or desired outcomes. For Ukraine, this often centers on sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security guarantees. For Russia, concerns may revolve around security architecture, neutrality, or specific regional issues. Location and Format: The choice of location for Russia-Ukraine talks is often strategic, aiming for a neutral ground that can foster an environment conducive to negotiation. The format can vary from direct bilateral meetings to sessions involving mediators or international organizations. The mere existence of these Russia-Ukraine talks , regardless of immediate breakthroughs, provides a mechanism for communication that has been desperately sought by the international community. It is a testament to the persistent efforts behind the scenes to find a diplomatic off-ramp from a conflict with dire humanitarian and economic consequences. Why Are These Russia-Ukraine Talks So Crucial Now? The timing of these Russia-Ukraine talks is not coincidental. The conflict has reached a stage where both sides face significant challenges, and the global repercussions are increasingly difficult to manage. From a humanitarian perspective, the toll in lives lost, displaced populations, and damaged infrastructure is immense. Economically, the conflict has triggered inflation, disrupted supply chains, and fueled an energy crisis that reverberates across continents. This confluence of factors makes the current Russia-Ukraine talks exceptionally crucial. Consider the following critical aspects: Aspect Impact on Urgency for Talks Humanitarian Crisis Ongoing civilian casualties, mass displacement, and destruction of vital infrastructure create immense pressure to halt hostilities. Economic Strain Global energy price spikes, food security concerns, and supply chain disruptions are impacting economies worldwide, urging a resolution. Geopolitical Stability The conflict has heightened tensions among major global powers, increasing the risk of wider escalation and demanding diplomatic engagement. Domestic Pressures Both nations likely face internal pressures related to the conflict’s costs and duration, pushing for a path forward. The current environment underscores a shared, albeit perhaps reluctant, understanding that a military solution alone may be unsustainable or too costly. Therefore, the initiation of these Russia-Ukraine talks represents a pragmatic acknowledgment of the need for dialogue to de-escalate and potentially resolve the conflict. What Are the Key Obstacles to Successful Russia-Ukraine Talks? While the start of Russia-Ukraine talks is a positive step, the path to a meaningful resolution is fraught with significant obstacles. The deep-seated distrust, conflicting objectives, and the complexity of the issues at hand make any negotiation inherently challenging. Both nations hold firm on certain positions, and bridging these gaps requires immense diplomatic skill and a willingness to compromise. Some of the primary hurdles include: Territorial Disputes: The most contentious issue remains the status of disputed territories, with both sides holding strong claims. Finding a mutually acceptable solution here is paramount and incredibly difficult. Security Guarantees: Ukraine seeks robust security guarantees from international partners, while Russia has its own security concerns regarding NATO expansion and military infrastructure near its borders. Neutrality Status: The question of Ukraine’s future geopolitical alignment, particularly its potential neutrality, is a key point of contention. Accountability and Reparations: Issues of war crimes, accountability for damages, and potential reparations are highly sensitive and complex to address in any peace agreement. International Sanctions: The web of international sanctions imposed on Russia complicates negotiations, as their removal or modification would be a significant demand. Overcoming these challenges will require not only flexibility from both negotiating teams but also sustained international support and potentially mediation efforts. The success of the Russia-Ukraine talks hinges on the ability of all parties to navigate these profound complexities. How Might Russia-Ukraine Talks Impact Global Markets and Crypto? The mere announcement of Russia-Ukraine talks can send ripples through global financial markets, and the cryptocurrency space is no exception. Geopolitical events of this magnitude often trigger immediate reactions, ranging from heightened volatility to shifts in investor sentiment towards perceived safe-haven assets. Here’s how these talks might influence various sectors: Traditional Markets: News of progress in Russia-Ukraine talks can lead to a rally in equities and a decrease in commodity prices, particularly oil and gas, as supply fears ease. Conversely, setbacks could cause a downturn and renewed inflationary pressures. Cryptocurrency Market: Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies have shown mixed reactions to geopolitical tensions. Sometimes, they act as a digital safe haven, seeing inflows during times of uncertainty. At other times, they behave like risk assets, declining alongside traditional stocks. The outcome of these Russia-Ukraine talks could dictate whether crypto sees a surge from renewed optimism or a dip from continued global instability. Energy Prices: A significant breakthrough could lead to a more stable energy market, reducing inflationary pressures globally. Conversely, a breakdown in talks might see prices soar again. Supply Chains: Resolution could ease disruptions, particularly in agricultural exports and manufacturing inputs, benefiting global trade. Investors and traders in the crypto space should remain vigilant, understanding that the market’s reaction to Russia-Ukraine talks will be dynamic and highly sensitive to the perceived success or failure of diplomatic efforts. The resilience of digital assets will be tested by the ongoing geopolitical shifts. Looking Ahead: The Road from Russia-Ukraine Talks The commencement of Russia-Ukraine talks is undoubtedly a significant development, yet it is crucial to temper expectations. History has shown that peace negotiations, especially in conflicts of this scale and complexity, are rarely straightforward or swift. The road ahead will likely be long, arduous, and punctuated by periods of both hope and frustration. Possible scenarios emerging from these Russia-Ukraine talks include: A Diplomatic Breakthrough: This is the most optimistic scenario, leading to a ceasefire, a framework for a peace agreement, and a de-escalation of tensions. While challenging, it remains the ultimate goal. Protracted Negotiations: The talks could evolve into a lengthy process, with intermittent meetings, periods of stalemate, and ongoing low-level conflict. This would keep markets on edge but prevent further major escalation. Breakdown of Talks: Unfortunately, there’s always the risk that negotiations could collapse due to irreconcilable differences, leading to a renewed intensification of hostilities. The international community will play a vital role in supporting these Russia-Ukraine talks , providing mediation, humanitarian aid, and maintaining diplomatic pressure. The world watches with bated breath, hoping that these discussions will indeed pave the way for a just and lasting peace, transforming the current dire situation into one of stability and recovery. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope in Complex Russia-Ukraine Talks The initiation of Russia-Ukraine talks , as reported by TASS via Walter Bloomberg, represents a profoundly significant moment in a conflict that has reshaped global dynamics. While the path to peace is undeniably challenging, fraught with historical grievances and conflicting demands, the very act of engaging in dialogue offers a crucial glimmer of hope. For global markets, including the resilient cryptocurrency ecosystem, these talks introduce a new layer of complexity and potential volatility, with outcomes that could profoundly influence economic trajectories. As the world observes these delicate negotiations, the collective hope is that diplomacy will ultimately prevail, leading to a resolution that benefits not only the immediate parties but also contributes to greater international stability and human well-being. The transformative power of dialogue, even in the most difficult circumstances, is now being put to the ultimate test.

The figures point to rising interest in ether from investors. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the way with $426.2 million worth of inflows. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust added $72.6 million, while Fidelity’s ether ETF brought in $35 million. The total ranks just behind the value of $726.7 million from the previous Wednesday and the $602 million seen last Thursday. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, pointed to a drop in bitcoin dominance and steady macro conditions for support of ether’s gains. “ETH’s momentum looks set to sustain in the mid‑term as long as these factors hold,” Liu said. Nick Ruck, from LVRG Research, noted that institutions appear to be turning bullish on Ethereum. He said the record‑high inflows into spot ether ETFs offer “a second opportunity for investors who missed out on Bitcoin’s historic rise,” as part of their reserve strategies for digital assets. Companies are starting to add ether to their balance sheets under new treasury plans. For instance, SharpLink Gaming has already shifted the focus to building up its ether holdings after outlining its Eth treasury strategy earlier in May. By contrast, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw net outflows of $67.9 million on Tuesday. The previous day, investors had pulled $131.3 million from these funds, indicating a shift away from bitcoin. “We’re seeing a familiar rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum,” – Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto. “Bitcoin has rallied significantly this year, and for investors who feel they’ve ‘missed’ the BTC trade or are looking for the next opportunity, Ethereum is becoming the natural next step.” Ethereum’s recent rally comes from a surge in structural demand In a July 22 memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan described what he called a “demand shock” for ether. He wrote that since May 15, ETFs and corporate treasuries have bought approximately 2.83 million ETH, worth about $10 billion. That is about 32x the number of ETH minted by the network over the same period. Hougan said that over the past month alone, ether has jumped over 65%, and since April, the price has climbed over 160%. He argued that this rise is driven by the imbalance between fresh demand and new supply, rather than changing market sentiment. Since US spot BTC ETFs began trading at the start of last year, funds on Wall Street, public companies including Trump Media and Strategy, and some governments have added over 1.5 million Bitcoins to their reserves, compared with only 300,000 newly minted coins. This roughly 5 to 1 demand advantage helped push bitcoin’s price up about 155%, making it the highest performer in this time. “Five times more demand than supply. Sometimes it really is that simple,” Hougan wrote. Ethereum’s early rally run did not see strong demand In the first ten months after spot ETH ETFs launched in the mid of 2024, these funds bought just 660k coins with roughly $2.5 billion in net new money, while public companies added only small amounts, and the network issued about 543,000 ETH. As a result, ether trailed behind bitcoin’s performance over that stretch. Then, spot ETH products ramped up their purchases in mid-May. They have since bought over $5 billion worth of ether, while companies such as SharpLink Gaming, Bit Digital, BitMine Immersion, and The Ether Machine, revealed large‑scale treasury plans. These companies purchased around 2.83 million Ethereum, a move that likely helped the token break above $3,800. Looking ahead, Hougan forecasted that ETFs along with corporate treasuries may purchase $20 billion worth of Ethereum over 2025. That would be around 5.33 million tokens. At the same time, the network would only issue around 800,000 Ethereum in this time frame. He mentioned that investors remain underexposed to Ethereum in comparison with bitcoin but also expects that to change as stablecoin and tokenization trends grow. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand, and right now, there is more demand for ETH than supply,” Hougan wrote. “As a result, I think we’re heading higher.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Related Reading: Too Pricey? Expert Says XRP Beats Bitcoin And Ethereum Right Now The surge came after a 5% increase over the last 24 hours and a 13% gain in the last week, taking BNB’s market capitalization to over $110 billion. Currently, it ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Spike In Volume And Derivatives Trading Volume trading around BNB has increased strongly. According to Coinglass data, daily volume rose over 40% to over $3 billion. Derivatives volume surged 31% to $2.18 billion, while open interest in BNB futures increased 19% to $1.23 billion. These represent an expanding tide of speculation and demand for the asset, perhaps fueled by fresh money flowing into the market. A good deal of this movement seems to be riding on bullish momentum forming around BNB’s recent price action. The token has been in an uptrend for weeks now, and this breakout above its previous highs indicates buyers are remaining bullish, even as there are indications that the market is heating up. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is also well into overbought conditions at 87.50. When the RSI crosses above 70, it generally means that a pullback may be imminent. Nevertheless, the uptrend is still in place. BNB is well above its 20-day simple moving average of $704. Price is higher with good volume, and this is a combination that is commonly used to confirm trend strength. Nano Labs Buys $90 Million Worth Of BNB Institutional buying could be propelling the rally. On July 22, China-founded Web3 infrastructure company Nano Labs Ltd announced it had added 120,000 BNB tokens to its holdings—worth around $90 million. According to the company, it bought over-the-counter at an average cost of $707 per BNB. Nano Labs stated that it views BNB as a strategic reserve asset and will continue to add to its holdings. It also stated that it will invest in companies that are dedicated to the BNB ecosystem. Such a long-term commitment brings an element of confidence for retail investors tracking the token’s movements closely. All the hype aside, there are beginning to appear some warning signs. BNB is now trading above the top Bollinger Band, an indication that the token may be getting stretched.

With this strategic move, the company aims to use XRP for long-term reserves, staking returns, and participation in the Ripple ecosystem. Nature's Miracle will make these XRP purchases using the proceeds from an equity financing provided through GHS Investments under an S-1 registration statement approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The XRP investments will also support the company's working capital needs. With this move, Nature's Miracle became one of the first public companies to place XRP at the center of its treasury. XRP currently ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related News: Huge Ethereum (ETH) Withdrawals Are Taking Place - CEO Reveals the Identity of the Whale Behind Them According to the company's statement, XRP purchases will initially be funded by proceeds from stock sales under the S-1 filing. New stock issuances, strategic placements, and structured finance instruments may also be considered to increase XRP adoption in the future. James Li, CEO of Nature's Miracle, said, “Following the GENIUS Act, signed by President Trump on July 18, 2025, many institutions have begun to adopt cryptocurrencies as their primary treasury asset. XRP's increased speed and reduced costs in cross-border payments make it a powerful tool. Major financial institutions like Banco Santander and American Express are already working with XRP. We believe this strategy will be beneficial for our shareholders and our company.” *This is not investment advice.

48809359,https://cryptonews.com/?p=386213,1753299240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48809359.jpeg,Shiba Inu Price Prediction: 22% Rally and 2 Bullish Signals – New All-Time High Next?,https://cryptonews.com/news/shiba-inu-price-prediction-22-rally-and-2-bullish-signals-new-all-time-high-next/,"The Shiba Inu price has dipped today, mirroring the modest pullback seen across most major tokens over the past 24 hours. Despite the drop, SHIB remains up 6.5% on the week and 22% over the past two weeks, though it’s still down 15% over the last year. While that yearly loss may disappoint some holders, SHIB’s chart is flashing two strong bullish signals, suggesting a fresh rally could be just around the corner. And when we combine such signals with the coin’s increasingly strong fundamentals, the long-term Shiba price prediction begins to look very good indeed. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: 22% Rally and 2 Bullish Signals – New All-Time High Next? If we look at SHIB’s one-day chart, the most obvious and important feature is that its price has broken out of the narrow descending channel active since mid-May. This is the clearest sign available that the coin is in the middle of a growth phase, yet there are others. Source: TradingView Also telling is the position of its MACD (orange, blue) which has been rising for the past week or so, but which is far from hitting the heights it attained in late November and early December. In other words, this means that Shiba Inu’s recent rally still has several weeks left to run, before the token enters a decidedly overbought position. Also supporting this claim is SHIB’s relative strength index (yellow). Despite having dipped in the past couple of days, it had been in oversold positions for most the six months to July. As such, we can expect it to remain above 50 (or higher) for a while yet, with the Shiba Inu price rising in parallel. There are also fundamental reasons to believe that SHIB will continue to do well over the coming weeks and months, with the coin’s ecosystem continuing to grow. Its layer-two network, Shibarium, is currently processing over 4.5 million transactions per day , indicating how popular it and the Shiba Inu ecosystem have become in recent months. There is no other crypto platform with a such strong social design as ShibOs. Bullruns are fun, but world-changing apps are even better, and you can do it better on Shibarium, which has all you need to create the next crypto ‘killer app’ pic.twitter.com/SLNXOhdTGT — SHIB INFORMER (@ShibInformer) July 11, 2025 There’s also the ongoing development of ShibOS, Shiba Inu’s decentralized operating system, which will see the rollout of various layers in the medium- and long-term. This will give Shiba Inu much more utility over the longer term, pushing up the coin’s price over time. Assuming an increasingly bullish market, as well as the reliability of the above indicators, we could therefore see the Shiba Inu price hit $0.000020 by the end of August. New Meme Coin TOKEN6900 Raises $1 Million: Could It Flip SHIB? It’s possible that the market will remain unconvinced by Shiba Inu, given that its price has actually declined in the past year, despite upgrades and launches. If so, traders may already prefer to look to newer meme tokens, with the market certainly not short of interesting candidates. Probably one of the best of these is TOKEN6900 ($T6900), an ERC-20 coin that has now raised just over $1 million in its ongoing presale. ok pidge pic.twitter.com/aGLu91ssjX — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 22, 2025 Unlike Shiba Inu, which is trying very hard to give itself utility and strong fundamentals, TOKEN6900 has raised this sum on the back of a simple promise: to be nothing more than a meme coin. TOKEN6900 proudly declares on its website that its value is “not built on fundamentals,” but rather on “delusion, irony, and the collective hallucination of the terminally online trader.” It’s therefore aiming to use hype, viral marketing and its growing community to pump its price over time, with the growth of its presale suggesting that this strategy may prove successful. With a max supply of 930,993,091 T6900, the coin has taken its memes from the dot-com bubble of the late 90s, with its website full of retro graphics. Holders of the coin will be able to stake it for passive income, but otherwise it will have no fundamental value or utility, something which could make it much more volatile. Investors can grab TOKEN6900 early at the official $T6900 website , with tokens still going for just $0.006675. The price will increase later today and continue climbing until the sale ends, so newcomers should act fast.

The rally may have been driven by two factors: an influx of institutional capital into ETF products and the recent passage of cryptocurrency regulatory bills in the US House of Representatives. BNB has overtaken Solana in market capitalization and now holds fifth place in the CoinGecko rankings. Amid the surge, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao hinted at the possible start of a “FOMO season.” He noted that the Altcoin Season Index from CoinMarketCap was rising, although he emphasized that he was unsure about the index’s accuracy. At the time of writing, the Altcoin Season Index stands at 44, down from 48 on July 22. Since reaching its peak, BNB’s price has corrected; at the time of writing, the coin is trading at $792 (a 4% increase over the day), according to CoinGecko. It is worth noting that BNB Chain developers have announced plans to “create a new generation blockchain” and increase the network’s performance by ten times. Recent trading data also shows that BNB’s trading volume surged significantly during the rally, reflecting increased demand and interest from both retail and institutional investors. The competition between BNB and Solana has intensified as both networks continue to launch new upgrades and attract more decentralized applications, contributing to their prominence in the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, technological advancements in BNB Chain aim to enhance scalability and interoperability, potentially outpacing Solana's network in future performance and ecosystem growth, solidifying BNB’s competitive advantage in decentralized finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-23 19:40:30

The upcoming draft is expected to complement a separate bill released by the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, which focuses on the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in overseeing digital securities. The two committees are moving on a dual-track basis, hoping to eventually meld their efforts in one all-encompassing, organized framework for regulating the digital asset space. The two draft bills are expected to merge into a comprehensive market structure bill. According to Journalist Eleanor Terrett, the Agriculture Committee is working toward a bipartisan proposal, with input from key members, including Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. The move follows the White House’s earlier push for crypto legislation through the GENIUS Act, urging Congress to deliver a cohesive regulatory framework by September. The administration is seeking to close gaps in oversight and provide clarity for the growing digital asset market. CFTC guidance will define regulatory boundaries The Agriculture Committee’s draft guidance will elucidate the CFTC’s de jure powers over digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, the CFTC oversees commodities and futures markets, where the SEC regulates securities. This division has long caused bewilderment in crypto regulation, when many digital assets don’t fit neatly into existing categories. The new draft is anticipated to articulate which categories of digital assets fall within the CFTC’s purview, and which may still belong to the SEC. It will also detail protocols for how the two agencies work together to prevent overlapping and ensure consistency in enforcement. Already proposed in the Banking Committee’s market structure bill , these provisions require joint rulemaking by the SEC and CFTC. The bill also says that decisions on registration requests from crypto-related entities are to be taken within 270 days. They will likely be in the Agriculture Committee draft or a mirror of the provisions. The hope is to design a dual-agency regulatory model in which both regulators work together, but with clear lines of responsibility. It seeks to create a means for further innovation while protecting investors and the market’s integrity. Lawmakers aim to combine drafts into unified crypto framework The two Senate committees are preparing the ground for what may be the most sweeping federal crypto legislation yet. After both drafts are made public, lawmakers will work to integrate their plans into one bill on market structure. In the meantime, the Senate Banking Committee has opened a comment request period on whether its draft properly strikes the balance between the CFTC and SEC in regulating the crypto industry. This reflects an increasing interest in stakeholder feedback, notably from industry professionals, investors, and advocacy groups. Bipartisan momentum in Congress and increasing pressure from the executive branch have left September looking like a make-or-break month for crypto regulation in the US. The next few weeks will determine if lawmakers can bridge political and ideological differences and move toward creating a framework that allows market hygiene and innovation.

Auyeung. “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Miller. “Federal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.” Crypto Fraudster Faces Up to 200 Years Behind Bars Indicted in August 2024, Auyeung and his unnamed co-conspirators allegedly convinced unwitting victims to move their funds into escrow accounts based in Europe and Texas in order to generate “significant profits” from renting out oil tanks there. Once victims sent their money, the crypto fraudsters stopped responding and shuffled the funds to crypto accounts in Russia and Nigeria—one of which had ties to a terrorist organization. “The money was quickly moved to one or more of at least 81 different accounts at financial institutions, moved offshore, or moved to one or more of at least 19 different cryptocurrency accounts, where it was used for the purchase of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Tether, USD Coin, and Ethereum,” the press release states. Auyeung faces a maximum of 200 years behind bars if convicted for the international crypto fraud , though sentencing varies per jurisdiction.

The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with anticipation, and few topics generate as much discussion as the potential shifts in global monetary policy. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, the whispers of impending interest rate cuts from major economies, particularly the United States, carry significant weight. Why? Because these decisions by central banks can ripple through financial markets, influencing everything from bond yields to the volatile yet exciting realm of digital assets. Understanding these macroeconomic currents is not just for economists; it is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the often-unpredictable tides of the crypto market. What Did U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Say About Interest Rate Cuts? Recently, the financial world turned its attention to a significant statement from a prominent figure: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. According to the widely followed Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X (formerly Twitter), Bessent indicated that the U.S. could realistically anticipate ‘one or two rate cuts’ this year. This declaration, coming from such a high-ranking economic official, is far more than a casual remark; it is a powerful signal that warrants close examination by anyone invested in or considering the crypto market. Secretary Bessent’s insights are particularly relevant because he sits at the heart of U.S. economic policy. His perspective offers a glimpse into the administration’s thinking and expectations regarding the nation’s financial trajectory. When a Treasury Secretary speaks about interest rate cuts , it suggests that the underlying economic conditions—such as inflation trends, employment data, and overall economic growth—are being carefully evaluated, potentially paving the way for a shift in the Federal Reserve’s monetary stance. While the Federal Reserve operates independently, high-level government officials often have access to comprehensive economic data and forecasts that inform their public statements, making Bessent’s comments a key piece of the puzzle for market watchers. Why Do Interest Rate Cuts Matter for the Crypto Market? Understanding the intricate dance between traditional monetary policy and the decentralized world of cryptocurrency is crucial for any investor. Historically, there is an inverse relationship often observed: when interest rate cuts are on the horizon or enacted, riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, tend to become more attractive. But what exactly drives this dynamic? Let’s break down the core mechanisms: Lower Borrowing Costs: When central banks reduce interest rates, the cost of borrowing money for businesses and consumers decreases. This encourages spending and investment, as capital becomes cheaper to acquire. More money flowing through the economy often finds its way into various asset classes, including those perceived as having higher growth potential. Increased Liquidity: Reduced interest rates typically lead to an expansion of the money supply and increased liquidity in the financial system. This abundance of capital seeks returns, and with lower yields on traditional ‘safe’ investments like savings accounts or government bonds, investors are often pushed towards assets that promise higher growth, even if they come with greater risk. Reduced Opportunity Cost: The opportunity cost of holding riskier assets like cryptocurrencies decreases when interest rates are low. If you can earn minimal returns from a bank savings account or a low-yield bond, the allure of potentially significant gains from crypto becomes stronger, making the trade-off more appealing for investors seeking better returns. Valuation of Growth Assets: Many crypto projects, particularly those focused on innovation and future technologies, are considered ‘growth assets.’ In a lower interest rate environment, the present value of future earnings or potential growth for these assets tends to increase. This is because the discount rate used to value future cash flows or potential market share is lower, making their long-term prospects appear more valuable today. These factors collectively create an environment where the perceived risk-reward balance shifts in favor of growth-oriented and volatile assets, making the prospect of interest rate cuts a generally bullish signal for the cryptocurrency market. Navigating the Economic Landscape: What are the Broader Implications of Rate Cuts? While the direct impact on crypto is a major focus for our community, it is vital to zoom out and consider the broader economic implications of interest rate cuts . These decisions are not made in a vacuum; they reflect central banks’ assessment of economic health and their strategies to achieve stability and growth. A rate cut typically signals a desire to stimulate economic activity, combat potential slowdowns, or manage disinflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, operates with a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (i.e., control inflation). When inflation appears to be under control and/or employment figures show signs of softening, the Fed might consider cutting rates to prevent an economic downturn. Such a move can: Boost Consumer Spending: Lower interest rates on loans (mortgages, credit cards) can encourage consumers to spend more, stimulating demand. Encourage Business Investment: Companies find it cheaper to borrow for expansion, research, and development, leading to job creation and economic growth. Impact Traditional Markets: Stock markets often react positively to rate cut expectations as they imply lower borrowing costs for companies and potentially higher corporate profits. Bond yields, conversely, tend to fall. However, the timing and magnitude of these cuts are heavily dependent on incoming economic data. The Fed constantly monitors inflation rates, employment reports, GDP growth, and global economic conditions to make its decisions. The market’s anticipation of these moves can sometimes be as impactful as the actual decisions themselves, leading to periods of heightened volatility as investors adjust their positions. Aspect Potential Impact Explanation Liquidity Increases Lower interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, leading to more capital flowing into the broader financial system, including risk assets like crypto. Investor Appetite for Risk Boosts With lower returns on safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts), investors may seek higher yields in more volatile assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Opportunity Cost of Holding Crypto Decreases The relative attractiveness of holding cash or low-yield assets diminishes, making the potential returns from crypto more appealing. Valuation of Growth Assets Positive Many crypto projects are seen as long-duration growth assets. Lower discount rates (due to lower interest rates) can increase their present value. Historical Precedents: How Have Crypto Markets Reacted to Past Rate Cycles? Looking back can often provide valuable insights into what might lie ahead. While the crypto market is relatively young compared to traditional asset classes, we have seen it react to various phases of monetary policy. During periods of aggressive rate hikes, such as those witnessed in 2022, risk assets, including crypto, generally faced significant headwinds. The tightening of monetary policy, aimed at curbing inflation, made borrowing more expensive and reduced overall market liquidity, leading to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment among investors. Conversely, periods of monetary easing or anticipated interest rate cuts have often coincided with renewed investor confidence and upward price momentum. For instance, the bull run seen in late 2020 and 2021 occurred amidst an environment of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing, where central banks were actively injecting liquidity into the financial system. This created a fertile ground for risk assets to flourish, and cryptocurrencies benefited significantly from the surge in liquidity and investor appetite for higher returns. It is important to remember, however, that correlation is not causation. While macroeconomic factors like interest rate cuts play a significant role, the crypto market is also influenced by its unique internal dynamics, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and specific project news. Therefore, while historical trends offer a useful framework, they should not be seen as a definitive predictor of future performance. What Are the Potential Challenges and Headwinds to Rate Cuts? While the prospect of interest rate cuts often brings optimism, it is crucial for any discerning investor to consider the potential challenges and headwinds. The path to monetary easing is rarely smooth, and unforeseen factors can always alter the trajectory or diminish the positive impact on risk assets. Inflation Persistence: If inflation proves to be more stubborn than anticipated, or if new inflationary pressures emerge (e.g., from supply chain disruptions or geopolitical events), central banks might delay or reduce the number of planned rate cuts. This could lead to market disappointment and a reassessment of risk assets. Economic Slowdown: Sometimes, interest rate cuts are enacted because the economy is weakening significantly. While cuts aim to stimulate growth, a severe economic downturn could still lead to overall market caution and a ‘flight to safety,’ even in a lower-rate environment. Investors might prioritize capital preservation over speculative gains. Geopolitical Instability: Major global events, such as conflicts or political crises, can overshadow economic policy decisions. Such events can trigger market volatility, disrupt supply chains, and create uncertainty that makes investors hesitant to embrace risk, regardless of interest rate movements. Regulatory Scrutiny in Crypto: The crypto market faces ongoing regulatory developments across the globe. New regulations, enforcement actions, or shifts in government stance could introduce significant headwinds that are independent of macroeconomic policy, affecting market sentiment and adoption. Unexpected Data: The Federal Reserve’s decisions are data-dependent. Any unexpected shifts in key economic indicators—like a sudden surge in unemployment or an unexpected rise in core inflation—could prompt the Fed to adjust its plans for rate cuts, leading to market re-pricing. These factors highlight the complexity of forecasting market movements based solely on monetary policy. A holistic view, incorporating a range of economic, political, and industry-specific considerations, is essential. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto Investor Given the evolving economic landscape and the potential for interest rate cuts , how can you best position yourself in the dynamic crypto market? While this is not financial advice, here are some actionable insights to consider as you formulate your strategy: Stay Informed and Adaptable: Continuously monitor official announcements from central banks (especially the Federal Reserve), key economic data releases (inflation, employment), and expert analyses. The market reacts swiftly to new information, so being well-informed allows for quicker adaptation. Understand the Nuances: Recognize that not all cryptocurrencies will react in the same way to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin, often seen as a ‘digital gold’ or macro asset, might respond differently than smaller altcoins or DeFi tokens. Research specific projects and their fundamentals. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Given crypto’s inherent volatility, even in a favorable macro environment, capital preservation should be a priority. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking profits at predetermined levels. Diversification: Avoid putting all your digital eggs in one basket. Diversifying your crypto portfolio across different asset classes (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, DeFi tokens, NFTs) and even traditional assets can help mitigate risk during periods of uncertainty. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making a large lump-sum investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations. DCA can help smooth out volatility and reduce the impact of short-term price swings, making you less susceptible to market timing errors. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific projects rather than getting caught up in daily price movements. Macroeconomic cycles come and go, but foundational technological advancements can drive sustained growth over years. By adopting a disciplined approach and integrating macroeconomic awareness into your investment framework, you can better navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by potential interest rate cuts . The potential for one or two interest rate cuts in 2024, as suggested by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, undoubtedly introduces a fascinating dynamic for the cryptocurrency market. While lower rates could inject fresh liquidity and boost investor appetite for risk, the broader economic context, including inflation, employment data, and geopolitical stability, will continue to shape the narrative. For those navigating the exciting world of digital assets, staying informed, understanding the macroeconomic currents, and adopting a well-thought-out strategy will be paramount. The future remains uncertain, but opportunities often emerge from periods of significant change, making this an exciting time to be involved in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the primary impact of interest rate cuts on financial markets? The primary impact of interest rate cuts is to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper. This encourages consumer spending and business investment, which can lead to increased liquidity in the financial system and often boosts stock markets and other risk assets, as investors seek higher returns than those offered by traditional low-yield savings or bonds. 2. How might interest rate cuts specifically affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Historically, interest rate cuts tend to make riskier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive. Lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding volatile assets, increase overall market liquidity, and can lead to capital flowing into digital assets in search of higher yields compared to traditional low-return investments. 3. Are interest rate cuts guaranteed this year, according to Scott Bessent? U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that ‘one or two rate cuts’ are a realistic expectation for this year. However, this is an expectation based on current economic forecasts, not a guarantee. The Federal Reserve’s decisions are data-dependent and can change based on evolving inflation, employment, and broader economic conditions. 4. What other factors, besides interest rates, influence crypto prices? Besides interest rate cuts and broader macroeconomic trends, crypto prices are influenced by a multitude of factors. These include regulatory developments, technological advancements within blockchain projects, institutional adoption, network upgrades (like Bitcoin halvings or Ethereum’s Merge), market sentiment, geopolitical events, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of individual cryptocurrencies. 5. Should I change my crypto investment strategy based on potential rate cuts? While potential interest rate cuts can be a positive macroeconomic tailwind for crypto, it is generally advisable to maintain a well-researched and disciplined investment strategy rather than making drastic changes based solely on a single factor. Consider diversifying your portfolio, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term speculation. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. 6. What is the Federal Reserve’s role in setting interest rates? The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is the central bank of the United States and is responsible for setting the federal funds rate, which influences other interest rates throughout the economy. Its decisions are guided by a dual mandate: to achieve maximum sustainable employment and to maintain stable prices (control inflation). The Fed uses interest rates as a key tool to manage economic growth and stability. Did you find this deep dive into interest rate cuts and their potential impact on crypto insightful?

In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Bessent says that the Federal Reserve is in need of deeper scrutiny as its budget and operations have expanded over the years. Bessent’s comments come as President Donald Trump has said he hopes Powell quits and has also considered attempting to remove him, all while slamming the Fed chair for not cutting interest rates. “The President has said he is not going to fire Chair Powell. I was somewhat surprised that [economist] Mohamed El-Erian came out and said that [Powell should resign]. And what I’ve come out and said is that I believe that it would do Chair Powell a favor, and he would be doing the institution a favor, if he did an internal review, separate monetary policy from everything else. And this is something that [economist and former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury] Larry Summers and I agree on, is this mission creep from the Fed is endangering their independence of monetary policy, all these other things that they’re engaging in could threaten monetary policy. It is a big, sprawling institution. The central budget for the board is up 4x since 2004, and every institution needs to examine themselves.” Bessent also says he’d support Powell overseeing the agency’s review, despite the criticism he’s facing. “It could be a committee. It could be a group. They could invite outside experts in. The Bank of England after the 2022 rate hike shock went back and did a very good examination of what went wrong with monetary policy that brought in outside experts. I think an internal review would be a good start. And if the internal review didn’t look like it was serious, then maybe their could be an external review.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Behind the scenes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight, with traders and analysts zeroing in on its rapid rise across DeFi networks. Mutuum Finance is now in the 5th presale stage. The stage is already more than 85% sold. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $12.9 million, apart from attaining more than 13900 token holders. Early data hint at growing liquidity flows and accelerating adoption, fueling speculation that 2025 could belong to this under‑the‑radar Mutuum Finance as it positions for potentially larger returns. Momentum XRP approaching $5 Also, Ripple XRP, which is trading at $3.56, has been on an upward trend since mid-July after breaching its major resistance levels between $3.00-$3.40. Analyst projections have also been upgraded to have upside potential to $5.00 by the late 2025 as the clouds of institutional holdings have continued to rise, with ETF-related sentiments also being bullish as well as technical indicators such as dominance breakouts and golden-crosses. On-chain metrics provide evidence that the number of whale wallets holds and trades with high volumes after important ETF and custody announcements. Mutuum Finance Presale with Powerful Investor Demand The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has attracted more than 13900 investors and over $12.9 million has been raised. There is enthusiasm over the project. The current price of MUTM tokens is $0.03 in phase five and will rise up 16.67% in phase 6. Powering the Future of DeFi with Dual-Lending Mutuum Finance is a distinctive platform where users retain their assets within the scope of decentralized lending. The platform operates on a double-model mechanism to provide flexibility as well as efficiency that encompass Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer of lending models. Peer-to-Contract employs self-executing smart contracts that perform the lending task as autonomic with no human involvement. They are programmed to function based on changing market rates with a floating rate of interest based on the prevailing supply and demand of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates intermediaries and provides an opportunity to be in direct touch with borrowers and lenders. This is even more so for application to risky assets because it allows customized terms of a loan and flexibility as per user desire and his or her risk-tolerance capacity. Mutuum Finance Doubles Down on Security with $50,000 Bug Bounty Security is the greatest priority of Mutuum Finance. It has introduced its Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. Four severity levels of the program are critical, major, minor, and low, so any vulnerability that would exist would be found and rewarded in a decent manner. This is aligned with the vision of the team to create a secure, transparent, and high-quality DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance’s $100K Giveaway Mutuum Finance has introduced a $100,000 giveaway as a token of gratitude to its early users. It will have ten winners who will get $10,000 in MUTM tokens.

The OCC says it’s issuing an order of prohibition against Cricel Santamaria, a former client service representative at Webster Bank in Stamford, Connecticut. Says the OCC, “From approximately April 2019 until May 23, 2022, the respondent was employed at the bank. Between approximately October 2021 and April 2022, the respondent obtained approximately 62 check images from the bank’s internal systems and made them available for sale over the internet. Thirteen bank customers reported fraud on their accounts shortly after their checks were made available for sale on the internet. The total fraud reported was $237,374 and the total Bank loss was approximately $108,000.” According to the OCC, Santamaria “engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, caused more than a minimal loss to the bank, demonstrated personal dishonesty and willful or continuing disregard for the safety and soundness of the bank.” The OCC order prohibits the ex-banker from working in the banking and financial services industry. Santamaria consents to the OCC order without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. Under the order, the Department of Justice (DOJ) retains its right to “bring other actions deemed appropriate” against Santamaria. The Webster Bank, a commercial bank based in Stamford, Connecticut, has more than $70 billion in assets under management.

As the market approaches an anticipated rally in 2025, speculators are eager to discover which coin promises greater returns. This article delves into the potential growth of these viral tokens, revealing crucial insights for those looking to capitalize on the surge. Dogwifhat Price Surge Reflects Short-Term Momentum Amid Volatility Past month WIF performance shows a strong upward move with an 81.988% price increase and notable 16.791% growth over the past week. Over the past six months, the coin dipped by -11.738%, reflecting typical volatility in altcoin markets. Price action has been dynamic, with buying pressure during the recent surge overcoming prior dips. The longer-term view highlights fluctuations and mixed indicators, combining robust short-term momentum with underlying variability. The trend has not been uniform, as shifts in market sentiment have led to erratic movements in earlier phases of this period. Current prices trade within a range of $0.642 to $1.081, with resistance at $1.299 and support at $0.420, while a secondary resistance stands at $1.738. Price behavior suggests bulls are active, as momentum indicators and RSI nearing 69 point to buying strength, though caution emerges at higher levels. The absence of a well-defined long-term trend calls for attention to these key barriers for entries and exits. Traders might consider buying near support levels with tight stops, taking partial profits near resistance zones. The current situation provides trading opportunities but warns of possible pullbacks if bearish pressure increases, so clear risk management is essential. Bonk Price Surge Sets Stage for Active Trading Setups Over the past month, BONK surged by over 200% while the past six months showed a steadier climb of roughly 18%. A one-week increase of about 24% underscores a recent burst of momentum. The data highlight significant short-term volatility contrasted with a more modest long-term growth. A rapid price escalation over the month stands in stark relief to a relatively gentle rise seen over the half-year period, setting an interesting backdrop for current market action. The current price is trading between $0.000011 and $0.000018 with clear markers for traders. Immediate resistance is noted at $0.000022 and a secondary level at $0.000029, while support is observed at $0.000008 and a very low level at $0.000000427. Bulls appear to be leading the action given the strong recent gains, yet the high RSI reading of 72.23 hints at caution as the coin approaches overbought territory. Traders might consider buying on dips near the support levels while watching for a confirmed break above $0.000022 to signal further bullish moves. Conclusion In 2025, WIF is expected to outperform BONK in terms of gains. Strong community support and innovative features give WIF an edge. BONK, while popular, may not match WIF's growth due to less impactful updates and a smaller following. Both coins have potential, but WIF appears more promising for higher returns. Updates and strategic moves will be crucial for their success. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A Statement That Crossed the Line? The comment marks one of the more extreme examples of tribalism within the crypto space. According to Guardy’s post, which referenced the now-infamous Space, the speaker questioned the legitimacy of XRP holders and suggested they were inherently untrustworthy. On record. #XRP people belong in prison! From the Danish space. pic.twitter.com/B3MQIU4QUN — Guardy (PARODY?) (@GLigh7) July 22, 2025 While Guardy’s account is tagged as “parody,” the tone and phrasing sparked immediate backlash . The strong reaction from the XRP community indicates just how sensitive and deeply polarized crypto discourse has become. XRP Community Reacts Swiftly XRP enthusiasts wasted no time responding to the alleged insult. Saul, while responding, stated, “ My biggest issue is how little sense the statement makes. It’s offensively nonsensical. XRP holders should be born in prison? What? How? One only becomes an active investor much later in life”. This was widely seen as a criticism of those who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, particularly XRP, which has long been the target of maximalist disdain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The response from Justin Tomlin – Imagine being such a hater that you’re willing to throw babies in prison over a digital asset…SMFH – also pointed to a deeper frustration within the XRP community: the inability to have rational, informed discussions when one side is unwilling to recognize the technological or institutional relevance of anything outside of Bitcoin. A Deeper Divide: Bitcoin Maximalists vs. XRP Supporters The controversy underscores a broader, long-standing conflict between Bitcoin maximalists, who believe Bitcoin is the only legitimate cryptocurrency, and supporters of projects like XRP, which offer faster, more energy-efficient solutions tailored for cross-border payments. Bitcoin has come under increasing scrutiny for its high energy consumption and scalability issues, while XRP’s value proposition lies in its speed, negligible transaction costs, and eco-friendly infrastructure. This has led to more institutional support for XRP, fueling resentment in corners of the Bitcoin community where decentralization purity tests remain the standard. XRP’s Meteoric Rise Adds Fuel to the Fire Since the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, XRP has surged by over 600%, bolstered by Ripple’s legal victories, the expansion of the XRP Ledger ecosystem, and increased adoption in financial corridors across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. As XRP gains ground, some interpret the pushback from Bitcoin maximalists as a defensive reaction to its growing credibility and influence. The uproar caused by the comment speaks volumes about the current state of crypto culture, and the divide it exposed is all too real. Parody or not, Guardy’s post tapped into an uncomfortable truth: tribalism still dominates much of the digital asset conversation.

In a social media post , the crypto investor said that the strategy behind the Liquid Alpha Fund “clearly is no longer serving our LPs.” He said the fund had been built for volatile markets and had once delivered results, but added that Asymmetric would now be ""shifting away from liquid trading strategies"" and toward longer-term investments in blockchain infrastructure. The decision comes after unconfirmed social media chatter that the liquid fund was down 78% this year. However, McCann said in a separate post that the Assymetric fund ""is not down 78%"" and is waiting for Hyperliquid's second airdrop, which he says will bring ""extraordinary"" returns. The move isn't a total surprise, as volatility in the crypto market has decreased significantly in the last twelve months, potentially signaling a more mature digital assets market. Crypto Volatility Index (CVI) is down almost 30%, according to TradingView data. Investor exit Investors in the liquid fund have been offered the option to exit without regard to standard lock-up terms or to roll their capital into a new, illiquid investment structure. “Our job is to adapt with discipline and build for what’s next,” McCann wrote. The firm, he said, consists of multiple investment vehicles, and while the Liquid Alpha Fund struggled, other parts of the business — especially its venture strategy — remain intact. That venture arm will continue to back early-stage blockchain projects. McCann, a former technologist and trader who moved into crypto investing, described the fund’s poor performance as a test of ""one's resolve” but emphasized that “the only way forward is through.”",Markets|Asymmetric|fund|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-23 20:02:45

In his YouTube video, Deutscher noted that, contrary to the popular altcoin season index, the current market situation signals a positive period for altcoins. According to the analyst, approximately 70% of the top 50 altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin on a monthly basis. Deutscher suggested that Bitcoin's dominance falling below a key support level for the first time since November 2024 has led to a shift in market momentum. He noted that the primary driver behind this shift is growing positive sentiment toward Ethereum. He argued that ETH ETFs, new regulatory frameworks, and institutional interest are boosting Ethereum, providing the necessary “firepower” for a broader altcoin market rally.

Some suggested this may be a drive to take profits, but there may be another reason, as more old whales are dusted with transactions containing warning messages. There may be one common reason as to why old whales are moving their coins. After years of holding, some of the largest holders transferred their coins. The most notable case was of one user moving 80,000 BTC from several wallets. The reason may be hiding behind the spread of messages, which are considered a specific scam using the op return function of Bitcoin transactions. Investigators, however, noted that many old whale wallets received dust amounts of BTC with a pseudo-legal message attached to the transaction. The targeted addresses were not specifically chosen, except by one common thread – a high balance and old wallets from the early years of the network. Dust messages reach BTC lost in landfill One on-chain investigator noted the pseudo-legal messages reached a notorious BTC wallet. The stash belonged to James Howells, known for trashing a hard drive containing 8,000 BTC. Since the address is widely known and the coins are considered lost, the legal claim to the BTC in Howell’s wallet is meaningless. Just realized that the person who sent notices to the 80,000 BTC that moved earlier this month has also been targeting several other dormant addresses, including the one belonging to James Howells, the guy who lost his hard drive in the landfill. This pretty much puts the hack… — Sani | TimechainIndex.com (@SaniExp) July 23, 2025 This also suggests that the whale that moved 80,000 BTC may have acted out of caution, despite the fact that BTC cannot be claimed legally and used for its purpose without control over the private keys. Unfortunately, even a legal claim would not be able to salvage Howells’ coins. The wallet has been pelted with messages and even an ultimatum to prove that the coins are not forfeited. The wallet of James Howells, containing 8,000 BTC, has been given a deadline to prove the coins are not abandoned. The BTC sit in an old hard drive, buried under layers of trash in a landfill. | Source: Mempool.space Howells has been given a deadline until September 30 to prove ownership. One of the messages even read ‘we have taken possession of this wallet and its contents’. Unless the sender managed to unearth the hard drive and revive the old wallet, the message remained meaningless. There is currently no explicit list of addresses that received the fake legal claims through op_return. Other old whales may also have moved their coins as a precaution or to shift them to a new address format. Newer whales that bought at a more favorable price did not receive the legal notes. Recently, three wallets linked to the same entity moved 10,606 BTC, potentially having a medium-term strategy. BTC whales have already taken profits A total of 14.7M BTC are held in wallets aged 155 days or over. Most of the older whales have moved their coins and realized profits during the earlier BTC bull rallies. Since 2023, the percentage of coins held for more than one year has been sliding slowly. Overall, ancient cohorts of over 7 years rarely move their coins. Newer whales have a double strategy of holding some of the BTC, while using a portion for short-term trading. The newest class of corporate and institutional buyers has diverging approaches to announcing their wallets. Some are showing proof of public reserves, while others try to keep their wallets a secret to avoid exposure and eventual attacks.

The market cap stands at $194.17 billion, with a Golden Cross formation as the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, validating institutional positioning ahead of a potential SEC settlement and ETF approvals. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, corporate treasury developments, Brazilian institutional adoption, and Golden Cross indicators to assess XRP’s 90-day trajectory amid a healthy correction phase and continued institutional validation. Technical Pullback: Healthy Correction Maintains Bullish Structure XRP’s current price of $3.3007 reflects a strong 7.03% daily decline, representing a healthy profit-taking correction after approaching the $3.55 resistance level. Source: TradingView The $0.3315 intraday range represents 10.0% of the current price, demonstrating high volatility typical of institutional position adjustments during correction phases. RSI at 68.72 is healthy, providing an optimal reset from extreme overbought conditions above 85 , suggesting technical cooling rather than a trend reversal. Source: TradingView MACD indicators maintain bullish momentum with a positive histogram at 0.2733, confirming underlying strength despite a short-term pullback. The combination of a healthy RSI reset and sustained MACD bullish indicators creates an optimal setup for continuation once the correction is complete around key support levels. Corporate Treasury Shift: Nature’s Miracle Leads $20M Adoption According to ChatGPT’s XRP analysis, Nature’s Miracle Holding Inc.’s announcement of a $20 million XRP treasury program represents continued corporate validation of XRP’s utility in institutional balance sheet diversification. Nature’s Miracle Holding Inc. ($NMHI) is launching a $20 M Corporate $XRP Fund! Backed by equity financing from GHS Investments — now SEC-effective — we’ll acquire XRP and fuel our vertical-farming expansion. Blockchain meets agriculture. #XRP #AgTech #Crypto — Nature’s Miracle Holding Inc (@NMHIcrypto) July 23, 2025 This corporate adoption demonstrates a sophisticated recognition of XRP’s payment infrastructure advantages and progress in regulatory clarity. The treasury program’s timing coincides with XRP’s technical pullback, creating an optimal opportunity for corporate accumulation during market correction phases. Brazilian Infrastructure Change: VERT’s $130M Platform Launch Brazil’s VERT securitization company has launched a blockchain platform with a BRL 700M ( $130M ) issuance on the XRP Ledger, marking a major step in institutional infrastructure adoption. JUST IN: VERT, one of Brazil’s leading securitization and fund management companies, launches blockchain platform for structured credit with BRL 700M ($130M) issuance on $XRP Ledger and EVM Sidechain. pic.twitter.com/7FVCBGdmFu — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) July 23, 2025 This development validates XRP’s capabilities for complex financial operations requiring enterprise-grade reliability and compliance. VERT’s selection of XRP technology over competing blockchain alternatives validates technical superiority for enterprise applications. Golden Cross Formation: Technical Milestone Confirms Institutional Thesis The Golden Cross formation, with the 50-day MA crossing above the 200-day MA, represents a technical milestone that validates the long-term bullish thesis despite the short-term correction. This classic bullish sign attracts institutional momentum traders seeking confirmed trend continuation opportunities. Source: TradingView Golden Cross timing coincides with the acceleration of corporate treasury adoption and progress in regulatory clarity, creating a confluence of technical and fundamental catalysts that support sustained appreciation scenarios. Historical Context: Correction Creates Accumulation Opportunity XRP’s pullback from $3.55 toward $3.30 support represents a healthy 7% correction within the context of an extraordinary year-to-date performance. The decline presents an institutional accumulation opportunity, while maintaining an 86% appreciation from January levels, demonstrating strong institutional momentum. Source: TradingView Current price action maintains a 14% discount to the 2018 all-time high of $3.84 , providing compelling risk-reward dynamics for institutional investors seeking exposure to a regulatory-compliant payment infrastructure. The correction eliminates speculative excess while preserving the fundamental momentum of adoption. Support & Resistance: EMA Strength Provides Foundation Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $3.2204 , reinforced by psychological support at $3.1000-$3.2000 . The exceptional EMA positioning, with prices 32-47% above all major moving averages, confirms the success of institutional accumulation despite daily corrections. Major support is provided by the 20-day EMA at $3.0024, representing a key technical level for validating trend continuation. Source: TradingView Recovery resistance begins at today’s high around $3.5500 , followed by major resistance at $3.6000-$3.7000 . Breaking above this zone would signal continuation toward key psychological resistance at $4.0000, representing a pathway toward new cycle highs above previous 2018 peaks. Market Metrics: Institutional Interest Sustains During Correction XRP maintains a $194.17 billion market capitalization with a robust 24-hour trading volume of $9.24 billion, despite a 6.74% decline. The volume-to-market cap ratio of 4.84% indicates continued institutional participation during correction phases rather than capitulation selling. XRP’s market dominance of 5.06% positions it as the third-largest cryptocurrency, with institutional recognition supporting premium valuations. The circulating supply of 59.18 billion XRP represents 59% of the maximum 100 billion supply, providing controlled tokenomics that appeal to corporate treasury strategies while maintaining sufficient liquidity for continued institutional participation. Social Sentiment: Community Resilience During Healthy Pullback LunarCrush data reveals community engagement with 83% positive sentiment, despite a price correction, demonstrating a mature investor understanding of healthy pullback dynamics. The 18.64 million total engagements, with 68,140 mentions, validate sustained interest during consolidation periods. A social dominance of 3.65% with declining engagement metrics reflects typical correction-phase behavior, while maintaining core community confidence in the institutional adoption thesis. Whales have bought over 280 million $XRP in just the past 10 days! pic.twitter.com/JDTwaEYHMe — Ali (@ali_charts) July 23, 2025 Recent themes have focused on SEC settlement speculation and ETF approval timelines, rather than concerns about price volatility. This, in turn, has driven whale activities. 90-Day XRP Price Forecast SEC Resolution and ETF Rally (Bull Case – 50% Probability) Successful SEC settlement and ETF approval momentum could drive appreciation toward $4.50-$5.00 , representing 36-51% upside. This scenario requires support to hold above $3.10 and sustained institutional positioning with regulatory clarity acceleration. Source: TradingView Technical targets include $3.70 , $4.20 , and $4.80 based on regulatory catalyst momentum and institutional flow projections. The settlement catalyst, combined with ETF approvals, could attract massive institutional capital seeking regulatory-compliant payment infrastructure exposure. Consolidation Extension (Base Case – 35% Probability) Continued consolidation between $3.10 and $3.60 could extend for 4-6 weeks while institutional positioning develops and the regulatory timeline advances. This scenario allows technical indicators to reset while maintaining Golden Cross momentum and validating corporate adoption. Support at the 20-day EMA around $3.00 would likely hold during consolidation, with volume normalizing around 7-9 billion daily. Source: TradingView This sideways action provides additional opportunities for corporate accumulation while preserving the uptrend structure for eventual continuation. Deeper Correction Risk (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Breaking below the $3.00 support level could trigger a deeper correction, potentially reaching $2.80-$2.90 , representing a 12-15% downside. This scenario would require broader regulatory disappointment or weak institutional demand weakness affecting the corporate treasury thesis. Source: TradingView The strong institutional adoption backdrop and Golden Cross formation limit extreme downside scenarios, with major support at $2.80-$2.90 providing a foundation for recovery during continued regulatory progress and corporate validation. XRP Forecast: Payment Infrastructure Excellence Meets Regulatory Clarity XRP’s current positioning reflects the mix of a healthy technical correction, accelerating corporate adoption, and approaching regulatory resolution. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals that cryptocurrency is positioned at an optimal accumulation opportunity during the acceleration of institutional validation. Next Price Target: $4.20-$4.80 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a successful defense of the $3.10 support level to validate correction completion and trigger recovery toward the $3.70 resistance. From there, the SEC settlement catalyst could propel XRP toward the $4.20 psychological milestone, with sustained institutional momentum driving toward $4.80-$5.00, representing new cycle highs. However, failure to hold $3.00 support would trigger an extended consolidation to the $2.80-$2.90 range, creating an optimal institutional accumulation opportunity before regulatory catalysts drive XRP toward $5.00+ targets and potential new all-time highs above $3.84 .

FOMC meeting where dovish dissents are looking very likely. QRA meeting where we will get a look into how willing Bessent is going to be to try to weaponize treasury issuance for the first time since being chair. Tariff letter deadlines. The Supreme Court will begin deliberating on whether tariffs via executive order are legal or not. No big edge on either side right now personally, will just react once we get clarity. Stay frosty,” Forward Guidance host Felix Jauvin wrote via X. July’s Final Days Could Shape Crypto The two‑day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on 29–30 July is the first shot. Governor Christopher Waller, speaking last week, laid out the case for an immediate 25‑basis‑point rate cut, arguing that tariff‑linked inflation looks “temporary” and that the labour market is “under strain.” Related Reading: House Passes Major Bills During ‘Crypto Week,’ But Significant Changes May Take Time Prediction‑market platform Kalshi assigns a 40 % probability to two cuts and a 13 % probability to three cuts by December; Goldman Sachs now places the first move in September, but traders emphasise that even a single dovish dissent next week would cement that timetable. As The Kobeissi Letter summed up in a widely shared post: “Rate cuts are coming … Next week’s Fed meeting will pave the path for a September rate cut.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has broken with predecessors’ reticence by all but instructing the central bank to move sooner. “If [tariff] inflation isn’t sticky, they could do it sooner than September,” he told Fox News on 1 July, after stating two months earlier that “the bond market is sending a signal that the Fed should be cutting.” Only hours after the Fed decision, Bessent will unveil the Treasury’s third‑quarter borrowing plans at the Quarterly Refunding Announcement. The agenda published on 11 July flags a noon release on 30 July. Desks are watching not just the size but the maturity mix: Bessent’s advisers have floated heavier use of short‑dated bills to “manage the yield curve,” a move that would soak up the very cash that cycles into stablecoins and crypto risk. Tariffs Come Back Into Focus Trade policy is the second pressure point. A 7 July executive order extended reciprocal tariffs and launched a volley of tariff‑rate letters to trading partners; the new levies take effect on 1 August unless renegotiated. Bessent flies to Stockholm next week in a last‑minute bid to defer a mooted 100 % surcharge on Chinese imports, underscoring how fluid the landscape remains. Related Reading: 2025 Crypto Thefts Spike: Stolen Funds Hit $2.7 Billion In H1– Report Even if diplomats buy time, lawyers may not. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has set 31 July for expedited oral argument on V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case that could decide whether a president can impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Petitioners have already asked the Supreme Court for review before judgment, calling the tariffs a “$600 bn annual tax.” A ruling to curtail executive trade powers would remove what many bitcoin bulls see as a long‑term inflation tail‑risk; the opposite outcome could entrench the policy. Real yields—now the dominant macro driver of Bitcoin—move inversely to rate‑cut expectations and Treasury supply. The benchmark 10‑year has fallen about 30 bp in three sessions to 4.34 %, mirroring BTC’s 8 % bounce over the same period. For now, the market’s playbook is simple: Watch the Fed dots, count the bills in the QRA, read the tariff letters—and, as Jauvin advised, “stay frosty.” At press time, total crypto market cap stood at $3.81 trillion.

Beyond Lee’s endorsement, the Bitcoin “digital gold” narrative has gained traction among other influential figures and institutions. Early in 2025, the US Treasury Department published a comprehensive report officially recognizing Bitcoin as digital gold. Additionally, in March, President Donald Trump publicly referred to Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a sentiment echoed by Crypto Czar David Sacks, who declared that “ the US strategic reserve functions as a digital Fort Knox for the asset commonly known as digital gold. “ JUST IN: Crypto Czar David Sacks says the ""US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: RSI at 48.88 Is a Perfect Setup for Next Rally Bitcoin currently trades at $118,160, representing a modest 0.20% decline from its recent all-time high of $123,000. Technical analysis reveals several resistance zones ahead, including an immediate target of around $120,094, followed by a primary objective of $122,013, and an extended target of approximately $128,387. Source: TradingView The current RSI reading of 48.88 occupies neutral territory, having moderated from previously overbought conditions at the all-time high. This RSI positioning indicates Bitcoin retains capacity for additional gains without immediately entering overbought conditions.

As a result, available liquidity has shrunk and temporarily sent the interest rate the protocol charges borrowers to more than 10%. As per DefiLlama data, Aave is the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum, with over $55 billion of deposits. Users deposit assets, like Ethereum, and earn interest when other users borrow them. Justin Sun leads the whale game According to reports, Marc Zeller, an Aave contributor, said that he believed crypto billionaire Justin Sun was behind most Ethereum withdrawals. He said the Tron founder regularly moves large amounts in and out of the lending protocol. Whales have pulled a whopping $1.7 billion worth of ETH from Aave over the past week. Marc Zeller, an Aave contributor, told DLNews he believed Justin Sun was behind the majority of the Ethereum withdrawals. “He’s moving billions like I go grocery shopping.” pic.twitter.com/37df6VLTOO — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 23, 2025 Arkham marked the wallets as belonging to Sun. Over the last three days, these wallets took more than $646 million worth of Ethereum from Aave, as shown by on-chain records. However, Wallets attributed to Sun by Arkham still hold another $80 million worth of Ethereum on Aave. Over the past week, a wallet connected to the crypto exchange HTX also took $455 million worth of Ethereum out of Aave. Sun is an advisor to HTX and a well-known figure in its public events, where he often talks about the platform and its projects. In addition, a London-based financial manager called Abraxas Capital Management was one of the other groups that took smaller amounts of Ethereum from Aave. Over the past week, it took out a net of $115 million worth of crypto. After whales withdrew Ethereum from Aave, the amount of the available asset on the site went down. After that, the protocol is designed to increase the interest rate charged to borrowers. When the interest rate went up, looping strategies that relied on the interest rate for borrowing Ethereum kept low, reversed, and investors lost their money. Also, only a certain amount of Ethereum can be unstaked at a time. It will take the network almost eleven days to unstake the backlog of 627,944 Ethereum, according to beaconcha.in . Ethereum short-term pullback According to figures from U.K. investment manager Farside Investors, the nine spot Ethereum funds have made $5 billion in net investments since May 15. This is twice as much as they made in their first 10 months. More than $2.5 billion has been put into the ETFs in just the last five days. However, analysts believe the price momentum is lagging behind institutional inflows. In addition, although the long-term outlook remains bullish due to institutional adoption, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan is positioning for a potential short-term dip and maintaining cash reserves to capitalize on better entry points. Meanwhile, ETH has seen a 3% dip in the last 24 hours to $3,583. This is a short pullback because the coin has seen a 9% surge in the last week and a 35% rise in the last 2 weeks. The crypto market take a dip Across the broad crypto market, there has been a big correction, led by Bitcoin and other crypto coins. The market downturn follows Trump’s statement that he will raise tariffs on some countries if they don’t make trade deals with the US. According to on-chain data , crypto prices have shed nearly $40 billion from the global market capitalization.

This surge of interest is spotlighting a series of new altcoin launches in 2025 , including MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, BlockDAG, and Neo Pepe — each blending unique narratives with emerging technology. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops List of Political Meme Coins with Community Governance MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out among current presales as a meme-powered altcoin with a political dimension, directly addressing investor appetite for projects that combine meme virality and decentralized governance . Often highlighted in discussions of meme coins with governance , MAGACOIN FINANCE introduces a zero-tax structure and a decentralized political ethos designed to put decision-making in the hands of its community. This approach contrasts with traditional meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which emphasize cultural impact without governance layers. It also offers a different narrative compared to platforms like Ethereum or XRP, where technology or regulatory compliance takes center stage. Investors evaluating Ethereum vs meme coins for 2025 growth often cite MAGACOIN FINANCE’s ideological edge and growing Telegram traction as reasons it could outperform standard meme plays. With the global crypto market cap reaching $3.37 trillion , MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as an early-stage opportunity for those tracking top crypto projects in July 2025 that align with community-first values. Qubetics Emerges as a Major Cross-Chain and Real-World Tokenization Play Among new launches, Qubetics ($TICS) has delivered one of the most striking starts. After raising $18.4 million in presale funds and distributing over 517 million tokens to more than 28,500 holders, the token surged 950% on launch , with early buyers realizing returns above 41,000% . Qubetics operates as a Layer-1 Web3 aggregator , targeting blockchain fragmentation through cross-chain smart contracts and a tokenization platform for real-world assets like land and infrastructure.

Its presale pricing is scheduled to increase weekly until reaching $0.4 by late July , keeping it on lists of best crypto presales right now for users balancing immediate gains with long-term ecosystem utility. BlockDAG Raises $329 Million, Expands Hybrid Infrastructure BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to draw heavy capital, raising $329 million through a presale that’s produced early returns of 2,600% . Built on a hybrid of Proof-of-Work and DAG technology, BlockDAG allows for scalable parallel transactions, positioning it alongside Layer-1 competitors like Solana and Cardano. The project’s live testnet and no-code dApp builder have attracted developers and miners alike. With over 2 million mobile miners and 18,000 hardware devices shipped, BlockDAG is backing software with physical infrastructure. A 100 million token airdrop in June helped expand reach ahead of upcoming listings on 20 major exchanges , a point that frequently comes up for investors asking where to buy meme coins and altcoins during launch phases . Neo Pepe Combines Meme Appeal with DAO Control Finally, Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) has emerged among meme coins with governance structures , blending classic meme virality with DAO-managed treasury and proposals. Its presale spans 16 stages, aiming for $50 million , with the next bump from ~$0.07 to ~$0.08 expected soon. Over $2 million has already flowed in, with analysts crediting its combination of community voting power, a Certik-audited auto-liquidity system, and multi-chain deployment across Ethereum, BSC, and Base. This layered approach is gaining traction among traders comparing Ethereum vs meme coins , especially those prioritizing decentralized finance mechanics over pure meme culture. Bottom Line: Where to Buy Meme Coins & Altcoins Now As Bitcoin’s rally faces possible short-term pullbacks — highlighted by Arthur Hayes’ prediction of a retreat to $90,000 — capital is rotating into newer narratives. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, BlockDAG, and Neo Pepe showcase how meme culture, governance, and cross-chain utility are reshaping early-stage crypto investing in 2025. For anyone wondering where to buy meme coins or get in on new altcoin launches, the answer is often pretty straightforward: most investors still pick them up directly through project websites or official presale pages before they hit major exchanges. As the market keeps shifting, these early access points have become a big part of the conversation around the best crypto opportunities this quarter.

A recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has delivered a crucial victory for NFT trademark protection , firmly establishing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as “goods” under established trademark law. This isn’t merely a win for Yuga Labs, the creative force behind the iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC); it’s a pivotal moment that underscores the growing maturity of the Web3 ecosystem and the increasing relevance of traditional intellectual property rights in decentralized spaces. A Landmark Decision: Defining NFTs as “Goods” for Trademark Protection At the core of this high-stakes legal battle lies the dispute between Yuga Labs and artist Ryder Ripps. Ripps had created and sold a collection of “lookalike” NFTs, dubbing them “expressive appropriation art” to critique the BAYC brand. While an earlier $9 million judgment against Ripps was vacated, the Ninth Circuit’s core declaration carries immense weight for NFT trademark protection and beyond: NFTs Classified as “Goods”: This is arguably the most significant aspect of the ruling. By categorizing NFTs as “goods” for trademark purposes, the court effectively extends the robust protections of the Lanham Act (the primary federal trademark statute in the U.S.) into the digital realm. This means that NFTs, despite their intangible nature, are now recognized in a way that allows for the same brand protection as physical products like shoes or electronics. Affirmation of Yuga Labs’ Rights: The court unequivocally upheld Yuga Labs’ right to trademark protection for its Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. This reinforces the idea that the distinct visual identity, branding, and goodwill associated with a successful NFT collection are legally defensible assets. Rejection of Artistic Defenses: Many of Ryder Ripps’ arguments, including claims of fair use and First Amendment protection for his “appropriation art,” were largely rejected. The court clarified that while artistic expression is valued, it cannot override established trademark rights when there’s a risk of consumer confusion. Return to Lower Court for “Consumer Confusion” Trial: The case will now proceed to a lower court to specifically determine whether Ripps’ lookalike collection actually caused “consumer confusion” among buyers. This element is central to proving trademark infringement. This decision provides much-needed clarity in a nascent and often ambiguous legal landscape surrounding digital collectibles. It acknowledges the commercial value, brand identity, and significant investment inherent in successful NFT projects, paving the way for greater legal certainty and stability. Navigating the Nuances of “Consumer Confusion” in NFT Trademark Cases The concept of “consumer confusion” is the cornerstone of trademark infringement claims. It refers to the likelihood that consumers would mistakenly believe that a product or service originates from, is sponsored by, or is affiliated with a different source. In the context of NFT trademark protection , this involves a multi-faceted inquiry: Direct Confusion: Did buyers of Ripps’ RR/BAYC NFTs genuinely believe they were purchasing official Yuga Labs products? Source Confusion: Would a reasonable person think that Ripps’ collection was produced, authorized, or endorsed by Yuga Labs? Initial Interest Confusion: Even if a consumer eventually realizes the product is not authentic, did the similar mark initially draw them in under a false pretense? The Ninth Circuit’s decision to send the case back for a factual determination on consumer confusion highlights that while trademark rights exist, their infringement still requires proof of actual or likely misleading of the public. This aspect of the trial will be crucial, as it delves into the perception and behavior of NFT market participants. It underscores that while artistic intent may be present, the commercial reality of a project’s presentation and potential to mislead consumers holds significant weight in the eyes of the law. Fair Use and First Amendment: Balancing Artistic Freedom with NFT Trademark Protection Ryder Ripps’ defense heavily leaned on the principles of fair use and the First Amendment, arguing that his work was a form of commentary and parody, thus protected speech. However, the court’s stance on these arguments is particularly instructive for the future of digital art and intellectual property: Fair Use Limitations: While fair use permits the use of copyrighted material for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, it is not an unlimited license. The court likely found that Ripps’ commercial sale of similar NFTs, which directly competed with Yuga Labs’ offerings and potentially confused consumers, exceeded the bounds of fair use. The transformative nature of a work is key in fair use analysis, but if the new work primarily serves to exploit the original’s market, it often fails this test. First Amendment Boundaries: The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but this protection is not absolute, especially when it encroaches upon established commercial rights. The court’s ruling suggests that while Ripps has the right to express his views, he cannot do so in a manner that constitutes trademark infringement by creating consumer confusion regarding the source of goods. The balance here is between protecting artistic expression and preventing market deception. This outcome sets a significant precedent: even in the realm of “appropriation art” or commentary, artists operating within the commercial space of NFTs must respect existing trademarks. It clarifies that merely labeling something as “art” does not automatically grant immunity from trademark infringement claims, particularly when commercial gain and potential consumer deception are involved. The Far-Reaching Implications for Web3 Intellectual Property and NFT Trademark Protection This ruling is not an isolated event; it represents a foundational shift in how intellectual property is perceived and protected within the Web3 landscape. Its implications are vast and will resonate across various stakeholders: Stakeholder Group Key Implication of the Ruling Actionable Insights & Recommendations NFT Creators & Artists Strengthened ability to defend their brands against unauthorized replication and counterfeiting. Increased confidence in monetizing their unique digital creations. Proactively register trademarks for your NFT collections’ names, logos, and distinct visual elements. Clearly define the intellectual property rights granted to NFT holders (e.g., commercial use, personal use) in your terms and conditions. Monitor the market for infringing collections and be prepared to take legal action. NFT Collectors & Buyers Greater assurance of authenticity and reduced risk of purchasing fraudulent or confusingly similar knock-offs. Increased long-term value potential for legitimate, trademarked collections. Always verify the authenticity and official source of an NFT collection before purchasing. Research the creator’s reputation and their commitment to protecting their IP. Understand the underlying IP rights associated with the specific NFT you are acquiring. NFT Marketplaces & Platforms Clearer legal basis for implementing robust IP infringement reporting and removal policies. Increased responsibility to police listings and ensure compliance. Develop and enforce strict IP infringement policies, including clear takedown procedures. Invest in tools and processes to identify and remove infringing collections proactively. Educate users about IP rights and the consequences of infringement on their platforms. Legal & IP Professionals Establishes a critical precedent for future digital asset IP cases, providing a framework for navigating complex Web3 legal challenges. Develop specialized expertise in Web3 IP law, combining traditional IP principles with blockchain nuances. Advise clients on comprehensive proactive IP strategies, from registration to enforcement in the digital space. Stay abreast of evolving case law and technological advancements in the NFT sector. This decision underscores a crucial maturation of the legal framework surrounding digital assets. It sends a strong message that the “wild west” era of Web3 is evolving into a more structured, albeit still dynamic, landscape where established legal principles will increasingly apply. Challenges and Opportunities in Upholding NFT Trademark Protection While this ruling is a significant stride forward, the decentralized and global nature of NFTs still presents unique challenges for enforcing NFT trademark protection : Jurisdictional Complexities: NFTs transcend geographical borders. Enforcing a U.S. court ruling against an infringer operating in a different country can be a complex and resource-intensive endeavor. Anonymity and Decentralization: The pseudonymous nature of some blockchain interactions can make it difficult to identify and pursue infringers, especially if they operate across multiple decentralized platforms. Technological Enforcement: Integrating legal enforcement with blockchain’s immutable nature requires innovative solutions. While legal action can deter, physically “removing” an infringing NFT from a blockchain is generally impossible. However, these challenges also spur innovation and present new opportunities: On-Chain IP Solutions: The growing need for robust IP protection could accelerate the development of blockchain-based IP registration, tracking, and enforcement mechanisms, potentially using smart contracts for automated dispute resolution. Industry Standards: This ruling may catalyze the development of clearer industry standards and best practices for IP rights within the NFT ecosystem, leading to greater consistency and fewer disputes. Increased Investor Confidence: A more secure legal environment for IP will undoubtedly attract greater institutional investment and mainstream brand participation in the NFT space, fostering sustainable long-term growth and innovation. This ruling is a clear signal that the legal system is actively engaging with and adapting to technological advancements, offering a framework for growth while safeguarding creators’ rights. It represents a crucial step towards building a more trustworthy and legally sound digital economy. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Yuga Labs Case and Beyond? The case’s return to a lower court for a trial on consumer confusion means the full story isn’t yet written. The outcome of this specific trial will be significant: If Ripps’ collection is found to have caused substantial consumer confusion, it could result in significant damages awarded to Yuga Labs and potentially an injunction preventing further sales of the infringing NFTs. Conversely, if consumer confusion is not proven to the jury’s satisfaction, it might limit the financial implications for Ripps, even with the affirmation of Yuga Labs’ underlying trademark rights. Regardless of the trial’s final verdict on confusion, the Ninth Circuit’s foundational declaration that NFTs are “goods” under trademark law stands as a monumental precedent. This alone is a significant victory for the digital asset space, providing a crucial legal bedrock for NFT trademark protection . This legal clarity empowers creators and protects consumers, fostering a more secure and reputable environment for digital innovation. It underscores the increasing importance of intellectual property in the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem, reminding us that even in decentralized worlds, established laws have a vital role to play in ensuring fairness, preventing deception, and promoting responsible growth. The journey of Web3 is one of constant evolution, and landmark legal precedents like this one are vital signposts along the way. They help shape a future where creativity is rewarded, and innovation can thrive within a robust framework of clear rights and responsibilities, ensuring that the digital frontier isn’t just exciting, but also secure and equitable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About NFT Trademark Protection Q1: What does it mean for NFTs to be considered “goods” under trademark law? A1: This means NFTs are treated similarly to physical products when it comes to trademark infringement. Creators can now seek legal protection for their NFT brands, names, and logos, just like companies protect their physical products, against unauthorized use that could confuse consumers. Q2: How does this ruling affect NFT creators? A2: It provides NFT creators with stronger legal tools to protect their intellectual property. They can now more effectively pursue legal action against copycat projects, counterfeit NFTs, and unauthorized derivatives that infringe on their brand’s trademark. Q3: What is “consumer confusion” in the context of NFT trademarks? A3: Consumer confusion refers to whether an average buyer would likely be misled into believing that an infringing NFT collection is affiliated with, sponsored by, or originates from the legitimate trademark holder (e.g., Yuga Labs). This is a key element that must be proven for a trademark infringement claim to succeed. Q4: Does this ruling limit artistic freedom or “appropriation art” in the NFT space? A4: The ruling clarifies that while artistic expression is valued, it does not grant absolute immunity from trademark law, especially when commercial gain and potential consumer confusion are involved. Artists must ensure their works do not mislead consumers about the source or affiliation of their digital goods. Q5: What should NFT buyers do to protect themselves after this ruling? A5: Buyers should always verify the authenticity of NFT collections, research the creator’s reputation, and understand the IP rights associated with their purchase. This ruling helps, but due diligence remains crucial to avoid counterfeit or infringing NFTs. Q6: What’s next for the Yuga Labs vs. Ryder Ripps case? A6: The case will return to a lower court for a trial specifically focused on whether Ryder Ripps’ lookalike NFTs caused actual “consumer confusion.” The outcome of this trial will determine potential damages and further legal remedies.

An anonymous source from the NNSA said no classified or sensitive data appears to have been stolen in the NNSA breach. When asked about the breach, the NNSA directed all inquiries to the Department of Energy, which oversees the administration as part of its wider responsibilities. “On Friday, July 18th, the exploitation of a Microsoft SharePoint zero-day vulnerability began affecting the Department of Energy,” an agency spokesman said. “The department was minimally impacted due to its widespread use of the Microsoft M365 cloud and capable cybersecurity systems. A small number of systems were impacted. All impacted systems are being restored.” The NNSA carries out a wide range of duties beyond managing nuclear arms. It builds naval reactors for the Navy’s submarine fleet, responds to emergencies at home and abroad, helps transport nuclear weapons safely across the United States, and supports counterterrorism efforts. This was not the first time hackers had penetrated NNSA-linked networks via a third-party tool. In 2020, the agency was targeted in an attack on SolarWinds Corp., whose software is used for network management. At the time, the Energy Department said malware had “been isolated to business networks only.” Microsoft blamed state-sponsored hackers from China The breach exploited weaknesses in the SharePoint platform and hit governments and businesses worldwide. In some cases, attackers stole sign‑in info such as usernames and passwords along with tokens and hash codes, according to an earlier Bloomberg report. Beyond the Energy Department, this breach extended to systems in national governments across ME and EU, as well as to several U.S. agencies, including the Education Department, the Rhode Island General Assembly, and Florida’s Department of Revenue. Investigators say the full scope of the intrusion is still being determined. The software flaws affect organizations that run SharePoint locally rather than through Microsoft’s cloud service, leaving on-site installations particularly at risk. In a Tuesday blog post , Microsoft named two hacking teams linked to China. These include Violet Typhoon and Linen Typhoon. The post mentioned a third group called Storm-2603 using similar tactics to breach systems. On Monday, Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer at Mandiant, a Google‑owned cybersecurity firm, said in a LinkedIn post: “We assess that at least one of the actors responsible for the early exploitation is a China-nexus threat actor.” The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, confirmed on Sunday that it was “aware of active exploitation” of the SharePoint weakness. Microsoft responded by issuing patches for local versions of SharePoint, then released a third fix on Monday. SharePoint is a core part of Microsoft’s Office suite. It serves as a collaboration hub, letting employees inside organizations access shared files and documents through a central portal. Microsoft has been attacked by Chinese hacker teams in the past Last year, Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft Satya Nadella declared cybersecurity as the top priority for the company after a government report slammed the company’s response to a Chinese breach of email accounts belonging to officials. Earlier this month, Microsoft told customers it would no longer rely on Chinese engineers for cloud services provided to the Pentagon, following media reports that the setup could have allowed attacks on defense systems belonging to the US. In 2021, another group called Hafnium, linked to China, exploited a separate flaw in Microsoft’s Exchange Server software to break into networks at organizations worldwide. In a statement emailed to reporters, the Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing opposed “all forms of cyberattacks” and warned against “smearing others without solid evidence.” Security researchers first spotted the vulnerability in May during a hacking contest in Berlin organized by Trend Micro. The event offered cash prizes to those who could find undisclosed software bugs. The competition included a $100,000 award for zero-day exploits targeting SharePoint, highlighting how high‑stakes these hidden flaws can be. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The numbers, reported Wednesday and compiled by LSEG, show a shaky start for one, confident bets from another, and unexpected strength from the third. Together, they set the tone for the rest of the week, as investors dig through every line looking for direction. Tesla came in first, and the news wasn’t great. The company said its automotive revenue dropped 16% from the same period last year. Sales fell for the second quarter in a row, and again came in lower than Wall Street estimates. Adjusted earnings per share landed at 40 cents, just under the 43 cents analysts were expecting. Total revenue hit $22.50 billion, short of the $22.74 billion forecast. Tesla’s numbers weaken as political fallout hits sales Auto revenue for the second quarter came in at $16.7 billion, down from $19.9 billion a year earlier. Tesla also saw a sharp cut in revenue from selling auto regulatory credits, pulling in $439 million, compared to $890 million the year before. Earlier this month, the company had already reported a 14% decline in vehicle deliveries year-over-year, totaling 384,000 for Q2. Those deliveries aren’t clearly defined, but they’re the closest thing Tesla reports to electric vehicle sales. The company’s net income dropped to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents, last year. But the numbers are only part of the story. The company has been facing major backlash in both the U.S. and Europe. At the center of it is Elon Musk, who’s been heavily involved in politics this year. Musk donated large amounts to support President Donald Trump’s reelection, endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party, and then joined Trump’s administration to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). At DOGE, Musk helped eliminate USAID, slash parts of the federal workforce, and roll back major regulations. The response from consumers hasn’t been kind. In a note to shareholders, Tesla also said it had started “first builds” of a cheaper model in June, with plans to ramp up production in the second half of 2025. Alphabet beats revenue targets, raises AI investments Alphabet reported second-quarter results that topped Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the quarter reached $96.43 billion, beating the $94 billion analysts were looking for. Adjusted earnings came in at $2.31 per share, compared to the $2.18 forecast. Its major business lines all delivered higher numbers. YouTube ads brought in $9.8 billion, above the $9.56 billion estimate. Google Cloud posted $13.62 billion, beating the expected $13.11 billion. Traffic acquisition costs hit $14.71 billion, slightly above the $14.18 billion prediction. Overall revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, better than the 10.9% Wall Street expected. But the big headline came from the company’s capital spending plans. In February, Alphabet had said it would invest $75 billion in 2025 to grow its AI efforts — already way above the $58.84 billion analysts had in mind. On Wednesday, that number was bumped up again to $85 billion. The company said the increase was due to “strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services.” Alphabet’s search division brought in $54.19 billion for the quarter. Its ad revenue climbed to $71.34 billion, up 10.4% from last year’s $64.61 billion. After the report, Alphabet shares edged slightly higher in after-hours trading. IBM tops estimates but slips in after-hours trading IBM wrapped up the tech trio, reporting stronger-than-expected earnings but still watching its stock slide 5% in extended trading. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.80, beating the $2.64 Wall Street was expecting. Revenue hit $16.98 billion, topping the $16.59 billion estimate. That figure was nearly 8% higher than the same quarter last year. In Q1, IBM’s revenue growth was below 1%, so this marks a sharp turnaround. Net income rose to $2.19 billion, or $2.31 per share, compared to $1.83 billion, or $1.96 per share, last year. The software division posted $7.39 billion in revenue, just below the $7.43 billion estimate. Hybrid cloud services — including Red Hat — grew by 16%. Gross margin in the software unit was 83.9%, only slightly under the 84% Wall Street was looking for. Revenue from consulting came in at $5.31 billion, beating the expected $5.16 billion. Infrastructure services pulled in $4.14 billion, above the $3.75 billion estimate, a 14% increase from a year ago. During the quarter, IBM also launched the z17 mainframe and announced the acquisition of Hakkoda, a consulting firm focused on data and artificial intelligence. In terms of outlook, the company reaffirmed its plan to generate over $13.5 billion in free cash flow in 2025, sticking close to projections it made in April. It still expects at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency. As of the close on Wednesday, IBM shares had gained 28% so far in 2025, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 8% gain in the same time frame.

For thousands of individuals and institutions impacted by the devastating collapse of FTX, a significant milestone is on the horizon. The FTX Recovery Trust, the dedicated entity managing the remnants of the once-mighty crypto exchange, has officially designated August 15 as the record date for its next substantial FTX creditor distribution . This news, initially reported by Unfolded on X, marks a pivotal moment in the long and arduous journey toward recompense for those who lost their assets. Understanding the Catastrophe: The Fall of FTX To truly grasp the importance of this upcoming FTX creditor distribution , it’s essential to revisit the events that led us here. FTX, once a titan in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, collapsed spectacularly in November 2022. What began as liquidity concerns quickly spiraled into a full-blown bankruptcy, revealing a staggering mismanagement of customer funds, alleged fraud, and a complex web of financial irregularities. The fallout was immediate and far-reaching, impacting millions of users globally and sending shockwaves through the entire crypto market. The collapse wasn’t just a financial disaster; it was a profound breach of trust. Users who had placed their faith and their digital assets with FTX found themselves in an unprecedented situation, with their funds frozen and their financial futures uncertain. The subsequent legal proceedings, investigations, and the appointment of new leadership to oversee the bankruptcy process have been complex and drawn-out. The FTX Recovery Trust: Pioneering the Path to Repayment In the wake of the collapse, the primary objective became clear: recover as much as possible for the defrauded creditors. This monumental task fell largely to the FTX Recovery Trust. This entity has been diligently working to: Identify and Secure Assets: Tracing and securing various assets, including cryptocurrencies, real estate, and other investments, often hidden or commingled. Navigate Legal Complexities: Engaging in numerous legal battles, negotiations, and settlements to maximize the recovery pool. Establish a Fair Distribution Framework: Developing a transparent and equitable process for distributing recovered funds to a vast number of creditors with diverse claims. The establishment of August 15 as a record date signifies a critical step forward in this intricate process, indicating that the Trust has made sufficient progress to begin another round of repayments. What Exactly is a ‘Record Date’ and Why Does it Matter for FTX Creditor Distribution? For many, the term ‘record date’ might seem like legal jargon. However, in the context of bankruptcy and creditor distributions, it holds immense significance. The record date, in this case August 15, is the specific cutoff date used to determine which creditors are eligible to receive the upcoming distribution. Here’s a breakdown of its importance: Eligibility Confirmation: Only creditors whose claims are recognized and recorded by this date will be included in the current distribution round. Snapshot of Claims: It provides a definitive snapshot of the creditor base at a particular point in time, streamlining the administrative process for payment. Prevents Future Complications: It helps to manage changes in creditor ownership or claim status that might occur after the date, ensuring a clear and organized payout. Creditors should ensure their claim information is accurate and up-to-date with the FTX Recovery Trust well before this date to avoid any delays or issues with receiving their entitled share of the FTX creditor distribution . The Long Road Traveled: Previous Recovery Efforts and Remaining Challenges The journey to this point has been anything but smooth. Since the initial bankruptcy filing, the FTX estate has made considerable strides in asset recovery. Reports indicate billions of dollars in assets have been identified and secured, far exceeding initial pessimistic forecasts. This success is largely due to the diligent work of the new management team and legal experts. However, significant challenges persist: Valuation Volatility: A substantial portion of recovered assets are cryptocurrencies, whose values can fluctuate wildly, impacting the final payout amounts. Legal Disputes: Ongoing legal battles with various parties, including former FTX executives and other entities, continue to tie up funds and resources. Administrative Hurdles: Managing and verifying claims from millions of creditors worldwide is an enormous logistical undertaking. Despite these hurdles, the setting of the August 15 record date is a strong indicator of the Trust’s confidence in its ability to proceed with further distributions, offering a glimmer of hope to those who have waited patiently. What Does This Latest Development Mean for FTX Creditors? For those directly impacted by the FTX collapse, this announcement is undoubtedly a source of both relief and continued anxiety. While it signals progress, the full extent of recovery remains to be seen. Here are some actionable insights for creditors: Verify Your Claim Status: It is paramount to regularly check the official FTX bankruptcy portal or communicate with your legal representatives to ensure your claim is properly filed and acknowledged. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from the FTX Recovery Trust and reputable news sources. Be wary of unofficial channels or scams. Prepare for Distribution: Understand the mechanisms through which distributions will be made (e.g., direct bank transfer, crypto transfer) and ensure your details are current. The August 15 record date is not the payment date itself, but a crucial step towards it. Creditors should anticipate further communications regarding the actual payout schedule following this date. Broader Implications: Trust and Transparency in Crypto The FTX saga has had a profound impact on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It highlighted the critical need for greater transparency, robust regulatory frameworks, and stringent internal controls within crypto exchanges. Every step taken by the FTX Recovery Trust, including this upcoming FTX creditor distribution , is watched closely by regulators, investors, and the industry at large. A successful and equitable distribution process for FTX creditors could help restore some of the lost trust in the digital asset space. It demonstrates that even in the face of catastrophic failure, mechanisms for recovery and justice can eventually prevail, reinforcing the importance of due diligence and secure practices for all participants in the crypto economy. Navigating the Future of FTX Recovery: What Comes Next? While the August 15 record date is a significant marker, it’s important to remember that the FTX recovery process is likely to continue for some time. Future distributions may occur as more assets are recovered and legal disputes are resolved. The Trust will continue its work, and creditors should remain vigilant for further updates. This ongoing process serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in nascent financial markets and the vital role of robust legal and recovery frameworks when things go awry. The hope is that the lessons learned from FTX will contribute to a more secure and trustworthy future for the entire crypto industry. In conclusion, the setting of August 15 as the record date for the next FTX creditor distribution is a beacon of progress in a challenging landscape. While the journey for creditors has been long and arduous, this development signifies tangible movement towards resolution and repayment. It underscores the painstaking efforts of the FTX Recovery Trust and offers a renewed sense of hope for those awaiting the return of their assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

The altcoin market accounted for the lion’s share of the $563 million in long liquidations during the past 24 hours. According to market aggregate data from Coinglass, the ETH and XRP trading pairs recorded net liquidations of about $126 million and $69 million respectively. Bitcoin (BTC) on the other hand recorded a net liquidation of around $54 million. Major Reasons Why Crypto Dropped Today The 2025 altcoin bull market officially kicked off after the Ethereum price outpaced Bitcoin, leading to a reversal in the BTC dominance. The rising calls for altseason 2025 attracted more FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) traders, thus leading to overheated futures. According to market data analysis from CryptoQuant , an overheated futures market amid weak prices often leads to a distribution phase. Additionally, market data analysis from Santiment shows the social volume and dominance for altseason 2025 surged to yearly peaks after Ether price approached $4k. Historically, an increase in social dominance of ATH often precedes a market correction. The heavy liquidation of long traders has also triggered panic selling, thus increasing the odds of a long squeeze. What Next? The crypto market has gained bullish momentum fueled by clear regulatory frameworks in the United States amid renewed demand from institutional investors. The rising global money supply will further boost the crypto bull market in the coming months. As a result, the wider crypto market is likely to be trapped in a short-term consolidation before a parabolic rally before the end of 2025.

Recently, the crypto world witnessed a stark reminder of this volatility, as a staggering $126 million worth of crypto futures were liquidated in just one hour , pushing the total liquidations over the past 24 hours to a shocking $727 million . This massive crypto futures liquidation event sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, leaving many traders stunned and prompting crucial questions about market stability and risk management. For anyone involved in or considering entering the crypto space, understanding the mechanics and implications of such events, particularly crypto futures liquidation , is paramount. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? To grasp the magnitude of recent events, it’s essential to understand what crypto futures liquidation entails. In simple terms, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to a lack of sufficient margin to cover potential losses. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. They often involve leverage, meaning you can trade with more capital than you actually possess, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Here’s a breakdown of the core components: Leverage: This is a double-edged sword. It allows traders to open larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, a $100 investment can control a $1,000 position. Margin: This is the collateral (your actual funds) deposited with the exchange to cover potential losses. It acts as a buffer. Margin Call: If the market moves against a leveraged position, the value of the collateral decreases. If it falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange issues a margin call, requesting additional funds. Forced Closure (Liquidation): If the trader fails to add more funds to meet the margin requirements, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. This is the crypto futures liquidation . The recent figures highlight just how quickly and forcefully these mechanisms can kick in, leading to significant capital evaporation for those caught on the wrong side of the market. Analyzing the Shocking Numbers: Who Was Hit Hardest by Crypto Futures Liquidation? The reported $727 million in crypto futures liquidation over 24 hours, with a concentrated $126 million within a single hour, indicates a sharp market movement that caught many leveraged traders off guard. While specific breakdowns by exchange and asset can vary, such large-scale liquidations typically occur during periods of extreme price volatility, often triggered by significant news, macroeconomic shifts, or large institutional trades. Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures tend to account for the largest share of liquidations due to their high trading volumes and open interest. However, altcoins can also experience disproportionately large liquidations if they undergo sudden, steep price corrections. Consider the typical breakdown during such events (hypothetical representation based on common market behavior): Asset 24H Liquidations (Approx.) Primary Direction (Long/Short) Bitcoin (BTC) $350 million Long Ethereum (ETH) $200 million Long Solana (SOL) $50 million Long Other Altcoins $127 million Mixed This table illustrates how a significant downturn can disproportionately impact ‘long’ positions (bets that the price will go up), leading to widespread crypto futures liquidation as prices fall. What Triggers These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Events? Large-scale crypto futures liquidation events are rarely isolated incidents. They are typically the culmination of several factors converging to create a perfect storm in the market. Understanding these triggers is crucial for predicting and potentially avoiding being caught in such a squeeze. Key triggers include: Sudden Price Drops: The most common catalyst. A sharp, unexpected decline in the price of a major cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) can rapidly push many leveraged long positions below their liquidation thresholds. High Leverage Ratios: When traders use extremely high leverage (e.g., 50x or 100x), even minor price fluctuations can lead to a margin call or immediate liquidation. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out a position. Cascading Liquidations: This is a vicious cycle. As initial liquidations occur, the forced selling by exchanges adds further selling pressure to the market, driving prices down even more. This, in turn, triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect that can accelerate a market downturn. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news, interest rate changes, inflation data, or geopolitical events can impact traditional financial markets, and these sentiments often spill over into the highly interconnected crypto market. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter cryptocurrency regulations in major jurisdictions can create panic and lead to sell-offs, triggering liquidations. Large Whale Movements: Significant buy or sell orders from large institutional players or ‘whales’ can move the market enough to trigger a wave of liquidations for smaller, leveraged traders. The recent crypto futures liquidation likely stemmed from a combination of these factors, demonstrating the intricate web of influences in the crypto ecosystem. How Does Crypto Futures Liquidation Impact the Broader Market and Trader Confidence? Beyond the immediate financial losses for individual traders, large-scale crypto futures liquidation events have broader implications for the entire market and the collective psyche of investors. Increased Volatility: The forced selling from liquidations can exacerbate price swings, making the market even more unpredictable and challenging to navigate for all participants, not just those using leverage. Erosion of Confidence: Repeated or massive liquidation events can erode investor confidence, especially among newer participants. It highlights the inherent risks of the crypto market and can lead to a more cautious or even fearful sentiment. Reduced Open Interest: After a major liquidation cascade, the total open interest (the number of outstanding futures contracts) typically drops significantly as positions are closed. This can indicate a cooling off period in speculative trading. Market Correction or Reversal: While painful, liquidations can sometimes act as a ‘reset’ for the market, flushing out excessive leverage and creating healthier conditions for a potential rebound. However, they can also signal the start of a deeper correction. Understanding these impacts is vital for any trader or investor aiming to build a sustainable presence in the crypto space. Navigating the Volatility: Smart Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risk Given the inherent risks, how can traders protect themselves from the brutal force of crypto futures liquidation ? While no strategy guarantees immunity in a volatile market, several best practices can significantly reduce your exposure. Avoid Excessive Leverage: This is perhaps the most crucial advice. While high leverage offers tempting returns, it dramatically increases your liquidation risk. Start with lower leverage ratios (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain substantial experience. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predetermined point. This limits your potential losses and prevents total liquidation. Manage Position Sizing: Never allocate a large portion of your portfolio to a single highly leveraged trade. Diversify your positions and only risk a small percentage of your total capital on any given trade. Maintain Sufficient Margin: Always keep more margin than the minimum required. This provides a buffer against sudden market movements and gives you time to react to margin calls before liquidation occurs. Stay Informed and Analyze the Market: Keep abreast of market news, technical indicators, and fundamental developments. Understanding the broader market sentiment can help you anticipate potential volatility. Consider Hedging Strategies: Advanced traders might use hedging techniques, such as taking an opposing spot position, to offset potential losses in their futures trades. Practice on Demo Accounts: Before risking real capital, practice trading futures on demo accounts offered by exchanges. This allows you to understand the mechanics without financial risk. The key takeaway is that responsible trading, particularly with leveraged products like futures, requires discipline, continuous learning, and a robust risk management framework. The recent crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of these necessities. The Broader Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Futures Trading While the threat of crypto futures liquidation is real and often dramatic, futures trading itself is a legitimate and powerful tool within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It offers opportunities for: Hedging: Traders can use futures to hedge against price fluctuations in their spot holdings. Price Discovery: Futures markets often lead spot markets in price discovery, reflecting collective expectations about future prices. Arbitrage: Discrepancies between spot and futures prices can create arbitrage opportunities for sophisticated traders. However, these opportunities come with significant challenges: High Volatility: The crypto market is inherently more volatile than traditional markets, amplifying futures trading risks. Complexity: Futures trading involves complex concepts like funding rates, open interest, and various order types that require deep understanding. Emotional Trading: The rapid price swings can lead to emotional decisions, often resulting in poor outcomes. The recent $727 million crypto futures liquidation underscores the need for a balanced perspective: acknowledge the potential, but respect the risks. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Crypto Futures Liquidation The recent staggering figures of crypto futures liquidation – with $126 million in just an hour and $727 million over 24 hours – serve as a potent warning and a crucial learning experience for everyone in the crypto space. These events are not just numbers; they represent significant capital shifts and illustrate the raw power of market dynamics, especially when leverage is involved. While the allure of amplified gains through futures trading is undeniable, the potential for swift and complete liquidation is an ever-present reality. Successful navigation of the crypto futures market demands more than just an understanding of price charts; it requires a deep respect for risk management, a commitment to continuous learning, and the discipline to adhere to a well-defined trading strategy. By prioritizing capital preservation, utilizing risk-mitigation tools like stop-loss orders, and avoiding excessive leverage, traders can better withstand the inevitable market storms. The crypto market will always have its volatile moments, but informed and disciplined participation can turn potential pitfalls into valuable lessons for long-term growth and resilience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange when a trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a required level due to adverse price movements, preventing further losses. Why do large crypto futures liquidation events happen? Large liquidations are typically triggered by sudden, significant price movements (often downwards for long positions), high leverage ratios used by traders, and a cascading effect where initial liquidations further depress prices, leading to more liquidations. How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidation risks? Key strategies include avoiding excessive leverage, always using stop-loss orders, managing position sizes wisely, maintaining sufficient margin, and staying informed about market conditions. Responsible risk management is paramount. Does a large crypto futures liquidation always mean the market will crash further? Not necessarily. While large liquidations indicate significant selling pressure and can lead to further price drops, they can also ‘flush out’ excessive leverage, potentially setting the stage for a market rebound or stabilization after the initial shock. Which cryptocurrencies are most affected by futures liquidations? Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures typically see the largest liquidation volumes due to their high trading volume and open interest. However, any highly leveraged altcoin can experience severe liquidations during sharp price movements. Did you find this article insightful?

The blockchain data tracking firm, Arkham Intelligence, has compiled data showing the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings across several agencies to clarify the confusion around the rumors that the U.S. government had depleted its Bitcoin reserves. The U.S. government still holds over 198,000 BTC, Arkham says Public records released by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sparked a wave of confusion and alarm over the size of the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings. The document, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and dated July 15, states that the USMS currently holds 28,988.356 BTC, valued at approximately $3.44B. However, the blockchain intelligence firm, Arkham, has clarified that the U.S. government still holds at least 198,000 BTC, worth roughly $23.5B, across multiple agencies and wallets. The company also asserted that none of the funds have moved in the past four months. U.S. government crypto holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis responded on X to the initial claim of dwindling reserves with concern. “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race,” she wrote . I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race. https://t.co/ciYf1uhy0x — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) July 16, 2025 But according to Arkham, the FOIA request only accounted for holdings by the US Marshals Service, which traditionally manages seized assets and conducts public auctions. Other agencies like the FBI, IRS, DEA, and Department of Justice also seize Bitcoin but do not regularly disclose their crypto balances, making centralized tracking nearly impossible. Arkham has identified at least 198,012 BTC under government control, spread across several high-profile criminal cases. The largest share of the reserve, totaling 114,599 BTC, which is worth about $13.65B was seized from Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, or “Razzlekhan,” in connection with the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Another major holding includes 94,643 BTC seized in two separate Silk Road-related cases. 51,680 BTC from James Zhong, who stole funds from the Silk Road marketplace, and 69,370 BTC previously seized from ‘Individual X,’ believed to have hacked Silk Road. Additional seizures include $81.25M in BTC from Alameda Research’s Binance accounts after the FTX collapse and $79.49M in BTC from HashFlare scammers Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin. Comprehensive data is limited The FOIA request, which was filed by independent journalist, “L0la L33tz” specifically asked the USMS for “the amount of Bitcoin held by the U.S. Marshals Service.” In return, she received a detailed spreadsheet , case breakdowns, and a total of 28,988.35643016 BTC as of July 15, 2025. The letter, sent by the Office of General Counsel, confirmed the data came from the Asset Forfeiture Division, though some lines were redacted for legal reasons. The ensuing controversy shows that the lack of a centralized database for all U.S. government BTC holdings is a critical barrier to transparency. For years, analysts have estimated the total government stash to hover around 200,000 BTC, but this number has been difficult to verify given the involvement of multiple law enforcement and regulatory bodies with differing reporting practices. L33tz has already filed a second FOIA request to determine whether the government’s holdings are being managed through Coinbase Prime, a platform often used to liquidate seized assets. Arkham’s data supports that Coinbase has been the venue for recent U.S. government BTC sales, including the sale of 9,861 BTC from James Zhong in March of 2023, totaling about $215M. In August 2024, the U.S. government sold 10,000 BTC from James Zhong, which is equivalent to $593.9M. Another 10,000 BTC, approximately $968.6M from James Zhong, was sold in December of 2024. 58.7 BTC from Ryan Farace was sold in July 2024. Despite these sales, Arkham insists that the U.S. government retains significant Bitcoin reserves. For instance, the Bitfinex and Silk Road cases alone account for over 150,000 BTC. However, until more agencies provide official disclosures, the exact total may remain contested.

The cryptocurrency has gone up by more than 60% since the start of the month, rising from $0.6942 to a high of $1.169 on July 21. This rally was fueled by strong investor interest, significant institutional partnerships, and a new Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) filing by 21Shares, a global investment company. ONDO ETF Filing Increases Market Interest The price of ONDO jumped higher after 21Shares filed with U.S. regulators to create a spot ETF for the token. This kind of ETF would make it easier for more people, including large investors, to invest in ONDO. At the time of writing, ONDO’s price has dropped by 3.31% and is now trading at $1.02, according to CoinMarketCap data. This drop brought the token’s market value down from $3.7 billion to $3.2 billion. Still, trading activity remains strong, indicating that many investors remain interested. Over the last 24 hours, more than $448 million worth of ONDO has been traded. This high volume shows that the token is still attracting attention, even after the recent price drop. The ETF filing could lead to more demand from institutions. Market Charts Show Possible Uptrend Even with the recent price drop, ONDO’s price chart still looks strong . The price has moved above key moving averages (EMAs), indicating continued upward momentum. Experts say ONDO is in a double accumulation phase. This means buyers are slowly building positions. If this trend continues, ONDO could rise above $2. Financial analyst Kren believes the long-term price could go even higher. He states that the U.S. Treasury market is valued at approximately $27 trillion. If ONDO captures just 0.1% of that, its price could reach $6.75. Right now, ONDO faces resistance at $1.1732, which was the high point in July. However, if it holds support above a specific resistance level, the price may rise again. If it fails, the price may drop to the $0.80–$0.90 range. Ondo Finance Builds Strong Partnerships Ondo Finance is a layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain explicitly created for institutions. Its goal is to make real-world assets (RWAs) easily tradable on-chain . Over the past few months, Ondo has built a robust network of institutional partners. In February, the company announced partnerships with industry giants. This includes Franklin Templeton, Google Cloud, WisdomTree, McKinsey, BlackRock, PayPal, and Morgan Stanley. These firms helped launch the Ondo Finance Chain, a dedicated protocol for tokenizing real-world assets. Just last week, Ondo partnered with Binance’s BNB Chain to bring tokenized 100 U.S. stocks and ETFs onto its blockchain. This move could bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Earlier this year, Ondo also joined Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network. This helps the company grow its reach in the space of tokenized real-world assets .

The firm just launched a $40 billion buyback program, lighting a fuse under its shares, which jumped 1% in late New York trading on Wednesday. The board gave the green light for the new plan to start right after August 1, once the current repurchase scheme wraps up. That older one, set at $25 billion last year, had $9.1 billion left in capacity by the end of June. This new move scraps that old plan and goes bigger. The company said the buyback gives them “additional capital return flexibility.” Translation? They’ve got more cash than they need and are pumping it back into their stock. The official line: it’s about balancing support for economic growth, future investments, and shareholder returns without losing financial strength. Sounds nice on paper, but the real story is they’re piling money into shares while still sitting on solid earnings. Bank of America falls short on revenue but beats profit forecast Alongside the buyback announcement, Bank of America reported its second quarter earnings. It was a mixed bag. The bank posted 89 cents per share, beating the 86 cents expected by analysts at LSEG. But the total revenue of $26.61 billion missed the $26.72 billion that was forecast. The miss was mostly thanks to net interest income (NII), which came in at $14.82 billion, about $70 million short of what StreetAccount had projected. NII is what the bank earns from loans and investments minus what it pays depositors. It still rose 7% year-over-year, but lower interest rates took a bite out of what could’ve been stronger growth. Despite that, the bank still grew its profit to $7.12 billion, which was up 3% from the same period last year. CEO Brian Moynihan tried to steer attention toward longer-term trends. “Consumers remained resilient, with healthy spending and asset quality, and commercial borrower utilization rates rose,” he said. According to him, NII has now risen for four straight quarters, thanks to stronger deposit inflows and loan expansion. Basically, the core business is humming even if some numbers disappointed Wall Street. Trading beats fixed income targets while banking fees decline Even with revenue falling short, some divisions pulled their weight. Fixed income trading pulled in $3.25 billion, beating the $3.14 billion estimate. Equities trading, on the other hand, landed at $2.13 billion, which was just below projections. Over in investment banking, things looked weaker. Fees dropped 9% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. That said, it still came in above the $1.27 billion StreetAccount forecast, so it’s not a complete flop. Still, that 9% dip shows the headwinds banks are facing in the dealmaking space this year. All this is happening while Bank of America stock has already climbed about 10% in 2025 so far. This buyback adds more fuel. The company isn’t alone either. Other major players are doing the same. JPMorgan Chase approved a massive $50 billion repurchase, and Morgan Stanley reauthorized its multiyear plan worth up to $20 billion. All of them passed the Federal Reserve’s stress test recently, so now they’re flaunting their capital positions.

Among these, the projection of the Stablecoin Market reaching a staggering $2 trillion by 2028 has certainly captured attention. Stablecoins, with their promise of bridging traditional finance and the volatile crypto space, seem poised for a massive expansion. But what if one of the world’s most influential financial institutions sees things differently? Why is JPMorgan Doubting the $2 Trillion Stablecoin Market Forecast? In a recent report, as highlighted by Bloomberg via Wu Blockchain on X, banking giant JPMorgan has cast a shadow of doubt over the optimistic $2 trillion Stablecoin Market projection for 2028. While many in the crypto community envision a rapid ascent, JPMorgan’s analysts suggest a more conservative trajectory. They anticipate the market to merely double or triple from its current size, which stands at approximately $260 billion. Current Valuation: The Stablecoin Market is currently valued around $260 billion. JPMorgan’s Expectation: The bank foresees this valuation growing to between $520 billion and $780 billion by 2028. The Discrepancy: This outlook is significantly lower than the widely cited $2 trillion forecast. This stark difference in perspective from a major financial player like JPMorgan prompts us to delve deeper into their reasoning. What factors are they considering that might be overlooked by more bullish proponents? What Infrastructure Gaps Are Limiting Stablecoin Market Growth? JPMorgan’s primary concern revolves around the underdeveloped infrastructure necessary to support such massive growth in the Stablecoin Market . While stablecoins themselves have matured, the broader ecosystem around them still faces significant hurdles. Think of it like building a highway: you might have great cars (stablecoins), but if the roads are unpaved, bridges are missing, and traffic laws are unclear, you can’t achieve high-speed, high-volume travel. The ‘underdeveloped infrastructure’ refers to several critical areas: Regulatory Clarity: The lack of a harmonized global regulatory framework for stablecoins creates uncertainty for institutional adoption and widespread use. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches, leading to fragmentation and potential compliance nightmares. Interoperability: While stablecoins exist on various blockchains, seamless interoperability between these networks is still a work in progress. For stablecoins to truly facilitate global payments, they need to move effortlessly across different chains and traditional financial systems. Scalability Challenges: Some existing blockchain infrastructures may struggle to handle the transaction volume required for a multi-trillion-dollar Stablecoin Market . Solutions like Layer-2 networks are emerging, but their widespread adoption and proven reliability are still developing. On-Ramps and Off-Ramps: The ease with which users can convert fiat currency into stablecoins and vice versa, especially for large institutional sums, remains a bottleneck. Efficient and cost-effective banking partnerships are crucial. Consumer Protection and Education: For stablecoins to become truly mainstream, there needs to be greater public understanding, robust consumer protection mechanisms, and clear pathways for dispute resolution. These foundational elements are crucial for stablecoins to transition from niche crypto assets to widely accepted digital currencies that can truly compete with traditional payment systems. How Does This Outlook Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? The health and growth of the Stablecoin Market are intrinsically linked to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Stablecoins are the lifeblood of decentralized finance (DeFi), providing stability for trading, lending, and borrowing. They also play a significant role in cross-border payments and remittances. If JPMorgan’s more conservative outlook proves accurate, it could have several implications: Slower DeFi Growth: A constrained Stablecoin Market might mean slower expansion for DeFi protocols that rely heavily on stablecoin liquidity. Delayed Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions and corporations require regulatory certainty and robust infrastructure before committing significant capital to stablecoin-based solutions. JPMorgan’s view suggests these prerequisites are not yet fully met. Focus on Infrastructure Development: The skepticism could, paradoxically, accelerate efforts to address the very infrastructure gaps JPMorgan highlights. This might lead to more investment in scalability solutions, regulatory advocacy, and interoperability projects. Increased Scrutiny: The more conservative forecast might lead to increased scrutiny from regulators and investors regarding the true potential and risks associated with stablecoins. It’s important to remember that such forecasts are not definitive. They serve as a critical lens through which to view potential challenges and opportunities, guiding strategic decisions for all participants in the crypto space. What’s Needed for the Stablecoin Market to Reach Its Full Potential? While JPMorgan’s outlook is a dose of realism, it doesn’t negate the immense potential of stablecoins. For the Stablecoin Market to move beyond its current trajectory and perhaps even approach the ambitious $2 trillion mark, several key developments are essential: Global Regulatory Harmony: A unified or at least highly coordinated global regulatory approach would unlock massive institutional capital and enable stablecoins to operate across borders without significant legal friction. Technological Advancements: Continued innovation in blockchain scalability (e.g., Layer-2 solutions, sharding) and cross-chain interoperability is vital to handle the volume and speed required for mainstream financial transactions. Robust Payment Rails: Integration with existing financial infrastructure, including traditional banking systems and payment networks, is crucial for seamless on-ramps and off-ramps, making stablecoins accessible to a wider audience. Stronger Audit and Transparency Standards: To build trust, especially with institutions, stablecoin issuers must adhere to rigorous audit standards and provide transparent attestations of their reserves. Educational Initiatives: Educating the public and traditional financial players about the benefits, risks, and proper use of stablecoins will be key to fostering adoption. The journey to a multi-trillion-dollar Stablecoin Market is not just about increasing demand; it’s fundamentally about building the foundational layers that can support such an expansive financial ecosystem. Navigating the Future: Insights for Investors and Users in the Stablecoin Market For individuals and institutions involved in or considering the Stablecoin Market , JPMorgan’s analysis offers valuable insights. It’s a reminder to temper exuberance with a healthy dose of realism and to understand the underlying challenges that need to be addressed for sustained growth. Diversify and Research: Don’t put all your eggs in one stablecoin basket. Research the backing, transparency, and regulatory compliance of different stablecoins. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep an eye on global regulatory developments, as these will significantly shape the future of stablecoins. Understand the Technology: A basic understanding of the blockchain technology underpinning stablecoins can help in evaluating their long-term viability and security. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is low for stablecoins themselves, the growth of the overall market is a long-term play that depends on fundamental infrastructure improvements. The path forward for the Stablecoin Market is one of evolution and adaptation. While the $2 trillion dream may seem distant according to JPMorgan, it also highlights the immense opportunity for innovation and development within the space. Conclusion: A Realistic Path for the Stablecoin Market JPMorgan’s cautious outlook on the $2 trillion Stablecoin Market projection serves as a crucial reality check for the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores that while the potential of stablecoins is undeniable, their widespread adoption and massive scale hinge on significant advancements in regulatory clarity, technological infrastructure, and seamless integration with traditional finance. The journey from $260 billion to potentially $2 trillion is not just a matter of increasing demand, but a complex undertaking requiring robust foundations. This perspective encourages a more grounded approach, focusing on building sustainable and secure systems rather than solely chasing ambitious targets. The future of the Stablecoin Market will undoubtedly be shaped by how effectively these challenges are addressed, paving the way for a more integrated and mature digital financial landscape.

33767162,[object Object],1753308006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Evolution: From A Tech Asset To Digital Gold Standard – Anthony Scaramucci,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-evolves-to-digital-gold/,"Institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin , the largest digital currency, has risen to a remarkable level as the asset gains mainstream recognition in the financial sector. What was once the domain of early adopters and tech-savvy investors is now being embraced by corporate giants, who consider the crypto king the virtual version of Gold. A Shift In Bitcoin Toward A Gold-Like Stability Over the years, Bitcoin has witnessed significant growth in terms of price and on-chain activity, prompting many to compare the digital asset to Gold, the largest asset in the world. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital, recently weighed in on the growing discussion, offering his insights on the evolution of BTC. In an interview on Bloomberg, Anthony Scaramucci explained that Bitcoin is in an evolutionary phase as major publicly traded companies take significant steps to acquire the top cryptocurrency. According to the founder, BTC is experiencing a pivotal transition, moving from its initial status as a speculative tech asset to its growing recognition as digital gold. The founder’s remark highlights the current state of Bitcoin in the financial landscape, where institutional investors, wealth managers, and sovereign funds are adopting the asset to address inflation, currency debasement, and geopolitical instability. While addressing how BTC could fully claim the digital gold status, Scaramucci stated that wallet expansion is the main factor that would solidify this notion. Currently, the Bitcoin network boasts roughly 300 million wallet addresses , but the founder believes that the number could expand over time. However, with 1 billion wallet addresses, BTC’s volatile nature is expected to decrease sharply, drawing attention to notable assets like Microsoft and Google over the years. Such a scenario for the crypto king is likely to cement its position as a reliable store of value and a hedge against inflation. As a result, BTC will attract more retailers, institutional investors, and long-term holders , which will persistently dampen volatility over time. Is BTC An Asset Class Or An Investment? In the interview, the founder also made a bold prediction on Bitcoin’s market cap , which is expected to rise to unprecedented levels as its user base and holders grow. Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin market cap might experience a massive pump, possibly matching that of Gold. Big institutions and high-net-worth players may be steadily acquiring BTC, thereby bolstering its market value. However, Scaramucci contends that Bitcoin’s market cap growth will likely be determined by whether it is seen as an investment or an asset class. If considered an investment, the founder has called a $1 trillion to $3 trillion value an ideal market cap for BTC. However, when classified as an asset class, its market cap could soar to that of Gold, which is currently valued at around $23 trillion.",Bitcoin News|Anthony Scaramucci|bitcoin|bitcoin market cap|Bitcoin Network|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|gold|Google|microsoft|SkyBridge Capital,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-23 22:00:06
48815520,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/capital-is-shifting-away-from-bitcoin-into-these-3-altcoins,1753308009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/48815520.jpeg,Capital Is Shifting Away from Bitcoin Into These 3 Altcoins,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/capital-is-shifting-away-from-bitcoin-into-these-3-altcoins,"A notable trend is emerging in the crypto market. Investors are beginning to divert their funds from Bitcoin, turning their attention to several promising altcoins. This shift indicates potential growth opportunities for these lesser-known digital currencies. The article reveals which three altcoins are capturing this interest and why they might be poised for significant gains. Ethereum Sees Strong Price Movement Amid Key Resistance Levels Ethereum showed strong performance with a 68.57% rise over the past month and a steady 12.45% gain over the past six months. A notable one-week increase of 19.60% highlights short-term strength. Price action during these periods demonstrated rapid upward moves, drawing attention from traders who watched the coin’s impressive short-term surge against a more moderate longer-term climb. Current trading ranges show Ethereum moving between approximately $2110 and $2870. Immediate resistance is present at $3254, while solid support rests at $1735, with an additional resistance barrier near $4014 and lower support around $975. The high relative strength index of 86.22 suggests that the coin is overbought, yet moving averages lean positive. Bulls appear active within the current range, but caution is warranted given the mixed signals. Traders might consider buying near support and planning exits at resistance levels, ensuring stops are set slightly below key supports to protect positions. Upbeat Momentum as Solana Eyes Bullish Moves Recent SOL performance shows a strong rebound over the past month with a 53.28% increase, while the half-year figures reveal a 20.23% decline. Price swings have been evident, ranging from lows at $131 to highs around $173. This period has seen significant short-term strength offset by a longer-term downturn, marking a period of adjustment. The one-week surge of 23.10% highlights renewed interest, while the longer timeline reminds traders of underlying volatility and sensitivity to market shifts. Current trading levels are defined by a support near $107.89 and resistance at $191.79, with an extended resistance at $233.74 and a second support at $65.94. The price remains within a confined range where bulls are trying to exert control, hinting at cautious optimism among traders. Momentum and oscillators display mixed signals with a high RSI of 77.64, suggesting short-term overbought conditions despite upward movement. Prices near $173 suggest a testing of resistance, and trading within these key levels can offer opportunities if buyers sustain pressure in a rally. XRP Price Surge and Key Trading Zones During the last month, XRP surged 73.58% with a weekly gain of 19.98%, while over the past six months the coin posted a more modest increase of 12.34%. These figures highlight a rapid climb in the short term, contrasting with steadier growth in the medium term. Recent momentum suggests an active trading environment fueled by investor optimism, indicating a response to market fluctuations. Currently, XRP trades between $1.99 and $2.41, with resistance at $2.59 and a tougher barrier at $3.02. Immediate support appears at $1.73, with a deeper floor at $1.30. Technical indicators show an Awesome Oscillator reading of 0.91 and a Momentum Indicator at 0.67, reinforcing the recent upward movement. A Relative Strength Index of 81.47 indicates potential overbought conditions. Traders may seek to buy from $1.73 towards $2.59 or short near resistance, as the market leans bullish with consolidation and breakout opportunities ahead. Conclusion The shift in capital marks a significant trend in the market. ETH , SOL , and XRP are attracting more attention and investment. This movement highlights the growing interest in these coins. Investors seem to believe in their potential for future growth. As Bitcoin settles, these alternatives become more appealing. This trend could redefine market dynamics. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin is breaking past old highs, and Ethereum is seeing big inflows. As the market cap edges closer to $4 trillion, attention is shifting to low-cost altcoins with room to grow in the near term. BlockDAG, XRP, Dogecoin, and PEPE are drawing fresh interest from those tracking the best crypto coins to buy now. These coins stand out for rising price activity, strong backing, and increasing buzz. With altcoin momentum picking up, choosing the right names early could help shape a strong second half for 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Expanding Reach with Major Milestones and Visibility BlockDAG is turning heads through more than just performance, as it builds real presence in mainstream spaces. A new deal with the Seattle Seawolves, a top U.S. rugby team, makes BlockDAG the Official Blockchain Partner for the 2025 season. This move supports its wider plan to blend blockchain and fan interaction. The project’s presale is also moving fast, raising $350 million in Batch 29 and selling 24.1 billion coins. The price is now locked at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, after which it’s expected to rise to $0.05. That gap signals a possible 3,025% return. From the first batch, returns already hit 2,660%, showing strong follow-through. These gains put BlockDAG (BDAG) on many watchlists as one of the best crypto coins to buy in the current cycle. 2. XRP: Pushing Forward with Resistance Targets Approaching XRP has broken through a major resistance near $1.90 and now trades above its 50-day moving average. This shift points to stronger upward momentum as the market watches for the next move. If Bitcoin stays on track, XRP may follow, with the next resistance expected around $2.65. Traders focused on altcoins with use cases and upside are beginning to take notice. Ripple’s established role in cross-border transactions adds to its strength. As price patterns match rising support levels, XRP is emerging as one of the best crypto coins to buy ahead of the next cycle. Broader trends will still impact progress, but current conditions suggest XRP could move steadily higher in the near term. 3. DOGE: Gaining Strength as Meme Tokens Regain Focus Dogecoin is now trading at $0.1612 and could be near a breakout. The chart shows a falling wedge pattern, often a sign of a shift in direction. At the same time, the RSI is moving up from 43, pointing to growing buying interest. DOGE has found support near $0.17, and higher volume shows both new and returning activity. As meme coins begin to attract attention again, DOGE remains the most well-known in the space. Although still below its highs, recent price action and renewed interest hint at possible gains ahead. For those looking at the best crypto coins to buy, DOGE continues to be part of the conversation as momentum picks up again. 4. PEPE: Moving Quietly with Chart Signs Pointing Up PEPE holds a price of $0.00001233 and is starting to rise after a long period of sideways action. It has been in a descending wedge since November, a formation often followed by upward moves. Its RSI near 60 and daily volume at $1.87 billion support a case for stronger momentum. In the last day, PEPE gained 1.46%, adding to a growing trend. It continues to draw interest from meme traders and short-term market watchers who seek high movement. Though it remains a higher-risk option, the technical setup gives PEPE a chance at more gains. That’s why it stays on the list of best crypto coins to buy for those open to quick shifts in price. Which Coin Has the Strongest Setup Right Now? Looking at the full list, XRP holds momentum and clear technical goals, though it still needs wider support. DOGE is showing signs of a bounce with strong community energy, though meme coins carry risk. PEPE shows life on the charts and high volume but leans more speculative. BlockDAG continues to grow with new announcements, including its recent partnership with the Seattle Seawolves. Global interest is rising fast. With $348 million raised, 24.1 billion coins sold, and its price fixed at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, time is running out to act. That’s why BlockDAG is among the best crypto coins to buy in today’s evolving market.

From tokenized infrastructure to governance-driven innovation, the 2025 altcoin cycle is increasingly defined by real functionality, community alignment, and technical readiness. MAGACOIN FINANCE Introduces DeFi Utility in Its Next Evolution MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just a technical experiment or financial tool — it’s a cultural statement. Built around the theme of political decentralization and anti-establishment values, the token resonates with a growing segment of users disillusioned with traditional finance and mainstream crypto narratives. A key factor setting MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-first structure. Unlike many meme coins that rely on centralized token control, influencer hype, or short-term gains, this project positions itself as fully decentralized with a growing focus on on-chain governance. Another key component analysts highlight is the platform’s zero-tax model. While numerous altcoins impose transaction fees as a method to incentivize holding or fund treasury initiatives, MAGACOIN FINANCE removes that friction entirely. The community around this token isn’t just growing—it’s starting to feel organized. The Telegram group is getting more crowded by the day, and people are sharing memes, asking questions, and actually reading the roadmap. Previous presale stages sold out with growing speed, and now, the addition of smart contract-based functionality is building fresh anticipation. As investors increasingly look for tokens that combine narrative strength with real blockchain application, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling early entry with long-term potential. Qubetics Launches Token with Web3 Aggregation Tech Qubetics has officially entered the market with a launch that bridges multiple blockchain ecosystems. Promoting itself as a Layer 1 Web3 aggregator, the project connects Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana through tools like decentralized VPNs and DeFi-enabled wallets. Its ecosystem is supported by a developer-first infrastructure, enabling rapid deployment of cross-chain smart contracts through the QubeQode IDE. Tokenomics have also been optimized—supply reduced, community participation expanded, and validator mechanics enhanced through a Delegated Proof-of-Stake model. These updates, combined with successful exchange listings and strong institutional interest, are helping Qubetics carve out its position as a technical leader in the new cycle of Layer 1 innovation. BlockDAG Secures $329M and Gears Up for Launch BlockDAG has raised over $329 million thus far and is poised to become one of the most successful token raises of the year. The project uses a DAG protocol that enables parallel transaction processing, so it can operate at very high speeds without congestion. The X1 mining app that the company has created turns mobile devices into nodes and allows anyone to participate in the network. Thanks to features like no-code smart contract tools and a gamified presale experience, the project is gaining good traction without traditional marketing. Many players keenly observe BlockDAG as the launch day approaches itself to remodel and co-exist scalability and accessibility in a decentralized blockchain world. Final Thoughts While Qubetics and BlockDAG demonstrate the strength of infrastructure-driven innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a different path—one that merges cultural resonance with real DeFi functionality. Its progression from meme-powered energy to a structured, on-chain utility model signals more than growth; it signals readiness. For those seeking tokens built for more than speculation, this may be the opportunity to enter before the next wave of attention hits.

In a post published on its verified X profile, the company disclosed that scammers have been increasingly hijacking existing YouTube channels and modifying them to resemble Ripple’s official presence on the platform. These fraudulent accounts are then used to post misleading content, with the apparent aim of defrauding XRP holders. According to Ripple, the attackers update the stolen YouTube channels to impersonate Ripple’s official username, “@Ripple,” misleading viewers into believing that they are engaging with authentic Ripple communications. The company emphasized that neither Ripple nor any of its executives will ever ask users to send XRP to any wallet under any circumstances. PSA: We’ve noticed an uptick of XRP scams on @YouTube – scammers are stealing accounts and then updating the page to impersonate Ripple’s official account (username: @Ripple ). Reminder: Ripple or our execs will NEVER ask you to send us XRP. Our official accounts are listed… — Ripple (@Ripple) July 23, 2025 Scammers Imitating Ripple’s Official Identity Ripple highlighted that scammers have been specifically targeting XRP holders by mimicking its branding and communication style on YouTube. By taking control of existing YouTube accounts and rebranding them, these actors can give their scam content a façade of legitimacy. Ripple cautioned that such impersonations are designed to exploit unsuspecting viewers, particularly those who are new to the cryptocurrency space or unaware of the company’s actual communication policies. The company shared a link to its official resource page that outlines how users can recognize and report scams. This page also contains an up-to-date list of Ripple’s verified accounts across all platforms. Ripple reminded the public that any message asking for XRP under the pretense of an airdrop, giveaway, or other promotion is fraudulent. XRP Community Calls for Legal Action Reactions from the XRP community reflect ongoing concern about the recurring nature of such scams. Prominent community member XRPcryptowolf called on Ripple to pursue legal recourse against YouTube again, referencing the company’s previous litigation. He stated , “Ripple should sue YouTube all over again to keep the XRP community safe.” This sentiment reflects frustration with the lack of enforcement by major social media platforms when it comes to protecting crypto communities from impersonation and fraud. Another X user, Lourenço Matalonga, commented that the rise in scam activity may indirectly point to XRP’s growing recognition, writing, “The more scammers, the more it means that more and more people are starting to know about XRP.” While the intent behind this statement differs, it underscores the visibility of the token in public discourse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Previous Lawsuit Against YouTube Resurfaces Ripple’s warning comes in the context of its earlier legal action against YouTube in 2020 . The lawsuit was based on the platform’s failure to remove videos impersonating Ripple and promoting fraudulent XRP schemes. Although the case was eventually settled, the recurrence of impersonation scams suggests that enforcement by the platform remains inconsistent or inadequate. According to a January 13, 2024, report by Times Tabloid , Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also expressed recent frustration with both YouTube and X for allowing deepfake scam videos to circulate. These videos used his likeness and were reportedly being promoted through paid advertisements. Garlinghouse criticized the platforms for failing to protect users from sophisticated scams that exploit visual and branding cues to mislead audiences. Ripple Reiterates Warning and Emphasis on Caution The company has continued to prioritize public awareness and community safety in its communications. Ripple stated unequivocally that it will never request XRP from anyone under any circumstances. By publishing guidance and consistently issuing alerts, the company aims to minimize the risk of users falling victim to scams. Ripple’s latest warning highlights the persistent threat of impersonation and fraud in the digital asset ecosystem . It also reinforces the importance of cautiously verifying official sources when engaging with cryptocurrency content on social media and video-sharing platforms.

By Wednesday, however, the collection’s average sale price started to cool , dropping 10% to 0.076 ETH between July 22 and July 23. Launched in December 2021, the CryptoBatz website markets the NFTs as a “chance to own a completely unique piece of collectible art created by one of the most legendary rock icons of our lifetime.” The NFT collection’s name is seemingly a nod to a 1982 incident from Osbourne’s tour of his sophomore album, Diary of a Madman, when he accidentally bit off the head of a live bat onstage during a performance in Des Moines, Iowa. RIP to the greatest of all time https://t.co/TZqbwg4LoI — CryptoBatz (@CryptoBatzNFT) July 22, 2025 “Every CryptoBat trait has been creatively directed by Ozzy Osbourne,” the website reads. “Unlike some of Ozzy’s previous bat friends, these ones live safely in the metaverse and are not edible…yet.” Family of Ozzy Osbourne Announces His Passing CryptoBatz faced scrutiny just two days after the NFTs were minted in January 2022, when The Verge published a report alleging that the project had yet to delete X posts, leading users to a Discord server controlled by scammers. According to the report , up to 1,330 users had been listed as members of the Discord at the time. The X posts have since been taken down. News of CryptoBatz’s increase in value came shortly after Osbourne’s family announced his passing on Tuesday at 76 years old. “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” the family’s statement read. “He was with his family and surrounded by love.” The post Ozzy Osbourne’s NFT Collection Sees Price Surge After Rock Icon’s Death appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|NFT|NFT collection|NFT sales volume,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-23 22:04:50

This is barely a month after its launch on June 9. The producer Naoki Motohashi said, “Due to the difficulty of balancing operational costs, and after extensive discussions with our stakeholders, we have arrived at the painful decision to terminate the service,” he wrote. “To all our supporters, we sincerely apologize and share in your disappointment and regret.” It’s a sudden end for what many saw as one of this year’s most promising web3 games, especially after 4 years in development and a $20 million budget backing the project. The Tokyo Beast store stopped selling things on July 22. BASE, the game’s back-end system, will be shut down on July 31. On August 24, the last games and full game service will end. The form can be filled out for refunds starting August 25 and ending September 30. That date is also when the app will be taken down for good. The compensation criteria The sudden move to shut down the game potentially fuels an unexpected benefit for people who invested in TGT or the game’s associated NFTs. To that end, eligible holders will receive compensation for their assets. Refunds will be paid in USDC, not TGT. This is mainly to avoid price swings and protect future projects tied to the token. Total compensation. Source: TOKYOBEAST blog The team allocated a $350,000 pool, with item values based on their market price as of July 20. Users who own BEAST NFTs will get more than the $200 paid in the main sale. The amount they get back in USDC stablecoin will depend on how rare the assets are and range from $203 to $597. TGT unstaking fees will also be refunded based on user tier. Any lucky ticket NFTs bought from the official shop will get full refunds. Unused in-game GEMs are also fully covered. Tokyo Beast money bumps Tokyo Beast made more than $1 million in its first week, and more than 300,000 copies were downloaded. However, as soon as TGT went on sale in late May, its value dropped sharply. It then fell even further after a short rise around the game’s release. TGT is now worth $0.006, 96% less than its all-time high. It has dropped another 16% in the last 24 hours due to news of the shutdown. The value of the token is now only $897,000. Tokyo Beast had many problems, even though it was very exciting. @vert1dkrn, who makes content for Web3, said that the game gave players easy ways to make money without spending any. In just five days, he made $60 on his own without paying anything. The team also spent a lot of money on advertising. As he said in his tweet, they had a “streamer program with 20 streamers in it,” but most of them didn’t show up. Many small creators with less than 1,000 followers got paid four figures, but bigger influencers were not even mentioned.

Today, the spotlight is firmly on LetsBONK, a prominent memecoin launchpad, which has made a groundbreaking commitment that could significantly impact the BONK ecosystem . This move is not just a ripple; it’s a wave designed to enhance the long-term health and stability of one of the most vibrant communities in the crypto space. What is LetsBONK and Its Groundbreaking Pledge for the BONK Ecosystem ? LetsBONK operates as a launchpad specifically tailored for memecoins, providing a platform for new projects to emerge and gain traction within the broader cryptocurrency market. Its role is crucial in fostering innovation and growth within the memecoin sector, offering infrastructure and support for budding digital assets. However, it’s their latest strategic decision that truly sets them apart: a firm commitment to allocate 1% of their total revenue towards weekly token buybacks within the BONK ecosystem . This isn’t just a promise; it’s a mechanism designed to create tangible value for the community. According to a report by The Block, this isn’t a one-off event but a consistent, weekly commitment. The implications are profound, suggesting a proactive approach to managing tokenomics and supporting the underlying assets that contribute to the BONK ecosystem ‘s vitality. For context, Dune Analytics recently revealed that LetsBONK generated an impressive approximately $1.5 million in fee revenue over a mere 24-hour period. This substantial revenue stream means that even 1% translates into significant capital being channeled back into the ecosystem, directly benefiting token holders. Why Are Token Buybacks So Important for the BONK Ecosystem ? Token buybacks are a common strategy in both traditional finance (stock buybacks) and the crypto world, employed by companies and projects to return value to shareholders or token holders. In essence, when a project buys back its own tokens from the open market, it typically achieves several positive outcomes: Increased Scarcity: By removing tokens from circulation (often by burning them or holding them in a treasury), buybacks reduce the total supply, which can, in theory, increase the value of the remaining tokens due to scarcity. Price Support: The act of buying tokens creates consistent buying pressure, which can help stabilize or even increase the token’s price, especially during market downturns. Investor Confidence: A consistent buyback program signals financial health and a commitment to token value, boosting investor and community confidence in the project’s long-term viability. Reduced Volatility: Regular buybacks can help absorb sell pressure, contributing to a more stable trading environment for tokens within the BONK ecosystem . For the BONK ecosystem , this commitment from LetsBONK means a steady, external source of demand for its core tokens. It’s a clear signal that the launchpad is invested in the success of the tokens it helps to foster, creating a virtuous cycle where the launchpad’s success directly contributes to the token’s health. How Does This Impact the Current State of the BONK Ecosystem ? The immediate impact of LetsBONK’s pledge is likely to be a surge in positive sentiment within the BONK ecosystem . Investors and community members often view such initiatives as a strong indicator of a project’s dedication to its token holders. Given the recent revenue figures, the financial capacity to sustain these buybacks is evident, lending credibility to the commitment. Let’s break down the potential implications: Aspect Potential Impact on BONK Ecosystem Market Dynamics Consistent buying pressure can absorb sell orders, potentially leading to a more stable or appreciating token price. Community Morale Increased trust and engagement as the community sees tangible value being returned. This can foster a stronger, more active user base. Project Reputation LetsBONK enhances its reputation as a responsible and value-driven launchpad, potentially attracting more quality projects and users. Long-Term Viability By reducing circulating supply and supporting price, the initiative contributes to the long-term sustainability and attractiveness of tokens within the ecosystem. This move also sets a precedent for other launchpads and projects within the memecoin space. As the market matures, such transparent and value-driven tokenomics become increasingly important for building lasting success beyond initial hype. What Are the Broader Implications for Memecoins and the BONK Ecosystem ? The memecoin market has often been characterized by volatility and speculative trading. While this offers high-risk, high-reward opportunities, it also deters more cautious investors. LetsBONK’s commitment introduces a layer of stability and fundamental value often missing in this segment. This initiative could contribute to a shift in perception, demonstrating that even memecoin-focused platforms can adopt robust tokenomics strategies. It encourages a more mature approach to project development, where revenue generation is linked directly to ecosystem health rather than solely relying on speculative interest. For the broader BONK ecosystem , this means a potential pathway to greater legitimacy and sustained growth, moving beyond mere virality to build a foundation of intrinsic value. Challenges and Considerations for Sustained Growth within the BONK Ecosystem While the buyback pledge is undoubtedly positive, it’s essential to consider potential challenges and factors for its sustained success: Revenue Sustainability: The efficacy of the buyback program heavily relies on LetsBONK’s continued ability to generate significant fee revenue. Market downturns or reduced activity on the launchpad could impact the buyback volume. Market Volatility: Even with buybacks, the broader crypto market’s inherent volatility can still influence token prices. Buybacks act as a support, but not an impenetrable shield. Transparency and Execution: Continued transparency regarding buyback execution and revenue reporting will be crucial for maintaining community trust. Token Utility: While buybacks boost value, ultimately, the long-term success of tokens within the BONK ecosystem will also depend on their utility, adoption, and development within various applications. LetsBONK’s strategy should be viewed as one powerful component of a multi-faceted approach to building a robust and thriving ecosystem. It complements, rather than replaces, the need for continuous innovation, community engagement, and strategic partnerships. Actionable Insights for Those Engaged with the BONK Ecosystem For investors, community members, and developers within the BONK ecosystem , LetsBONK’s announcement provides several key takeaways: Monitor Revenue and Buyback Reports: Keep an eye on LetsBONK’s reported revenues and buyback activities. This data will offer insights into the program’s effectiveness and the launchpad’s ongoing health. Engage with the Community: A strong community is vital. Participate in discussions, provide feedback, and contribute to the ecosystem’s growth. Understand Tokenomics: Deepen your understanding of how tokenomics, including buybacks and burns, influence token value and sustainability. Diversify and Research: While positive, no single initiative guarantees success. Continue to conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider diversification within your crypto portfolio. This commitment from LetsBONK isn’t just about a financial transaction; it’s about building a sustainable model for growth in the memecoin space. It highlights a growing trend towards more mature and responsible practices within a segment of crypto often seen as purely speculative. Conclusion: A New Era for the BONK Ecosystem ? LetsBONK’s pledge to dedicate 1% of its revenue to weekly token buybacks is a significant development for the BONK ecosystem . It represents a proactive and financially sound strategy to foster long-term value, stability, and community confidence. By directly linking the success of the launchpad to the health of the tokens it supports, LetsBONK is setting a commendable standard for transparency and commitment in the memecoin space. While the road ahead in crypto is always dynamic, this move provides a solid foundation for the BONK ecosystem to build upon, potentially ushering in an era where memecoins are not just about fleeting hype, but also about sustainable, community-driven growth. It’s a testament to the evolving sophistication of the crypto market, where even the most playful assets are beginning to adopt serious financial strategies.
