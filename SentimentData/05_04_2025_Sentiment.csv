Here’s what on-chain data says regarding if BTC is going anywhere with them. Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss Ratio Could Shed Light On Broader Dynamics In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the recent trend in the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio for Bitcoin, which is an indicator that can be useful to study how investors are reacting to price volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.57 Or $0.06? Analyst Says DOGE’s Fate Hinges On This Level The metric measures, as its name already suggests, the ratio between the amount of profit and that of loss being realized by the holders or addresses as a whole. The indicator works by looking at the transaction history of each coin being sold on the network to find what price it was transferred at prior to this sale. If this previous selling value is less than the latest spot price for any token, then the metric includes it under the profit volume. The total profit realized in the sale of the coin is assumed to be equal to the difference between the two prices. The indicator calculates this value for all coins belonging to the profit volume and takes a total sum to determine the scale of profit realization happening across the blockchain. Similarly, the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio also finds the total amount of loss being realized by referring to the sales of the coins of the opposite type (that is, the tokens with the last transaction value higher than the current spot price). Then, it takes the ratio between the two sums, to estimate the net situation for the sector. During the last couple of months, Bitcoin has been going through a phase of bearish price action. Here’s what investor trading behavior has been like in this period, according to the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio: As the analytics firm has highlighted in the chart, the indicator has seen dips under the 1 mark during each of BTC’s recent lows. A value in this region corresponds to loss-taking being more dominant than profit-taking. “This imbalance typically marks a degree of seller exhaustion, where downside momentum fades as sell-side pressure is absorbed,” explains Glassnode. Due to this reason, capitulation tends to help BTC arrive at local bottoms. From the graph, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency also benefited from this effect during the recent bursts of loss realization, as its price found a rebound following each of them. These Bitcoin rebounds, however, have so far not been anything sustained. Will they eventually culminate into a return of proper bullish momentum, or are they only dead-cat bounces on the way down? To tackle the question, the analytics firm has referred to a long-term view of the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. As shown in the above chart, the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has been sharply trending down recently, despite the jumps in profit realization that have come on the short-term view. “These brief profit-driven surges have failed to reverse the broader downtrend, suggesting that the macro picture remains one of generally weaker liquidity and deteriorating investor profitability,” notes Glassnode. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Among Coins Seeing The Largest Decline In Profit Supply: Data So, as for whether Bitcoin has been witnessing a shift towards bullish momentum with the recent rebounds, the answer is seemingly no, at least from the perspective of the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $83,600, down almost 2% in the last seven days.

However, amidst this exhilarating innovation, the United States has found itself playing catch-up in the regulatory arena. Many argue that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement-first strategy has inadvertently pushed burgeoning crypto ventures and talent overseas, hindering domestic growth. But hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Change is in the air, and it’s coming straight from Capitol Hill. Why is Digital Asset Regulation Suddenly a Hot Topic? For years, the lack of clear digital asset regulation in the U.S. has been a thorn in the side of the crypto industry. Imagine trying to navigate a complex maze without a map – that’s been the reality for businesses operating with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The absence of well-defined rules has led to: Uncertainty for Businesses: Companies wanting to innovate in the crypto space have been hesitant, unsure of the legal boundaries and potential penalties. Investor Hesitation: The regulatory grey area has made some investors wary, slowing down capital inflow into the U.S. crypto market. Innovation Drain: As mentioned earlier, the stringent enforcement approach has encouraged crypto entrepreneurs to seek more welcoming regulatory environments abroad. The urgency for a clear framework has become undeniable, and finally, lawmakers are taking note. The recent move in Congress signals a significant shift towards embracing and regulating this transformative technology. Bipartisan Breakthrough: A Unified Front on Crypto Regulation In a refreshing display of unity, the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees have joined forces, passing the first bipartisan crypto regulation market structure bill. This is not just another piece of legislation; it’s a landmark moment, signifying a growing consensus across party lines on the need for a comprehensive approach to digital assets. This bipartisan effort is built upon six core principles, designed to foster innovation while safeguarding consumers and the integrity of the financial system: Principle Description Benefit Promoting Innovation Creating a regulatory environment that encourages the development and adoption of digital asset technologies. Spurs economic growth, technological advancement, and job creation within the US. Clarifying Asset Classification Establishing clear definitions for different types of digital assets to determine appropriate regulatory oversight (e.g., are they securities, commodities, or something else?). Reduces confusion, provides legal certainty for businesses, and simplifies compliance. Regulating New Asset Issuance Setting guidelines for the issuance of new digital assets, ensuring transparency and investor protection. Mitigates risks associated with fraudulent schemes and protects investors from scams. Overseeing Spot Markets Implementing regulatory oversight for the spot markets where digital assets are traded, enhancing market integrity and preventing manipulation. Builds trust in the market, attracts institutional investors, and ensures fair trading practices. Protecting Customer Funds Establishing robust safeguards to protect customer funds held by digital asset platforms and custodians. Enhances consumer confidence, reduces the risk of loss due to platform failures or hacks, and protects user assets. Safeguarding Decentralized Projects Developing a regulatory approach that accommodates the unique nature of decentralized projects, fostering innovation while addressing potential risks. Allows for the growth of decentralized technologies, recognizing their potential benefits while managing associated risks in a balanced way. These principles form the bedrock of a balanced framework that aims to nurture the burgeoning digital asset market while mitigating potential risks. It’s about creating a space where innovation can thrive responsibly. What’s Next? The Road Ahead for US Crypto Regulation This bipartisan bill is a crucial first step, but the journey towards comprehensive US crypto regulation is far from over. Lawmakers are committed to refining and expanding this framework. A joint hearing is already scheduled for May, indicating the continued momentum and dedication to advancing digital asset regulation. Here’s what we can expect in the coming months: Further Deliberation and Refinement: The May hearing will likely involve expert testimonies, industry input, and further debate among lawmakers to shape the legislation. Collaboration Across Agencies: Effective regulation will require collaboration between various government agencies, including the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury Department, to ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach. International Alignment: As crypto is a global phenomenon, the U.S. will need to consider international regulatory standards to maintain competitiveness and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Focus on Consumer Protection: Protecting consumers from fraud and scams will remain a paramount concern, influencing the final shape of the regulations. The ultimate goal? To establish the U.S. not just as a participant, but as a global leader in the crypto space. By providing a clear, balanced, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment, the U.S. can attract investment, foster technological advancements, and solidify its position in the digital economy. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are a crypto investor, a business owner exploring blockchain applications, or simply a curious observer, this development in bipartisan crypto bill matters. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the developments in Congress and the evolving regulatory landscape. Resources like CoinDesk and other crypto news outlets will be crucial. Engage with Policymakers: If you are part of the crypto industry, consider engaging with policymakers and industry associations to contribute to the regulatory dialogue. Prepare for Compliance: Businesses operating in the crypto space should start preparing for potential regulatory changes. Understanding the six principles outlined in the bill is a good starting point. Consider Long-Term Opportunities: The move towards clearer regulation can be seen as a positive signal for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market in the U.S. A New Chapter for Crypto in America? The bipartisan push for digital asset regulation in the U.S. marks a pivotal moment. It’s a signal that lawmakers are recognizing the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and are committed to creating a framework that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. While the journey is ongoing, this initial bipartisan bill is a monumental leap forward, potentially paving the way for the U.S. to become a global powerhouse in the digital asset revolution. The future of crypto in America is looking brighter, and it’s a space to watch with keen interest.

While the digital asset world keeps us on our toes, a seismic shift is happening in the traditional markets that might just ripple through our crypto universe. Whispers are turning into shouts as reports emerge about a massive stock market decline in the U.S. since Donald Trump’s return to office. According to WhaleWire’s Jacob King on X, we’re talking about a staggering $9.6 trillion wiped out from the U.S. stock market. That’s not just a dip; it’s a plunge! Is this a temporary blip, or are we witnessing the start of a significant economic downturn ? Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you and your investments. Decoding the $9.6 Trillion Market Crash: What’s Behind the Numbers? Nine point six trillion dollars. Let that sink in for a moment. That’s a mind-boggling figure, and it represents a substantial erosion of wealth in the U.S. stock market. But what’s causing this dramatic market crash ? While attributing such complex phenomena to a single factor is simplistic, the timing coinciding with a political shift raises eyebrows. Let’s break down some potential contributing factors: Policy Uncertainty: New administrations often bring policy changes, and the return of a former president can amplify this uncertainty. Markets dislike uncertainty, and shifts in trade policy, regulations, or fiscal spending can spook investors. Economic Outlook Concerns: Are there underlying economic concerns that are being exacerbated by the change in administration? Factors like inflation, interest rate hikes, and global economic slowdown could be playing a significant role. A new administration’s perceived approach to these issues can either calm or agitate market sentiments. Investor Sentiment and Reaction: Market psychology is a powerful force. Investor confidence can be swayed by political events. If the market perceives the new administration’s policies as unfavorable for business or economic growth, a negative feedback loop can be triggered, leading to sell-offs and further declines. Comparison to Previous Administrations: The claim highlights this as the “largest market decline recorded under a new president.” This comparative aspect itself can fuel concern and media attention, further impacting market sentiment. It’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation. While the timeline is noteworthy, a multitude of global and domestic economic factors are always at play in market movements. Trump’s Economic Policy: A Deja Vu or a New Chapter of Investment Losses? Donald Trump’s previous presidency was characterized by significant tax cuts and deregulation, initially cheered by many in the business community. However, it also saw trade disputes and increased national debt. So, how might his return influence the current economic policy landscape and contribute to these investment losses ? Here are some key areas to consider: Trade Relations: Trump’s stance on trade, including tariffs and trade agreements, has historically created market volatility. Any perceived shift towards protectionist policies could worry investors about global economic growth and corporate earnings. Fiscal Policy: Proposed changes in tax policy and government spending can have a direct impact on corporate profitability and investor sentiment. Markets will be scrutinizing any signals regarding fiscal stimulus or austerity measures. Regulatory Environment: Deregulation was a hallmark of Trump’s previous term. The extent to which deregulation is pursued again and in which sectors will be closely watched by investors. While some sectors might benefit, others could face increased risks. Geopolitical Impact: Trump’s foreign policy and international relations also play a role. Geopolitical instability or shifts in alliances can create market uncertainty and impact investor confidence. It’s essential for investors to analyze specific policy proposals and their potential sector-by-sector impacts rather than reacting solely to broad political narratives. Navigating the Economic Downturn: Actionable Insights for Crypto and Traditional Investors Whether this economic downturn is a short-term correction or the beginning of a deeper trend remains to be seen. However, for both crypto and traditional investors, this market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insight For Crypto Investors For Traditional Stock Investors Diversification: Consider diversifying crypto holdings across different types of assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins, stablecoins) and exploring traditional assets for portfolio balance. Ensure portfolio diversification across different sectors, asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities), and geographic regions. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Volatility can be amplified in crypto markets. Review and adjust risk tolerance based on market conditions. Consider hedging strategies or reducing exposure to high-risk assets if necessary. Due Diligence and Research: Stay informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors impacting both crypto and traditional markets. Conduct thorough research on companies and sectors before investing. Understand the potential impact of economic policies on specific industries. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are inherent. Focus on the long-term potential of crypto and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term volatility. Maintain a long-term investment perspective. Market corrections can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong companies. In times of market uncertainty, knowledge is your best weapon. Staying informed, being adaptable, and having a well-thought-out investment strategy are crucial for navigating turbulent economic waters. Conclusion: Weathering the Storm and Seeking Opportunity The reported $9.6 trillion stock market decline is undoubtedly a significant event that demands attention. While the narrative around political factors is prominent, a confluence of economic forces is likely at play. For investors in both crypto and traditional markets, this period underscores the importance of vigilance, diversification, and a disciplined approach to risk management. Market downturns, while concerning, can also present opportunities for strategic investors who are prepared to weather the storm and capitalize on emerging trends. Keep a close watch on economic indicators, policy developments, and market reactions, and position yourself to navigate this evolving landscape with informed decisions.

BTC looked to be on the brink of reclaiming $85,000, but price action turned bearish, with the flagship cryptocurrency dropping to $81,745 before rising above $82,000 and moving to its current level of $82,350. BTC has been marginally up over the past 24 hours, with price action relatively flat after the flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum around $84,500. Genius Group Temporarily Banned From Buying Bitcoin Genius Group, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence firm has announced it has been temporarily banned from buying more Bitcoin after a US court order barred the company from selling shares, raising funds, and using investor funds to buy more of the asset. The preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order (TRO) were issued by a New York District court in connection with a broader dispute regarding its merger with Fatbrain AI. Fatbrain AI and Genius Group completed a merger and purchase agreement in March 2024. However, on October 30, Genius initiated arbitration proceedings to terminate the agreement alleging fraud by Fatbrain AI executives connected to the deal. “Genius Group Limited (NYSE American: GNS) (“Genius Group” or the “Company”), a leading AI-powered, Bitcoin-first education group, today announced that it is being forced to sell its Bitcoin Treasury after having been blocked from selling shares or raising funds, and specifically from using investor funds to buy Bitcoin by the United States District Court Southern District of New York (SDNY).” Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz filed for a TRO and permanent injunction in February, preventing Genius from selling shares, raising funds, and buying more BTC . The injunction forced Genius Group to close divisions, halt marketing activities, and sell 10 BTC from its stash of 440 to fund operations. The firm has not ruled out more sales of Bitcoin. “Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place.” Fatbrain AI shareholders also filed two lawsuits against Fatbrain AI executives, including Moe, Ritz, and Genius, alleging violations of federal securities laws in connection with the merger. However, Genius Group has stated the injunction forced it to break Singapore law by halting employee compensation. “We never dreamed that it was possible that a US court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds, or buy Bitcoin — all actions that would normally be decided by a public company's shareholders or Board rather than a court.” Japanese Gaming Firm Enish Announces Bitcoin Investment Japanese game developer Enish has announced a strategic investment of 100 million yen ($660,000) in Bitcoin . The purchase is set to be completed between April 1 and April 4. The acquisition is part of a broader initiative to deepen the company’s understanding of blockchain technology and enhance its game development capabilities. The game developer plans to integrate crypto assets into its financial strategy while leveraging BTC’s liquidity, market stability, and potential long-term growth. The company also plans to allocate a portion of its liquid funds to Bitcoin, conduct quarterly market valuations of its Bitcoin assets, and include any gains or losses in its financial statement. It has also pledged to disclose any significant market event that could impact its performance. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the red during the ongoing session after giving up most of the day’s gains and trading marginally down at $83,200. BTC attempted a rally during the ongoing session but could only push to the 20-day SMA before losing momentum. BTC’s price action indicates its growing correlation with the traditional markets as governments and major institutions ramp up their interest in the asset. Block CEO Jack Dorsey weighed in on Bitcoin’s popularity with governments and institutional investors, warning about the increasing influence of these institutions over the flagship cryptocurrency. Dorsey stated that while institutional adoption of Bitcoin was bound to happen, it could impact the cryptocurrency’s foundational principles. Dorsey also warned that becoming solely a store of value could reduce Bitcoin's usefulness in regular transactions. BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising to an intraday high of $88,839. However, it lost momentum after encountering selling pressure and volatility. As a result, BTC registered marginal declines on Tuesday and Wednesday, slipping below $87,000 and settling at $86,942. The price registered a marginal increase on Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $84,422. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC fell over 2% on Saturday and 0.36% on Sunday and settled at $82,404. Source: TradingView The flagship cryptocurrency encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $82,511. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3%, moving past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $85,150. The price surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified in the leadup to Trump’s Liberation Day speech. However, sentiment turned bearish, and BTC fell over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $82,535. BTC recovered on Thursday despite overwhelming selling pressure, rising almost 1% to $83,199. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. The RSI is just under the neutral zone, while the MACD has a slight bullish bias, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42918845,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146505,1743808820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Significant $25M USDC Transfer: DWF Labs Backs Trump’s DeFi Venture – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dwf-labs-usdc-trump-defi/,"In a move that’s sending ripples through the crypto sphere, prominent digital asset market maker DWF Labs has reportedly transferred a substantial $25 million in USDC to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project linked to the Trump family. This news, initially brought to light by Onchain Lens on X, has sparked intense speculation and debate about the intersection of traditional finance, decentralized finance (DeFi), and political influence within the cryptocurrency landscape. What does this USDC transfer signify, and what could it mean for the future of crypto investments and political engagement in the digital asset space? Why is DWF Labs Making a Bold Crypto Investment in a Trump DeFi Project? DWF Labs is no stranger to making headlines with strategic crypto investments . Known for their active participation in the digital asset market and their support for various blockchain projects, their decision to inject $25 million into World Liberty Financial raises several key questions. Let’s break down what we know about DWF Labs and why this move could be strategically important: Who is DWF Labs? DWF Labs is a global digital asset market maker and multi-stage web3 investment firm. They are known for providing liquidity, market making services, and investment to crypto projects across various sectors. Their portfolio includes investments in numerous well-known crypto platforms and protocols. Strategic Diversification: DWF Labs’ investment in WLFI could be seen as a strategic diversification of their portfolio. Investing in a project with a unique political angle, especially one associated with a prominent figure like the Trump family, could open up new avenues and markets within the DeFi space. High-Growth Potential: DeFi projects, while inherently risky, offer the potential for high growth. DWF Labs might be betting on the potential of WLFI to attract a specific user base or community, leveraging the Trump brand and network. Market Influence: A significant investment like this can have a considerable impact on market sentiment. It signals confidence in the WLFI project and potentially the broader DeFi market, attracting further attention and investment. Understanding World Liberty Financial (WLFI): The Trump Family’s DeFi Venture World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is positioned as a Trump DeFi project , leveraging the name and potentially the network associated with the Trump family. While details about WLFI might still be emerging, here’s what we can infer and consider about this project: Brand Association: The clear association with the Trump name is a significant factor. It brings immediate name recognition and could attract a specific demographic of users who are supporters of the Trump political brand. DeFi Ambitions: As a DeFi project, WLFI likely aims to offer decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, or yield farming. The specifics of their offerings will be crucial in determining their success and appeal. Community Focus: Projects associated with public figures often aim to build a strong community. WLFI may be targeting a community that aligns with the political and ideological stances often associated with the Trump brand. Potential for Innovation or Niche Market: To stand out in the crowded DeFi space, WLFI will likely need to offer unique features, target a niche market, or innovate in some aspect of decentralized finance. The connection to a political brand could be their unique selling proposition. The Significance of a $25 Million USDC Transfer in the Crypto World A $25 million USDC transfer is a substantial amount in the cryptocurrency world, especially for a DeFi project in its early stages. Let’s examine why this amount is significant and what it could enable for WLFI: Aspect Significance of $25M USDC Liquidity Injection Provides WLFI with significant capital to bootstrap operations, develop their platform, and offer attractive incentives to early users.

Why China’s 34% Tariffs on U.S. Goods Could Propel ETH 250% Ethereum price traded near $1,820 on Friday, rising 1.6% in a muted performance compared to broader market leaders. While Bitcoin ( BTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and XRP all rallied over 3%, ETH lagged behind. However, China’s 34% tariffs on U.S. imports introduce fresh volatility triggers that could accelerate ETH’s upside momentum. BTC/Nasdaq Correlation Hits 37-Day Low Amid Trade War Tensions Markets reacted sharply to China’s unexpected decision to impose 34% tariffs on a broad range of U.S. imports. Equities dipped in early trading, but crypto assets remained largely resilient. According to TradingView data, Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 fell to 0.42, its lowest level since February 25. Bitcoin Price Correlation to NASDAQ 100 | BTCUSD Historically, such divergence signals capital rotation. When equities experience trade-related instability, investors often seek alternative hedges, initially favouring Bitcoin. If momentum continues, ETH price typically follows with steeper gains. Reallocation Accelerates as Macro Risks Intensify The current geopolitical backdrop mirrors 2019, when market turbulence from COVID-19 lockdowns led to increased capital inflows into crypto. With global retaliation measures now escalating following Trump’s tariff rollout, ETH price could soon surpass the $1,900 resistance level and sustain a broader uptrend. US Fed Rate Pause Could Boost Ethereum’s DeFi Ecosystem Following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, another rate pause now seems likely. If traditional savings and treasury yields remain low, investors may shift capital into DeFi for higher returns. As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum’s DeFi sector could see rising demand, increasing ETH accumulation. If additional retaliatory trade measures emerge, alternative assets like ETH may gain further traction. ETH Price Forecast: Falling Wedge Pattern Hints at a 250% Rally Ethereum price is forming a falling wedge, a historically bullish pattern suggesting a potential 250% breakout toward $3,200. ETH is testing the wedge’s upper boundary near $1,900, with confirmation requiring a sustained close above this level. The MACD indicator signals early bullish momentum, with an imminent MACD line crossover. If buyers sustain pressure above VWAP at $1,804, ETH could confirm the wedge breakout and accelerate higher. ETH Price Forecast However, rejection at $1,900 could invalidate the bullish outlook, exposing ETH to $1,600 support. A breakdown below this level might send prices toward $1,400, aligning with historical support zones. Ethereum next move depends on Bitcoin’s strength and macroeconomic trends. If ETH breaks out, it could mirror past parabolic rallies, but failure to breach resistance may lead to deeper corrections before a true recovery. Traders should monitor volume and momentum for confirmation.

42919118,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146506,1743809414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Uncertain Path Ahead: Jerome Powell’s Warning on Monetary Policy & Interest Rates,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/powell-uncertain-monetary-policy/,"In a world where every whisper from the U.S. Federal Reserve can send ripples across the cryptocurrency market, Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent speech has sparked both intrigue and anxiety. Crypto enthusiasts and investors are keenly watching every move, trying to decipher the future trajectory of monetary policy. Powell’s message? It’s simply too early to chart a definitive course. Jerome Powell’s Cautious Stance on Monetary Policy Addressing an audience of economists and financial experts, Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. central bank, delivered a nuanced message that essentially boiled down to ‘wait and see.’ He emphasized that the Federal Reserve is in no rush to commit to a specific direction for monetary policy. This cautious approach comes at a time when the global economic landscape is riddled with uncertainties, from trade tensions to fluctuating inflation rates. Powell’s words suggest a period of careful observation and data analysis before any firm decisions are made about the future of interest rates and the overall monetary environment. Key takeaways from Powell’s speech: Patience is Paramount: The Fed is prepared to take its time before deciding on the appropriate path for monetary policy. This signals a data-dependent approach, where decisions will be guided by incoming economic indicators. Tariff Impact Under Scrutiny: Powell acknowledged that the economic impact of tariffs could be more significant than initially anticipated. This is a crucial point, as trade policies can have a cascading effect on inflation and economic growth. Inflation Vigilance: The Fed is committed to ensuring that price increases do not translate into persistent inflation. This highlights their focus on maintaining price stability, a core mandate of central banks. Presidential Pressure: It’s no secret that President Trump has been vocal in his calls for interest rate cuts. Powell’s remarks come against this backdrop of political pressure, adding another layer of complexity to the Fed’s decision-making process. Decoding the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Dilemma What exactly is behind this ‘wait and see’ approach to monetary policy? Several factors are likely contributing to the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance. The global economic outlook is far from clear-cut. While the U.S. economy has shown resilience, there are concerns about a potential slowdown. Globally, trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and varying growth rates across different regions create a complex and somewhat unpredictable environment. In this context, committing to a definitive monetary policy path could be premature and potentially risky. Factors influencing the Fed’s monetary policy decisions: Global Economic Uncertainty: The interconnected nature of the global economy means that events in one part of the world can have ripple effects elsewhere. The Fed must consider these global dynamics when formulating its monetary policy. Trade Tensions and Tariffs: As Powell explicitly mentioned, the impact of tariffs is a significant concern. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses, and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers, contributing to inflation. Domestic Economic Data: The Fed closely monitors a range of domestic economic data, including employment figures, inflation metrics, consumer spending, and business investment. These indicators provide crucial insights into the health of the U.S. economy and guide monetary policy decisions. Inflation Expectations: Beyond current inflation, the Fed also pays close attention to inflation expectations. If businesses and consumers expect inflation to rise, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Managing these expectations is a key part of the Fed’s job. Political Pressure: While the Federal Reserve is designed to be independent, it cannot completely ignore political considerations. President Trump’s repeated calls for lower interest rates add a layer of external pressure that the Fed must navigate. Inflation Concerns and the Fed’s Response Powell’s emphasis on ensuring that price increases don’t lead to persistent inflation is particularly noteworthy. Inflation, the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, is a critical economic indicator. While moderate inflation is generally considered healthy, high or runaway inflation can erode purchasing power, destabilize the economy, and negatively impact financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: to promote maximum employment and maintain price stability. Keeping inflation in check is central to fulfilling the latter part of this mandate. How the Fed manages inflation: Interest Rate Adjustments: The primary tool the Fed uses to manage inflation is adjusting the federal funds rate, the target range for the overnight lending rate between banks. Raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and curb inflationary pressures. Conversely, lowering rates can stimulate borrowing and spending. Open Market Operations: The Fed also conducts open market operations, buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply and interest rates. Forward Guidance: Communicating its intentions and outlook to the public, known as forward guidance, is another important tool. By providing clarity about its future policy plans, the Fed can influence market expectations and shape economic behavior. Powell’s recent speech itself is an example of forward guidance, albeit one emphasizing uncertainty. Monitoring Economic Data: Continuously tracking inflation data, along with other economic indicators, is essential for the Fed to assess inflationary pressures and adjust its policy response as needed. Interest Rates Under Scrutiny: What’s Next for Interest Rates? The question on everyone’s mind is, what will the Federal Reserve do with interest rates? President Trump’s repeated calls for rate cuts add significant weight to this question. Lower interest rates can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. However, they can also fuel inflation and potentially lead to asset bubbles. The Fed must carefully weigh these competing considerations. Powell’s statement that it is “too early to tell” suggests that the Fed is not yet convinced that rate cuts are necessary or appropriate at this juncture. They are likely waiting for more data to clarify the economic outlook and the trajectory of inflation before making any decisive moves on interest rates. Possible scenarios for interest rates: Rate Hikes on Hold: Powell’s remarks strongly suggest that further interest rate hikes are unlikely in the near term. The Fed appears to be in a pause mode, assessing the economic landscape. Potential Rate Cuts: While not explicitly stated, the possibility of future rate cuts cannot be ruled out, especially if economic data weakens or if inflation remains stubbornly low. However, the bar for rate cuts seems to be relatively high at this point. Data-Dependent Approach: The Fed’s future actions on interest rates will be heavily dependent on incoming economic data. Stronger-than-expected growth and rising inflation could prompt a more hawkish stance, while weaker data could lead to a more dovish approach. Balancing Act: The Fed is engaged in a delicate balancing act, trying to support economic growth while keeping inflation under control. Navigating this balance in an uncertain global environment is a significant challenge. Navigating Uncertainty in Monetary Policy: Implications for Crypto For the cryptocurrency market, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are crucial. Lower interest rates can sometimes be seen as positive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets compared to traditional interest-bearing investments. Conversely, rising interest rates can make safer, yield-generating assets more attractive, potentially dampening enthusiasm for crypto. The current uncertainty surrounding monetary policy creates a period of both risk and opportunity for the crypto space. Impact on the crypto market: Volatility Potential: Uncertainty often leads to volatility. As markets try to interpret the Fed’s signals and anticipate future policy moves, we can expect price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If inflation concerns persist or intensify, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, might be viewed as a potential hedge against inflation, potentially increasing demand. Dollar Strength: Monetary policy decisions can influence the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes be correlated with increased interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Institutional Investment: Clarity on monetary policy can provide a more stable macroeconomic backdrop, potentially encouraging institutional investment in the crypto space. Conversely, uncertainty might make institutions more cautious. In conclusion, Jerome Powell’s recent speech underscores the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the future path of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is adopting a patient and data-dependent approach, carefully monitoring economic developments and global risks. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of uncertainty translates into both challenges and opportunities. Staying informed, understanding the nuances of monetary policy, and being prepared for potential volatility will be key for navigating the evolving landscape.

Users can now purchase, transfer, or sell these assets directly from their accounts. This new rollout is expected to happen in the coming few weeks. Once live, it will increase PayPal’s supported digital coins to seven, according to a recent announcement . According to May Zabaneh from PayPal, this new addition would serve PayPal’s goal of increasing its presence in the broader crypto market. It will open PayPal to a larger segment of crypto users including data providers, developers, and retail investors. PayPal seems to be betting on crypto for the long-term. The platform believes that crypto and digital assets will become a major part of digital commerce, despite the temporary volatility in the market. PayPal is racing to adopt crypto While the current CEO of PayPal, Alex Chriss has not said much about PayPal’s plans for crypto adoption, Dan Schulman, the previous CEO has been an open advocate of crypto integration. In 2022, the previous CEO mentioned, “the intersection between digital currencies and the digital wallet is a clear opportunity.” PayPal integrated crypto for the first time in October 2022. At that time, the company allowed US customers to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash directly from the app. Later, PayPal users got a new crypto checkout feature in March, 2021. This new feature made it easier for users to spend their cryptocurrencies at various merchants. The crypto would automatically get converted into fiat currency during a sale.

According to a Bloomberg report , this effort is happening in Washington, where lobbyists for Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. believe they have their best chance yet to challenge Microsoft Corp.’s dominance in government software. By aligning their message with DOGE’s focus on trimming costs, they hope to persuade policymakers that Microsoft’s contracts lead to overspending and lock agencies into outdated tools. DOGE, which is Musk’s brainchild, has already raised questions about the cost of technology across government agencies. Amazon and Google’s lobbyists, in large part through technology trade groups such as NetChoice, are amplifying those questions. They are calling attention to Microsoft’s contracts, arguing that new solutions could offer better prices and more modern products. These lobbyists have reached out to lawmakers known informally as the “DOGE caucus,” along with DOGE contacts at various federal agencies. Microsoft believes Google and Amazon are using a backdoor approach to gain government contracts Microsoft’s spokesperson, Alex Haurek, said the company is not surprised by these lobbying tactics. In a statement, Haurek described certain industry players as “trying to manipulate decision makers, through shadowy front groups, rather than competing transparently on price and quality.” Google has a clear aim, which is to dislodge the legacy systems on which many government agencies rely, including Microsoft Outlook and Word. Meanwhile, Amazon wants to tilt the playing field in cloud computing, an area where it claims Microsoft has used unfair strategies by bundling software and cloud services together. Some observers believe that Musk’s network of mostly young engineers at DOGE may be open to these changes, given the agency’s stated mission to overhaul how the government spends money. Though these companies have historically relied on inside connections, they now find themselves appealing to a newer group of decision-makers. Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Service Administration, is a former software executive. He has met with trade groups about possible changes in how software licenses are purchased. On March 26, Federal Chief Information Officer Greg Barbaccia directed all federal agencies to compile an inventory of their licenses with the government’s five largest software providers. At the top of that list is Microsoft. Barbaccia once worked for Palantir, a firm founded by Peter Thiel, and he framed this move as part of an effort to stop what he called “wasteful spending.” Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa who founded the DOGE Caucus in the Senate, is championing legislation that would make agencies consolidate their software licenses and adopt updated enterprise license agreements. Ernst has cited estimates that such moves could save about $750 million every year. The House introduced its version of the legislation in late March. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and Google, has led the charge for new solutions. In a March letter to DOGE, NetChoice called Microsoft’s role in government software a “monopoly” and said it results in excessive prices and “abysmal cybersecurity performance.” A Government Accountability Office report estimated that the government invests over $100 billion every year on IT and cyber-related projects, including licenses. Leading software vendors by total payments reported by agencies in fiscal year 2021. Source: GAO analysis of agency data Microsoft alone accounted for 31% of software-license spending by 24 major federal agencies in fiscal year 2021. This total reached $2.4 billion and was roughly three times as much as its closest competitor. Exact figures for Microsoft’s total government business remain unclear, as the company does not share detailed data. Still, these numbers signal that the stakes are high for any company seeking to challenge Microsoft’s leadership. One tech lobbyist working with Microsoft’s rivals feels hopeful about chances for Google and Amazon in the face of DOGE’s emphasis on cost-cutting. That optimism grows from Musk’s earlier criticism of agencies for buying more software licenses than the number of workers who would actually use them, and for spending too much on those licenses. In an earlier podcast with Senator Ted Cruz, Musk said that in every government department, “there are far too many software licenses and media subscriptions, more than there are humans in the department.” Elon Musk speaking about government software spending in a podcast by Ted Cruz. Source: Verdict with Ted Cruz on YouTube Google spokesperson José Castañeda stated, “We’ve said for ages that government IT needs more competition to save taxpayers money and improve security, so it’s no surprise that legacy players prefer the status quo and criticize those who want change.” Microsoft has come under scrutiny from Musk’s circle for recent breaches and failures In 2023, Chinese state-affiliated hackers compromised Microsoft’s cloud environment, affecting tens of thousands of U.S. government emails, including accounts belonging to then-Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. There was a report in April 2024 from a government-appointed cyber advisory board that studied the hack and criticized Microsoft’s handling of the incident. It noted that the breach occurred just before a meeting between then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Then, in July 2024, a global failure tied to a faulty update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. disrupted Microsoft systems, halting airline flights and business operations worldwide. Critics seized on these events to argue that government reliance on Microsoft poses risks. Chris Mohr, president of the Software Information Industry Association, said in an interview that Microsoft’s dominance “led to systemic risk.” SIIA has Google and Amazon among its members. He believes DOGE is correct to say that software contracts could be handled more effectively to limit cybersecurity threats and cut costs. Some of the technology trade groups have zeroed in on just such solutions in their conversations with DOGE. They urge the agency to encourage competition in software contracts, claiming it can drive down costs and reduce security vulnerabilities. NetChoice, for example, has proposed measures aimed at blocking what it calls Microsoft’s “predatory” licensing deals, which it believes keep agencies from exploring rival offers. According to Amy Bos, NetChoice’s director of state and federal affairs who drafted the March 14 letter, the group was encouraged when DOGE said it was looking for cost-saving measures. She said, “We had something that was perfectly lined up for this.” The letter argues that removing Microsoft’s tight grip on government software would unlock billions in potential contracts for other firms. Microsoft counters that it earns its share by offering better deals and superior products. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

On April 4th alone, this whale purchased 4,100 ETH at a price of $1,785, spending approximately $7.32 million. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Since March 26th, the same wallet has accumulated a total of 33,441 ETH. Let’s break down the numbers: Total ETH Accumulated: 33,441 ETH Total USD Value (Approximate): $65.5 million Average Purchase Price: $1,959 per ETH Recent Purchase (April 4th): 4,100 ETH at $1,785 ($7.32 million) Period of Accumulation: Since March 26th To put this into perspective, $65.5 million is a substantial investment, even in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. This level of whale activity often indicates strong conviction in the asset’s future potential. But what exactly makes this accumulation noteworthy, and what could be driving this whale’s confidence in Ethereum? Why is ETH Accumulation by Whales Significant for the Crypto Market? Whale movements are often considered leading indicators in the crypto market for several reasons: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large accumulations like this can signal a bullish sentiment among major players. When whales, who have significant capital and often sophisticated market insights, start buying heavily, it can be interpreted as a sign that they anticipate price appreciation. Supply Dynamics: Significant ETH accumulation reduces the available supply of ETH on exchanges. If demand remains constant or increases, reduced supply can lead to upward pressure on prices. Trendsetter Behavior: Whale actions can sometimes trigger a herd effect. Observing large players accumulating an asset can instill confidence in smaller investors and traders, encouraging them to also buy, further driving up demand. Institutional Interest Proxy: While not always the case, whale activity can sometimes be a proxy for institutional interest. Large entities often operate through multiple wallets, making it challenging to pinpoint institutional involvement directly, but significant on-chain movements are often scrutinized for such clues. However, it’s crucial to remember that whale activity is just one piece of the puzzle. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While whale accumulation can be a positive signal, it’s not a guaranteed predictor of price movements. Decoding Whale Strategies: What Can We Learn from This ETH Accumulation? Understanding the ‘why’ behind such massive cryptocurrency investment is crucial. While we can only speculate on the whale’s exact motivations, here are a few possible scenarios: Long-Term Bullish Outlook on Ethereum: The whale may believe in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a leading blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. This accumulation could be a strategic move to position themselves for future growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. Anticipation of Ethereum Upgrades: Ethereum has been undergoing significant upgrades, including the transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) and ongoing scalability improvements. The whale might be anticipating that these upgrades will enhance Ethereum’s value proposition and drive price appreciation. Diversification and Portfolio Rebalancing: For large investors, diversification is key. This ETH accumulation could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy, shifting assets towards cryptocurrencies, and specifically Ethereum, based on perceived market opportunities. Strategic Market Timing: The whale may have identified the current price levels as attractive entry points. Accumulating ETH at an average price of $1,959 suggests a belief that Ethereum is undervalued at these levels and has significant upside potential. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain and others to track whale movements and significant transactions. This can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential trends. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow whale activity. Always conduct thorough research on projects, understand the underlying technology, and assess the risks involved before making any investment decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies, consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which can help mitigate the risks of market volatility. Manage Risk: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always diversify your portfolio across different asset classes. Ethereum’s Potential and Whale Confidence: A Look Ahead Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized web. Its robust ecosystem, active developer community, and ongoing technological advancements position it as a leading platform for innovation. This crypto market analysis of whale accumulation suggests that significant investors recognize this potential and are strategically positioning themselves for future growth. While the future of the crypto market remains uncertain, the actions of this smart whale provide an intriguing glimpse into the sentiment of large players. Whether this accumulation marks the beginning of a new bull run for Ethereum or simply reflects a strategic long-term investment, it underscores the importance of monitoring whale activity and staying informed in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Watching the Whales The recent $65 million ETH accumulation by a single whale serves as a powerful reminder of the significant influence large investors can have on the crypto market. While it’s essential to avoid blindly following any single market signal, understanding whale activity can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and managing risk effectively, crypto enthusiasts can navigate the exciting and often unpredictable world of digital assets with greater confidence.

As traditional markets reeled from the shockwaves of new tariff announcements, the crypto world, particularly Bitcoin, watched with bated breath. Powell’s recent statements offer crucial insights into the Fed’s current thinking and its potential implications for both traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what Powell’s words mean for the economy and your crypto portfolio. Decoding Powell’s Message: Federal Reserve’s Steady Hand Speaking at the SABEW conference, Jerome Powell addressed the elephant in the room – market volatility spurred by President Trump’s latest tariff initiatives. His message was clear: the Federal Reserve is adopting a wait-and-see approach. Despite the turbulence in the stock market, Powell indicated that the Fed is not yet ready to make immediate adjustments to its monetary policy . This stance suggests a level of confidence within the Fed that current market fluctuations, while significant, do not warrant immediate intervention. Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways from Powell’s address regarding the Federal Reserve ’s current position: Patience is Paramount: The Fed is prioritizing data analysis and seeking further clarity before making any policy shifts. This signals a cautious approach, avoiding knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations. Inflation Focus Remains: Powell reiterated the Fed’s primary focus on controlling inflation. He acknowledged the potential for tariff-driven price increases but characterized these as likely to be temporary. Ignoring External Pressure: Despite public calls from President Trump for interest rate cuts, Powell’s comments suggest the Fed remains independent and data-driven in its decision-making process. Monitoring Global Developments: While not explicitly stated in this excerpt, the Fed is undoubtedly keeping a close watch on global economic developments, which are increasingly interconnected with U.S. market stability. Jerome Powell on Inflation and Temporary Price Hikes A central theme in Jerome Powell ‘s remarks was the issue of inflation. He specifically addressed concerns that tariffs could lead to sustained price increases. However, Powell conveyed a sense of optimism, suggesting that the inflationary pressures resulting from tariffs are expected to be transient. This perspective is crucial for understanding the Fed’s reluctance to immediately alter its monetary policy . Powell’s confidence in the temporary nature of tariff-induced inflation likely stems from several factors: Supply Chain Adjustments: Businesses may find ways to mitigate tariff impacts by diversifying supply chains or absorbing some costs. Consumer Demand Elasticity: Increased prices due to tariffs could potentially dampen consumer demand, naturally limiting the extent of price increases. Broader Economic Factors: The Fed’s overall assessment of the economy, beyond tariffs, likely plays a significant role. If underlying economic conditions are deemed stable, temporary price shocks may be viewed as manageable. Navigating Market Turmoil : Powell’s Words as a Stabilizing Force? The timing of Powell’s speech was particularly significant. Coming on the heels of President Trump’s tariff announcement, which triggered a wave of selling in U.S. stocks, his words were closely scrutinized for any hints of reassurance or concern. The market turmoil was palpable, with investors seeking guidance amidst the uncertainty. Did Powell’s address calm the nerves, or did it add to the unease? While U.S. stocks continued their decline even after Powell’s comments, the reaction could have been far more severe. Powell’s steady demeanor and message of patience might have prevented a deeper plunge. In times of market turmoil , clear and consistent communication from central bank leaders is vital. Powell’s emphasis on data-driven decision-making and the Fed’s commitment to its mandate could be interpreted as a stabilizing force, assuring markets that policy responses will be measured and thoughtful, not reactive and impulsive. Monetary Policy Unchanged: What Does it Mean for Crypto? The Fed’s decision to hold steady on monetary policy has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. While traditional markets reacted negatively to the tariff news and Powell’s non-committal stance on immediate policy changes, Bitcoin displayed a surprising degree of stability. This divergence raises an interesting question: how does the current monetary policy landscape influence the crypto sphere, particularly Bitcoin ? Here are a few potential connections: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Stable Monetary Policy Reduced volatility compared to traditional markets reacting to policy uncertainty. Inflation Concerns (albeit temporary, according to Powell) Potential safe-haven appeal for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, even if perceived as temporary. Continued Low Interest Rate Environment (implied by no immediate policy shift) May encourage investors to seek higher-yield assets, potentially including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Global Economic Uncertainty Increased interest in decentralized and borderless assets like Bitcoin as alternatives to traditional systems. Bitcoin ‘s Resilience: A Digital Safe Haven in Turbulent Times? Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this market episode is Bitcoin ‘s relative stability. While U.S. stocks experienced a notable downturn, Bitcoin remained remarkably steady, hovering around the $83,000 mark. This resilience fuels the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin as a potential ‘digital gold’ or safe-haven asset, particularly in times of economic uncertainty and market turmoil . Why might Bitcoin be showing such resilience? Decentralization Appeal: Bitcoin operates outside the traditional financial system and is not directly influenced by central bank monetary policy decisions in the same way as traditional assets. Global Investor Base: Bitcoin ‘s global nature diversifies its investor base, potentially reducing sensitivity to specific regional economic shocks, such as U.S. tariff announcements. Limited Supply Narrative: The fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin coins continues to resonate with investors, particularly in inflationary environments or when fiat currencies face potential devaluation. Emerging Asset Class Status: Bitcoin is still considered by many as an emerging asset class with growth potential, attracting investors seeking diversification and higher returns, even amidst market turmoil . Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainty with a Watchful Eye Jerome Powell’s recent address provides a crucial snapshot of the Federal Reserve’s current thinking. His message of patience and focus on data, amidst market turmoil and external pressures, suggests a steady hand at the helm of U.S. monetary policy . For the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin , this period of uncertainty and traditional market volatility could further solidify its narrative as a resilient and potentially safe-haven asset. As we move forward, keeping a close watch on both traditional economic indicators and the evolving crypto landscape will be paramount for navigating the complexities of the global financial system.

China’s trade tariffs fueled a Bitcoin-led crypto rally. Ripple (XRP) sees gains China tariffs sparks crypto market recovery Ripple (XRP) price posted considerable gains on Friday climbing as high as $2.17, as China’s tariffs on the US introduce fresh volatility risks. The global crypto market cap erased losses from Wednesday’s sell-off as China announced retaliatory tariffs on Friday. Investors now fear these measures could impact revenues of U.S. firms worldwide, with concerns mounting as more countries consider retaliatory actions. Crypto market performance, April 4 | Source: Coingecko If the U.S. fails to find a diplomatic solution, equities could slide further, accelerating capital rotation into alternative assets. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against trade policy risks, prompting fund inflows into the crypto market. According to Coingecko data, the total market cap stabilised around $2.78 trillion, with major assets reclaiming key support levels—Bitcoin at $83,000, Ripple price at $2, and Ethereum breaking above $1,800. XRP Price Forecast: XRP Eyes $2.28 as Bullish Reversal Gains Momentum XRP price surged 12.54% in two days, reclaiming the $2.12 level amid strengthening bullish momentum. The rally coincides with an early MACD crossover and a recovery within the Bollinger Bands’ lower boundary. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential volatility expansion after XRP touched the lower band at $1.98 and rebounded sharply. The mid-band resistance at $2.28 aligns with the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $2.09, reinforcing a crucial test for sustained upside. Ripple (XRP) price analysis | Source: TradingView A breakout above these levels could fuel a rally toward $2.58, where the upper Bollinger Band sits. Meanwhile, MACD lines are narrowing, with the blue line approaching an upward crossover. If confirmed, this would mark a bullish reversal, echoing past rallies from similar levels. However, Bitcoin price forecast remains a critical factor, as BTC’s next move could influence XRP’s trajectory. If Bitcoin maintains bullish sentiment, XRP could benefit from broader market strength. Failure to break the $2.28 resistance could trigger another retest of $1.98 support, risking further declines. However, as long as XRP holds above the VWAP, the technical setup leans bullish, suggesting higher probability for further gains.

Martinez points to the bearish patterns on Ethereum’s monthly ETH/BTC chart, specifically mentioning a double-top or M pattern, signaling a 91% drop. If this happens, Ethereum could drop to as low as 0.0020 BTC from its current price of 0.02205 BTC, which is equivalent to $1,866 at Bitcoin’s $84,600 price, according to the market trends. The absence of whales also shows a drop in confidence, pushing investors to seek alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE amid Ethereum’s looming storm. Bitcoin’s Resistance Battle: A Death Cross Threat Martinez also discussed Bitcoin, noting that its recent drop below the 200-day and 50-day moving average, now acting as resistances at $86,200 and $88,300. As of April 04, 2025, Bitcoin trades at $84,600, down by 5% in the past week, with its daily volume around $32 billion, according to web data. Martinez has warned that the failure of the asset to break these levels could trigger a “death cross”, a bearish signal showing a likelihood of a further drop, which could see the asset moving to $80,000, as predicted by Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered. Bitcoin’s $1.6 trillion market cap also shows stability in the market, but its 19 million circulating supply might cause issues. With Bitcoin and Ethereum currently facing uncertainties, investors have been eyeing new opportunities to evade the market’s turbulence. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Breakout Moment: Targeting $1 As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to battle with the bears, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as the best option for investors, with the token aiming at $1 by 2025. Its presale raised about $5 million on April 04, with Stage 6 sold out at $0.000266 and a listing price of $0.007 securing the predicted 2,500% ROI. Analysts predict a 14,185% rise to push the asset to $1, which means a $100 investment could return $142,000. The project has also seen the support of its 50,000 supporter base, with about 10,000 joining every week across 30 countries in addition to its audit that was carried out by Hashex. Stage 7 is 90% sold out in days, with posts on X showing that whales’ interest is mirroring that of Ethereum but with higher chances of gain. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s DeFi lending push could ride on Ethereum’s woes, offering a high-growth alternative. ETH’s Crash vs. MAGACOIN’s Rise: A Shifting Tide Ethereum’s potential 91% drop to 0.0020 BTC–in addition to Bitcoin’s resistance at $88,300, paints a bad picture for the crypto giants. The $1.42 billion whale sell-offs in the Ethereum market and Bitcoin’s $32 billion volume have signaled caution, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 million presale in three months presents the best opportunity to investors. Investors fleeing from Ethereum because of its bearish M pattern see MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $1 target as the best opportunity, comparing it to the early 2021 Dogecoin run. While stability has met uncertainty in the BTC and ETH markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering investors the best opportunity for escape in the current shaky market.

One project making waves is BlockDAG (BDAG). Its ongoing presale has already brought in more than $211.5 million, selling over 19.1 billion coins at just $0.0248 during Batch 27. These numbers reflect strong backing and place BlockDAG among the best crypto projects in 2025 priced under $1. This momentum isn’t based on hype. BlockDAG uses DAG technology, works with both EVM and WASM, runs a live Beta Testnet, and offers a $30 million grant program for developers. These real features show it’s more than a typical altcoin. Built as a complete Layer 1 platform, it has actual use cases and a growing base, appealing to both individual buyers and larger entities. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem with Huge ROI Potential Among many digital coins, BlockDAG (BDAG) sets itself apart with a solid structure. Unlike older blockchain designs, it uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to handle many transactions at once. This design leads to better speed, quicker confirmations, and lower fees. Developers can also benefit from its EVM and WASM compatibility. This lets them build apps in different languages, making BlockDAG suitable for DeFi, NFTs, AI, and other tools with real-world use. These tech advantages help position it as one of the best crypto projects in 2025. Already, the project has a Beta Testnet running across more than 100 global nodes. Unlike projects that only have plans on paper during presale, BlockDAG is showing real-time network activity, boosting its standing among new digital assets. Why BDAG Attracts Whales in the Presale Phase The presale model used by BlockDAG is open and rewarding. At a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27, early backers have seen gains of 2,480% from the original price of $0.001 in Batch 1. With each batch climbing slightly in cost, those who joined early have already gained before the coin reaches any exchanges. If BDAG reaches $1 in 2025, as some experts predict after it launches on trading platforms and grows its system, early supporters could see profits of over 3,900%. This potential rise is why it’s often included in lists of the best crypto projects in 2025. Presale details include: Raised: Over $211.5 million Price: $0.0248 (Batch 27) Coins Sold: 19.1 billion+ ROI Since Batch 1: +2,480% Plans for 10 major centralized exchange (CEX) listings are underway. When trading begins, demand could rise quickly, making this one of the last chances to get BDAG before prices move up. These facts help rank BlockDAG among the best crypto projects in 2025. The Graph (GRT): A Key Data Indexing Tool The Graph plays a big role in making blockchain data searchable. Often called the “Google of blockchain,” GRT lets app creators access data across many blockchains, which is critical for building useful platforms. Priced near $0.10 and used by apps like Uniswap, Aave, and Lido, GRT keeps showing strength under $1. As more digital tools need indexed data, GRT is expected to benefit, and it remains among the best crypto projects in 2025. Sei (SEI): Speed-Focused Chain for DeFi Use Sei focuses on speed, ease of use, and large-scale function. Its Twin-Turbo method allows almost instant trades, giving it a clear edge over slower systems. World Liberty Financial’s support of Sei through a large deal has brought it more attention. With a current value of around $0.20, it provides fast tech and cross-chain support, making Sei another pick for those exploring the best crypto projects in 2025. Ethena (ENA): A Stablecoins with USDe Ethena brings something new to stablecoins with its USDe—a secure digital dollar backed by assets. The launch of the Converge blockchain with Securitize and other partnerships adds strength to its base. Its low price and expanding use make it a smart choice for those looking for hidden gems. ENA’s real-use direction helps keep it listed among the best crypto projects in 2025. Summing Up– Best Crypto Projects in 2025 Though The Graph, Sei, and Ethena are all solid options, BlockDAG holds a stronger position. Its active Testnet, scalable DAG tech, big presale returns, and upcoming exchange listings set it apart. Anyone checking out the best crypto projects in 2025 will see BDAG as a strong candidate under $1. With its active growth and strong start, BlockDAG could turn into one of the biggest gainers next year—and early participants are already positioned to benefit.

Official Trump ( TRUMP ) is trading at $9.03 at time of writing and is down more than 13% in the past 24 hours. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that slapped a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods entering the US, effective April 5th, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. The tariffs rattled global markets, with the S&P 500 plunging by 4.84% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite dropping by 5.97%. Trump’s announcement also battered the crypto sector, with the overall digital asset market cap taking a 6.5% hit. The president launched the Official Trump memecoin in mid-January, days before he took office. The asset has generated controversy in and out of crypto circles. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

Plume is gaining ground through its AI-based setup for real-world assets (RWAs). Pi Network is moving closer to daily use with its Visa card feature. And BlockDAG is standing out with its strong presale record, working features, and future expansion plans. With $211.5 million raised and 19.1 billion BDAG coins already sold, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best long-term cryptos to watch for 2025. Let’s look closer at these three best long-term cryptos leading the charts now, showing why BlockDAG is catching more eyes than the rest. BlockDAG (BDAG) Unlike other crypto presales that lean on future goals, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already live with working features and a fast-growing system. In Batch 27, over 19.1 billion coins were sold at $0.0248, drawing interest from thousands of people who have poured in over $211.5 million in record time. A major reason behind BlockDAG’s rise as one of the best long-term cryptos is its core Layer 1 system using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tech. It can handle transactions at the same time instead of one by one like Ethereum. This leads to instant results, no delay, and much lower fees, making it better for regular users, builders, and teams. One more strength lies in its support for both WASM and EVM tools. People building apps can use familiar coding tools while enjoying the speed of DAG-based systems. This mix of ease and fast action has made it popular among DeFi users and app creators. BlockDAG also brings working features like the TG Tap Miner game with over 250,000 players, the X1 Miner App downloaded over 800,000 times, and a full mainnet coming after the testnet in March. These parts are not just ideas—they are working now. There’s more for the community, too. The project has ways for people to earn through staking, referrals, and task rewards. A $30 million grant effort and tie-ups with groups like SpaceDev and HackerEarth are helping to bring in more skilled builders. In an area where many talk big before building anything, BlockDAG has done the opposite—creating first, then spreading the word. This is why BDAG stands as one of the best long term cryptos right now. With exchange listings planned in 2025 and a clear push toward $1, it’s drawing strong interest. Plume (PLUME) Plume is working to become the base for handling real-world asset tokenization. With more than 180 protocols on board and over 18 million wallets linked to its testnet, it’s proving itself as a solid platform for serious financial data and tools. A key edge for Plume is its use of Pond, which adds strong AI tools like credit checks, risk checks, and forecast-based NAV tools into its RWA systems. This setup is not just about blockchain use—it’s helping improve smarter financial planning by using clear, on-chain info. With laws getting clearer around RWAs, tools like Plume might help close the gap between common finance and DeFi. Pi Network (PI) Pi Network is making headlines as it pushes toward real-world function. It recently added Visa card access through Teltlk International, letting people use Pi Coin and USDT for services like Amazon, Apple Pay, and eBay. It’s also adding more features like direct Pi withdrawals, faster access to funds, better KYC steps, and new learning tools through Web3 College. Pi is clearly aiming to be more than just a mining app—it wants to become a full system for payments and learning. Even though Pi still faces hurdles in terms of clear rules and listings, its strong focus on payments may help it reach people outside the usual crypto crowd. Final Thoughts All three—BlockDAG, Plume, and Pi—are building in different directions: one focuses on real payments, one on AI-linked tools for finance, and one on a system that can scale fast. But what sets BlockDAG apart among the best long-term cryptos is how much it has already done—offering DAG-based processing, dApp support, mobile mining, staking, and live tools. Its presale has now passed $211.5 million, and it has sold more than 19.1 billion coins. The testnet is already live, top exchange listings are coming, and there’s a big goal to launch 1,000+ dApps by 2026. For anyone checking the best long term cryptos with real products and early chances for growth, BDAG is clearly worth keeping an eye on.

Forget mundane software updates and integration challenges; the latest headline involves accusations of corporate espionage, secret crypto payments, and a full-blown legal battle between HR giants Rippling and Deel. This isn’t your typical HR Tech Lawsuit ; it’s a high-stakes drama unfolding in Silicon Valley, and it’s captivating the tech industry. Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast is dissecting every twist and turn, and we’re here to bring you up to speed on this explosive saga. The Genesis of the HR Tech Lawsuit: Rippling vs Deel What started as fierce competition in the HR software market has escalated into a dramatic legal showdown. Rippling has publicly accused Deel of engaging in corporate espionage, alleging that Deel paid a Rippling employee to act as an inside mole. The lawsuit claims that Deel orchestrated a scheme involving secret cryptocurrency payments to obtain confidential information from Rippling. According to Rippling’s filing, the employee was allegedly tasked with feeding sensitive data to Deel, painting a picture of calculated infiltration. Deel vehemently denies these accusations, dismissing the lawsuit as a theatrical distraction from Rippling’s own legal woes. Key Allegations in the Rippling vs Deel HR Tech Lawsuit: Corporate Espionage: Rippling accuses Deel of paying a Rippling employee to spy and leak confidential company information. Secret Crypto Payments: The lawsuit details alleged payments made in cryptocurrency to the employee, suggesting an attempt to obscure the transactions. Fake Slack Channel Trap: Rippling claims to have set a trap using a fake Slack channel to catch the alleged mole in action. Smashing the Evidence: Adding a touch of dark comedy to the drama, there’s even an allegation of the employee smashing his corporate espionage phone with an ax at his mother-in-law’s house – described as “the oldest trick in the book” by Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast hosts. Why This Startup Rivalry Exploded into Espionage Claims? The rivalry between Rippling and Deel is no secret. Both companies are major players in the rapidly growing HR tech space, offering comprehensive platforms for payroll, benefits, and HR management, often targeting similar customer segments. This intense startup rivalry in a competitive market can sometimes push boundaries, but the allegations in this HR Tech Lawsuit are unprecedented. The lawsuit highlights the intense pressure and high stakes in the tech industry, where access to competitive intelligence can be perceived as a critical advantage. But is this just aggressive business tactics gone wrong, or a genuine case of corporate espionage? The legal proceedings are likely to be lengthy and revealing. Beyond Rippling Deel: Other Headlines from Bitcoin World’s Equity Podcast While the Rippling Deel saga dominates headlines, Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast also covered other crucial developments in the tech and crypto space this week: Gamifying Tax Filing: A startup is attempting to make tax filing less painful by turning it into a game. However, this innovative approach raises complex copyright questions that the industry is grappling with. Circle’s IPO Ambitions: Stablecoin giant Circle is reportedly moving closer to an IPO. This move is significant for the crypto industry, potentially signaling increased maturity and mainstream acceptance, and could pave the way for other crypto firms to go public. The Relentless AI Race: The AI sector continues its breakneck pace of innovation and investment. Key highlights include OpenAI’s record-breaking funding round, challenges related to GPU availability and performance, Anthropic’s plans to introduce its AI chatbot to colleges, and leadership changes at Google’s Gemini project. The AI race is not just about technological advancements but also about market dominance and ethical considerations. Actionable Insights from the HR Tech Drama and Beyond This Corporate Espionage case, while dramatic, offers some crucial takeaways for businesses and individuals in the tech and crypto space: Insight Description Data Security is Paramount The Rippling Deel lawsuit underscores the critical importance of robust data security measures and employee monitoring to prevent internal threats and data breaches. Competitive Intelligence Ethics While competitive intelligence is a legitimate business practice, this case raises questions about the ethical boundaries and legal ramifications of aggressive tactics, particularly when they cross into espionage. Crypto in Corporate Espionage The alleged use of cryptocurrency for payments in this case highlights the anonymity and potential for misuse of crypto in illicit activities, even in the corporate world. Startup Rivalry Intensity The HR tech sector, and the startup ecosystem in general, is characterized by intense competition. Companies need to be prepared for aggressive tactics from rivals and ensure they operate within legal and ethical boundaries. Conclusion: Spy Games and High Stakes in the Tech World The Rippling vs Deel lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a stark reminder of the high stakes and intense competition in the tech industry. The allegations of corporate espionage, secret payments, and dramatic attempts to cover tracks paint a picture of a cutthroat business environment where the lines between aggressive competition and illegal activity can become blurred. As the legal battle unfolds, the tech world will be watching closely, not just for the outcome, but for the lessons it offers about ethics, security, and the true cost of winning in the relentless race for market dominance. The drama in the HR Tech Lawsuit is just beginning, and it promises to be a wild ride.

42920274,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705788,1743811306,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42920274.jpeg,US Senator Ted Cruz warns about an upcoming bloodbath,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/senator-ted-cruz-warns-bloodbath/,"Republican senator Ted Cruz warned on Friday about a potential “bloodbath” in the 2026 midterm elections if President Donald Trump’s tariffs drag the United States economy into a recession. According to Financial Times , the Texas lawmaker said a long-term trade war could have devastating effects on both the economy and Republican political prospects. Cruz typically aligns with Trump, but his remarks were unusually blunt. He called the possibility of an ongoing conflict with retaliatory tariffs from other nations “a terrible outcome.” In his view, if the tariff standoff leads to a recession, “particularly a bad recession,” voters could turn sharply against the party in power. “2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath,” Cruz said. The Canada-born Texan added that even the Republican Senate majority, currently 53-47, might not survive if the economy sours and people blame the party leading the country. Republican lawmakers have begun to share these concerns. Their unease intensified when the stock market shed about $5.4 trillion in value after Trump’s so-called “liberation day” levies launched a global market retreat. Observers worry that ongoing trade tensions could hurt U.S. exporters, harm jobs, and worsen inflation if the measures remain in place indefinitely. Democrats want to undo the tariffs On Thursday, Republican senator Chuck Grassley joined forces with a Democrat to introduce a bill that would reassert congressional authority over tariff policy. Under the proposed law, new tariffs would expire in 60 days unless Congress voted to keep them in place. Lawmakers would also have the power to revoke existing levies. By Friday, Republican senators Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, Jerry Moran, and Thom Tillis had signed on as co-sponsors. Although the bill may not advance, the growing support suggests that many in the party are wary of the president’s approach and fear potential fallout ahead of the 2026 midterms. Signs of discontent emerged this week when a conservative candidate backed by Elon Musk lost a state supreme court race in Wisconsin to a liberal opponent. Republicans also underperformed their 2024 results in two special House elections in Florida. These setbacks added fuel to doubts that the current trade policy will help the party maintain control of both chambers of Congress. Cruz said that if the U.S. is in the middle of a recession and “people are hurting badly,” they will likely turn on the GOP. “They punish the party in power.” Cruz also disputed Trump’s claim that tariffs will usher in “a booming economy.” He suggested that there would only be “an enormous economic boom” if the U.S. and any retaliating countries lowered duty rates across the board. Otherwise, if tariffs become permanent, he predicted “real damage” to the economy and warned that a full-blown trade war “would destroy jobs here at home.” It would also “have a powerful upward impact on inflation,” the senator cautioned. He warned that further escalation could lock the country into lasting harm. ​ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

But unlike earlier cycles dominated by hype-only tokens, this quarter’s leading meme coins are backed by real use cases, scarcity-focused tokenomics, and structured roadmaps. Meme coins are maturing—and some are starting to resemble full-scale platforms rather than temporary trends. Among the projects gaining traction, Dragoin ($DDGN) is emerging as one of the most promising. While several meme coins are still finding their footing, Dragoin’s presale model, gaming utility, and decentralization plan are already turning heads. For investors eyeing meme coins with real upside this quarter, Dragoin and a select few others stand out as strong candidates. Dragoin Combines Utility, Scarcity, & Structure Dragoin takes a different approach from the average meme coin. Rather than relying on internet buzz alone, it delivers actual user interaction through a Telegram-based play-to-earn game. Players can hatch dragons, train them, and battle—all while earning $DDGN tokens based on their activity. This kind of gamified utility transforms holders into engaged participants. Its presale adds another layer of strength. Structured into 25 stages, each with a slight price increase, it creates steady upward momentum while rewarding early buyers. Out of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens, 50% are allocated to the presale. Any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation—a strategy that directly reduces supply over time. This deflationary approach matters. As Dragoin’s game rolls out to a broader audience in Q2 and interest grows, reduced supply paired with rising demand can help support long-term price growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely on sudden virality, Dragoin is strategically building a player base while tightening its token supply. At the end of the presale, ownership of Dragoin’s smart contract will be renounced, making the project fully decentralized. No central figure will hold control. This shift appeals to investors looking for transparency and protection against centralized manipulation. With key features like staking rewards, airdrops, referral bonuses, and listings on major exchanges planned for Q2 and Q3, Dragoin appears well-positioned for sustained momentum. Its combination of meme appeal, gameplay, and token strategy places it among the top new meme coins to buy right now—and potentially throughout 2025. Cheems Attempts a Strategic Pivot in Q2 Cheems remains a well-known meme coin, mostly thanks to its iconic image and lighthearted branding. However, Q2 2025 marks a shift in strategy, as the team introduces charitable initiatives and new staking rewards aimed at rewarding long-term commitment. One of Cheems’ consistent strengths is its strong community. Through regular contests, giveaways, and creator partnerships, the project continues to maintain solid engagement. Still, its deep ties to nostalgia may hold back broader growth, especially in a meme coin space that’s shifting toward functionality. Cheems could still deliver in the short term, but its long-term viability depends on how far it can evolve beyond its meme roots. MEMEX Offers Index-Like Exposure to Meme Coins MEMEX, also known as Meme Index, introduces a fresh way to invest in the meme coin sector. Instead of buying individual tokens, holders get access to a basket of trending meme coins—all bundled into a single asset. This concept is similar to an ETF, giving investors diversified exposure without the need to track multiple charts. With dynamic adjustments and automated tracking of meme coin trends, MEMEX simplifies decision-making. It’s not focused on riding a single project to massive returns. Instead, it spreads risk across the space, allowing holders to benefit from overall momentum in the meme coin market. While MEMEX may lack the viral pull of Dragoin or Cheems, it serves as a lower-risk entry point for those who prefer a more hands-off approach. Why Functional Meme Coins Have the Edge in Q2 Early signs in Q2 suggest a shift in investor priorities. While speculation is still part of the game, many traders are gravitating toward meme coins that offer real engagement, transparent economics, and community ownership. Dragoin represents this shift well. Its focus on utility, paired with a supply-reducing presale and a clear product launch timeline, makes it more than just another meme. The project invites users to play, earn, and contribute—not just buy and hold. From its 25-stage token rollout to its upcoming staking features and decentralization, Dragoin has multiple growth levers in place. Cheems and MEMEX still play meaningful roles—Cheems with its community base and MEMEX with its passive investment model. But it’s Dragoin that offers the full package for investors looking ahead. As capital continues rotating into meme coins with substance, Dragoin’s setup positions it well for a breakout quarter and potentially a standout year.

Filed by plaintiff Andrew Willoughby, the suit alleges Capital One Financial Corporation, Capital One N.A. and Capital One Bank (USA) N.A. entities exposed its customers’ personal identifiable information (PII) due to an employee’s negligence. The suit alleges that because of inadequately protected computer systems, customers’ names, Social Security numbers, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, credit card numbers, transaction history, and other financial information exposed via a data breach. The breach happened between August 11, 2022 and May 22, 2023, when an “unauthorized actor” accessed client PII due to the employee’s “failure to maintain an adequate security system,” according to the lawsuit. The Capital One employee also allegedly delayed informing the plaintiffs of what happened in time to save them from potential identity theft crimes. Says the complaint, “Due to Defendants’ negligence, cybercriminals obtained everything they need to commit identity theft and wreak havoc on the financial and personal lives of thousands of individuals… Defendants were negligent and failed to inform Plaintiff and the Class Members of the data breach in time for them to protect themselves from identity theft.” Now, the suit alleges that “for the rest of their lives,” Capital One customers will have to face the threat of identity thieves possessing or misusing their personal information via the dark web. “The unencrypted PII of Plaintiff and Class Members may end up for sale on the dark web or simply fall into the hands of companies that will use the detailed PII for targeted marketing without the approval of Plaintiff and Class Members. Unauthorized individuals can easily access the PII of Plaintiff and Class Members.” Capital One was also recently accused of engaging in “cancel culture” by President Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump. The bank has $490.1 billion in total assets as of the end of last year.

42920353,https://coingape.com/?p=247399,1743811747,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Rules Dollar-Backed Stablecoins Are Not Securities Under Federal Laws,https://coingape.com/us-sec-rules-dollar-backed-stablecoins-are-not-securities-under-federal-laws/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that certain stablecoins, specifically those backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar, do not qualify as securities under federal laws. This decision helps provide greater regulatory clarity in the growing field of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. US SEC Defines Covered Stablecoins In a recent statement, after the US SEC’s incoming chair got voted in by the Senate committee , the Division of Corporation Finance defined “Covered Stablecoins” as those stablecoins that maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. These tokens are backed by assets held in a reserve, which are low-risk and highly liquid, ensuring that they can always be redeemed for U.S. dollars at a one-to-one ratio. The SEC has noted that such stablecoins are intended to be used for payment, transferring of money and for value storage rather than being investment products. The SEC provided an opinion that the process of minting and redeeming these stablecoins does not fall under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act. Consequently, any parties that engage in the issuance and circulation of these stablecoins are not regulated nor required to abide by the US securities laws or register with the US SEC. Marketing of Stablecoins Clarified The US SEC further detailed that Covered Stablecoins are marketed as a stable and reliable medium of exchange, with no promise of profits or returns. In its statement, the SEC noted that these are not advertised as investments and do not provide holders with any governance rights or financial returns based on the issuer’s performance. By clarifying the marketing strategies surrounding these stablecoins, the SEC aims to prevent any confusion about their classification as securities. This moves comes post the U.S. passing the STABLE Act , establishing a regulatory framework for USD-pegged. The SEC’s statement also addresses the importance of maintaining a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. These stablecoins are not meant to fluctuate in price like other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. As a result, their primary role is to facilitate transactions and act as a stable store of value rather than to generate financial returns for holders. Reserve Requirements for Stablecoins The SEC further elaborated that Covered Stablecoins are presented as a stable store of value and medium of exchange that cannot faithfully fill the role of a security promising profits or returns. The SEC, in its statement, stated that they are not promoted as an investment and they do not give the holders any rights or any type of financial returns on the issuer. In this respect, the mission of the US SEC is to define the marketing strategies concerning them in order to avoid any misunderstanding of their nature. The SEC also gives emphasis on the company maintaining stable price that does not fluctuate with the U.S dollar. These coins are relatively stable compared to other cryptocurrencies like the Bitcoin or the Ethereum because they are designed to have fixed values. Consequently, their main functions are to be used as a medium of exchange and serve as a unit of account instead of producing revenue for owners. SEC’s Application of Reves and Howey Tests According to the findings of the legal analysis, the defends used two legal benchmarks known as Reves and Howey tests to establish if the asset is a security. Under the Reves test, the SEC has held that Covered Stablecoins are akin to traditional commercial instruments as opposed to securities. Another reason is the Howey test that emphasizes that these buyers use these assets for commercial reasons with the expectation of gains other than in the form of profits. Based on its decision, the SEC decided that Covered Stablecoins do not fall under the securities definition under the federal securities laws. This decision is founded on the fact they are mainly used as a medium of exchange, and not as an investment vehicle backed by readily saleable assets. This clarification from the SEC comes as Congress continues to work on cryptocurrency legislation. While the SEC’s stance provides clarity on stablecoins, it does not address other digital assets, such as yield-bearing tokens , which may fall under securities regulations. The move aligns with ongoing efforts in the U.S. government to regulate digital assets and cryptocurrency more comprehensively.

The Wisconsin project would be the latest in a series of large data centers being built in the United States. Meta and Wisconsin struck up a significant project that will bring changes to the AI sector Wisconsin struck an incentive agreement in February with an unidentified business operating under a false identity to build a data center in the state with an anticipated $837 million multiyear investment. Based on a statement retrieved from an individual whose identity was disclosed because the information was confidential stated that Meta was the firm in charge of the project . On the other hand, an official from Meta chose not to comment. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation commented on this topic. It raised discussions based on the unidentified business it struck a project with, stating that after a contract was approved, its practice was to list the businesses with which it collaborates. Notably, in recent years, to meet the demands of cloud computing and increasingly complex artificial intelligence models, major tech companies have hurried to increase the capacity of their data centers. For instance, Meta stated that it intends to invest up to $65 billion this year, concentrating on developing AI-related infrastructure, including a sizable facility in Louisiana. In addition, it is worth noting that it already operates data centers in the Midwest, including DeKalb, a suburb of Chicago, and Iowa. Several companies have also eyed Wisconsin as a data center construction site promoting AI innovation Meta implements AI in all areas of its operations, which impacts how Facebook and Instagram target users with advertisements and arrange content in users’ feeds. Additionally, the company uses it in its consumer hardware, such as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and Meta Quest headsets. Following the company’s growing interest in AI, CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed investors that he expected Meta to eventually invest hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence in late January. Furthermore, apart from Meta, other companies have also shown interest in building data centers in Wisconsin. For example, hyperscalers recently found Wisconsin a desirable data center construction site. In addition, Microsoft Corp. is building what may be one of its most powerful facilities south of Milwaukee, located in the state of Wisconsin. Another company on this list is OpenAI’s Stargate venture. The firm stated that Wisconsin was one of the states it was considering for growth. However, in light of Microsoft’s pullback, the rise of less expensive AI models, and the possible effects of tariffs, investors have questioned whether the rate of data center construction was sustainable. The Beaver Dam project promises significant benefits to the local community and region In February, a local economic development authority, the Beaver Dam Area Development Corporation, mentioned that future economic benefits from this project could greatly impact the community and region. That month, the city’s economic development entity stated that it was collaborating with Alliant Energy Corp. on the project and had already authorized water and development agreements. However, according to the group, the project is still pending finalization and non-local approvals. Earlier, a representative for Alliant Energy assured people that more details would be released soon, stating that the company was currently in the “exploratory and due diligence phases” of a possible Beaver Dam project.

Pundit Explains What’s Happening,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-next-direction/,"A crypto analyst has shared insights into the recent strength in the XRP price, suggesting that South Korea may be the reason behind it. The analyst noted that the altcoin has been seeing high trading volume on South Korean exchanges, and this localized demand may be holding up its price while other altcoins struggle to gain traction. How South Korea Is Bolstering The Price According to XForceGlobal South Korea is currently one of the major drivers of the XRP price action. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the analyst disclosed that the engagement and adoption from the crypto users in South Korea was a major contributor to XRP’s bullish performance. Related Reading: Analyst Unveils Extended XRP Price Target To $44, Reveals When To Take Profits Currently, South Korea is one of the most active crypto markets in the world, leading in global trading volume across multiple assets. However, among the numerous cryptocurrencies in the market, XRP stands out the most within the country. The analyst has revealed that even during low trading days, XRP frequently outpaces Bitcoin, underscoring its high demand and adoption in South Korea. XForceGlobal has suggested that South Korea’s notable interest in XRP likely stems from its status as one of the most isolated countries in terms of crypto regulations. The analyst revealed that millions of citizens currently own the altcoin, making up about 20% of the cryptocurrency’s market cap valuation. Moreover, due to a lack of large-scale cross-border payment solutions, most South Koreans opt to use cryptocurrencies like XRP to facilitate transactions. This, in turn, fuels adoption and strengthens the cryptocurrency’s utility, which positively influences its price action. Compared to South Korea, the regulatory uncertainties and legal challenges in the United States (US) have slowed down XRP’s growth. XForceGlobal has stated that the active participation of retail institutions, strong community support, and early adoption in South Korea have helped prop up prices despite the difficulties it faced over the past years. What The Future Holds For XRP In South Korea While discussing the impact of South Korea’s support for XRP on its price action, XForceGlobal offered insights into the cryptocurrency’s future in the country. The analyst revealed that the market is at a pivotal moment where XRP has evolved from a speculative asset to a symbol of Korea’s dominance in the crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Descending Trendline, Why A Surge To $4 Is Still In The Cards Currently, Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in South Korea, holds the most significant market share of XRP in terms of total supply. The exchange reportedly has about 6 billion XRP, accounting for roughly 5% of the entire supply. XForceGlobal has revealed that the continued demand from retail investors combined with Upbit’s massive XRP reserve will make South Korea a key driver to the cryptocurrency’s global future price action. Moving forward, the analyst has discussed XRP’s price movements on the Korean won chart, suggesting that its current action may be foreshadowing upcoming events. He pointed out that the altcoin has already formed a lower low on the chart, possibly hinting at a more controlled pullback rather than an impulsive decline — an outlook he described as “arguably bearish”. The crypto analyst also noted that XRP may be forming a potential bottom on the Korean won chart, indicating a possible impulse to the upside and a bullish continuation.

For those in the crypto space keeping an eye on technological advancements, understanding the cost and capabilities of AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro is crucial. Why? Because AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain and crypto, from enhancing security to predicting market trends. Let’s dive into why Gemini 2.5 Pro is turning heads, and emptying wallets, in the tech world. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Setting New Benchmarks in AI Performance Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro isn’t just another AI model; it’s positioned as a leader, boasting industry-leading performance across several critical benchmarks. These benchmarks are essentially the gold standard for measuring an AI’s prowess in areas like: Coding: Evaluating how well the AI can understand, generate, and debug code. Reasoning: Testing the AI’s ability to solve complex problems and make logical inferences. Math: Assessing the AI’s mathematical and analytical skills. According to Google, Gemini 2.5 Pro excels in these areas, suggesting a significant leap forward in AI capabilities. But with great power comes a great price tag, and in this case, a surprisingly hefty one. Decoding the AI Model Pricing: What Does Gemini 2.5 Pro Cost? Let’s break down the numbers to understand why Gemini 2.5 Pro is being called Google’s most expensive AI model to date. The pricing structure is based on tokens, which are essentially units of text. Here’s the breakdown: Prompt Length Input Tokens (per million) Output Tokens (per million) Up to 200,000 tokens $1.25 $10.00 Greater than 200,000 tokens $2.50 $15.00 To put this into perspective, 200,000 tokens are roughly equivalent to 150,000 words, far exceeding the length of the entire “Lord of The Rings” series. For most standard use cases, the lower pricing tier applies. However, for extremely large inputs, the price doubles for input tokens and increases by 50% for output tokens. This tiered pricing is noteworthy because it caters to a broader range of applications, but at a premium. Google AI Pricing Compared: Gemini 2.5 Pro vs. The Competition When we stack Gemini 2.5 Pro against other AI models, the “expensive” label becomes even clearer. Consider these comparisons: Gemini 2.0 Flash: A more budget-friendly Google offering at $0.10/M input and $0.40/M output tokens. Gemini 2.5 Pro is significantly pricier. OpenAI’s o3-mini: Priced at $1.10/M input and $4.40/M output tokens, still cheaper than Gemini 2.5 Pro. DeepSeek’s R1: An even more affordable option at $0.55/M input and $2.19/M output tokens. Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet: At $3/M input and $15/M output tokens, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is more expensive for input tokens but matches Gemini 2.5 Pro’s output token price at the higher tier. OpenAI’s GPT-4.5: A truly premium model, costing a staggering $75/M input and $150/M output tokens, dwarfing even Gemini 2.5 Pro’s cost. While Gemini 2.5 Pro is indeed expensive compared to many models, it’s positioned in a complex pricing landscape. It’s more costly than some but cheaper than the absolute top-tier models like GPT-4.5 and even Claude 3.7 Sonnet in certain scenarios. Why the High Price Tag? Demand and Computing Costs So, why are we seeing this upward trend in pricing for flagship AI models? Several factors are likely at play: High Demand: According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Gemini 2.5 Pro is their most in-demand AI model. This high demand, reflected in an 80% usage increase in Google’s AI Studio and Gemini API this month alone, naturally drives up prices. Computing Costs: Training and running these advanced AI models require immense computational power, translating to significant infrastructure costs. These costs are inevitably passed down to developers. Performance and Features: Gemini 2.5 Pro offers extended context windows (handling prompts over 200,000 tokens), a feature not widely supported by competitors. This advanced capability justifies a higher price point for users needing to process massive amounts of data. The tech industry’s initial reaction to Gemini 2.5 Pro’s AI model pricing has been surprisingly positive. Developers seem to appreciate the perceived value for money, acknowledging the performance gains justify the cost. However, the broader trend of increasing prices for top-tier models is undeniable. OpenAI’s o1-pro, for instance, is even more expensive than Gemini 2.5 Pro, signaling a potential new normal in AI pricing. Actionable Insights for Developers and Crypto Enthusiasts For developers, especially those in the crypto and blockchain space looking to integrate AI, here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Needs: Carefully assess your project’s requirements. Do you truly need the cutting-edge performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro, or could a more cost-effective model like Gemini 2.0 Flash or DeepSeek’s R1 suffice? Optimize Prompts: Efficient prompt engineering can reduce token usage, thereby lowering costs. Focus on clear, concise prompts to minimize unnecessary token consumption. Monitor Usage: Keep a close eye on your AI usage to avoid unexpected expenses. Utilize Google’s AI Studio or API dashboards to track token consumption. Explore Free Tier: Gemini 2.5 Pro is available for free with strict rate limits. This could be sufficient for initial testing and smaller projects. For crypto enthusiasts, the pricing trend in AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro highlights the increasing value and cost of advanced computation. As AI becomes more integral to blockchain technology, understanding these cost dynamics will be crucial for future developments and integrations. Conclusion: Is Gemini 2.5 Pro Worth the Investment? Gemini 2.5 Pro is undoubtedly a powerful and advanced Google AI model, setting new standards in various benchmarks. Its expensive AI model pricing reflects its premium capabilities and the high demand it commands. Whether it’s worth the investment depends entirely on your specific needs and budget. For projects requiring top-tier performance and the ability to process massive datasets, Gemini 2.5 Pro could be a game-changer. However, for less demanding tasks, more affordable alternatives might be more practical.

The explosive rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot app, is sending shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Surging to the top of app store charts, DeepSeek is not just another chatbot; it’s a statement. Trained with groundbreaking compute-efficient techniques, DeepSeek’s AI models are forcing analysts to rethink the AI landscape and the future demand for AI chips. But what exactly is DeepSeek, and why is it suddenly a global phenomenon? Let’s dive into the story of this game-changing AI player. DeepSeek AI Chatbot: From Hedge Fund to AI Frontrunner DeepSeek’s origins are rooted in the world of high finance. Backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund, DeepSeek leverages AI’s power for more than just market predictions. Founded by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, High-Flyer Capital Management has been deploying AI algorithms in trading since 2019. In 2023, the company expanded its vision, establishing DeepSeek as a dedicated AI research lab, separate from its core financial operations. This lab then spun off into its own entity, retaining the name DeepSeek, with High-Flyer as a key investor. This unique background gives DeepSeek a financially robust foundation and a deep understanding of leveraging AI for complex problem-solving. From its inception, DeepSeek prioritized infrastructure, building its own data center clusters for model training. However, like other Chinese AI innovators, DeepSeek faces headwinds from US export restrictions on advanced hardware. To train its cutting-edge models, DeepSeek has reportedly utilized Nvidia H800 chips, a less powerful alternative to the H100 chips favored by US companies. Despite these hardware limitations, DeepSeek’s technical team, known for its youth and aggressive recruitment of top doctorate AI researchers from leading Chinese universities, has achieved remarkable progress. Interestingly, DeepSeek also diversifies its talent pool by hiring individuals from non-computer science backgrounds, enriching its tech development with broader perspectives. Unveiling DeepSeek’s Powerful AI Models DeepSeek burst onto the AI scene in November 2023 with its initial suite of models: DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. However, it was the spring 2024 release of the next-generation DeepSeek-V2 family that truly captured the AI industry’s attention. DeepSeek-V2, a versatile system capable of analyzing both text and images, demonstrated exceptional performance across various AI benchmarks. Crucially, it offered this performance at a significantly lower operational cost than comparable models available at the time. This cost-efficiency sent ripples through the industry, compelling domestic competitors like ByteDance and Alibaba to slash prices for their own models and even offer some for free. The subsequent launch of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 only solidified DeepSeek’s growing reputation as a major disruptor. According to DeepSeek’s internal testing, DeepSeek V3 surpasses both open-source models like Meta’s Llama and closed models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o in performance. Further amplifying DeepSeek’s prowess is its R1 “reasoning” model, launched in January. DeepSeek asserts that R1 rivals OpenAI’s o1 model on critical benchmarks. Reasoning models like R1 excel in self-correction, mitigating common errors and enhancing reliability, particularly in complex domains such as physics, science, and mathematics. While reasoning models might take slightly longer to generate solutions, the increased accuracy and dependability they offer are invaluable in fields demanding precision. Here’s a quick comparison of DeepSeek’s key models: Model Description Key Features Release Date DeepSeek Coder Code generation model Efficient code synthesis, supports multiple programming languages November 2023 DeepSeek LLM Large Language Model General-purpose language understanding and generation November 2023 DeepSeek Chat Chatbot application Conversational AI interface, powered by DeepSeek LLM November 2023 DeepSeek-V2 General-purpose text and image analysis Improved performance, cost-efficient operation Spring 2024 DeepSeek-V3 Next-gen general-purpose model Outperforms Llama and GPT-4o in internal benchmarks December 2024 DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Model Self-correcting, high reliability in complex domains, rivals OpenAI’s o1 January 2025 The Shadow of Regulation: Navigating Chinese AI Benchmarks Despite its technical achievements, DeepSeek, as a Chinese-developed AI, operates within a unique regulatory landscape. Its models are subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure alignment with “core socialist values.” This oversight manifests in DeepSeek’s chatbot app, where certain politically sensitive topics, such as Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy, are off-limits. This content filtering is a crucial aspect to understand when evaluating DeepSeek’s capabilities and potential applications in a global context. DeepSeek’s Market Impact and Disruptive Approach DeepSeek’s rapid ascent is undeniable. In March, it recorded over 16.5 million website visits, positioning it as a significant player in the AI arena, second only to ChatGPT, although still trailing far behind in user engagement. What’s particularly intriguing is DeepSeek’s business model, or rather, the apparent lack thereof. The company offers its products and services at prices significantly below market averages, with some even provided for free. Adding to the mystery, DeepSeek is reportedly not actively seeking investor funding, despite considerable VC interest. DeepSeek attributes its extreme cost competitiveness to efficiency breakthroughs, although some experts have questioned the validity of these claims. Regardless, developers are flocking to DeepSeek’s models, which, while not fully open-source, are available under permissive licenses allowing commercial use. Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue reports over 500 derivative models of R1 created by developers on their platform, amassing over 2.5 million downloads. DeepSeek: An AI Revolution or Overhyped Threat? DeepSeek’s impact is undeniable. Its success has been described as both “upending AI” and “over-hyped,” highlighting the polarized opinions surrounding its rapid rise. Notably, DeepSeek’s momentum contributed to an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price in January and even prompted a public statement from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The US government is also taking notice, with the Commerce Department reportedly banning DeepSeek on government devices. Conversely, Microsoft has embraced DeepSeek, integrating it into its Azure AI Foundry service. Even Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged DeepSeek’s influence, stating that AI infrastructure spending remains a “strategic advantage” for Meta. OpenAI has labeled DeepSeek as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” advocating for a potential US ban on DeepSeek models. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” recognizing the computational demands of reasoning models as beneficial for Nvidia’s hardware. Despite endorsements from some quarters, DeepSeek also faces bans from individual companies, entire countries like South Korea, and US states like New York. The Future of DeepSeek and the Global AI Race The future trajectory of DeepSeek remains uncertain. Continued advancements in its AI models are expected. However, growing wariness from the US government regarding potential foreign influence poses a significant challenge. The reported impending US ban on DeepSeek for government devices underscores this concern. Whether DeepSeek can navigate these geopolitical complexities and sustain its disruptive momentum will be crucial in determining its long-term impact on the global AI landscape. One thing is clear: DeepSeek has undeniably injected a new level of competition and innovation into the AI race, forcing established players to adapt and reassess their strategies.

Pi Network aims to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-hungry mining, Pi uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is efficient and eco-friendly. Users earn rewards not just for daily check-ins but also for growing their trusted circles and running full nodes. With its focus on decentralization and fair access, Pi could be a game-changer in the crypto space. As it plans to move from its “enclosed” Mainnet phase to an open network, Pi might become an attractive option in the market, especially for those looking to participate without significant investment in hardware. Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Ready to Shine Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a platform that lets developers build apps, tokens, and games without harming the environment. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This means it needs much less energy to operate compared to traditional methods. Its native coin, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and earn rewards by staking. What sets Cardano apart is its unique two-layer design. One layer handles transactions, while the other manages smart contracts. This setup could allow Cardano to process up to a million transactions per second in the future. With the introduction of native tokens in 2021, Cardano has become more efficient and scalable. In the current market, ADA looks attractive, especially for those interested in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. As Ethereum faces challenges with scaling and energy use, Cardano’s ADA might be the alternative that investors and developers are looking for. Conclusion PI, ADA, and XYZ are promising, with XYZVerse uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin aiming for significant growth and cultural impact.

Bullish signals are back, and three standout tokens are making serious noise. Between massive supply burns, breakout chart setups, and surging presales, there’s a lot more than hype in the air—it’s a window of opportunity. Leading the surge is Dragoin ($DDGN) , a new Ethereum-based meme coin that’s combining gaming and deflation into a formula with explosive potential. Alongside it, Pepe Coin is looking sharp with a projected 50% price breakout, and Shiba Inu is turning heads with an 8,470% spike in burn rate. All three offer something different—but Dragoin is emerging as the most complete play this month. Pepe Coin Bulls Hold the Line as Charts Signal 50% Upside Pepe Coin (PEPE) is showing clear signs of strength as buyers defend key support zones. Analysis from Brave New Coin points out that PEPE is holding firm near $0.0000068, with a potential move toward $0.0000105—a 50% price jump—on the table. Technicals are lining up in its favor. The RSI is sitting in bullish territory, and Bollinger Bands are narrowing—classic signs that price action could soon explode. Current volume trends show accumulation, not selloffs, adding fuel to the bullish case. Although PEPE still lacks major utility, it thrives on culture, momentum, and trader sentiment. If Bitcoin can maintain levels above $85K, meme coins like PEPE could benefit from a wider wave. But for those aiming for stronger returns and lasting utility, Dragoin is pulling ahead of the pack. Dragoin Stands Out With Scarcity, Gameplay, and 100x ROI Promise Among the top meme coins to join this month, Dragoin ($DDGN) is getting serious attention—and for good reason. Built on Ethereum, it powers a play-to-earn game hosted directly on Telegram, where users hatch dragons, train them, and battle to earn $DDGN tokens. It’s more than just a meme—it’s an ecosystem. The project’s 25-stage presale structure encourages early buying by raising the price at each level. Half of the total 200 billion tokens are allocated to presale, and any unsold tokens are permanently burned—cutting down supply and boosting value for participants. With a current price of $0.0000292 and a launch price set at $0.002, the 100x potential isn’t a stretch—it’s math. But Dragoin’s appeal doesn’t stop at numbers. The team plans to renounce smart contract ownership after the presale ends, ensuring the token becomes fully decentralized. This hands-off model is rare among meme coins and is one reason Dragoin’s community is growing fast. Looking ahead, Q2 brings the game’s official launch, staking features, and a marketing campaign led by influencers. Q3 will introduce CEX listings, more game content, and community-driven governance. With airdrops, referral programs, and ongoing staking incentives already live, Dragoin is clearly aiming far beyond the meme coin mold. SHIB’s Massive Token Burn Reignites Market Buzz Shiba Inu (SHIB), long seen as a staple of meme coin culture, has stirred up excitement again after a dramatic rise in burn activity. As reported by the Hindustan Times, SHIB removed over 82.24 million tokens from circulation in 24 hours, pushing its burn rate up by a staggering 8,470%. While the price hasn’t moved much, the burn is sparking speculation about a possible rally. SHIB has often used burns to keep interest alive, and with meme coins gaining traction again, some expect another leg up in price action. Still, SHIB’s challenge remains the same—it needs to evolve. Without new interactive features or added utility, its growth strategy relies heavily on reducing supply. That’s a stark contrast to Dragoin, which is already rolling out new mechanics, rewarding its users, and expanding rapidly. Which Meme Coin Should You Watch Closely This Month? All three tokens—Dragoin, PEPE, and SHIB—are bringing something to the table. PEPE offers short-term trading setups, SHIB continues to draw power from its legacy and burn strategy, but Dragoin offers the most compelling mix: scarcity, interactivity, decentralization, and real upside. The presale is more than just hype—it’s a system built to reward early adopters and grow the community organically. With 100x ROI potential and a unique play-to-earn structure, Dragoin is offering more than speculation—it’s offering substance. At its current price, it’s still early for those who want in before the public launch. When meme coin momentum hits, timing is everything. Dragoin isn’t just reacting to the market—it’s building ahead of it. And that’s why it tops the list of top meme coins to join this month .

As the payment behemoth increases its crypto footprint, PayPal and Venmo users can buy, sell, and hold LINK and SOL in their accounts. PayPal Expands Crypto Offering With SOL and LINK According to an official press release , PayPal has announced the expansion of its suite of cryptocurrencies with two new tokens. The payment giant confirmed the addition of Chainlink and Solana to its offerings, signaling increased confidence in Web 3 solutions. Per the statement, the offering will extend beyond PayPal and include its subsidiary Venmo. Users of Venmo and PayPal in the US will be able to purchase, hold, transfer, and sell both SOL and LINK with their accounts. May Zabaneh, Paypal’s VP for Digital Currencies revealed that expanding its cryptocurrency offerings was an obvious choice for the company. Zabaneh disclosed that feedback from users confirmed the need to allow consumers to interact with SOL and LINK. “Offering more tokens on PayPal and Venmo provides users with greater flexibility, choice, and access to digital currencies,” said Zabaneh. With the addition of SOL and LINK, PayPal supports seven cryptocurrencies on its platform. The firm waded into cryptocurrencies back in 2020 starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) offerings for consumers. Early successes saw it expand to Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) before launching its stablecoin PayPal USD(PYUSD). Institutional adoption for SOL is rising with Polymarket integrating Solana by enabling SOL deposits. Chainlink is riding its wave of partnerships and integrations with institutional and enterprise utility at the core. Why Did The Payment Giant Choose SOL and LINK? PayPal’s decision to expand to SOL and LINK flows from their inherent capabilities and massive adoption figures. According to the statement, PayPal sees Chainlink as a key player in cross-chain interoperability while describing Solana as a “leading blockchain platform.” Both SOL and LINK are in the top 11 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization with a combined valuation of over $80 billion. Chainlink’s ADGM partnership to build tokenization frameworks in the UAE is the latest high-profile play for the Web 3 infrastructure platform. Furthermore, the company says the decision underscores the company’s cryptocurrency-facing ambitions in recent years. PYUSD has its sights on challenging USDT and USDC dominance with PayPal neck-deep in cryptocurrencies. “The addition of LINK and SOL reflects the company’s dedication to the evolving digital currency landscape and fostering greater accessibility and engagement in the cryptocurrency market,” read the statement. Apart from PayPal and Polymarket, BlackRock’s BUIDL has launched on Solana in a strong case for institutional adoption. Both SOL and LINK have reacted positively to the announcement, rising 5.42% and 1.37 respectively.

42922363,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146530,1743815407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Recognition: U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares Bitcoin a Growing Store of Value,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/landmark-bitcoin-store-value/,"In a potentially landmark moment for the cryptocurrency world, the U.S. Treasury Secretary has publicly acknowledged Bitcoin as a “growing store of value.” This statement, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, signifies a possible sea change in the official stance towards digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. For years, Bitcoin has navigated a complex landscape of skepticism and regulatory uncertainty. But could this declaration from a key figure in U.S. financial policy be the turning point Bitcoin enthusiasts have been eagerly awaiting? Let’s delve into the implications of this exciting development and explore what it means for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Why is Bitcoin Being Recognized as a Store of Value? The concept of Bitcoin as a store of value has been a cornerstone argument within the crypto community since its inception. But what exactly does it mean for Bitcoin to be considered a store of value, and why is this recognition from the U.S. Treasury Secretary so significant? Traditionally, assets like gold and real estate have been viewed as stores of value – assets that maintain or increase their worth over time, acting as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, limited supply of 21 million coins, and increasing global adoption, is increasingly fitting this description. Here are key factors contributing to Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a store of value: Scarcity: Just like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply. This scarcity is hardcoded into its protocol, ensuring that no more than 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created. This inherent scarcity contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which central banks can print, potentially leading to inflation. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of governments and financial institutions. This decentralization is a major draw for those seeking an alternative to traditional financial systems, particularly in times of economic instability or geopolitical tension. Increasing Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This institutional interest lends further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a viable asset class and store of value. Growing Acceptance as Digital Gold: Many investors are starting to view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a modern alternative to precious metals for wealth preservation. This narrative is gaining traction as Bitcoin matures and its resilience is tested through various economic cycles. The Significance of Treasury Bitcoin Acknowledgment The U.S. Treasury Secretary’s statement carries immense weight. It’s not just another endorsement from a tech enthusiast or crypto advocate; it’s a signal from one of the most influential financial authorities in the world. This acknowledgment could pave the way for: Reduced Regulatory Headwinds: Official recognition as a store of value might lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the United States. It could soften the stance of regulatory bodies that have previously viewed Bitcoin primarily as a speculative asset or a tool for illicit activities. Increased Mainstream Adoption: When a figure as prominent as the Treasury Secretary acknowledges Bitcoin’s value proposition, it lends credibility to the asset in the eyes of the general public and institutional investors who might have been hesitant to enter the space before. This could accelerate Bitcoin adoption across various sectors. Legitimization of Crypto as an Asset Class: This statement can be seen as a step towards the broader legitimization of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, moving beyond the fringes of finance and into mainstream investment portfolios. Potential for Further Policy Shifts: This initial acknowledgment could be the first step in a series of policy shifts that are more accommodating and supportive of cryptocurrency innovation in the U.S. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation While the Treasury Secretary’s comments are undoubtedly positive, the landscape of crypto regulation remains complex and evolving. It’s crucial to remember that this is just one statement, and regulatory frameworks are shaped by multiple agencies and political considerations. Here are some key aspects to consider regarding the regulatory future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies: Global Regulatory Divergence: Different countries are taking vastly different approaches to crypto regulation. Some are embracing innovation, while others are imposing strict restrictions. This global divergence creates challenges for the industry and necessitates international cooperation. Balancing Innovation and Consumer Protection: Regulators are tasked with balancing the need to foster innovation in the digital asset space with the crucial responsibility of protecting consumers from fraud and illicit activities. Finding this balance is a delicate act. The Role of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): The rise of CBDCs presents both opportunities and challenges for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. CBDCs could compete with or complement existing digital assets, and their regulatory frameworks will likely influence the broader crypto ecosystem. Continued Scrutiny on Compliance: Despite growing acceptance, the crypto industry will remain under scrutiny regarding compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Projects and exchanges must prioritize robust compliance frameworks to operate within legal boundaries. What Does This Mean for Digital Assets Beyond Bitcoin? While the statement specifically references Bitcoin, the implications extend to the broader world of digital assets . If Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, gains further legitimacy as a store of value in the eyes of regulators, it could have a ripple effect, benefiting the entire digital asset class. This could lead to: Increased Investor Confidence in Crypto: Positive sentiment towards Bitcoin often translates to increased confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market. This could attract more investors to explore other digital assets beyond Bitcoin. Greater Acceptance of Blockchain Technology: Recognition of Bitcoin indirectly validates the underlying blockchain technology that powers it and many other cryptocurrencies. This could accelerate the adoption of blockchain in various industries beyond finance. Innovation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin could also foster innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, allowing for the development of new financial products and services built on blockchain technology. Growth of the Digital Economy: Ultimately, greater acceptance of digital assets can contribute to the growth of the broader digital economy, fostering innovation, creating new economic opportunities, and transforming how we interact with finance and technology. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Bitcoin Landscape So, what should investors and crypto enthusiasts take away from this significant development? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape is constantly changing. Keep abreast of the latest news and policy updates related to cryptocurrencies in your region and globally. Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio: While Bitcoin is gaining recognition, diversification remains a prudent strategy in the volatile crypto market. Explore other promising digital assets and allocate your investments strategically. Educate Yourself on Crypto Fundamentals: Understanding the technology, economics, and regulatory aspects of cryptocurrencies is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Continuously learn and expand your knowledge base. Consider Long-Term Investment in Bitcoin: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a store of value, consider adopting a long-term investment strategy, potentially through dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Mainstream Bitcoin? The U.S. Treasury Secretary’s acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a “growing store of value” is more than just a headline; it’s a potential shift in the narrative surrounding digital currencies. While challenges and regulatory complexities remain, this statement signals a maturing perception of Bitcoin within influential financial circles. It opens doors for greater mainstream adoption, reduced regulatory friction, and a more robust future for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, this landmark moment could be remembered as a pivotal step towards the full integration of Bitcoin into the global financial landscape.

Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice (STJ) has unanimously decided that judges may now notify crypto exchanges of their intent to seize a debtor’s crypto assets to repay outstanding debts, local media has reported. The decision, from the court’s Third Panel, examined a case brought by a creditor trying to get repayment. “Although they are not legal tender, crypto assets can be used as a form of payment and as a store of value,” the STJ wrote in a translated statement published on its website, confirming the decision. Crypto now treated like bank accounts in legal disputes Under Brazilian law, judges are empowered to freeze bank accounts and authorize fund withdrawals without notifying the debtor. Following the new ruling, crypto assets will now be treated similarly and may be frozen or confiscated to satisfy legal obligations. Minister Ricardo Villas Bôas Cueva, one of the five-panel members, acknowledged that while Brazil still lacks comprehensive regulation for cryptocurrencies, several legislative proposals already define them as a “digital representation of value.” Despite the regulatory gap, Brazil has emerged as one of the leading countries in Latin America for crypto adoption. An October report from Chainalysis ranked Brazil second in the region based on the volume of crypto value received, highlighting the nation’s growing engagement with digital assets. In a notable move earlier this year, Binance received regulatory approval to operate in Brazil after acquiring a São Paulo-based investment firm. At the time, a Binance executive told Cointelegraph that Brazil was making “significant strides” toward crypto regulation and predicted that a comprehensive legal framework would be introduced “by mid-year.” Stablecoin ban sparks debate in growing market Still, not all developments have been favorable to the industry. In December, Brazil’s central bank proposed a controversial ban on stablecoin transactions via self-custodial wallets—an increasingly popular method for Brazilians to protect their wealth against real devaluation. Critics argued that such a ban would be hard to enforce. “Governments can regulate centralized exchanges, but P2P transactions and decentralized platforms are much harder to control,” said Trezor analyst Lucien Bourdon. “That means the ban would likely only affect part of the ecosystem.” Brazil’s largest bank, Itaú Unibanco, is presently considering the launch of its own stablecoin, making it the latest major traditional financial institution to announce these plans. Local media reported that the bank’s decision will depend on how Brazil’s regulatory framework evolves and how similar initiatives by major international institutions perform. The move follows a wave of recent announcements by TradFi institutions regarding plans to launch or develop stablecoins. Bank of America signals readiness for stablecoin launch In the U.S., Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently confirmed that the bank is prepared to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin if Congress establishes a clear legal framework. The announcement places the U.S. lender among a growing number of systemically important banks planning entry into the stablecoin sector. These developments have come in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s formal rejection of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and endorsements for stablecoins, which has shifted attention away from state-issued digital money and toward private-sector alternatives. As Brazil continues its regulatory evolution, the court’s latest ruling reinforces the perception of crypto assets as integral to the country’s financial system—even as broader legal frameworks are still in development.

42922698,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146532,1743816001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Revelation: OpenAI’s GPT-4 ‘Memorization’ of Copyrighted Content Sparks AI Debate,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-gpt4-copyright-memorization/,"The cryptocurrency world thrives on transparency and verifiable truth. But what happens when the very AI tools we’re starting to rely on for information and innovation are built on potentially murky foundations? A groundbreaking new study is sending shockwaves through the tech world, suggesting that OpenAI’s powerful models, including the much-hyped GPT-4, may have ‘memorized’ copyrighted material during their training process. This explosive claim reignites the fierce debate surrounding OpenAI Copyright practices and raises serious questions about the ethical and legal implications of AI development. Does OpenAI’s GPT-4 Exhibit Alarming AI Model Memorization? For months, whispers and accusations have circulated, alleging that OpenAI trained its cutting-edge AI models on a vast ocean of data that included copyrighted works. Now, a rigorous study from researchers at leading universities like Washington, Copenhagen, and Stanford seems to lend significant weight to these allegations. This research introduces a novel method to detect data ‘memorization’ within API-driven models like OpenAI’s. But what exactly does ‘memorization’ mean in the context of AI? AI models as prediction engines: Think of AI models as incredibly sophisticated prediction machines. They are trained on massive datasets to identify patterns and relationships within the data. This learning process is what enables them to generate human-like text, images, and more. The inevitability of memorization: While most AI outputs are original creations, the very nature of how these models learn means some degree of verbatim reproduction from the training data is unavoidable. Imagine learning a language – you’ll naturally repeat phrases you’ve heard frequently. Prior instances of regurgitation: We’ve already seen examples of this ‘memorization’ in action. Image models have been caught spitting out exact screenshots from movies they were trained on, and language models have been observed essentially plagiarizing news articles. Unveiling the Method: High-Surprisal Words and Copyrighted Content Detection The study’s ingenious approach hinges on identifying what the researchers term “high-surprisal” words. These are words that are statistically uncommon within a given context. Consider the example: “Jack and I sat perfectly still with the radar humming.” “Radar” is a high-surprisal word here because, in the context of things that hum, words like “engine” or “radio” are far more probable. To test for AI Model Memorization , the researchers cleverly masked these high-surprisal words from snippets of copyrighted fiction books and New York Times articles. They then challenged OpenAI’s models, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, to guess the missing words. The logic is compelling: if the model accurately guesses the high-surprisal word, it strongly suggests the model ‘memorized’ that specific snippet during its training phase. An example of the model guessing a high-surprisal word: “Jack and I sat perfectly still with the [MASK] humming.” – Model correctly guesses “radar”. Image Credits: OpenAI Shocking Findings: GPT-4 and the Memorization of Copyrighted Material The study’s results are nothing short of startling. GPT-4 demonstrated clear signs of having memorized portions of popular fiction books, notably including books from BookMIA, a dataset known to contain copyrighted ebooks. Furthermore, the research indicated that GPT-4 had also memorized segments of New York Times articles, although at a lower frequency compared to the fiction books. This raises critical concerns about the source material used to train these powerful AI models and whether Copyrighted Content was utilized without proper authorization. Abhilasha Ravichander, a University of Washington doctoral student and study co-author, emphasized the significance of these findings in a statement to Bitcoin World. She highlighted that the research sheds light on the potentially “contentious data” used in training these models. “For large language models to be truly trustworthy, we need the ability to probe, audit, and scientifically examine them,” Ravichander stated. “Our work provides a tool for this probing, but there’s a pressing need for greater data transparency across the entire ecosystem.” The Looming Legal Battle Over AI Training Data OpenAI is already facing a barrage of lawsuits from authors, programmers, and copyright holders. These plaintiffs accuse the company of illegally using their Copyrighted Content – books, code, and more – to train its AI models. OpenAI has consistently defended its actions under the “fair use” doctrine of copyright law. However, the plaintiffs argue that fair use doesn’t extend to the wholesale ingestion of copyrighted material for AI training purposes. This legal battle could redefine the landscape of AI development and intellectual property rights. Adding fuel to the fire, OpenAI has actively lobbied for more lenient regulations regarding the use of copyrighted data in AI training. While they have established some content licensing agreements and offer opt-out mechanisms for copyright owners, their push for broader “fair use” rules suggests a desire to continue utilizing vast datasets, even those potentially containing copyrighted material. The question remains: Can innovation thrive without respecting creators’ rights and ensuring data transparency? Key Takeaways and the Path Forward for AI Ethics This study is a wake-up call, underscoring the urgent need for greater transparency and ethical considerations in the development of AI. Here are some crucial points to consider: Transparency is paramount: The AI industry must move towards greater transparency regarding training datasets. Understanding what data is used to build these powerful models is essential for accountability and ethical development. Copyright and AI: A Legal Grey Area: The legal framework surrounding AI Training Data and copyright is still murky. This study adds weight to the argument that current “fair use” interpretations may be insufficient to address the scale and nature of AI training. Ethical AI Development: Beyond legalities, there’s an ethical imperative. Building AI that respects intellectual property rights and operates with transparency is crucial for fostering trust and long-term sustainability in the AI ecosystem. The Need for Robust Auditing Tools: Ravichander’s study highlights the necessity for tools that can effectively probe and audit large language models. This is crucial for identifying potential copyright infringement and ensuring responsible AI development. The Future of AI and Content Creation: The outcome of the legal battles and the evolution of ethical standards will significantly shape the future of AI and its relationship with content creators. Finding a balance that fosters innovation while respecting creators’ rights is paramount. The implications of this study are profound. As the cryptocurrency and blockchain space increasingly intersects with AI, understanding the ethical and legal underpinnings of these technologies becomes ever more critical.

42923056,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146533,1743816657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Bakkt Lawsuit: Investors Allege Securities Law Violation in Class Action,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bakkt-investor-class-action/,"The cryptocurrency world is once again witnessing turbulence as Bakkt, a prominent cryptocurrency platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), finds itself at the center of a storm. Recent reports reveal that Bakkt is facing a class action lawsuit, sending ripples of concern through the crypto investment community. Investors are alleging significant losses due to what they claim is a failure in transparency and potential securities law violation. Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for Bakkt and the broader crypto landscape. What Sparked the Bakkt Lawsuit? Allegations of Non-Disclosure The core of the Bakkt lawsuit revolves around accusations of non-disclosure of critical information to investors. According to court documents filed in the Southern District Court of New York and reported by Cointelegraph, the plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit are primarily investors who claim to have suffered financial setbacks. They allege that Bakkt did not adequately disclose details about crucial business contracts with major clients, namely Bank of America (BofA) and Webull. These contracts, as per the allegations, were not just any partnerships; they were cornerstones of Bakkt’s revenue generation. The investors argue that the recent discontinuation of these agreements was a significant event that should have been disclosed earlier and more transparently. The lack of this information, they claim, led to investment decisions made without a full understanding of Bakkt’s financial health and future prospects, ultimately resulting in investor losses . To break it down simply: The Claim: Bakkt investors are alleging non-disclosure of material information. Key Contracts: The contracts in question are with Bank of America and Webull. Revenue Impact: These contracts reportedly constituted a significant portion of Bakkt’s revenue stream. Investor Grievance: Investors argue they were not informed about the potential risks associated with these contracts and their subsequent termination. Investor Losses and the Claim of Securities Law Violation The lawsuit doesn’t stop at just non-disclosure. It escalates to accusations of securities law violation . Investors are contending that the alleged lack of transparency and the withholding of information constitute a breach of securities laws. These laws are in place to protect investors by ensuring companies provide accurate and complete information about their business operations and financial status, especially when it could influence investment decisions. If these allegations are proven true, Bakkt could face serious repercussions, including financial penalties and reputational damage. The lawsuit highlights the critical importance of transparency and regulatory compliance within the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for platforms that handle significant volumes of digital assets and investor funds. Consider these points regarding the securities law violation aspect: Legal Framework: Securities laws are designed to ensure fair and transparent markets. Investor Protection: These laws aim to protect investors from fraudulent or misleading information. Alleged Breach: Investors claim Bakkt’s actions or inactions violated these laws through non-disclosure. Potential Consequences: If found guilty, Bakkt could face fines, legal injunctions, and damage to investor trust. Bakkt: A Cryptocurrency Platform Under Scrutiny Bakkt’s position as a leading cryptocurrency platform makes this lawsuit particularly noteworthy. Launched with considerable fanfare and the backing of ICE, a giant in the traditional financial world, Bakkt was envisioned to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset market. It offers services including cryptocurrency trading, custody solutions, and institutional on-ramps to the crypto space. The platform’s credibility and reputation are now under a cloud of uncertainty due to this legal challenge. For users and observers of the crypto market, this situation serves as a stark reminder that even platforms with strong institutional backing are not immune to legal and regulatory scrutiny. It underscores the inherent risks associated with investing in the volatile cryptocurrency market and the importance of due diligence. Key takeaways about Bakkt as a platform in this context: Institutional Backing: Owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a major stock exchange group. Service Range: Offers trading, custody, and institutional crypto solutions. Market Position: A prominent player aiming to connect traditional finance with crypto. Reputation at Stake: The lawsuit poses a significant threat to Bakkt’s reputation and future growth. Class Action Lawsuit: What Does it Mean for Bakkt and Investors? A class action lawsuit is a legal procedure that allows a large group of people with similar grievances to collectively bring a claim against a defendant. In this case, it means that numerous Bakkt investors who believe they suffered losses due to the alleged non-disclosure have joined forces to sue the company. For Bakkt, a class action lawsuit can be a protracted and expensive legal battle. It also amplifies the negative publicity and could further erode investor confidence. For the investors involved, it provides a way to pool resources and potentially recover losses that might be too small to pursue individually. However, class action lawsuits can be lengthy, and the outcome is never guaranteed. Let’s understand the implications of a class action: Collective Action: Many investors unite to file a single lawsuit. Efficiency: More efficient than individual lawsuits for similar claims. Potential Impact on Bakkt: Significant legal costs, reputational damage, and potential financial payouts if they lose. Investor Opportunity: Allows investors to seek collective redress for alleged wrongdoing. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Transparency and Due Diligence The Bakkt lawsuit serves as a critical reminder of the importance of transparency and due diligence in the cryptocurrency space. For investors, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and understand the risks associated with any cryptocurrency platform or investment. For platforms like Bakkt, maintaining open communication and adhering to regulatory standards is paramount for building and retaining investor trust. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto community will be closely watching the developments. The outcome of this class action lawsuit could set precedents for transparency and disclosure expectations within the cryptocurrency industry and further shape the regulatory landscape. It highlights the ongoing maturation of the crypto market and the increasing demand for accountability and investor protection. Key takeaways for moving forward: Investor Vigilance: Always perform due diligence before investing in crypto platforms. Transparency is Key: Platforms must prioritize clear and timely communication with investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: The crypto industry is facing increasing regulatory attention, demanding compliance and accountability. Market Evolution: Incidents like this lawsuit contribute to the maturing and regulation of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Bakkt and Crypto Transparency? The Bakkt lawsuit is more than just a legal challenge for a single company; it’s a potential watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the growing pains of a rapidly evolving market grappling with issues of transparency, regulation, and investor protection. The allegations of securities law violation and non-disclosure are serious and demand careful consideration from all stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem. Whether this lawsuit will result in significant changes at Bakkt and across the broader crypto space remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the demand for transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency market is only going to intensify. Investors are becoming more discerning, and regulatory bodies are paying closer attention. The Bakkt case serves as a powerful reminder that in the world of digital assets, trust and transparency are not just desirable – they are essential for long-term sustainability and growth.

Cryptocurrency markets are often seen as a hedge against traditional finance, but they’re not immune to broader economic trends. New data from Kalshi, a prediction market platform, is sending ripples through financial circles. Let’s dive into why their latest forecast is particularly concerning for 2025 and what it could mean for your investments. What’s Behind the Rising Fear of a US Recession in 2025? Kalshi, known for its real-time prediction markets on various events, has recently updated its data regarding the likelihood of a US recession . According to their platform, the probability of an economic recession hitting the United States in 2025 has surged to a sobering 62%. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s the highest level observed in recent months, signaling a potentially significant shift in economic sentiment. This figure alone should raise eyebrows, prompting investors and the general public alike to consider the implications. But what exactly does this 62% probability mean? It signifies that based on market activity and predictive modeling on Kalshi, the prevailing sentiment points towards a more than likely economic downturn within the next couple of years. While not a certainty, a 62% chance is far from negligible and warrants serious attention. It suggests that a majority of participants in these prediction markets are betting on economic headwinds becoming stronger. Kalshi’s Market Prediction: A Reliable Indicator? You might be wondering, why should we pay attention to Kalshi? Kalshi operates as a regulated prediction market, allowing users to trade on the probability of specific events. The collective wisdom of the crowd, reflected in these markets, can often provide valuable insights. Here’s why Kalshi’s data is noteworthy: Real-time Sentiment: Kalshi’s data reflects up-to-the-minute market sentiment, offering a dynamic view of expectations compared to lagging economic indicators. Crowdsourced Predictions: It aggregates predictions from a diverse group of users, potentially mitigating individual biases. Track Record: Prediction markets have, in some instances, shown surprising accuracy in forecasting events. However, it’s crucial to remember that Kalshi’s data is not a crystal ball. It’s a reflection of market sentiment and probabilities, not a guarantee. It’s one piece of the puzzle in understanding the complex economic landscape. Think of it as a sophisticated weather vane for the economic climate – it points in a certain direction, but the actual weather can still surprise you. Decoding the 62% Recession Probability: What Does it Imply? Let’s break down what a 62% probability of a recession 2025 actually suggests: Increased Economic Uncertainty: This figure highlights a significant level of uncertainty and pessimism regarding the future health of the U.S. economy. Potential for Market Volatility: Heightened recession fears can lead to increased volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrency. Business and Consumer Impact: A recession can impact businesses through reduced demand and consumers through job losses and decreased spending power. Investment Strategy Adjustments: Investors might need to reassess their strategies, considering more defensive positions or hedging against potential downturns. It’s not time to panic, but it is certainly time to pay attention and prepare. Understanding the potential implications is the first step in navigating uncertain economic waters. Navigating the Potential Economic Downturn: Is Your Portfolio Ready? So, with a 62% probability of a market prediction pointing towards a recession, what should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across asset classes, including potentially recession-resistant assets, can be beneficial. Review Risk Tolerance: Assess your comfort level with risk and adjust your portfolio accordingly. A potential recession might warrant a more conservative approach for some. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic news and indicators. Understanding the evolving economic narrative is crucial for making informed decisions. Consider Long-Term Strategy: Recessions are often cyclical. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making rash decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. While the crypto market can be volatile, it also presents opportunities. Some argue that during traditional financial downturns, cryptocurrencies could act as alternative assets. However, this is still a developing narrative, and thorough research and caution are always advised. Beyond Kalshi: Broader Economic Indicators and Recession Signals While Kalshi’s data provides a valuable perspective, it’s essential to look at a range of economic indicators to form a comprehensive view of the potential for a US recession . Consider these factors: Indicator Relevance to Recession Prediction Inflation Rates Persistent high inflation can prompt central banks to aggressively raise interest rates, potentially slowing economic growth. Interest Rate Hikes Aggressive rate hikes can cool down the economy, but also risk triggering a recession if they become too restrictive. GDP Growth Slowing or negative GDP growth is a primary indicator of economic contraction and recession. Unemployment Rate Rising unemployment is a lagging indicator but signifies economic distress and reduced consumer spending. Consumer Confidence Declining consumer confidence can foreshadow reduced spending and economic slowdown. Analyzing these indicators in conjunction with market sentiment, like that reflected on Kalshi, offers a more robust understanding of the economic outlook. Conclusion: Heeding the Warning Signs of a Potential Recession Kalshi’s 62% probability for a recession 2025 is a stark reminder of the economic uncertainties that lie ahead. While predictions are not guarantees, this data point, combined with other economic indicators, suggests a heightened need for vigilance and preparedness. For cryptocurrency investors and anyone engaged in financial markets, staying informed, diversifying portfolios, and understanding risk tolerance are crucial steps in navigating potential economic turbulence. The key takeaway is not to be paralyzed by fear, but to be proactive and informed. The economic landscape is constantly evolving, and adaptability is your greatest asset.

42923651,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146538,1743817848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Yuan Power Surge: Dalio Predicts US-China Trade Talks Could Unleash Tariff Relief,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yuan-power-surge-trade-talks/,"Are you watching the global financial chessboard closely? For those in the crypto space, understanding macro trends is crucial, and right now, all eyes are on the potential shifts in the US-China relationship. Legendary investor Ray Dalio suggests that ongoing US-China discussions could trigger significant changes, potentially leading to a stronger Chinese Yuan and a welcome wave of tariff relief . Let’s dive into what this could mean for the global economy and your crypto portfolio. Decoding Dalio: Why US-China Talks Matter for the Chinese Yuan Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, isn’t just any investor; he’s a macroeconomics guru whose insights are closely followed by financial professionals worldwide. When Dalio speaks about US-China trade talks , it’s time to listen. He posits that constructive dialogues between the world’s two largest economies could have profound implications, particularly for the Chinese Yuan . But why should crypto enthusiasts care about the Yuan? Here’s the connection: Global Economic Ripple Effects: The strength of the Yuan is a barometer for the health of the Chinese economy, which in turn significantly influences the global economy. A stronger Yuan can indicate increased economic confidence and stability in China, impacting global trade and investment flows. Currency Market Dynamics: Fluctuations in major currencies like the Yuan can affect broader currency markets, including those relevant to cryptocurrency trading pairs. Changes in the Yuan’s value can create arbitrage opportunities and influence trading strategies. Geopolitical Stability: Positive US-China trade talks can signal reduced geopolitical tensions, fostering a more stable global economic environment. Stability is generally seen as favorable for investment markets, including the crypto market. Dalio’s perspective is rooted in understanding historical patterns and economic cycles. He believes that nations often go through periods of cooperation and competition. Currently, a move towards cooperation, even incrementally, could be beneficial. Tariff Relief on the Horizon? Unpacking the Potential Benefits One of the most keenly anticipated outcomes of improved US-China relations is tariff relief . Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, have been a major point of contention between the two nations. Easing these tariffs could unlock a cascade of positive economic effects: Potential Benefits of Tariff Relief: Benefit Description Impact Reduced Costs for Businesses Lower tariffs mean cheaper imported goods for businesses in both countries. Increased profitability, potentially leading to business expansion and investment. Lower Consumer Prices Cost savings for businesses can be passed on to consumers through lower prices. Increased consumer spending and purchasing power. Boosted Trade Activity Reduced trade barriers encourage greater volumes of imports and exports. Stimulates economic growth in both nations and globally. Improved Investor Sentiment Signs of easing trade tensions create a more optimistic outlook for investors. Increased investment in various asset classes, including potentially crypto. For the cryptocurrency market, improved investor sentiment and a healthier global economy are generally positive catalysts. When traditional markets thrive, there’s often a spillover effect into alternative investments like crypto. Navigating the Challenges: Are Smooth US-China Talks Guaranteed? While the prospect of a stronger Yuan and tariff relief is enticing, it’s crucial to maintain a realistic perspective. US-China trade talks are complex and fraught with challenges. Here are some potential hurdles: Geopolitical Tensions: Beyond trade, numerous geopolitical issues still strain US-China relations. These include disagreements on technology, human rights, and regional influence. These tensions can easily derail trade progress. Domestic Political Pressures: Political considerations within both the US and China can influence the negotiation positions and willingness to compromise. Domestic agendas might take precedence over trade agreements. Implementation Hurdles: Even if agreements are reached, implementing and enforcing them can be complex. Disagreements over compliance can resurface and create new friction. Economic Competition: At their core, the US and China are economic competitors. This fundamental competition will continue to shape their relationship, even with efforts to improve trade ties. Therefore, while Dalio’s perspective offers a hopeful scenario, it’s essential to recognize that the path to smoother US-China trade talks is not guaranteed. Expect potential setbacks and volatility along the way. Ray Dalio’s Actionable Insights: What Can Crypto Investors Learn? So, how can crypto investors translate Dalio’s analysis into actionable strategies? Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Monitor Yuan Strength: Keep an eye on the Chinese Yuan’s performance. A consistent strengthening trend could signal positive developments in US-China relations and a healthier Chinese economy. Track Trade Talk News: Stay informed about the progress (or lack thereof) in US-China trade talks . News of breakthroughs or setbacks can create short-term market fluctuations. Diversify Globally: A stronger Yuan and improved global trade could benefit economies beyond just China and the US. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio to include assets that might benefit from broader global economic growth. Manage Risk: Remember that geopolitical and economic events can introduce volatility. Implement robust risk management strategies, such as position sizing and stop-loss orders, to protect your capital. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term fluctuations are possible, focus on the long-term implications. Improved US-China relations, if sustained, could contribute to a more stable and prosperous global economy , which is generally beneficial for all asset classes over time. The Powerful Takeaway: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Global Finance Ray Dalio’s analysis serves as a crucial reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the potential impact of US-China trade talks . The prospect of a stronger Chinese Yuan and tariff relief offers a glimmer of optimism in a complex global landscape. For crypto investors, understanding these macro trends is not just academic; it’s essential for informed decision-making and navigating the ever-evolving financial markets. While challenges remain and the path forward may be bumpy, the potential rewards of improved US-China relations are significant. By staying informed, adaptable, and focused on long-term trends, crypto investors can position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities that arise from these global shifts.

42923953,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=725238,1743818404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42923953.jpeg,Is The Solana Bottom In? Experts Answer,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/is-the-solana-bottom-in-experts-answer/,"In a new technical analysis shared via X, crypto analyst Scott Melker aka The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) highlighted a critical support-resistance setup for Solana (SOL), emphasizing what he views as a textbook bounce off of a key technical level. “Picture perfect bounce off of $112 support. Double bottom would confirm with a break above $147, the swing high between the two bottoms. Don’t let anyone call it a double bottom until that happens. Regardless, nice bounce off of support with defined resistance to watch,” Melker stated. The analyst’s chart shows SOL rebounding from near $112, reinforcing that zone as significant short-term support. For a bullish double-bottom pattern to validate, Melker points to a breakout above the downtrend line (currently around $130). If SOL breaks this resistance, $147 will be the critical level that would need to be breached. Until then, he advises caution about prematurely labeling the formation as a confirmed double bottom. Solana Bottom In? Notably, these remarks come on the heels of unlocks. According to a post by on-chain intelligence firm Arkham on Thursday, “$200M OF SOL UNLOCKING TOMORROW. Tomorrow (4th April) marks the largest single-day unlock of staked SOL until 2028. These 4 accounts staked a total of $37.7M of SOL in April 2021, and are up 5.5x at current prices.” The scale of these unlocks has generated considerable discussion on social media. Related Reading: Solana Bearish Continuation: $118 Support, The Last Barricade Against Deeper Another trader, NooNe0x, took a more optimistic stance, remarking, “SOL unlocks. Looking at the bright side, today’s unlock was the last large block. Today alone is as much as 40% of everything that is still left. It is 78% done, May, June and only large-ish blocks left. Ripping the bandaid off.” In other words, with the bulk of significant unlocks possibly behind it, the supply overhang from locked tokens might be dissipating. Historically, major token unlock events—whether for Solana or other projects—have often been anticipated well in advance by traders and investors. Markets “price in” that large holders sell their old tokens, sometimes driving prices lower ahead of the actual unlock. Once the unlock date arrives, if the anticipated sell-off does not materialize as severely as feared (or if much of the unlocked stake remains off the market), prices have tended to stabilize and often recover in the days or weeks that follow. Related Reading: Solana Leads The Bull Case For Crypto, Says Multicoin’s Samani This pattern emerges because many holders, especially larger or early investors, may opt to restake or hold onto their tokens if they maintain a strong fundamental outlook. Meanwhile, short-term traders who had been betting on unlock-related volatility might close positions once the event passes. This “buy the rumor, sell the news” (or vice versa) dynamic can lead to price whipsaws around unlock periods, but no single outcome is guaranteed; much depends on how much actual selling pressure surfaces and broader market sentiment at the time. Meanwhile, Awawat, a trader and angel investor at APG Capital, cautioned that Solana could be in a precarious position despite holding above $100. “SOL absolutely shrekt – broke 170 range low, bounced at 120 a few times – now holding above 100 but the ice is thin – last big unlock tomorrow – will bid sub-100 if given but this looks rough given the state of the trenches,” he wrote. At press time, SOL traded at $115.

42924010,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146539,1743818444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Plunge: NFT Sales Crash 12% as Marketplaces Vanish – Is the Digital Collectibles Dream Over?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nft-sales-crash-marketplaces-vanish/,"Hold onto your digital wallets, NFT enthusiasts! The once-booming world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is experiencing a significant chill. March 2025 witnessed a surprising downturn, with overall NFT sales taking a noticeable dip. Let’s dive into the numbers and explore what this means for the future of digital collectibles. What’s Behind the Shocking Drop in NFT Sales? Recent research from Binance, highlighted by BeInCrypto, paints a stark picture. Across the top 10 blockchains, NFT sales plummeted by a substantial 12.4% in March 2025. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a considerable shift in market sentiment. Perhaps even more concerning is the dramatic 59.3% nosedive in sales specifically for Ethereum-based NFTs. Ethereum, traditionally the kingpin of the NFT space, is clearly feeling the heat. Adding fuel to the fire, buyer activity has slumped to its lowest point since October 2023, indicating a cooling interest from investors and collectors alike. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key takeaways: Overall NFT Sales Decline: A significant 12.4% drop across major blockchains in March 2025. Ethereum NFTs Hit Hard: A massive 59.3% decrease in sales for Ethereum-based NFTs. Buyer Activity Dries Up: Lowest buyer engagement since October 2023. Marketplace Meltdown: Why are NFT Marketplaces Shutting Down? Adding to the market woes, several prominent NFT marketplaces are throwing in the towel. Major platforms like Bybit and X2Y2 have recently announced closures, a clear sign of the mounting pressure in the NFT sector. These closures aren’t just isolated incidents; they reflect a broader struggle for survival in a less exuberant market. The shrinking sales volumes and reduced trading activity are likely making it unsustainable for some platforms to operate. This consolidation could reshape the landscape of NFT marketplaces , potentially leading to a more centralized ecosystem. Why are these closures significant? Market Contraction: Platform closures indicate a shrinking market and reduced overall activity. Platform Sustainability Issues: Lower sales volumes make it harder for marketplaces to remain profitable. Ecosystem Reshaping: Consolidation could lead to fewer, larger marketplaces dominating the NFT space. Ethereum NFTs: Is the Dominance Dwindling in the Crypto Downturn? The substantial drop in Ethereum NFTs sales raises questions about the platform’s continued dominance in the digital art and collectibles arena. Adding to the concern, Ethereum’s fee revenue has plummeted by a staggering 95% since the heady days of 2021. This dramatic decrease in fees directly reflects the diminished activity within the Ethereum NFT ecosystem. While Ethereum remains a foundational blockchain, the data suggests that its grip on the NFT market may be loosening amidst the broader crypto downturn . The rise of competing blockchains and changing investor preferences could be contributing to this shift. Key points regarding Ethereum and NFTs: Dramatic Fee Revenue Drop: Ethereum’s NFT fee revenue is down 95% since 2021. Reduced Ecosystem Activity: Lower fees directly correlate with decreased NFT trading and activity on Ethereum. Shifting Market Dynamics: Competition from other blockchains and evolving investor interests may be impacting Ethereum’s dominance. Bright Spots in the Bleakness: Are Any NFT Sectors Thriving? Despite the overall gloom, there are glimmers of hope within the NFT landscape. While most blockchains experienced declines, Immutable and Panini bucked the trend, showcasing positive growth. Panini, in particular, witnessed an astounding 259.2% surge in sales! This suggests that certain niches within the digital collectibles market are still resonating with audiences. Panini’s success likely stems from its focus on sports-related NFTs, indicating that collectibles with real-world connections and established brands may hold stronger appeal during market corrections. Immutable’s growth also points towards the potential of gaming-focused NFTs, a sector that continues to attract interest. Positive trends amidst the downturn: Immutable’s Growth: Demonstrates resilience in specific NFT sectors. Panini’s Explosive Surge: 259.2% sales increase, highlighting the strength of sports collectibles. Niche Market Resilience: Collectibles with real-world links and gaming NFTs show continued potential. Is This the End of the Digital Collectibles Dream? Actionable Insights for NFT Enthusiasts While the current crypto downturn and the decline in NFT sales might seem alarming, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. Market corrections are a natural part of any evolving financial space, and the NFT market is no exception. This period could be viewed as a necessary recalibration, weeding out unsustainable projects and platforms, and paving the way for more robust and mature growth in the future. The long-term potential of digital collectibles remains significant, especially as metaverse adoption and blockchain technology continue to advance. Actionable Insights: Diversify your NFT Portfolio: Explore NFTs beyond Ethereum, considering emerging blockchains and niche markets. Focus on Utility and Value: Prioritize NFTs with real-world utility or strong community backing, rather than purely speculative assets. Stay Informed and Adapt: Keep abreast of market trends and be prepared to adjust your NFT strategies as the landscape evolves. Long-Term Vision: Consider the long-term potential of NFTs in gaming, metaverse, and digital ownership, rather than short-term price fluctuations. Conclusion: Navigating the NFT Market Correction The recent dip in NFT sales and the closure of some NFT marketplaces serve as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the crypto world. While the headlines might scream ‘crash,’ it’s more accurate to view this as a significant market correction. The enthusiasm surrounding digital collectibles might have cooled from its peak, but the underlying technology and the potential for NFTs remain compelling. As the market matures, we can expect to see a greater focus on quality, utility, and sustainable growth. For savvy investors and collectors, this period of recalibration could present new opportunities to acquire valuable assets and position themselves for the next wave of NFT innovation.

After dedicating four and a half years to Paradigm’s research endeavors, Samczsun is now poised to channel his expertise and passion into Security Alliance (SEAL), a non-profit entity he has founded. This move marks a significant shift in the landscape of crypto security , prompting discussions across the industry about the future of proactive security measures in the digital asset space. Who is Samczsun and What Was His Role at Paradigm? For those deeply entrenched in the world of cryptocurrency, the name Samczsun resonates with trust and expertise. Known for his sharp insights and proactive approach to identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities, Samczsun has become a pivotal figure in the often turbulent waters of crypto security. His work at Paradigm, a leading investment firm focused on crypto and Web3 companies, involved in-depth research aimed at understanding and enhancing the security of blockchain technologies and decentralized applications. During his tenure at Paradigm, Samczsun wasn’t just another researcher. He was a key contributor to the firm’s understanding of the intricate security challenges facing the crypto ecosystem. His work likely involved: Vulnerability Research: Proactively identifying potential weaknesses in smart contracts, blockchain protocols, and decentralized applications before they could be exploited. Security Audits: Analyzing the security architecture of projects Paradigm was considering investing in, ensuring a robust and secure foundation. Incident Response: Potentially assisting portfolio companies in responding to security incidents and breaches. Community Engagement: Sharing his knowledge and insights with the broader crypto community, contributing to a more secure ecosystem for everyone. His departure from Paradigm therefore isn’t just a personnel change; it’s a noteworthy event for the crypto space, given his established reputation and the critical nature of his work. Why Focus on Crypto Security and the Birth of SEAL? The cryptocurrency world, while brimming with innovation and potential, is also a hotbed for cyber threats. From smart contract exploits to rug pulls and exchange hacks, the risks are ever-present. This inherent vulnerability underscores the critical need for robust crypto security measures. Samczsun’s move to dedicate himself fully to Security Alliance (SEAL) highlights this pressing need. SEAL is envisioned as a non-profit organization focused on bolstering security across the crypto ecosystem. This initiative is particularly timely as the industry continues to grapple with increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. SEAL’s mission is deeply rooted in proactive security and community support. It aims to: Provide Resources and Tools: Develop and distribute tools and resources that empower developers and users to build and interact with crypto platforms more securely. Foster Collaboration: Create a collaborative environment where security researchers, developers, and projects can work together to address security challenges collectively. Emergency Response: Offer rapid response mechanisms to assist projects and users facing security emergencies, such as vulnerability disclosures or active exploits. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about common security threats and best practices within the crypto space through educational content and outreach programs. By focusing on these key areas, SEAL aims to be a vital support system for the entire crypto community, strengthening its defenses against malicious actors. Spotlight on SEAL 911: A Direct Line to Crypto Security Assistance At the heart of SEAL’s operations is SEAL 911 , a Telegram bot designed to provide immediate access to a trusted security community during critical moments. Imagine a scenario: a project discovers a critical vulnerability, or users suspect a rug pull. In such high-pressure situations, swift and reliable communication is paramount. This is precisely where SEAL 911 steps in. Here’s how SEAL 911 works and its key benefits: Feature Description Benefit Telegram Bot Interface Users interact with SEAL 911 through the familiar Telegram messaging app. Easy accessibility and user-friendliness, especially during emergencies when time is critical. Direct Connection to Security Team Messages sent to the bot are immediately forwarded to the SEAL security team. Ensures rapid response and direct communication with security experts. Emergency Support Network Connects users with a community of trusted security professionals ready to assist. Provides a safety net and expert guidance during security incidents. Vulnerability Disclosure Assistance Facilitates responsible vulnerability disclosure processes. Helps projects address vulnerabilities ethically and efficiently, minimizing potential damage. Rug Pull Emergency Support Offers guidance and resources for users affected by potential rug pulls. Provides support and potential avenues for recourse in cases of malicious scams. SEAL 911 isn’t just a bot; it’s a lifeline in the fast-paced and often risky world of cryptocurrency. It provides a crucial service by bridging the gap between those who need security assistance and those who can provide it, especially in time-sensitive emergencies. What Does Samczsun’s Departure Mean for Paradigm and the Future of Cybersecurity Researchers? Paradigm , while losing a valuable asset in Samczsun, will undoubtedly continue its commitment to crypto security. Investment firms in the crypto space are increasingly recognizing the importance of robust security practices, both for their own operations and for the projects they support. Paradigm’s future strategy in research and security might evolve, potentially focusing on building in-house teams, collaborating with SEAL, or adopting other innovative approaches. Samczsun’s move could also signal a broader trend. The increasing focus on non-profit initiatives like SEAL could represent a maturing of the crypto security landscape. Cybersecurity researchers like Samczsun are crucial for the industry’s growth and sustainability. Their expertise is not just about protecting individual projects or firms; it’s about building trust and resilience into the entire ecosystem. By dedicating himself to SEAL, Samczsun is amplifying his impact, potentially benefiting a wider range of projects and users than he could within a single firm. This transition could inspire other security experts to explore similar paths, creating a stronger, more decentralized, and community-driven approach to crypto security. The industry needs more dedicated cybersecurity researcher talent, and initiatives like SEAL may play a critical role in attracting, nurturing, and deploying this talent effectively. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Security Samczsun’s departure from Paradigm to focus on Security Alliance is more than just a career change; it’s a significant moment for the crypto industry. It underscores the paramount importance of proactive and community-driven crypto security . SEAL, with its flagship initiative SEAL 911, is poised to become a crucial resource for projects and users navigating the complex security landscape of digital assets. As Samczsun embarks on this new chapter, the crypto community watches with anticipation and support, hopeful that SEAL will indeed become a powerful force for enhanced security and resilience across the entire ecosystem. His dedication exemplifies the spirit of collaboration and proactive defense that is essential for the continued growth and trust in cryptocurrencies.

Tether, the issuer of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, is signaling a significant strategic pivot. Could we be seeing a future where USDT isn’t readily available in the U.S. and Europe? Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for the cryptocurrency landscape. Why is Tether Considering a Market Shift? The core reason behind Tether’s potential market realignment boils down to evolving regulations in the United States and the European Union. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, Tether is proactively preparing for a scenario where USDT might not be able to operate within these major economic zones due to increasingly stringent regulatory frameworks. This isn’t about abandoning ship, but rather a strategic maneuver to ensure long-term viability and compliance. Here’s a breakdown of the key drivers: Stringent Regulatory Landscape: Both the U.S. and EU are tightening the reins on crypto assets, particularly stablecoins. New regulations are emerging that demand greater transparency, reserve management, and operational compliance. Cost of Compliance: Adapting USDT to fully comply with every new regulation in each jurisdiction could be complex and resource-intensive. Tether seems to be weighing the benefits against the costs of such extensive modifications. Focus on Emerging Markets: Tether has witnessed substantial growth and adoption of USDT in emerging markets . These regions often present less restrictive regulatory environments and a strong appetite for stablecoins as a bridge to digital finance. EU Regulations and Binance Delisting: Recent EU rules have already had a tangible impact, leading Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to delist USDT in Europe. This event underscores the immediate regulatory pressure in the region. The Strategic Play: A New Compliant Stablecoin Instead of overhauling USDT to meet the specific demands of U.S. stablecoin regulations, Tether is exploring a more strategic approach: launching a separate, fully compliant stablecoin specifically designed for the U.S. market. This is a significant move, indicating a willingness to adapt to regulatory pressures while maintaining the core functionality of USDT for its primary user base. Key Aspects of this Strategy: Targeted Compliance: A new stablecoin can be built from the ground up to adhere to all U.S. regulatory requirements, ensuring smooth operation within the American financial system. USDT Focus Remains: This allows USDT to continue its current trajectory, catering to the global market , especially emerging economies, without being encumbered by U.S.-specific regulatory constraints. Regional Compliance: Tether is also reportedly backing other regionally compliant stablecoins in both the U.S. and EU. This suggests a broader strategy of fostering a network of compliant stablecoins tailored to different jurisdictions. What Does This Mean for USDT and the Crypto Market? The potential shift raises several important questions about the future of USDT and its role in the wider cryptocurrency market . While CEO Ardoino expresses optimism about USDT remaining available on U.S. secondary markets, the long-term implications are worth considering. Potential Impacts: Impact Area Potential Consequence US Market Access to USDT Reduced availability on primary exchanges, potentially impacting liquidity and trading pairs directly involving USD. However, secondary market presence might mitigate this. Stablecoin Competition The launch of a new U.S.-compliant stablecoin by Tether could intensify competition in the U.S. stablecoin market , potentially challenging existing players. Global USDT Adoption USDT’s focus on emerging markets could further solidify its dominance in these regions, driving wider crypto adoption in areas with less stringent regulations . Regulatory Scrutiny Tether’s strategic moves will likely be closely watched by regulators globally, potentially influencing future regulatory approaches to stablecoins. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users So, what should crypto users and investors take away from this news? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on regulatory developments in your region and how they might affect stablecoin availability and usage. Diversify Stablecoin Holdings: Consider diversifying your stablecoin portfolio beyond just USDT to mitigate potential risks associated with regulatory changes. Explore other compliant stablecoins available in your jurisdiction. Understand Regional Differences: Recognize that the crypto landscape is becoming increasingly fragmented by regional regulations . Strategies and available assets may vary significantly depending on your location. Monitor Tether’s Announcements: Pay attention to official announcements from Tether regarding their new stablecoin and any changes to USDT’s availability in different markets . Conclusion: A Bold Step into a Regulated Future Tether’s proactive approach to potentially bifurcating its stablecoin strategy – maintaining USDT’s global focus while introducing a new U.S.-compliant option – is a bold move in the face of increasing regulatory complexity. It signals a pragmatic understanding of the evolving crypto landscape and a willingness to adapt to ensure long-term sustainability. The coming months will be crucial in observing how these strategies unfold and reshape the stablecoin market .

Since they don't require machines to secure ledgers, Proof-of-Stake Digital Assets might theoretically be immune from tariff considerations since they don't physically exist. Concerns remain in Ethereum's spot ETF capital flows. Where despite positive year to date net flows through April 3rd, there is a relative lack of demand compared to BTC ETFs. We can see this specifically through ETHE's share of total spot ETH ETF supply - which still stands at 38% and makes ETHE the largest fund. April 4th brings another session of turmoil and panic in global markets. Equities, commodities, and precious metals are all experiencing another day of deep, across-the-board losses. Of all markets, it is cryptocurrencies that are actually holding up well, with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) both green during April 4th trading as of article submission. Frankly, this is a somewhat perplexing development, but I'll get into why I believe there is perhaps a signal in the apparent 'crypto immunity' from global tariff concerns. In this Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHE ) article, we'll get into ETH's correlation with tech stocks, holder data, and recent capital flows. Digital Asset Tariff Immunity? Let's start with the obvious; cryptocurrencies and digital assets don't actually exist. Shocker, I know. But it happens to be true. Thus, in a world with trade-war escalation, assets that are not bound by physics or geographic borders have perhaps understandably shown little regard for tariff concerns since 'Liberation Day.' 5 Day Performance (Seeking Alpha) The chart above shows BTC and ETH against proxies for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as well as Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and Crude Oil ( CL1:COM ). Through 2pm on April 4th BTC and ETH are holding up while virtually every other major asset or index is down by at least 3%. Digital assets theoretically being immune from jurisdiction risk regarding tariffs is really only one part of this, however. What I still find very perplexing about the action for BTC and ETH is that during stock market panics like the one we're seeing in real time, we often see everything down together as market participants raise liquidity any way they can. For instance, it's not out of the realm of possibility that profitable Gold positions could be sold by speculators who are de-risking while equities fall apart. One would think BTC and ETH would be getting dragged down in sympathy with the rest of the market due to possible margin calls. But that is not happening as the week of March 31st draws to a close. IntoTheBlock It's hard to truly express how bizarre this is because these assets are typically tightly correlated with US equities, particularly tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. Between mid-March and today, only Tesla ( TSLA ) has seen correlation with ETH dip below 65%. Most of the stocks shown in the chart above had correlations with ETH in excess of 80%. Could it truly be that tariffs don't impact cryptos? I'm actually much less sold on that possibility; especially for Bitcoin, which has a US mining footprint that requires machines produced overseas for hashing. This is not a concern for ETH, since Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake network. Perhaps more likely? Down nearly 60% since mid-December, ETH has already sold off so bad that it's possible that there is simply nobody left who is willing to sell - even raising liquidity could alleviate problems elsewhere. ETH Holders (IntoTheBlock) At 53% of holders currently 'out of the money,' this level of token holders hanging onto losing positions hasn't been seen in ETH in about 5 years. So what do we do with this information? I've been more cautious about Ethereum in recent months on what I view to be a weakening fundamental story, given the network's lack of fees and scaling through secondary layers that don't require nearly as much ETH for gas payment. Given that, it's hard for me to say 'buy ETH' based on any fundamental improvement in the market. But there are other considerations to keep in mind. Seasonality and Capital Flows ETH Seasonality (TrendSpider) I think we have to take some of the seasonality information with a grain of salt because it flat out did not work in January, February, or March. That said, April and May have historically been the best two months of the year for ETH based on mean change. That figure is 23% for April (2025 is included here) and 31% for May. For me, the bigger thing to pay attention to is whether capital is flowing in or out of ETH-based financial products. Asset (mil) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin -$826 $1,519 $114,475 Ethereum -$370 $316 $9,565 Multi-asset -$206 -$137 $6,366 Solana $27 $86 $1,194 XRP $15 $168 $957 Source: CoinShares, as of March 28th We know that capital exited ETH products during the last full month of March. However, year to date flow for ETH was still positive at $316 million at the end of the month. ETH ETF Flows (Farside Investors) Even though we've seen a little under $60 million come out of Ethereum ETFs so far through three full days in April, the majority of that outflow is from a $31 million single day decline in ETHE on April 2nd. On that same day, an additional $20.2 million came out of the iShares Ethereum ETF ( ETHA ). The problem ultimately is that ETHE's outflow on the 2nd isn't indicative of Grayscale 'fee flight' continuation: ETH ETF Supply Share (TheBlock) In fact, ETH ETF share of on-chain supply still favors ETHE which commands over a third of the total market at 38.3%. Importantly, ETHE holding firm in supply share for most of 2025 is probably more indicative of a lack of demand for other funds. For instance, it took a little over 4 months for the iShares product to become the largest ETF holder of Bitcoin in the US spot ETF market. We're 8 months into ETH ETFs in the US market, and ETHE still has a 43% supply edge over ETHA. I read this primarily as a lack of investment demand for Ethereum more broadly. Closing Takeaways To answer the question from the headline from the title, I do think ETH is sending a signal. On a day filled with motivated sellers, ETH holders were not among them. Ultimately though, I see more than just one signal in the data. While it's quite encouraging that ETH didn't fall apart with the rest of the market on April 4th, it's perhaps more of an indication that ETH isn't actually as far along with traditional investors as digital asset holders might have hoped. Perhaps the reason ETH isn't getting slammed with the rest of the market is because there just aren't enough people holding it to begin with? Bottom pickers may find the $1,800 per coin level to be an interesting enough area to make a contrarian trade attempt. I'll re-share something I said in March about how I still currently view ETH technicals: I see $2,100 per coin serving as support on weekly closes going back to late 2023. That level was breached on a close the week of March 3rd, failed a back test the week of March 10th, and is currently still under that key level as of article submission on March 20th. I, personally, would not entertain taking a stab at that trade from the long side until we see the coin take back $2,100 on a weekly close. The lack of demand for products like ETHA and similarly lower-priced spot ETFs might remain a headwind of Ethereum bulls should holders keep selling out of ETHE positions. In spite of real problems with ETH's network activity, you could still talk me into holding spot ETH ETFs, but ETHE isn't one of them.",ETH-USD|ETHE,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-05 02:36:06

However, many in the crypto industry see the SEC’s decision as a step in the right direction. In an April 4 statement, Crenshaw, who is widely known for opposing the spot Bitcoin ETFs, said that the SEC's statement on stablecoins contained ""legal and factual errors that paint a distorted picture of the USD-stablecoin market that drastically understates its risks."" Crenshaw disagrees, crypto industry applauds Under the new SEC guidelines, stablecoins that meet certain criteria are now considered ""non-securities"" and are exempt from transaction reporting requirements. Crenshaw disputed the accuracy of the analysis made by the SEC in arriving at that decision. She pushed back on the SEC for reiterating issuer actions ""that supposedly stabilize price, ensure redeemability, and otherwise reduce risk."" Source: David Sacks The SEC said that ""albeit briefly, that some USD-stablecoins are available to retail purchasers only through an intermediary and not directly from the issuer."" Crenshaw argued this was misleading. She said: ""It is the general rule, not the exception, that these coins are available to the retail public only through intermediaries who sell them on the secondary market, such as crypto trading platforms."" ""Over 90% of USD-stablecoins in circulation are distributed in this way,"" Crenshaw added. Meanwhile, many in the crypto industry expressed optimism over the decision. Token Metrics founder Ian Ballina said it “feels like a clear step in focusing on what really matters in the crypto space.” Crypto industry says positive step, just late Vemanti CEO Tan Tran said he wished the SEC reached this point three years ago, while Midnight Network’s head of partnerships Ian Kane said it “feels like progress for crypto folks trying to play by the rules.” Crenshaw said it is ""also grossly inaccurate"" for the SEC to reassure users that an issuer can handle unlimited redemptions just because its reserves match or exceed the value of the supply. Related: Stablecoins' in bull market'; Solana sputters: VanEck ""The issuer's overall financial health and solvency cannot be judged by the value of its reserve, which tells us nothing about its liabilities, risk from proprietary financial activities, and so forth,"" Crenshaw said. She explained that stablecoins always carry some risk, particularly during market downturns. It comes only weeks after stablecoin issuer Tether was reportedly engaging with a Big Four accounting firm to audit its assets reserve and verify that its USDT stablecoin is backed at a 1:1 ratio. On March 22, Cointelegraph reported that Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the audit process would be more straightforward under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump.

Russian Central Bank: Crypto Must Be Kept Out of Economy The Governor, a key ally of President Vladimir Putin and the chief architect of Moscow’s digital ruble (CBDC) project, was speaking in the State Duma on April 3, RBC reported. Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina addressing lawmakers in April 2025. (Source: DumaTV/Screenshot) Nabiullina, a long-time crypto skeptic, says Moscow also needs to “increase the liability” for people who make “settlements with cryptocurrencies in Russia.” She said that crypto must be kept out of “domestic settlements,” although she conceded that tokens could be used in international trade “within the framework of” the sandbox. Nabiullina said: “Our position is unchanged. We cannot allow crypto to penetrate into domestic monetary circulation; into settlements within the country. We propose to simultaneously pursue [crypto] investment opportunities and increase liability for the use of crypto in settlements within the country.” Russia has agreed to provide arms and military training to a newly formed joint force between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso https://t.co/zkp0MxIgXH — Bloomberg (@business) April 3, 2025 Criminal Liability for Traders? Russian lawmakers outlawed the use of crypto in payments back in 2020 . More recently, they have also legalized crypto mining. But Moscow is yet to pass any laws that govern the status of crypto trading. Lawmakers have also yet to rule on crypto’s legal status. Moscow is also still undecided on how it should police crypto exchanges . And while the use of crypto as a “domestic settlement tool” is illegal, enforcement is thought to be rare. Offenders do not currently face criminal liability. But Nabiullina, it appears, wants to change this. Russian dissident Gorinov fails in appeal against sentence for 'justifying terrorism' https://t.co/j3Qz0VNCdJ pic.twitter.com/hfL1RbDVSw — Reuters (@Reuters) April 3, 2025 The Central Bank Governor said the Russian government “really must protect retail investors from investing in crypto.” She explained: “Crypto is very volatile. Retail investors do not understand the risks involved with crypto. And it is unclear who is responsible for these coins.” However, it appears Nabiullina has accepted that despite her well-document wishes to keep crypto “out of the Russian economy,” she has also made many concessions to pro-industry forces.

(Source: Pyerviy Kanal/Screenshot) ‘Highly Qualified Investors’ Nabiullina again gave her blessing to plans to allow “highly qualified investors” to invest in crypto. However, she said this should be done “within the framework” of the sandbox. She even suggested that “ordinary qualified investors” could be given permission to invest in crypto derivatives “even outside” the sandbox. Nabiullina said: “We propose allowing highly qualified investors to invest in Russian crypto infrastructure. The criteria can be discussed.” Nearly 50% of Polymarket bettors predict that a recession is coming in 2025, a new poll on the decentralized betting market's website shows. #Polymarket #Tariffs https://t.co/oSxvLpnCOk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 Nabiullina dismissed notions that her stance was unreasonable. She noted that the Central Bank “has an absolutely normal approach” to the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign economic activity. She added that “several” companies were working in the sandbox. These companies are using crypto as a sanctions-evading tool for cross-border payments with overseas partners, she suggested. However, Nabiullina said she would not reveal the details of the firms involved “for obvious reasons.” Under existing proposals, only citizens who have already invested over 100 million rubles (around $1.2 million) in securities and deposits will be allowed to obtain the “super-qualified” investor status required to trade crypto in the sandbox. A further exception will be made for people whose yearly income “amounts to more than 50 million rubles ($587,000).” Russian bailiffs say they have developed new methods to help them convert Bitcoin (BTC) seized in criminal cases into cash for the state’s treasury. #Russia #Bitcoin https://t.co/a8ZnK7uvIX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 Russian Central Bank Crypto Stance: Lawmakers Divided After the Central Bank Governor had finished her address, the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets Anatoly Aksakov suggested Moscow remains divided on the matter of crypto regulation. Vyacheslav Volodin, Chairman of the State Duma. (Source: Duma.gov.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Aksakov said that lower house lawmakers are “showing significant interest in the topic of cryptocurrencies.” He said that MPs are now either “attacking crypto,” or “are interested in the industry themselves.” Interfax , meanwhile, reported that Vyacheslav Volodin, the State Duma’s long-serving Chairman, urged lawmakers to step up their regulatory efforts on April 3. Volodin said: “Let’s think about what other rules we could make in this sector. Please don’t stop.

Saylor shared this view on X, telling his 4.2 million followers about Bitcoin’s unique position compared to physical goods. Related Reading: XRP Breakout Alert!

According to reports, many investors worried about how Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” plans would affect crypto prices. But these concerns haven’t caused major price drops so far. Asian Countries Face Highest Import Taxes Based on information from Trump’s announcement, several Asian nations will face steep tariffs on their goods entering the United States. China will see a 34% tax rate, while Japan faces 24%. Taiwan’s imports will be charged at 32%, and Vietnam tops the list with a 46% tariff.

Even American allies must pay more to sell their products in the US market. The UK will face a 10% tax on imports, Israel 17%, European Union countries 20%, and India 26%. China has already threatened to respond with its own tariffs if Trump doesn’t reverse his decision. The back-and-forth raises questions about broader economic impacts. Bitcoin Price Holds Strong Despite Economic Uncertainty Although Trump’s tariff announcements caused market jitters, Bitcoin prices have remained relatively stable. The cryptocurrency was trading at $83,105 when this article was written, with only a 1% drop over the last 24 hours. Some market analysts opine that physical goods carry the brunt of tariff effects, while digital assets may escape direct effects. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? The tariff impasse serves to emphasize Bitcoin’s odd position in global commerce. Unlike oil, gold, or manufactured goods that need to physically traverse borders, Bitcoin transactions occur electronically. This aspect may make cryptocurrencies a winner in trade conflicts since they cannot be halted or taxed at border points. Several investors are worrying that Bitcoin could still be indirectly affected by increased tariffs. If the costlier imports reduce the income of companies and consumers, they might invest less money into cryptocurrency, which might end up reducing funding to the cryptocurrency market. For now, it’s still above the $80,000 mark while the market watches the tariff development. Trump labeled his tariff proposal as “reciprocal,” adding that it reflects what other nations are charging on American products. As countries react to these new trade policies, cryptocurrency markets appear less impacted than other commodity markets.

Major holders of popular digital assets are now shifting their focus towards five emerging altcoins. The attention that these tokens are getting shows that there is belief in these smaller tokens. What are these altcoins, and why are they attracting interest from the big players? The answer could unveil the next big opportunity in the crypto industry. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The attention around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is attracting both fans in the sports world and crypto enthusiasts, creating a nice integration that is gaining serious attention. With a strong presale and the engagement of its community, some investors are already eyeing major gains from the project. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that rely on trends without substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. The project is blending the energy in the sports world with the viral nature of the meme culture, and it is working. The presale has been moving fast, with early buyers purchasing tokens at a fraction of what most consider would be the price of the asset in the future. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but the demand has been high. The price has already increased from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to about $0.003333 in Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million target already raised. Investors who got in early have already enjoyed a nice discount, and with the final presale target of $0.1, those numbers are attracting the attention of investors. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse has already earned a feature on CoinMarketCap, with the community showing a bullish mood on the coin–95% of the voters predict that $XYZ would grow. XYZ has also seen the attention of reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCpitalMaster, who has about 800,000 followers recently expressed his support for the project, noting that it has the best opportunity to reach the top. While nothing is sure in the crypto industry, the excitement cannot be denied. Aside from the hype, the tokenomics model of XYZVerse is aimed at enabling long-term sustainability. The developers said that 15% will be used for liquidity, in order to create a good market foundation. The project has also put aside 10% to reward its loyal followers via airdrops and bonuses. In addition, about 17.13% has been put aside for burns, which would reduce the supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing that makes XYZVerse appealing is its focus on its community. The team recently announced its Ambassador Program, where users get the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that is just the start, as the project is already in talks with sports celebrities to increase visibility. By integrating sports fans and the crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different using entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With its presale still growing fast, a strong community, and a good roadmap, XYZVerse has what it takes to get to the top in the crypto market. While the crypto market remains unpredictable, many investors are seeing this as an opportunity to enter a big project. The presale won’t last forever, so if you’re interested, now might be the best time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity HBAR: The Green Alternative Shaping the Future of Digital Transactions Hedera Hashgraph has been catching attention with its approach to decentralized networks. Unlike traditional blockchains, it uses hashgraph technology for its ledger. This method is efficient and environmentally friendly since it does not rely on mining. As a result of this, transactions are faster, costs are lower, and energy footprints are reduced. HBAR, the native token of the project, helps the network by covering transaction fees and ensuring security through its proof-of-stake system. This makes it the best option for quick, secure transactions, as well as smart contract applications in finance and other aspects. In the blockchain industry where there is competition among projects, Hedera Hashgraph faces the challenges of standing out. While its technology offers speed, security, and efficiency, it lacks community engagement compared to other open-source projects. However, with support from big projects in the sector, there is hope for the future. In this current market, where traders prefer sustainability and performance, HBAR presents the better alternative. Its special features could appeal to investors seeking solutions that go beyond traditional blockchains, suggesting a bright future for this project. Stellar (XLM): Connecting Currencies for a Global Money Revolution Stellar (XLM) is changing the way we think about how money moves across borders. Since its launch in 2014, the decentralized network has made it possible to transfer money easily across the border regardless of the currency. Whether it’s dollars, euros, or even bitcoin, this system allows fast transactions without favoring any currency. The platform is supported by the Stellar Developments Foundation, with initial support from Stripe. It has also processed billions of transactions and partnered with several companies in the world, proving its value in the real world. In today’s market, Stellar’s technology gives traders an edge. Unlike many projects that aim to push out traditional financial systems, Stellar aims to make them better through collaborations. This approach allows individuals to send money using its app and businesses to build blockchain applications or handle payments and conversions without issues. With the growing interest in the digital finance sector, Stellar’s ability to carry out transactions in any currency, including digital assets, makes it one of the best options in the market. Its focus on partnerships and integrations also makes the project an attractive option in global finance. NEAR Protocol: Sharding the Way to a Scalable Decentralized Future NEAR Protocol is making a name for itself in the blockchain industry. The project helps developers to create and launch their apps more easily. NEAR uses a technology called sharding to improve scalability and efficiency, meaning that transactions can be cheaper and faster. The platform has raised about $20 million from venture firms since its launch by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin. The platform is on a distributed network, which is similar to centralized data storage but without a single point of control. What makes NEAR one of the best in the industry is its technology stack. The Nightshade sharding solution ensures the network can divide transactions, handling more than one at a time. The Rainbow Bridge also allows easy token transfers from Ethereum, increasing interoperability. Aurora, the platform’s Layer 2 solution, uses Ethereum’s technology for its performance and lower fees. In the current market, where scalability and low costs are important, NEAR stands out. Compared to most platforms, it has better developer support and user accessibility, making it an attractive option. As the demand for efficient dApps continues to grow, NEAR’s approach could put it in the best position in the market. Pi Network: The Cryptocurrency You Can Mine on Your Phone Imagine earning digital assets on your mobile without any expensive hardware or draining the battery. That is what Pi Network, a mobile-first crypto-mining community started in 2019 by Stanford graduates promises. Pi allows you to mine its digital assets by checking in daily on the app. By adding trusted contacts, users can build a team of verified members, creating a global trust graph that secures the network without the need for massive computing power. Pi Network aims to make digital assets accessible to everyone. Unlike Bitcoin which needs energy for mining, Pi uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol due to its efficiency and eco-friendly nature. Users earn rewards for increasing their trust circle, daily check-ins and running full nodes. With a focus on decentralization and fair access, Pi could become one of the biggest projects in the crypto market. With a plan to move from enclosed mainnet to open network, Pi might become the best option in the market, especially for traders looking to enter the market without much investment in hardware. Conclusion While HBAR, XLM, NEAR, and PI are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports-meme ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth and becoming the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

This time the vulnerability was discovered in a widely used ‘elliptic library.’ What makes matters worse – its exploitation could lead to hackers taking control of users’ private keys and draining wallets. All through a simple fraudulent message signed by a user. Is this a critical issue? The first thing to consider is the fact that libraries like elliptic provide developers with ready-made code components. This means that instead of writing the code from scratch and checking it as they go, developers just borrow the elements they need. While it’s considered to be a safer practice, since the libraries are continuously used and tested, this also increases the risks if one vulnerability gets through. Elliptic library is used extensively across the JavaScript ecosystem. It powers cryptographic functions in many well-known blockchain projects, web applications and security systems. According to NPM statistics, the package containing the error is downloaded approximately 12–13 million times weekly, with over 3,000 projects directly listing it as a dependency. This broad usage implies that the vulnerability potentially affects a vast number of applications – especially cryptocurrency wallets, blockchain nodes and electronic signature systems – as well as any service relying on ECDSA signatures through elliptic, especially when handling externally provided input. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to fully compromise sensitive data without proper authorization. That’s why the issue received an extremely high severity rating – approximately nine out of 10 on the CVSS scale. It’s important to point out that exploiting this vulnerability requires a very specific sequence of actions and the victim must sign arbitrary data provided by the attacker. That means that some projects may remain safe, for example, if an application only signs predetermined internal messages. Still, many users don’t pay as much attention when signing messages via crypto wallets as they do when signing a transaction. Whenever a Web 3.0 site asks users to sign terms of service, users often neglect to read them. Similarly, users might quickly sign a message for an airdrop without fully understanding the implications. Technical details The problem comes from not handling errors properly during the creation of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures. ECDSA is commonly used to confirm that messages, like blockchain transactions, are genuine. To create a signature, you need a secret key – only the owner knows it – and a unique random number called a ‘nonce.’ If the same nonce is used more than once for different messages, someone could figure out the secret key using math. Normally, attackers can’t figure out the private key from one or two signatures because each one uses a unique random number (nonce). But the elliptic library has a flaw – i f it gets an odd type of input (like a special string instead of the expected format), it could create two signatures with the same nonce for different messages. This mistake could reveal the private key, which should never happen in proper ECDSA use. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs two things. A valid message and its signature from the user – for instance, from any previous interactions The user to sign a second message explicitly created to exploit the vulnerability With these two signatures, the attacker can compute the user’s private key, gaining full access to funds and actions associated with it. Detailed information is available in the GitHub Security Advisory . Exploitation scenarios Attackers may exploit this vulnerability through various methods, including the following. Phishing attacks that direct users to fake websites and request message signatures Malicious DApps (decentralized applications) disguised as harmless services, such as signing terms of use or participating in airdrops Social engineering convincing users to sign seemingly harmless messages Compromising servers’ private keys that sign messages from users A particularly concerning aspect is users’ generally lax attitude toward signing messages compared to transactions. Crypto projects frequently ask users to sign terms of service or airdrop participation messages, potentially making exploitation easier. So, think about it – would you sign a message to claim free tokens? What if that signature could cost you your entire crypto balance? Recommendations Users must promptly update all applications and wallets that utilize the elliptic library for signatures to the latest secure version. Exercise caution when signing messages, particularly from unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Developers of wallets and applications should verify their elliptic library version. If any users could be affected by the vulnerable version, developers must inform them about the urgent need for updating. Gleb Zykov is the co-founder and CTO of HashEx Blockchain Security .

While many coins show potential, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves with its unique presale structure and deflationary token burn mechanism. Meanwhile, Near Protocol is making headlines with its latest blockchain advancements, and Bitcoin Cash is seeing renewed interest due to network upgrades. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is progressing rapidly, with the current phase at Glacial Glade, offering investors a limited window to secure tokens at $0.000087. This article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Near Protocol, and Bitcoin Cash. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: Token Burns & Scarcity Boost A powerful force in the meme coin sector, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is setting itself apart with a robust token burn mechanism designed to enhance scarcity and drive value. The project permanently removes unsold tokens every week during the presale, ensuring a deflationary supply model. Furthermore, all remaining tokens after the presale will be burned, creating an environment that continuously increases the coin’s rarity. Operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin, the best crypto to join in April 2025 , maintains full transparency in its burn transactions. This unique approach aligns perfectly with its presale journey, where demand continues to surge. With over $2 million raised and a launch price set at $0.008, early investors at the current Glacial Glade phase ($0.000087) stand to gain an astonishing 9,084.48% ROI by the time of listing. Glacial Glade Presale Phase – The Most Anticipated Crypto Sale? The meme coin presale of Arctic Pablo has now reached Glacial Glade, the 17th phase of its ambitious journey. As this unique location-based presale progresses, the entry price remains at an attractive $0.000087, offering immense potential before the launch price of $0.008. The presale structure eliminates traditional stages, instead allowing Arctic Pablo to “travel” across different locations, making each phase increasingly exclusive. With the price set to rise as new locations unlock, this might be the last opportunity to invest at such a low entry point. Once Glacial Glade ends, the cost per APC will increase again, and the ROI potential for new buyers will diminish. Investors keen on maximizing returns should act now before Arctic Pablo reaches its next destination. What Experts Are Saying About Arctic Pablo Coin’s Future Market experts are highly optimistic about the future of Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), with many predicting that it could reach $0.10 after its initial listing at $0.008. To put this into perspective, a $100 investment today would yield approximately 1,149,425 APC tokens. At the current listing price of $0.008, those tokens would be worth $9,195. However, if the price rises to $0.10, that same $100 investment could skyrocket to $114,942. With such significant potential returns, it’s no surprise that investors are eager to buy now before the price climbs even higher. Near Protocol’s Innovation: Revolutionizing Web3 Development Near Protocol continues to push boundaries in the blockchain space, recently announcing its groundbreaking Chain Signatures feature. This innovation aims to enhance cross-chain interoperability, allowing seamless transactions between Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Near’s ecosystem. The development positions Near as a leader in Web3 infrastructure, enabling developers to build more efficient decentralized applications (dApps). With growing institutional interest and a rising adoption rate, Near Protocol is solidifying its place in the crypto industry. Bitcoin Cash’s Surge: Major Upgrade Enhances Network Efficiency Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is gaining traction after its latest network upgrade focused on improving transaction efficiency and reducing fees. The upgrade enhances scalability and security, making BCH a more attractive option for peer-to-peer transactions. With increased adoption by merchants and a strengthening market position, Bitcoin Cash is proving to be a resilient contender in the digital payments space. Final Words With Arctic Pablo Coin ’s presale nearing a crucial turning point at Glacial Glade, investors have a limited window to lock in early-stage gains before the price climbs further. Meanwhile, Near Protocol’s advancements in Web3 technology and Bitcoin Cash’s enhanced efficiency are drawing attention. However, the most urgent opportunity remains with Arctic Pablo Coin, as its presale’s deflationary structure and high ROI potential make it the Best Crypto to Join in April 2025. Don’t miss out—secure APC tokens before the next price jump!

BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as one of those projects—gathering momentum with a growing user base, sharp buyer interest, and a rapidly evolving roadmap. With $211.5 million already raised and 19.1 billion BDAG tokens sold, BlockDAG’s presale is among the fastest-moving in recent memory. Early adopters have already gained a 2,380% return on their entry, and with 10 centralized exchange (CEX) listings coming soon, the level of anticipation is rising. As the token price increases with each batch, industry observers are starting to question just how far BDAG can go. Presale Demand Builds as Early Buyers Lock in Strong Returns BlockDAG’s presale momentum offers insight into growing market confidence. With over $211.5 million raised and 19.1 billion BDAG sold, the numbers speak for themselves. This isn’t just hype—it’s a sign that the project is being closely watched by both retail and institutional participants. For those who got in early, the reward has already been substantial. Initial buyers have seen up to 2,380% ROI, a figure that continues to drive urgency around remaining batches. Each stage of the presale brings a price increase, encouraging earlier entry and further accelerating demand. As more buyers enter, supply becomes tighter and the sense of opportunity becomes more immediate. The project’s forward momentum is evident, and its strong presale performance suggests BlockDAG is entering a new phase—where sustained interest could become long-term adoption. BDAG’s Current Batch Price Rises—Is This the Last Entry Point Below $0.03? With the presale now in Batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248—far above its starting point of $0.001. Each batch has sold out quickly, and the current rate of sales indicates that the final stages may arrive sooner than expected. For those looking to enter, this may be one of the last opportunities to buy BDAG at what is still considered a low price point. The projected return has drawn attention as well. If BDAG hits its target price of $1 after launch, current batch buyers could see a 3,932% return. That type of upside potential is rare—and it’s a key reason analysts continue to highlight BDAG’s market potential. With demand holding steady and 19.1 billion coins already sold, the remaining batches are likely to draw heavy interest. If BDAG continues on its current path, future access may come with a much higher entry price. What Exchange Listings Could Mean for BDAG’s Next Chapter BlockDAG is preparing for its move to the next level with 10 CEX listings lined up. For presale coins, listing on major exchanges often marks a turning point—bringing increased liquidity, broader exposure, and a new wave of buyer attention. But beyond the initial excitement, these listings represent something more lasting: easier access for global users and increased credibility in the eyes of the broader crypto market. When a project that’s already gained strong presale traction becomes available to a much larger audience, demand often spikes—and so does price activity. Add in the upcoming Mainnet launch, and BDAG has all the makings of a project entering its most critical phase. It’s not just about launch day gains—it’s about building a foundation that supports real, long-term growth in the crypto ecosystem. Summing Up! BlockDAG’s presale success has made it one of the most talked-about launches in crypto this year. With 19.1 billion BDAG sold and each batch bringing a new price hike, the window for lower entry is closing. Momentum is strong—and that momentum is being backed by meaningful metrics. With 10 centralized exchange listings approaching and a highly anticipated Mainnet debut on the way, BlockDAG is positioned to move beyond presale headlines into lasting market presence. As buzz builds and access expands, BDAG may soon prove to be not just a fast mover—but one of the defining crypto projects of the next cycle.

Analysts Say Price Could Moon After 25 Presale Stages,https://thecoinrise.com/why-buy-dragoin-early-at-0-0000292-analysts-say-price-could-moon-after-25-presale-stages/,"Picture getting into a rising meme coin before the crowd notices—and at its cheapest rate. Dragoin ($DDGN) has crafted that very setup. Its presale spans 25 themed stages inspired by legendary dragon fights. Each new phase brings fewer tokens and a higher price, making early access the key to potential future profits. The earlier you buy, the lower the price—and the better the chance to make more once Dragoin hits exchanges. As each phase closes, the token supply thins and prices increase. Right now, early buyers can grab Dragoin at a massive discount. Waiting too long, though, could mean paying a lot more for far fewer tokens. Dragoin isn’t just another token with a funny name. It delivers real benefits, including a Telegram-based game where players can train dragons, compete, and earn rewards. Early supporters get the dual advantage of cheap tokens and the chance to shape the growing community. Token Price Rises Stage by Stage Dragoin’s presale breaks the usual mold. It invites buyers into 25 unique stages, each one themed around a classic dragon showdown. Every stage offers a limited number of $DDGN at a fixed price. Once the tokens from one stage are gone, the next begins instantly—with a price hike. Buyers entering at Stage 1 secure the best deal. With every stage, token availability drops, and the cost rises fast. Early stages offer more tokens at attractive rates, urging users to act quickly. Later stages release fewer tokens, increasing their value but making them costlier. Plus, unsold tokens are burned after each stage, reducing the total supply and putting upward pressure on value right away. Scarce Supply Makes Early Moves Matter At the start of the Dragoin presale, it’s all about access: plenty of tokens, lowest possible price. But this window narrows fast. After each stage, available tokens vanish, leaving less on the market and pushing prices up. Those who buy early gain a clear edge—more tokens for less money. This setup builds urgency. By the halfway mark, prices will already be climbing sharply. Those who delay will end up with fewer tokens for more money—and lower profit potential. Early participants grab the most favorable pricing, filling their wallets before Dragoin hits public exchanges. Those who wait might miss the best returns or get priced out altogether. Meme Coin Status with Real-World Function Dragoin goes beyond the typical meme coin template. It introduces a Telegram-based play-to-earn experience where users hatch, train, and battle dragons for $DDGN rewards. This gives the coin true utility, offering more than just speculative value. The game is simple and fun, open to players of all experience levels. Early buyers don’t just score better prices—they can also be among the first to dive into the gameplay and earn real rewards. These early users will influence how the game and the broader Dragoin ecosystem develop, giving them a voice in shaping its direction. It’s a two-part win: low-cost tokens now and early entry into an expanding community. Clear and Fair Token Structure Dragoin’s tokenomics are built on simplicity and openness. Out of a total of 200 billion $DDGN, 50% goes to the presale. The rest is allocated for ecosystem development, liquidity, and team support. The focus is long-term success, not short-term hype or manipulation. DDGN is priced at just $0.0000292 and will hit the $0.002 at launch after its 25 stages. Fairness matters. After the presale, the Dragoin team plans to renounce contract ownership. This hands control to the community and reduces risks tied to central authority. All smart contracts tied to Dragoin are also independently audited, adding a layer of protection for buyers. Early participants can feel confident that while they’re getting in at the best prices, they’re also buying into a secure and professionally vetted system. Early Entry Delivers Maximum Value Getting in early on Dragoin’s presale is a strategic move. Early buyers secure more tokens for a lower price—putting them in a strong position for gains after launch. As each stage closes, leftover tokens are burned, supply tightens, and prices increase. Delays could mean missing this prime window or paying far more. Dragoin offers more than a crypto purchase—it invites users into an engaging, rewards-based community built around gaming. With a shrinking supply and token prices starting at rock-bottom, smart investors will recognize the value of moving quickly. The best token rates are available now. Those who hesitate might pay extra or miss out entirely. Don’t wait—lock in your early advantage by joining the Dragoin presale today.

This is a big shift and adds to the list of crypto areas the SEC is slowly letting go of, like memecoins and mining. Not Every Stablecoin is a Security NEW: The @SECGov Division of Corporation Finance has just put out guidance on stablecoins. The agency has minted a new term — ‘Covered Stablecoins’ which describe stablecoins that “maintain a stable value relative to the United States Dollar, on a one-for-one basis, can be… pic.twitter.com/g3HjCc7mHa — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 4, 2025 According to a post by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, the SEC has introduced a new category called “Covered Stablecoins.” These digital coins are always equal in value to the U.S. dollar — one coin equals one dollar. To qualify, these coins must be backed by safe, easy-to-sell assets that match or exceed the amount of coins in circulation. This means they’re considered stable, safe, and easily redeemable for real dollars at any time. The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance made it clear that these kinds of stablecoins are not being treated as investments. Because of that, they do not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction — which is a big deal for projects trying to stay compliant while offering dollar-backed crypto. However, this doesn’t apply to all stablecoins. The SEC says this guidance doesn’t include algorithmic stablecoins (which use code to keep their value stable), stablecoins that offer yield or interest, or coins tied to other assets like gold or foreign currencies. These other types might still be considered securities or face other regulations. This new update is a positive step for regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC or PayPal’s PYUSD, giving them a bit more breathing room and clarity. But the rest of the stablecoin space still sits in a gray area. But No Interest for Users But there is something else that is very important to note: Even though stablecoin companies can make money (like through interest on their reserves), they’re not allowed to share that money with users. So, users won’t earn interest from holding these covered stablecoins. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong isn’t happy about that. He said he wants Congress to change the rules so users can earn interest without the coins being considered securities. Circle Applauds, Congress Pushes Ahead Circle President Heath Tarbert praised the SEC for its decision, saying that only stablecoins with real backing, like USDC, qualify. At the same time, Congress is working on stablecoin rules. Bills are moving through both the House and Senate with strong support from both parties. As political discussions grow, with Trump supporters pushing their own crypto plans, everyone’s attention is on the SEC’s upcoming crypto summit, where trading will be a major focus.",News|Crypto Regulations|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 04:23:24

While Ripple’s executives have confirmed the case is over, there’s been no official statement from the SEC, leaving many in the XRP community wondering what’s really going on. To add to the mystery, an unexpected filing popped up in the court case. A guy named Justin W. Keener sent an emergency request, claiming he has “decisive evidence” that could help Ripple and support freedom for Americans. But no one knows exactly what this evidence is. Keener says it has something to do with investment contracts he’s been collecting.

Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel said it’s basically like spam getting through the court’s system and will likely be thrown out quickly. He explained that Keener isn’t part of the case and doesn’t have the right to submit evidence. Some people asked if Judge Analisa Torres might change her decision about Ripple’s liability.

After briefly climbing past the $87,000 mark earlier this week, the cryptocurrency experienced a significant pullback, declining to $81,332 earlier today. As of the latest data, Bitcoin is trading at around $82,600, reflecting a weekly decrease of about 7.6%. This downward momentum indicates ongoing market uncertainty, influencing investor strategies and market sentiment. With frequent retracements and short-lived surges, the current pattern highlights persistent volatility in the cryptocurrency space. This instability has prompted some analysts to explore more profound insights into investor behavior to predict potential market directions. Related Reading: Bitcoin On High Alert: US Recession Odds Top 50% On Kalshi Analyzing Binance User Activity for BTC Market Signals CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn recently provided a perspective on Bitcoin market dynamics through an analysis of user activity on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Maartunn’s investigation into Binance user retention patterns offered some interesting insights into trading behavior that could influence Bitcoin’s market performance. According to the analyst’s findings, over half of returning Binance users make their second deposit within 16 days following their initial transaction. Nearly 10% of users perform their second deposit within just one day, indicating active trading behavior rather than passive investment strategies. Furthermore, approximately one-third of returning users reload their accounts by day seven, reinforcing the notion that Binance predominantly attracts traders engaging in frequent transactions. Over 50% of Returning Binance Users Make a Second Deposit Within 16 Days “Some interesting takeaways: 🔹 Nearly 10% return on Day 1, showing immediate trading interest. 🔹 By Day 7, one-third of users have already reloaded. 🔹 By Day 16, over 50% of returning users have made a… pic.twitter.com/OG6d6BKUdt — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 4, 2025 What Does This Mean for Bitcoin? This high frequency of early deposits by returning users highlights a pattern of short-term trading rather than long-term holding. Such active engagement on Binance can directly impact Bitcoin’s price volatility, as rapid buying and selling contribute significantly to market fluctuations. Increased trading activity shortly after initial deposits often implies speculative market behavior, potentially leading to quick price movements in both directions. Overall, the behavioral trends observed on Binance suggest that Bitcoin might continue to experience sharp volatility in the near term. The quick return rate of traders to deposit funds signals a market where trading volume spikes are frequent, influencing Bitcoin’s price stability.

Investors have lost hope for the Pi Coin price recovery amid expectations of another 60% fall to $0.1. Despite a few developments, the overall market sentiment for the altcoin has turned extremely bearish. Pi Network Has Been On A Freefall The Pi Network price has been respecting no support levels and has been facing strong selling pressure with daily trading volumes shooting to $500 million. This massive dumping comes as investors have been losing faith in the project amid delays in mainnet launch, KYC process, etc. As a result, several top crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have distanced themselves from Pi Coin listing on their platforms. On the other hand, PiDaoSwap has raised concerns over prolonged delays in receiving Know Your Business (KYB) approvals. As a temporary workaround, PiDaoSwap has opted to launch its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Binance Chain to maintain project momentum while awaiting regulatory clearance. Additionally, other developments like the Banxa integration are also not working in Pi Network’s favor at the moment. Four Reasons Pi Coin Price Could Drop to $0.1 Amid the very poor performance and 85% drop from its February high of $3.0, experts are now speculating that the Pi Coin price could drop to $0.1. The four main factors that can contribute to this are: Mass Sell-Off Risk: With a community exceeding 60 million users, concerns are mounting over what could happen once unverified holders complete KYC. If a significant portion decides to cash out, the resulting supply flood could overwhelm the market. Currently, Pi Network has 6.79 billion tokens in circulation, with a max supply of 100 billion—leaving ample room for dilution. Lack of Major Exchange Listings: Without listings on top-tier platforms like Binance or Coinbase, market confidence could falter. Pi may remain confined to mid-tier exchanges such as OKX and Gate.io, limiting liquidity and price stability. Macro Market Weakness: A broader crypto market downturn—especially if Bitcoin drops below the $70K level—could trigger widespread altcoin selloffs. As a highly speculative asset, Pi would likely be among the hardest hit. Stagnant Utility Growth: Projects like Zito Realty and PiFest have been cited as real-world applications, but if such initiatives fail to scale meaningfully, the ecosystem may lose momentum, driving Pi closer to penny-coin status. Our Pi Coin price prediction shows the altcoin will be trading under $0.40 level over the next month. Looking at the current free fall, the Pi core team needs to step up to arrest the further downside, and regain trust within the community.

He clarified that his country will not pursue retaliatory measures, claiming he is willing to work together with the US president. Milei even commented , “Argentina is going to move forward to readjust the regulations so that we meet the requirements of the reciprocal tariffs proposal developed.” Milei said he’s fulfilled 9 of 16 requirements of Trump’s new tariffs The United States has imposed a 10% tariff on Argentine goods entering the country. However, Milei has argued that he’s willing to compromise and introduce legislative reforms to meet the requirements of Trump’s new tariffs. According to Milei, they’ve already taken care of 9 out of 16 requirements. He’s even asked his country’s Foreign Ministry and Commerce Secretariat to cater to the remaining requirements. He also pledged to address all other outstanding issues with the United States promptly. He believes all the changes his country will make will bring it closer to securing a free trade agreement with the US, anticipating a time without tariffs or trade restrictions. A while back, he even said he would withdraw from the Mercosur regional trade bloc should the need arise. He remains convinced that for Argentina to be great again, it will need to partner with the United States, and he is clearly ready to do what it takes to ensure a peaceful relationship between the two nations. So far, the Argentine government is planning to harmonize tariffs on about 50 products. However, it said it would start with about 10 products. Milei has consistently sought the favor of President Trump, hoping to protect Argentine interests Milei had flown overnight to receive an award on Thursday at a right-wing gala at Mar-a-Lago. He had hoped to meet Trump, but, to his disappointment, the two did not meet. Milei has always publicly shown his adoration for Trump, praising him as a great leader, thus cultivating a somewhat smooth relationship with the American President. He’s even tried to mimic some of Trump’s actions. Sometime after Trump declared that he would pull the United States from the World Health Organization, Milei ordered his country’s withdrawal from the agency. Moreover, after Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, he argued that he would do so too. His efforts may not have gone to waste with some of his ministers believing their president gained Trump’s favor. For starters, Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s new foreign minister, claimed that every time Trump meets Milei, he always says, “I like this guy.” Furthermore, in some of his public appearances, Trump has acknowledged the Argentine leader, commending him for reducing inflation and enhancing economic growth in his country. Some have suggested that Milei’s curried favor with the President is why Argentina only received 10% tariffs instead of the higher tariff rates applied to countries like China and India. In 2024, Argentina’s exports to the US surged by over 13% year on year, culminating in almost $6.5 billion total. The growth even resulted in the country’s first trade surplus with the U.S. in nearly two decades, with a positive trade balance of $232 million. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The price has jumped above the $2.11 mark and is now aiming to break higher levels. This rebound signals renewed bullish momentum, with traders watching closely to see if XRP can maintain this upward trend and target new resistance levels. The market’s positive sentiment is fueled by growing interest in XRP, especially in regions like South Korea, where it continues to dominate trading volumes. Has XRP Outpaced BTC And ETH? XRP is one of the top-traded cryptocurrencies in South Korea, especially on Upbit, the country’s leading exchange. According to Kaiko Research, XRP-KRW has held the top spot for trading volume 70 times this year, even outpacing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in popularity. Unlike global markets where BTC and ETH dominate, South Korea’s crypto scene is more diverse, with altcoins like XRP, STX, DOGE, and SOL frequently topping trading charts. XRP’s strong demand reflects its active community and liquidity in the region. “Upbit, on the other hand, has had more than 40 different instruments grab the top spot on at least one day. XRP-KRW has the most days on top at 70, followed by BTC-KRW at 64. After that, it’s chaotic. Tokens like T (yes, just T), HIVE, PUNDIX, and STEEM have all spent at least a day at the top,” a research by Kaiko said. South Korea’s strict crypto regulations, requiring exchanges to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), have helped create a stable trading environment. Despite global attention often focusing on the U.S. or Europe, South Korea’s vibrant crypto market—especially XRP’s performance—shows just how dynamic and unique it truly is.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 05:35:41

Have you been keeping an eye on the latest projects? The next few months could be the turning point for some of these coins, with presales and developments making waves in the crypto world. For those looking to dive in, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin are creating excitement like never before. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin, and why Arctic Pablo is currently one to watch. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Meme Coin Phenomenon If you haven’t heard of Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), you might want to sit up and pay attention. APC’s presale is nothing short of electrifying, offering investors an opportunity to get in early at an unbeatable price of $0.000087. With a staggering 9084.48% ROI projected from the 17th phase, Glacial Glade, to the final listing price of $0.008, the potential for massive returns is hard to ignore. What’s driving this buzz? For one, the project’s token burn mechanism boosts scarcity and value by eliminating unsold tokens weekly during the presale. Plus, as tokens are burned, the deflationary environment increases the appeal for investors who want to get in early. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure is also unique, with no stages – instead, the presale is divided by locations, marking a new chapter in its journey as it “travels” through different phases. As of now, APC has raised over $2 million, and there’s still time to join the early investors who stand to reap the rewards of this rapidly growing project. With the price increasing as the coin moves through new locations, including the current location of Glacial Glade, it’s an exciting time to invest at such an affordable price. Arctic Pablo Presale: A Limited-Time Opportunity By investing early, you can potentially see a return of 9084.48% by the time the coin reaches its listing price of $0.008. The meme coin presale is divided by locations, so as Arctic Pablo progresses, the price will inevitably rise. Don’t miss the chance to secure your share of APC at this remarkable price before it’s too late. The token burn mechanism ensures that the coin’s scarcity increases over time, increasing its potential value. As a result, those who are lucky enough to enter at this stage will be positioned for incredible rewards when the presale concludes. Shiba Inu: The Resilient Meme Coin Continues to Shine Shiba Inu has been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts for a while now, and it continues to show resilience in the face of market challenges. Recently, Shiba Inu made headlines with its ShibaSwap 2.0 launch, a major upgrade that enhances the functionality of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. With Shiba Inu NFTs gaining more traction and the community’s unwavering support, Shiba Inu has proven it’s not just a passing trend. The coin has maintained a loyal following and continues offering new opportunities for seasoned investors and newcomers alike. As Shiba Inu expands its ecosystem, it remains a crucial player in the meme coin market and a coin worth watching. Pepe Coin: A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Space Pepe Coin, another fan favorite, has gained attention for its unique branding and meme-based appeal. Pepe Coin’s market activity has recently been impressive, with new partnerships and integrations expanding its use cases. The coin is gaining popularity within meme communities, and the market buzz suggests Pepe Coin’s future could be brighter than ever. With its highly engaged community, Pepe Coin is positioning itself to become a strong contender in the meme coin race, even as other coins like Shiba Inu and Arctic Pablo continue to gain momentum. Epilogue: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge As we move deeper into April 2025, it’s clear that Arctic Pablo Coin is making a bold statement in the meme coin market. While Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin remain strong contenders, Arctic Pablo’s presale excitement, ROI potential, and deflationary token burn mechanism set it apart.

42931338,https://nulltx.com/?p=147757,1743832243,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Remittix Could 100x If OKX & Binance Listings Happen & Is Now The Time To Buy Cardano Or Solana While Prices Are Down?,https://nulltx.com/remittix-could-100x-if-okx-binance-listings-happen-is-now-the-time-to-buy-cardano-or-solana-while-prices-are-down/,"With the market entering a cooling phase, investors are weighing opportunities beyond just the big names. Cardano and Solana are both trading at discounted levels, sparking debate over whether this is the dip to buy. But the real buzz surrounds Remittix , a rising star in the PayFi space that has already raised over $14.3 million. If listings on OKX or Binance materialize, analysts say a 100x surge isn’t just hype—it’s a realistic scenario taking shape fast. Cardano Price Action Stays Flat as Investors Wait for Confirmation Cardano (ADA) is feeling the weight of market fatigue, shedding 11% this past week and sliding to around $0.64. While it’s been a sluggish stretch for Cardano blockchain, some analysts like Jonathan Carter aren’t throwing in the towel just yet. His recent forecast points to a potential dip below $0.60, but he sees this as a possible setup for a rebound, with ADA eventually making a push back toward the $1 mark in the coming months. The current support zone at $0.59 is where Carter believes things could turn. If buying activity picks up around that level, it could lay the groundwork for a strong recovery rally. Still, Cardano’s price action hasn’t done much to inspire confidence lately. It’s been mostly sideways, lacking serious momentum, and the Relative Strength Index hovering around 39 suggests it’s approaching oversold territory—but not quite there yet. As of April 4, ADA trades at $0.6457 , showing mild movement between $0.65006 and $0.65054. That tight range reflects investor caution. Sentiment is muted, and any decisive move upward will require more than just speculative optimism. The fundamentals need to come into play—and that’s where many investors are shifting focus toward newer, utility-rich tokens with clearer growth paths. Solana Faces Pressure But Fibonacci Support Could Trigger Reversal The Solana price has slid to $115.12 after an 11.62% daily drop. The sharp decline comes amid global market chaos following sweeping tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump . While the broader market felt the shock, Solana’s sell-off was particularly brutal, raising fresh concerns over whether SOL can maintain its footing or if further losses are on the horizon. Still, not everyone is throwing in the towel. Veteran crypto analyst Patel notes that Solana is now resting within the 0.382 Fibonacci support zone, sitting between $100 and $115—a range that’s historically sparked strong accumulation and upside reversals. If SOL can hold this line, a gradual bounce-back could be in play. But if it dips lower, the next major support zone hovers between $50 and $72, near the 0.618 Fib level that triggered a legendary 2,100% rally in 2020. The key question now is whether buyers will step in at this zone or wait for a deeper dip. Solana’s fundamentals—scalability, DeFi traction, and consistent developer activity—haven’t disappeared. But the market wants confirmation, not speculation. Timing the entry is crucial, and some investors are exploring alternative plays with clearer upside triggers. Businesses Embrace Remittix For Instant Fiat Settlement Remittix (RTX) has caught the attention of serious investors by doing what most tokens only talk about—solving a real problem with real utility. Aimed squarely at the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, Remittix offers a fast and low-cost alternative to sluggish wire transfers and high remittance fees. With over $14.3 million raised and more than 526 million tokens sold at a presale price of just $0.0734, momentum is building fast—and it’s not hype driving it, it’s function. Imagine a remote worker in Kenya or a digital agency in Brazil receiving USDT from a European client. With Remittix, those funds can be converted to local currency and land in their bank account within hours—no bloated fees, no middlemen, no drama. That kind of utility is rare in crypto, and it’s why this PayFi project is being called one of the most grounded opportunities of 2025. The platform’s crypto-to-fiat API gives businesses the ability to accept digital payments without exposing themselves to price swings. Merchants get stability, users get speed, and the blockchain records it all with transparent accountability. As exchanges like OKX and Binance reportedly consider listings, market watchers are already tossing around 100x predictions. That might sound steep, but for a platform solving a $190T pain point, it’s not outrageous. Especially when many top altcoins are still banking on vague roadmaps and long-delayed rollouts. Analysts Say Remittix Could Outperform Cardano And Solana with 50x Gains Cardano blockchain and Solana remain valuable long-term plays, and investors are right to eye their recent dips as entry points. ADA continues to refine its architecture, while SOL brings blazing speed to DeFi and NFTs. But unlike them, Remittix is building where user demand is immediate. It’s not about what the project might deliver—Remittix is already delivering. With listings expected soon and demand surging across freelancing, global business, and remittance markets, Remittix offers a uniquely tangible use case. For those positioning for the next breakout story, this isn’t a moment to sit on the sidelines. Remittix isn’t just another token—it’s a bridge between crypto and the cash people actually use.

The coin that saw massive hype is now turning out to be a nightmare for investors and traders who rooted for the success of the project. The main issue lies in the long delays in approving “Know Your Business” (KYB) applications, which are required for projects to officially build on the Pi mainnet. This has left many developers feeling stuck, and some are now turning to other blockchains to keep things moving. PiDaoSwap Shifts to Binance Chain One of the latest examples is PiDaoSwap, a decentralized exchange that had been waiting over two weeks for KYB approval from the PiCoreTeam (PCT). Tired of waiting, the team decided to launch their NFT project on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) instead. They described the delay as “agonizing” and said they didn’t want to sit idle while waiting for approval. PiDaoSwap clarified that they still want to build on the Pi Network, but until they get the green light from the PCT, they’re choosing to move forward on BSC as a temporary step. This decision also highlights a bigger concern as Binance continues to ignore Pi Network in its “Vote to List” campaigns, instead focusing on more active BSC projects. We officially submitted the KYB application 15 working days ago, but the KYB review process has been excessively prolonged. Currently, the foundational framework of PiDaoSwap has been fully developed. We have chosen to launch community NFTs on BSC as an interim solution rather… https://t.co/EaqtjdpiQ9 — PiDaoSwap (@PidaoSwap_) April 4, 2025 Community Voices Speak Out Moreover, the PiCoreTeam is catching serious heat from well-known figures in the community. Dr Altcoin, a prominent community member, didn’t hold back. He said PiDaoSwap’s experience isn’t unique; other centralized exchanges (CEXs) are also waiting on KYB approvals. According to him, these delays are preventing Pi Coin from being listed on major platforms like Bybit. He also accused the PCT of not being transparent about important token mechanics like locking and burning, which could be further holding back listings and partnerships. Pi Coin Price Dips, But Interest Remains As a result of all this uncertainty, Pi Coin’s price has crashed another 20% in just 24 hours and slipped to $0.44, now out of the top 30 crypto rankings. Investor confidence has collapsed, with many fearing a further 60% drop to $0.10. Despite a few positive developments, the overall sentiment around Pi Coin has turned sharply bearish, and hopes for a recovery are fading fast. Hopes of seeing the token reach $1 have taken a hit. Still, the community believes things could turn around if the PiCoreTeam can speed up approvals and land a big exchange listing. Interestingly, despite the backlash, the PCT is still moving ahead with its domain auction, reporting over 200,000 bids, a sign that enthusiasm for Pi is still alive, even if tensions are rising.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 05:51:13

Analysts consider cautious optimism, as both Cardano and Ethereum have room for explosive growth. Some analysts also suggest that potential future sanctions on former President Trump may restart crypto mania, driving Ethereum’s price higher. In the background, newer altcoins like Remittix (RTX) predict even greater gains. Here, we examine Cardano’s role in these predictions and how Remittix is different. Cardano News: The Next Big Upswing? Current Cardano news suggests renewed bullishness, but skeptics point to the possibility of a fall below $0.40. Cardano’s methodical approach earns praise for its security, but impatient traders often look for faster ROI. If macro forces remain volatile, a short-term drop may happen. At $0.6457—a 3.11% increase— ADA’s market cap stands at $29.05 billion, and its daily volume remains at $839.97 million, declining 29.31%. However, Cardano news also points to ADA’s broader potential. True believers celebrate each network milestone, looking forward to real-world dApps and more DeFi adoption. If these expansions catch on, ADA can bounce back from any short-term correction. In the meantime, analysts note that some ADA holders diversify with tokens like Remittix, hedging volatile markets for a possible chance at massive profit. Ethereum Price Set to Skyrocket on Trump Sanctions? Speculation that Ethereum could blow up is fueled partly by leaked Trump sanctions that were said to spur crypto adoption. Some view the policy landscape as a low-probability catalyst for altcoin rallies, with Ethereum poised to gain as the leading DeFi platform. Should authorities introduce fresh restrictions on fiat channels, risk capital may surge into digital assets. Ethereum is currently trading at approximately $1,801.49, up by 1.61%. Although this is a modest gain, its daily trading volume is at $16.84 billion, a huge drop of 30.97%. Despite this, Ethereum maintains a robust market cap of $216.98 billion, underlining its status as a major player in the decentralized finance industry. Such a scenario would mean Ethereum price may leapfrog ahead, overtaking slower currencies. But critics argue the Trump factor is overblown. They cite that Ethereum’s real driver is a successful developer ecosystem and upcoming protocol enhancements. However, any move that brings institutional players into crypto may, in theory, drive Ethereum price ahead of typical cyclical increases. Remittix: A Leap Beyond Ordinary Hype Remittix gained popularity with its focus on real cross-border payments in the real world. Priced at $0.0734, it raised over $14.3 million and over 526 million tokens. Unlike coins based on speculation or mere brand names, Remittix seeks to capture a $190 trillion remittance market burdened by multi-day wires and excessive fees. Consider a Southeast Asian freelancer who is employed by European clients. Instead of wading through tiresome banking protocols, he or she can utilize Remittix to realize near-instant currency exchange into the local fiat. This streamlined process melds the speed of blockchain functionality with the rails of local banks, registering all transfers on a public record for tracking. Early adopters have in mind that significant partnerships would drive Remittix’s presale price exponentially higher. Security adds credibility to the project. Rigorously audited contracts and liquidity locks reduce the risk of scams, welcome to investors who are sick of hype-coins. Merchants benefit as well with Remittix’s pay API, in which they can accept crypto but, as a default, settle in fiat. This mass market appeal is in complete contrast to meme coins or non-incremental networks. If Remittix could penetrate significant remittance corridors, user growth can potentially explode, giving substantial returns to early investors. Where ADA, Ethereum, and Remittix Intersect Seasoned traders weigh Cardano news and Ethereum’s rumored boom against Remittix’s everyday usability. ADA’s gradual growth might still prove worthwhile, especially if DeFi is a hit on its chain. Ethereum, meanwhile, could take off if global political shifts funnel more capital into crypto. But Remittix speaks to real-time applications that tap an immense potential audience. A balanced strategy would be a mix: hold ADA for stable, academically oriented growth, hold some Ethereum for DeFi dominance, and trade Remittix for short-term utility. The strategy has the best of both worlds, hedging macro volatility and taking advantage of innovations that mainstream users actually need. Regardless of whether cardano news falls under $0.40, or Ethereum takes the Trump policy tide, one thing is sure: utility tokens such as those pegged on use cases like Remittix have the potential to capture attention when top coins top out. By solving a world pain point in finance, Remittix is the best choice for those looking for more than usual altcoin hype. Learn more about Remittix’s borderless revolution.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing Annual Conference , emphasized that the Fed is not yet ready to change interest rates. He noted that they are waiting for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to the policy stance and that it’s too soon to determine the right course of action for monetary policy. Tariffs To Cause More Inflation The fed noted that the economic impact of higher tariffs remains hard to predict due to ongoing uncertainties. Higher tariffs will likely cause bigger-than-expected inflation and slower growth. While the full impact is uncertain, the key is keeping long-term inflation expectations stable. Their goal is to ensure that any one-time price increases don’t evolve into persistent inflation. Trump’s tariffs hit harder than expected, sparking a global stock sell-off. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a global recession if the tariffs stay. Bitcoin (BTC) slipped back below $83,000, staying flat over the past 24 hours, despite hopes for a more dovish stance from Powell.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart was surprised by Bitcoin’s strength, noting that it stayed above $80,000 despite a sell-off in risk assets and a drop in gold.

Ramaswamy gave his sentiments on the crypto in a reply to a late Friday X post by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. “This is becoming increasingly clear,” wrote the Ohio Gubernatorial seat aspirant. Although an investor could argue that Gold currently has better returns, as the crypto market is also in a bloodbath, BTC holds more value in a long-term comparison. If an investor had allocated $1,000 equally into Bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500 five years ago, the latter would have doubled the initial investment to approximately $2,040. Gold could have yielded a slightly below 90% return, but Bitcoin has gone up 11 times in value since, bringing the same $1,000 investment to $12,210. Stock market plunges down, crypto investments go up A two-day post-Liberation Day market rout erased $6.6 trillion in shareholder value from the US stock market, according to Dow Jones data. Thursday and Friday marked the worst two-day loss in US equity market history, with $3.25 trillion of that value vanishing on Friday alone. At the same time, as reported by multiple sources, the crypto market absorbed $5.4 billion in new capital. The selloff came as a result of new tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, which rattled investors and raised fears of economic isolation. The S&P 500 fell by nearly 6% over the two-day stretch, surpassing early-term losses seen under former President George W. Bush, whose first office days had a low-point market performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 11.9% since Inauguration Day, while the S&P 500 has declined 15.4% in the same period, according to data through Friday’s close. The Russell 2000 index, focused on small-cap stocks, experienced its most turbulent start to a new administration on record, falling more than 25% from its November high and entering bear market territory. The Nasdaq Composite, which closed at an all-time high of 20,056.25 in February, has since plunged more than 22%. On the flip side, the BTC/SPX ratio, an indicator comparing Bitcoin’s performance to the S&P 500, recently completed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, typically a bullish signal in asset comparison charts. BTCUSD/SPX chart. Source: TradingView The pattern, seen in the chart above, has broken above a neckline at the 15 mark. After a standard pullback to retest the breakout point, the ratio rebounded and could lead to a renewed upward momentum for Bitcoin. It also corresponds with Bitcoin’s 2021 peak relative to the S&P 500, a zone that traders now view as the crypto’s support level. Adding to the bullish signal, the monthly chart displayed a green candle following the rebound, an indication that Bitcoin bulls have successfully defended this critical zone. Analysts noted that the demand range between 13 and 15 on the BTC/SPX ratio, marked by multiple support lines, has become a battleground now tilting in Bitcoin’s favor. “ It seems like it has found a support/range, now that it has somewhat serious hodlers backing and interest like the Institutions and U.S govt SBR ,” One market analyst on X commented . They backed the claim for two more reasons: Bitcoin faces no earnings compression and cannot be targeted by international tariffs. According to market data trackers, Bitcoin is consolidating well above $80,000, as tech stocks like Apple and Meta both shed over 2% of their valuations on Friday’s market close. Overall, BTC had the least negative price movement compared to all the Magnificent 7 tech stocks, closely followed by Microsoft. At the time of this publication, it was trading around $83,000, seeking a route past $85,000 that, if breached, could push the coin towards its 30-day high of values above $90,000.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $72 billion, recorded a 24 percent growth in its 24-hour average traded volume to about $5 billion on Saturday during the early European trading session. As the dust for the U.S. reciprocal tariffs gradually settles, it is clear that Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider altcoin market are a better hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. Moreover, Wall Street experts – led by J.P Morgan research that lowered U.S. growth estimate in 2025 by 1.6 percent – forecast a possible global recession. Solana Network Growth The Solana network has experienced explosive growth in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) led by stablecoins in the recent past. With a total value locked of about $6.6 billion at the time of this writing, the Solana network has added over $8 billion in stablecoins minted since the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump, late last year.

Ethereum Large Holders Netflow Has Turned Positive Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has talked about the trend in the Large Holders Netflow for Ethereum. This metric measures the net amount of the cryptocurrency that’s moving into or out of the wallets controlled by the Large Holders . The analytics firm defines three categories for investors: Retail, Investors, and Whales. Members of Retail hold less than 0.1% of the supply in their balance, that of Investors between 0.1% and 1%, and that of Whales more than 1%. At the current exchange rate, 0.1% of the ETH supply, the cutoff between Retail and Investors, is worth over $214 million, a very substantial amount. This means that the addresses who are able to qualify for Investors are already quite large, let alone those who have made it to the Whales. As such, the Large Holders, the actual cohort of interest in the current discussion, includes both of these groups. Thus, the Large Holders Netflow keeps track of the transactions related to Investors and Whales. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the big-money investors on the network are receiving a net number of deposits to their wallets. On the other hand, it being under the zero mark suggests these key holders are participating in net selling. Now, here is the chart shared by IntoTheBlock that shows the trend in the Ethereum Large Holders Netflow over the past week: As is visible above, the Ethereum Large Holders Netflow has remained almost entirely in the positive territory for the period of the graph, which implies that the Investors and Whales have been accumulating. On the second of the month alone, these key entities loaded up on a net 130,000 ETH (about $230 million). The net inflows for the Large Holders have come while the cryptocurrency has been declining, so it’s possible that this cohort believes the recent prices have been offering a profitable entry into the asset. It now remains to be seen whether this accumulation would be enough to help ETH attain a bottom or not. In some other news, the Ethereum fee is down to the lowest level since 2020 this quarter, as the analytics firm has pointed out in another X post . Following a sharp drop of 59.6%, the Ethereum total transaction fees is down to $208 million. According to IntoTheBlock, this trend is “primarily driven by the gas limit increase and transactions moving to L2s.” ETH Price Ethereum saw recovery above $1,900 earlier in the week, but it seems bullish momentum has already run out as the coin’s back to $1,770.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Bullish|Ethereum Bullish SIgnal|Ethereum Buying|Ethereum Large Holders|Ethereum Whales|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-05 06:30:00

Since then, the digital asset has experienced diminished bullish activity and steady downward pressure, reflected by its latest price of approximately $82,000, marking a marginal weekly drop of about 0.6%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Sentiment Worsens as Bull Score Index Drops to 10 Market Implications of Volume Ratio Trends Amid these market conditions, Crypto Dan, an analyst contributing to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, has provided insights highlighting a notable market trend. According to Dan, Bitcoin’s trading volume over six to twelve months acts as an indicator of the amount of capital entering the cryptocurrency market during specific market cycles. As highlighted in the chart shared, the metric typically undergoes two distinct phases of decline: the first signals the conclusion of the early bull cycle phase, while the second, lower drop, traditionally marks the peak and subsequent end of the cycle. The volume ratio trend outlined by Crypto Dan provides insights into investor behavior and market sentiment. Essentially, as this ratio decreases for the second time, historical patterns suggest that investor interest and speculative activity may begin to taper, potentially signaling the culmination of the ongoing bull run. Investors typically interpret such movements cautiously, as similar past events often preceded significant corrections in the market Technical Analysts View on Bitcoin Technical analysts add additional perspectives on Bitcoin’s current status. Analyst RektCapital recently pointed out significant developments in Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI)—a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and magnitude of recent price movements to assess overbought or oversold conditions. RektCapital highlighted that the Monthly RSI level of 60 previously represented resistance levels during Bitcoin’s dominance peaks in August 2019 and December 2020. #BTC Dominance The Monthly RSI 60 (green) represented the peak for Bitcoin Dominance in August 2019 & December 2020 In previous cycles, Monthly RSI 60 was the ceiling In this cycle, Monthly RSI 60 is the floor$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/G47KSa33ZR — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 4, 2025 Notably, this cycle differs, with the Monthly RSI 60 acting as a support floor rather than resistance. This change could suggest ongoing strength and potential resilience in Bitcoin’s price. Meanwhile, Javon Marks, another market analyst, emphasizes a bullish chart pattern currently forming for Bitcoin.

The black line, representing XRP’s network activity, shows a steep upward trajectory beginning in early 2025, culminating in a 490% increase. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network activity, represented by an orange line, remains relatively flat, reflecting only a 10% increase. The rapid growth in XRP’s active addresses suggests increased engagement with the XRPL. This may be attributed to various factors, including rising adoption, new use cases, or speculation in anticipation of potential market developments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reactions and Market Sentiment Derek John, an X user who commented on the post, referenced the data while acknowledging the increasing interest in XRP. He stated , “We have followed the breadcrumb trail, I got here late but better than how it will be for most. Congrats to the people that bought under 50 cents for sure tho, respect.” His comment implies that early investors in XRP, particularly those who accumulated when prices were below $0.50, are now in a strong position. The sentiment surrounding XRP has been notably positive among its supporters, with many pointing to increased on-chain activity as an indicator of long-term adoption. While the broader cryptocurrency market remains volatile, some analysts consider rising network activity a potential precursor to increased asset value. Implications of XRP’s Rising Activity The significant increase in active addresses on XRPL could suggest growing institutional or retail interest in the asset. The XRPL has been widely recognized for its efficiency in cross-border payments and decentralized finance applications. Its recent uptick in network engagement may signal expanding use cases or strategic partnerships that are yet to be fully realized. Despite maintaining its position as the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin has not exhibited the same level of network growth as XRP in this timeframe. The contrast in activity changes raises questions about the evolving utility of different blockchain networks.

This bounce suggests the market might be starting to recover from the recent downturn. If the buying pressure continues, the market could soon see a relief rally. According to analyst Egrag Crypto, XRP is currently forming an Ascending Broadening Wedge pattern, suggesting two possible price targets: a decline to $0.65 or a rise to $17. For a bullish breakout, XRP must first close above $3.50. If it reaches the $5 level but fails to sustain above it, this could signal a higher probability of the pattern playing out.

In the US stock market crash over the last two days, the Nasdaq Index has plunged over 2000 points, or 11.4% drop, the steepest fall since COVID-19 crash. Bitcoin Price Resilience Confirms Hedge to US Stock Market? This BTC resilience to the falling US equity market has got everyone discussing that the asset is now truly emerging as a hedge against the global market uncertainties. Since the Trump reciprocal tariffs kicked in on April 2 Liberation Day, Bitcoin has been the only asset in Green when compared to Gold, Silver, and Magnificent 7 stocks. Returns Since Liberation Day: BTC: +2.2% Gold: -2.9% SPY: -10.5% QQQ: -11.2% Magnificent Seven: MSFT: -5.8% GOOGL: -7.3% AMZN: -12.8% META: -13.6% NVDA: -14.6% TSLA: -15.3% AAPL: -15.9% — Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) April 4, 2025 Despite the Bitcoin price facing rejection at $89,000, it has held firmly around the support of $82,000. As of press time, BTC is trading 0.6% up at $83,669 with a market cap of $1.660 trillion, with daily trading volumes up 42% to $42.5 billion. However, investors still remains hopeful of $90K BTC breakout from here. Experts Have Mixed Opinion on BTC Bitcoin appears to be showing signs of decoupling from traditional financial markets, according to prominent Bitcoin contributor and Blockstream CEO Adam Back. In a recent post on X, Back suggested that the long-observed correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equities may have been artificially maintained. He speculated that market makers could be using Bitcoin’s liquidity conditions—particularly the shortage of fiat liquidity—to create an automatic correlation during U.S. market hours. However, Jeff Dorman, CIO of Arca institutional investment said: “Everyone is talking about BTC strength in the face of a 2-day, 10%+ stock sell-off, even as gold falls. But this has nothing to do with stocks Bitcoin is NOT, & never has been, a market hedge. It is a gov’t/bank hedge. This selloff is due to a loss of trust in global gov’t”. Where’s BTC Heading Next? Despite the strong Bitcoin price performance recently, investors still need to be watchful of the on-chain metric here. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has flagged a notable decline in Bitcoin’s exchange-related activity, suggesting a possible dip in investor sentiment and network engagement. Source: Ali Martinez Another popular analyst Kyledoops stated: “Someone for sure bidding BTC here, either it’s a mega trap and going to mark down, or when equities bounce crypto will giga send.

The ADA price is holding steady near a key support level of $0.635, keeping it in a make-or-break zone. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.657 and has recorded a modest 0.50% uptick over the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume jumped by 10%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Levels With its ongoing consolidation between $0.635 and $0.682, ADA’s price remains near the key support level of $0.635, where it has held for the past week. According to expert technical analysis, the price is expected to remain in this narrow range until it breaks out or breaks down from the consolidation. Source: Trading View Based on historical patterns, if the ADA price breaches the upper boundary of the zone and closes a daily candle above $0.69, it could soar by 20% to reach the $0.85 mark in the future. On the other hand, if ADA breaches the lower boundary of the zone, its price could crash, potentially dropping by 25% to 28% and reaching its key support at $0.45.

With concerns over trade wars escalating, the total crypto market capitalisation had fallen nearly 7% to $2.75 trillion by late Asian trading hours on Friday. In line with this, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index slipped into extreme fear territory at 28, down sharply from 44 the previous week. Trader hesitation was also evident across the altcoin market, with low trading volumes and only single-digit gains among the top 99 tokens. Why was Bitcoin down this week? Several macroeconomic catalysts kept Bitcoin muted Early in the week, sentiment took a hit as traders reacted to mounting geopolitical tension. US President Donald Trump announced a fresh round of 25% tariffs on imported cars, stoking fears of a renewed trade war. The economic backdrop further shook investor confidence. The latest PCE report showed inflation rising faster than expected, while March data from the Conference Board revealed that US consumer confidence had slumped to its lowest level in 12 years. This one-two punch of inflation and weakening sentiment pushed traders to de-risk, dragging down spot demand and futures activity. By midweek, those fears had only grown. The market was jittery ahead of the April 2 tariff rollout, which many feared would act as a bearish trigger for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Although intended to protect US manufacturing, the proposed measures risked inflaming trade tensions. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell another 3.5% after the open on tariff news, with analysts dubbing the move the start of a new “World War 3” of trade wars. Even stronger-than-expected US jobs data failed to offset the gloom, as investors remained focused on the deteriorating macro environment. Still, market bets on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut continued to climb, with expectations inching higher despite the mixed signals. When writing, the CME Fed watch tool showed chances of a May rate cut at 41.3%. Will Bitcoin crash again? The current scenario around Bitcoin remains largely bearish. Market analyst Sergei Gorev, head of risk at bitcoin and crypto platform YouHodler, warned that a break below March’s low of $77,186 could open the door to what one described as a “crisis scenario” heading into 2025. The outlook for equities and crypto alike has darkened in the wake of escalating trade tensions, with sentiment weakening across the board. Yet, Bitcoin has continued to trade within a relatively tight range between $80,000 and $90,000. According to XBTO’s Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, this range could act as a trigger zone, with any decisive breakout potentially fuelling a larger move in either direction. “With attention turning to how these reciprocal tariffs will be enforced in the coming weeks, investors should closely monitor key macroeconomic indicators and prudently manage position sizes, particularly by restricting leverage,” Rodriguez added. Nevertheless, some remained optimistic and suggested that the benchmark cryptocurrency may have bottomed and an upward rally may be looming. One such signal came from market analyst Cas Abbé, who pointed to a potential falling wedge pattern forming on Bitcoin’s daily chart. He noted that BTC didn’t print a new low even as traditional markets suffered their worst session in five years, which could suggest relative strength. Abbé added that Bitcoin often bottoms before the broader market, speculating that the $76,500 level may have marked the cycle low. For further upside confirmation, he advised watching for a breakout and reclaim above the $86,500 mark. Crypto commentator Lana Queen chimed in with a similar sentiment, noting that Bitcoin’s outperforming traditional markets was “bullish.” See below.

Source: Rekt Capital Another technical setup was highlighted by fellow trader Merlijin The Trader. In an April 4 X post, he pointed out that Bitcoin had just completed what he called the “perfect AMD setup,” a bullish pattern that follows a cycle of accumulation, manipulation, and finally distribution. According to Merlijin, Bitcoin appears to have already passed through the manipulation phase and is now entering distribution. If the pattern plays out, it could signal the beginning of a major upward continuation, with the next leg targeting price levels above $100,000. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering above $83,000, down 1.3% over the past 7 days. Altcoin markets cool off Most high-cap altcoins gave up the gains accrued over the previous week. However, the total market capitalisation dipped only slightly, holding near the $1.1 trillion mark seen last week. The Altcoin Season Index dropped by four points from the previous week, firmly confirming “Bitcoin Season.” The top gainers were as follows: EOS EOS (EOS) rallied 40% over the past week to $0.8161 as of press time, while its market cap rebounded to over $1.27 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap Its price gains came with an increase in its trading volume from $200 million to nearly $1 billion yesterday before settling at $489 million. The EOS rally builds on its recent rebrand to Vaulta as it shifts gears toward building a blockchain-powered banking system. The EOS team also introduced four main “pillars” of Vaulta’s Web3 banking setup this week, which include wealth management, consumer payments, portfolio investment, and insurance. These will be backed by partners like CEFFU, SPIRIT Blockchain, and Blockchain Insurance Inc., each bringing real-world use cases to the Vaulta network. Pendle Over the last 7 days, Pendle (PENDLE) rose 14.5%, exchanging hands at $3.07 when writing. Source: CoinMarketCap Its market cap was seated at $495.72 million, while its daily trading volume was still hovering over $129 million after falling from its weekly peak of nearly $190 million. Pendle gains this week were accompanied by a sharp rise in open interest on Binance. The bullish bets from investors were largely driven by Binance whales who have recently begun accumulating PENDLE following its recent listing on Coinbase and expansion to Berachain. The project has also announced plans to expand to Sonic. These developments have pushed Pendle to exhibit some of the highest positive funding rates among DeFi-related tokens. Positive funding means that traders holding long positions are paying those with short positions, which typically reflects a bullish market sentiment. Zcash Zcash (ZEC) was up 12% over the past 7 days, priced at $40.49 at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap Its market cap was standing at over $643.3 million, with a daily trading volume of $73.58 million. Zcash saw most of its recent gains after breaking above the descending trendline that started forming after its December highs, with the altcoin moving past the $35 resistance level and ending the downtrend. Zcash’s price also got a boost after Brave Wallet added support for shielded transactions in a recent desktop update, letting users buy, send, and receive the privacy-focused crypto right in the browser. The feature will be expanded to Android and iOS soon.

Speculators have already started talking of an “XRP 2.0” scenario in which the token can relaunch itself once legal clarity is achieved. TRON (TRX), on the other hand, is fighting to restore confidence after reaching the heights of approximately $0.245, with pundits arguing if further downward movement is likely. Against this backdrop, Remittix—a relatively new DeFi entrant—has created a stir by shattering presale records. Below, we break down the latest on XRP, TRON, and Remittix’s meteoric ascent. XRP: Legal Wrangles and a Futures Boost April 3 saw XRP hold a 1.96% gain, recovering from a 5.42% decline on the previous day. Hope arrived in the shape of an unsolicited filing from Justin W. Keener, in which he asserted possession of “game-changing” information in Ripple’s SEC litigation. Caution, nevertheless, is not in short supply, with Keener boasting a record of unregistered penny stock activity and no apparent credible connection to Ripple’s lawyers. Chart 1, Analyzed by Alokkp0608, published on April 4th, 2025 The actual turning point is if the SEC is going to do anything about recent news. Traders were hoping for guidance after an April 3 closed-door SEC meeting, but nothing was announced. In the meantime, Coinbase Derivatives is listing XRP futures on April 21, which may bring additional liquidity to the token. Most see this as a move towards “XRP 2.0,” with the implication of a future where robust derivatives markets are the source of both liquidity and stability. Still, the near-term destiny of the coin hangs on whether or not any new announcements shift the suit in Ripple’s favor. If the SEC appeals previous rulings or forever holds its silence, doubt might squeeze buying pressure. Conservative holders now eye $2.50 as an absolute floor and chartists indicate $2.84 for another resistance test. TRON: Rebound or Further Downside? TRON (TRX) is still torn between bull and bear possibilities. A falling channel terminated at $0.20 in February, which initiated a bounce that reached $0.245—the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That point has relentlessly rejected TRX’s attempts at recovery, with a strong resistance above. TRX Price Chart Analysis Technical indicators are mixed. The RSI has broken a hidden bullish divergence, and a support trendline has been rising since the February low. However, the price has yet to break convincingly above the 0.618 Fib zone, and some analysts are cautious that a final Y wave down will develop if bullish momentum is not imminent. TRX’s mid-term trajectory may be beholden to the general market sentiment, especially if there is unfavorable news about platform development or ecosystem expansion. Presently, TRX holders await further definitive signals to see if the token can retrace to higher grounds or falls back to its recent lows at about $0.20. Remittix: The Surging Altcoin Breaking Records As XRP grapples with legal turns and TRX probes key Fibonacci levels, Remittix has taken the limelight by taking over the DeFi narrative. It’s a novel cross-border payment network that enables users to exchange more than 40 cryptocurrencies for fiat and transfer money to bank accounts worldwide, minus the typical hidden fees. This real-world use case is appealing to investors tired of sluggish bank wires and complicated bridging services. Having sold over 526 million tokens and raised $14.3 million, Remittix’s presale soared in a flight exceeding expectations. Early holders, who had bought at just $0.0734, witnessed over 1000% gains, even when the larger crypto markets appeared uncertain. Analysts peg momentum to continue through March, with a potential 200% rally in the near term. Why the hype? Remittix solves a real pain point by combining domestic payment rails with blockchain efficiency, reducing the time for transactions to hours or minutes from days. Merchants can access the Remittix pay API, accepting crypto from consumers but settling in fiat. The platform also has a strong security layer—public ledgers that record each transaction, reducing fraud risks. These attributes have placed Remittix on the radar screens of industry observers, who attribute its simplicity and ease of use. Who Stands Poised for 2025 Glory? XRP’s modest gain and mention of “XRP 2.0” highlight the token’s potential should Ripple win its case against the SEC. Most are hopeful derivatives listings on major exchanges will be the foundation for long-term stability. Meanwhile, TRX clings to the hope its bullish divergences are followed by long-term upside, but skepticism lingers. In hindsight from the mid-2025 vantage point, crypto success follows actual utility, community trust, and tireless development. XRP might surge once more if the legal overhang is removed. TRX might still confirm a bull breakout. But Remittix, by solving a $190 trillion cross-border remittance puzzle, might offer the more direct path to mainstream adoption—and the sort of consistent growth that truly defines the next big thing in crypto.

In a new post, Tapiero tells his 127,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may outperform equities as US President Donald Trump’s announced tariffs have ignited a massive stock sell-off. “‘Moment of realization’ for BTC. Tariffs crushing analog markets and fears rampant with VIX (Volatility Index) at 40. Authorities and co. sitting by watching NDX (Nasdaq-100 Index) in free fall. Rates will adjust lower but it is a process. Chart below is BTC/SPX. About to explode up.” Source: Dan Tapiero/X Tapiero suggests that Bitcoin’s performance may be decoupling from traditional finance, which is reeling from Trump’s tariffs. “Tariffs represent battle ongoing in the old analog world. In an attempt to solve old problems: excess govt spending, FX (foreign exchange) manipulation, weak growth, geopolitics, etc. So much manipulation and interference. Can it be fixed? Bitcoin stands outside this world. Free of legacy burdens.” Lastly, he says that Trump’s massive increase in US tariffs may slow economic growth and create market uncertainty. However, he says that gold and Bitcoin may work as a hedge against recessionary pressures. “Unfortunately, this chart means lower growth in the US and uncertainty to remain high for now. Interest rates are definitely coming down a lot now. Gold and Bitcoin as havens.” Source: Dan Tapiero/X Bitcoin is trading for $83,805 at time of writing, up 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

VET emphasized that for RLUSD adoption to increase, users must engage more with the XRPL. The statement highlighted the importance of both retail and institutional users in driving the ecosystem forward by utilizing the ledger’s capabilities and providing feedback to builders. VET’s post underlined a fundamental aspect of blockchain ecosystems: growth is driven by usage. The validator pointed out that relying on others to increase adoption while remaining inactive is not sustainable. Instead, users should communicate their needs to developers, support new applications, and continuously engage with the network. Honestly folks, if we want more $RLUSD on the XRP Ledger then we have to use the XRPL more. Tell builders what you want, let them build it, use it – repeat. Ecosystems need retail and institutional to bootstrap. Can't expect others to use the XRPL if you don’t use it yourself. — Vet (@Vet_X0) April 2, 2025 Addressing Smart Contract Deployment on XRPL In response to VET’s remarks, an X user, DOQ, inquired about the best approach for developing smart contracts related to the XRPL. The user asked whether developers should wait for the XRPL to implement native smart contract functionality or proceed with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain. VET acknowledged the complexity of the situation, noting that deciding where to allocate development resources is difficult given the evolving nature of the XRPL. The validator stated that if compliance requirements allow a given use case to operate within the XRPL while handling automated logic off-chain in a centralized manner, then utilizing the XRPL directly would be a viable option. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, VET also pointed out that there are no guarantees when full smart contract functionality will be integrated natively into the ledger. Due to this uncertainty, using the EVM sidechain remains a legitimate alternative for those looking to build applications in the near term. Implications for the XRPL Ecosystem VET’s comments reflect broader discussions within the XRPL community about network adoption and developer engagement. The remarks reinforce that an ecosystem thrives when participants actively use its infrastructure rather than wait for external factors to drive adoption. Furthermore, the conversation regarding smart contract deployment highlights the strategic decisions that developers must make when working within the XRPL environment. As the XRPL continues to evolve, the timing and execution of new functionalities will influence how builders approach development.

Trading activity picked up, with total volume rising 10.35% to reach $98.18 billion. Despite the recovery, the Fear & Greed Index dropped to 27, placing the market in the “Fear” zone. Fed Chair Powell Flags Economic Concerns In a policy statement, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed the economic impact of tariffs proposed by Donald Trump. Powell warned that these tariffs could lead to increased inflation and unemployment, along with slowing overall economic growth. He emphasized that it’s still “too soon” to consider altering U.S. monetary policy. This hints that interest rate cuts are not on the horizon just yet, as the Fed maintains its stance to steer inflation back to its 2% target. The current benchmark interest rate remains between 4.25% and 4.50%. Bitcoin Grips $83k, Altcoins Show Mixed Signals Bitcoin continues to exhibit strength, hovering above the $83,000 mark and contributing to a market dominance of over 60%.

Automation | Opinion,https://crypto.news/the-secret-to-a-high-performing-portfolio-automation/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. People engage in “risky” situations almost daily. For some, a risk could be only giving yourself two hours at the airport instead of the instructed three hours before departure time. For others, risk could be associated with a physical threat like skydiving. You might also like: Overlooked crypto trends that could define 2025 | Opinion While these examples highlight personal risks, financial risks operate on a completely separate scale, impacting entire markets and economies. Risk has been closely associated with the crypto market as volatility remains one of its most defining characteristics. Crypto’s volatility means that while its surges can be dramatic, the downturns are often even steeper. Take, for example, this Bitcoin ( BTC ) price chart, which outlines its intense peaks and dips in just 24 hours. A single remark or action by an influential person can trigger an instantaneous response in the current digital landscape, which can eventually affect the entire market. Since Trump’s re-election in November, while many markets have been sensitive to his actions and statements, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in particular, have faced increased volatility. A post on X or his policy stance has been enough to spark a sharp rise or fall in prices. The power of such moments was evident last week when Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price fell significantly following a comment from Eric Trump , son of the US President. He told his followers on X that it was an excellent time to add Ethereum to their portfolios, a remark that caused the cryptocurrency’s value to drop nearly instantly. Some say that the tweet was fueled by his ties to World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto venture inspired by Trump that holds Ethereum assets. The market’s overall skepticism and often volatile influences have made it difficult for investors to maneuver, particularly for those new to the game. New traders are typically filled with excitement during a bull run, only to see the price drop, and then face the panic of potential and often immediate losses. Historically, traders depended on their intuition and previous patterns to forecast price shifts. However, traders now have access to tools that use algorithms to understand market conditions and trends, allowing them to execute data-driven decisions. This shift has been seen in traditional finance, where “ robo-advisors ” have surfaced as automated services that use analytics and algorithms to provide personalized wealth management advice. As a result, manual portfolio oversight is no longer an absolute necessity, and in crypto, bots can now execute trades on behalf of users. While investors set specific parameters, the algorithm acts accordingly, even in the absence of the user, ensuring that no trade is missed. Several automated trading platforms exist, each providing tools to streamline the trading process. Intellectia.ai, for example, uses AI to analyze market data and make predictions, optimizing trading strategies based on market conditions. It can summarize large amounts of data according to market trends, financial reports, and news articles and turn those into actionable insights. While it’s a powerful tool, its advanced features could appear overwhelming for beginners, especially for those who are not as familiar with AI-trading strategies. 3Commas is another trading platform that uses always-on automated bots to execute trades based on pre-determined strategies, facilitating more favorable outcomes for investors. It provides a variety of trading bots, from DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) to GRID trading bots, all of which can be altered for newcomers and experienced traders. However, compared to other platforms, 3Commas is suited for more professional traders with prior knowledge of the market, offering advanced features designed for those interested in crypto. While oversight is helpful in many situations, allowing algorithms and machine learning technologies to take the lead in trading has become a promising advantage for investors. By reducing human error and emotion-driven decisions, automated trading allows for more consistent and positive outcomes, making it a valuable and indispensable tool in the risky world of crypto.

With millions of tokens at stake, the investors are eyeing this permissionless interoperability protocol TGE plus airdrop, especially as the crypto market’s downtrend continues. Hyperlane Airdrop Listing Details & Tokenomics The Hyperlane airdrop is one of the biggest crypto airdrops for April and is all set for the token launch on April 22, just two weeks from today. The team has allocated 57% of its total supply (1 billion tokens) for the community user, 25% with a 12-month lock period for the core team, 10.9% with a similar 12-month lock for investors, 7.1% for the foundation treasury, and much more. This HYPER token distribution could affect its price significantly. Interestingly, out of the community allocation, 7.5% of the total HYPER supply is allocated to the airdrop, whose registration is live. Interested investors can participate in this event from April 3 to April 14, 2025 (3:59 AM UTC), and the claims will be made between April 20 and May 6, 2025 (3:59 AM UTC). Hyperlane Airdrop Eligibility Criteria & Process According to the official HYPER airdrop announcement, users who are in the top 37% of fee-spending users and are the most active users of the platform are eligible for HYPER tokens. In addition, the developers who have deployed contracts and applications with at least $5.00 USD notional in fees using apps are eligible. Although the HYPER airdrop is available globally, there are restrictions on regions like Cuba, Iraq, Russia, North Korea, and many other countries, but it is available in America. The eligibility checking process is as follows: Head to Eligibility checker claim.hyperlane.foundation Click on “Enter Address” and put EVM or SVM wallet inputs Eligibility outcome will appear on screen If eligible, investors must hit “Save Registration” or “Register Now” to lock in their upcoming claims. What Will be HYPER Token Price at Launch? The HYPER token price is unknown as the TGE and the Hyperlane airdrop is days away. Based on previous token launches and the tokenomics detail, the crypto community anticipates a price between $0.50 to $2 while considering the fully diluted valuation and circulating supply. However, this is just an anticipation and may differ depending on various parameters like top crypto exchange listing, airdrop claims, investors’ demand, and much more. Now, the eyes are on the TGE and airdrop for millions of token distributions.

The guidance introduces the term “covered stablecoins,” defining a specific category deemed not to be securities under federal law. Defining ‘Covered Stablecoins’ & Legal Implications According to the SEC staff guidance, “covered stablecoins” meet three criteria: they maintain a one-to-one value with the U.S. dollar, are redeemable for USD on demand at par, and are backed by low-risk, highly liquid assets. Crucially, the guidance determines that these specific stablecoins do not qualify as securities.

While no one knows who Nakamoto truly is, the date is taken from his old P2P Foundation profile and has become a symbolic day in crypto history. Despite several people claiming to be Satoshi, no one knows if he is still alive or dead. Satoshi Nakoto the infamous creator of Bitcoin. Not much is known about him.. But he listed his birthday as April 5th on his P2P foundation profile It is the only personal information we have about him Tomorrow makes it his 50th birthday… pic.twitter.com/mQvbo2Dx5C — Yugi (@yugicrypt_oh) April 4, 2025 Interestingly, April 5 wasn’t chosen randomly. It’s the same date the U.S. government banned private gold ownership back in 1933 an act that many believe inspired Bitcoin’s design as a decentralized alternative to state-controlled money. And in a quirky twist, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks an inversion of the number 6102 from that 1933 order. Despite Bitcoin’s massive success, Nakamoto’s fortune, believed to be around 1.096 million BTC, has never been touched. That stash is now worth over $91 billion, and it’s just been sitting there since 2010. Occasionally, people still send small amounts of BTC to those addresses, either as a tribute or to cloud the trail, but there’s been no movement from the original owner. A Fortune Untouched and a Mystery Unsolved Over the years, many have tried to uncover who Nakamoto really is. In 2024, a UK court dismissed claims by Australian Craig Wright, calling his case “deliberately false.” A few months later, an HBO documentary raised eyebrows by suggesting Canadian developer Peter Todd—who quickly denied it. Some even tossed Jack Dorsey’s name into the mix, though there’s no real evidence behind that. Bitcoin’s journey began with a powerful message buried in its very first block: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” a newspaper headline from the 2009 financial crisis. That message set the tone for what Bitcoin stood for: financial freedom and independence from traditional banking systems. Today, Bitcoin stands tall with a $1.6 trillion market cap and a rock-solid network still running on Nakamoto’s original framework. While the person behind it remains a mystery, the technology he (or they) left behind continues to shape the future of finance.

The more CATZILLA someone scoops up during the presale, the more points they rack up. It’s simple math, massive potential: Spend $400 and Earn 2,800 Meow Points (That’s $400 x 7% x 100) The higher Meow Points, the bigger the future airdrop reward. It’s like XP in a video game — except this time, it’s leveling up a wallet. Why Catzilla isn’t just another memecoin Catzilla isn’t here to blend in; it’s here to obliterate the old system. With an army of crypto warriors, anime diehards, DeFi degenerates, and meme fanatics behind it, this cat is uniting cultures, smashing expectations, and rewriting what a meme coin can be. The art? Iconic. The growth? Explosive. The energy? Unstoppable. PNUT: A playful crypto token on the solana blockchain PNUT is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency token on the Solana blockchain. The token appeals to meme enthusiasts and the broader crypto community with its fun approach. There is a total supply of 100 million PNUT tokens. The token features zero transaction taxes and has a revoked contract and a burnt liquidity pool. These elements aim to provide security for holders’ assets. The token’s mascot is Pnut, a playful squirrel character. This character captures the lighthearted and community-driven spirit of the project. Users interested in acquiring PNUT can do so on platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. While PNUT presents itself as a secure and fun option, its attractiveness in the current market cycle would depend on the broader trends in meme cryptocurrencies and community interest. Conclusion Although PNUT and similar coins have limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a memecoin aiming to deliver financial freedom. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it offers triple utility: governance, participation rewards, and staking for passive growth. Acquiring CATZILLA tokens lets individuals join the battle against crypto villains. For more information on Catzilla, visit the website , Twitter , or Telegram Chat .

This mixed forecast comes as Bitcoin and most altcoins teeter from macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the ongoing trade war between China and the US. Wedge Pattern Places XRP Price At a Crossroads According to analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP price had formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. However, the direction of the wedge breakout remains uncertain. In his analysis, EGRAG noted that for a solid bullish breakout from this wedge pattern, XRP needed to close above the $3.50 price level. Doing so would kickstart the surge towards the $5 range, where it will likely face rejection. If Ripple price eyes gains and makes a decisive close above $5, it could spark a rally to double digits within weeks. Per the analysis, this altcoin will post a 700%l surge to 417. However, despite this bullish thesis, headwinds still lie ahead. Analyst EGRAG noted there was only a 30% chance for this breakout to occur. Meanwhile, there is a 70% chance that XRP might make a bearish breakout from this pattern, which will fuel a 70% crash to $0.65. XRP Price Chart This mixed XRP price prediction shows that XRP is at a crossroads with no clear direction for a breakout. However, if there is a bullish catalyst like a spot ETF filing by BlackRock and the US Treasury mentioning XRP as part of a digital asset stockpile, it will support the upward momentum to $17. XRP Short Liquidations Hit 2-Week High XRP price trades at $2.13 with a slight 3.3% gain in 24 hours. These gains have triggered a surge in short liquidations. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, XRP short liquidations have surged to $7.3M, which is the highest in more than two weeks. When short sellers are liquidated, their positions are closed by buying the asset. Therefore, these short liquidations are behind the gains in Ripple price and could accelerate the uptrend, which will push the altcoin higher. These liquidations have also caused a shift in funding rates. In the last two days, XRP funding rates have been deeply negative, indicating that traders opened short positions after the price approached the critical support level of $2. However, after the recent gains, these traders are now going long on XRP, showing optimism towards a price recovery. XRP Funding Rate To sum up, XRP price seems to be at a pivotal point. A spike in buying pressure and Ripple whale activity might push Ripple toward $17. However, failure to hold levels above $2 might cause a crash to $0.65.

Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, outlined this ‘off-frontier’ strategy during the company’s 50th-anniversary event. This approach emphasizes developing AI solutions that are slightly behind the cutting edge but more cost-effective and tailored to specific uses. ​ Unlike firms competing to create the world’s most powerful models, Microsoft intentionally pulls back from the cutting edge. Instead of immediately building the most advanced systems, it takes three to six months to do anything after the latest models are released. “After you’ve let the frontier go first for the first three months , th e first six months, it’s cheaper to give a specific answer then,” Suleyman said in an interview. “We call that off-frontier.” T his strategy enables the tech firm to sidestep the vast expense of being a first mover while at the same time establishing powerful, useful AI systems. It also allows the company to concentrate on creating artificial intelligence tools that the world needs rather than trying to ride the hype wave. Suleyman said they had never attempted to win any leaderboard; instead, they focused on solving real people’s real problems. Microsoft is adding personalized features to empower Copilot Copilot (Microsoft’s AI assistant for Windows, Office, and other apps) is one of the best examples of the practical AI vision the firm tries to achieve. At its anniversary event, Microsoft revealed that it will soon be adding “memory” to Copilot, allowing it to retain key details about users as time goes on. That means the assistant can provide more intelligent, customized assistance — like remembering the names of people you frequently email, how you usually format documents in Word, or which tasks you do most often in Excel. Those features were originally introduced in OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Microsoft deeply embeds. Now, comparable powers are coming to the firm’s products. OpenAI released the “o1” model in September — a system focused on reasoning that takes longer to create considered answers. Then, a few weeks later, Microsoft announced “Think Deeper,” a similar capability for Copilot. Instead of racing to b e fi rst, the company is repackaging ideas that work in ways that match its ecosystem. Copilot’s improvements prove the tech company is interested in usability rather than Flash . This is about tools that work and feel like magic — AI that helps people do their work better. Microsoft balances partnerships with in-house development Microsoft’s close relationship with OpenAI has spurred its speedy advancement in AI in the past two years. The firm has poured over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2023, embedded its models in Bing, Word, Teams, and Windows, and powered everything from generative tools like image generation to AI-powered search. But that relationship is beginning to change. Microsoft targeted OpenAI in July 2024, just a few months after it targeted Google. In January 2025, OpenAI struck a significant deal with Oracle to help power the $500 billion Stargate AI project — a deal that raised the possibility that the startup was seeking partners beyond Microsoft’s Azure cloud. Still, Suleyman said the partnership with OpenAI remained strong, stating that they had been deeply partnered with the company until at least 2030 and that OpenAI had enjoyed an enormously successful relationship with Microsoft. It’s worth noting that the company is not resting on its laurels; it is now leaning into developing its proprietary AI capabilities, too. Suleyman added that it is mission-critical for the company to develop its own long-term AI. He said that Microsoft had “thousands” of Nvidia GPUs, critical hardware for AI training, and is also developing a separate class of smaller and open-source models that can run on machines without cloud access. These models avoid being expensive and resource-intensive, and they can be a nice option for businesses that don’t need to own and operate AI at a massive scale but do want powerful tools.

Pepe faces declines but eyes potential rebound Pepe (PEPE) has been volatile, trading between $0.000006054 and $0.000008528. This past week, the price dropped by 15.64%, marking a significant short-term decline. Over the month, the change is slight at -0.32%, indicating some stability. However, the six-month decrease of 23.42% highlights a prolonged downtrend. Despite recent drops, PEPE has potential to recover. The RSI is at 43.52 — below neutral but not oversold — suggesting room for upward movement if buying pressure increases. The nearest support level is $0.000005176. A fall to this point could mean a decline of about 14-20%. The nearest resistance is at $0.000010126. Climbing to this level could yield gains of 20-60% from current prices. Given the data, PEPE may continue to face pressure. Yet, proximity to support could prompt a bounce. Breaking above resistance could lead to significant gains. Market sentiment and buying activity will be key factors. Conclusion Though coins like PEPE have soared in the past, their short-term potential seems limited.

Amid its current performance, an analyst has warned investors the cryptocurrency risks dropping to 17-month lows if it fails to reclaim key resistance levels. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Ready For A Breakout? Analysts Eye 20% Rally If This Level Is Reclaimed Ethereum Could See Drop To $1,550 Ethereum has been trading below a key support zone for the past two days, hovering between $1,750-$1,840 after failing to recover the $1,900 mark on Wednesday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost its 15-month range in early March, dropping below $2,100 for the first time since December 2023. Since losing this level, ETH has seen its worst performance in seven years, recording a negative monthly close for the fourth consecutive month. Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that this performance validated Ethereum’s double top formation that developed within its $2,196-$3,904 Macro Range. After breaking down from this range, Ethereum trades within a historical liquidity pool, between the $1,640-$1,930 range, and “effectively has positioned itself for a bearish retest” of the range’s top with its monthly close within this area, which could turn this level into a new resistance. As the analyst explains, turning this level into resistance has historically seen ETH’s price drop to the current range’s lower zone. “In other words, turning the red level into resistance (red circle) has historically preceded a drop into the support at the bottom of the light blue historical demand area (orange circle),” he detailed. As such, Ethereum must reclaim the top of this demand area “to challenge a move to the old Macro Range Low of $2,196.” Meanwhile, a rejection from the $1,930 mark, which it has been unable to reclaim over the past week, would see ETH risk a 15% drop to the $1,550 area. Is A 20% Rally Coming? Rekt Capital also pointed out that since June 2023, ETH’s Dominance has dropped from 20% to 8%, historically a reverse area for the cryptocurrency. When Ethereum’s Dominance touched the $7.5%-8.25% range, it reversed “to become more market-dominant,” which could signal a reversal for the King of Altcoins. Several analysts consider that the key levels to watch are the $1,750 support and the $2,100 resistance, as a break above or below these levels will determine ETH’s next significant move. Related Reading: Solana Slammed By Whale Dump—Can It Recover Or Is More Pain Ahead? Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that Ethereum could eye a 20% rally based on a Power of 3 setup in ETH’s lower timeframe chart. The analyst highlighted that the cryptocurrency had an accumulation phase after dropping below the $2,150 support, hovering within the $1,840 and $2,100 levels since March 10. After dipping below the $1,840 mark, the cryptocurrency has been in the manipulation phase, the chart shows, which could trigger a push to the $2,150 resistance if ETH breaks out and starts the distribution phase. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,808, a 2.2% surge in the daily timeframe.

On Friday, China retaliated against the U.S. tariffs, thus further weakening major stock indexes led by the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq composite. However, Bitcoin price teased $84k, as its 24-hour average trading volume surged over 22 percent to hover at about $42 billion on Saturday, during the mid-London session. Recession Looms The ongoing global trade war is expected to significantly disrupt international supply chains. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it expects the U.S. economy to fall into a recession this year. “We now expect real GDP to contract under the weight of the tariffs, and for the full year we now look for real GDP growth of -0.3 percent, down from 1.3 percent previously,” Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan noted. Bitcoin Whales on the Hunt Bitcoin has been identified as a hedge against ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Moreover, gold was exempted from the ongoing tariffs, and BTC is widely regarded as the modern digital gold. Consequently, long-term whale investors have accelerated their BTC accumulation in anticipation of a bullish breakout ahead. According to on-chain data analysis by Intotheblock, the volume of large transactions has increased by $136 billion in the past seven days. Meanwhile, the overall supply of BTC on centralized exchanges has declined from 2.22 million on March 18 to around 2.19 million on April 5. What Next? From a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin price has approached the apex of a multi-week correction and consolidation. According to Matthew Dixon, a veteran financial trader, the BTC price is on the cusp of a major capitulation towards $70k. #BTC has been nothing short of resilient in the face the tariff induced, 3rd biggest points drop in history for the #DowJones BUT don't be complacent as -ve risk is real, with the likelihood of a 3rd wave of 3rd wave down for $BTC next week possibly targeting low $BTC 70k area. pic.twitter.com/5RGtLYzvLQ — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) April 5, 2025 However, the BTC price has established a robust support level of around $80.5k, which could form a basis for the next rally towards $85.5k and $92k soon.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-05 08:02:26

And if early 2025 signals are to be believed, that pattern may already be unfolding. This time, while meme coin staples like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin dominate headlines, many sharp-eyed traders are turning to a different candidate— Dragoin ($DDGN) . Quietly gaining ground, this Game of Thrones-inspired token is entering the spotlight with not just narrative hype, but utility, structure, and early-stage potential few others can match. With deflationary tokenomics, engaging play-to-earn mechanics, and a presale price designed for maximum upside, Dragoin is shaping up to be more than just a meme coin—it’s emerging as a well-positioned crypto with kingmaker potential. Meme Coins Heating Up—And Dragoin Is Leading the Fresh Wave Bitcoin is holding its ground above $83,000, and altcoin activity is surging. In past cycles, this combination has signaled the start of explosive meme coin momentum. Traders often rotate profits from majors like BTC and ETH into higher-risk, high-reward tokens—creating rapid pumps across meme markets. This month alone, the meme coin market cap jumped 16%, with DOGE and SHIB making notable moves. But while legacy tokens still draw attention, Dragoin stands out with a new storyline, community traction, and genuine use case—something that’s been missing in many meme coins that rely solely on social media waves. Crypto influencers, Telegram analysts, and meme veterans are already buzzing. Dragoin is gaining momentum early—and momentum matters. Dragoin’s Play-to-Earn Game Is a Real Differentiator Where most meme coins run on speculation and meme energy alone, Dragoin introduces something tangible: a fully integrated play-to-earn (P2E) gaming model that rewards engagement with real token rewards. Centered around a Telegram-based dragon training and battle game, players hatch, evolve, and compete with dragons, earning $DDGN tokens as they interact. This is more than novelty—it’s utility built into the token economy. Rather than hoping for external hype to generate demand, Dragoin is generating demand organically. The more users play, the more they earn, and the more demand grows—fueling activity without the need for constant social buzz. It’s a mechanism that could bring gamers, traders, and first-time meme coin buyers together inside one ecosystem—something previous cycles lacked. Deflationary Supply + Presale Advantage = 100x Potential Dragoin’s tokenomics have been carefully engineered to favor scarcity and reward early entry. The token has a hard-capped supply of 200 billion, with half available during a 25-stage presale. Each stage comes with a slightly higher price point—ensuring those who get in early enjoy the most favorable returns. At the time of writing, Dragoin’s presale is in Stage 1, priced at just $0.0000292. Its confirmed launch price? $0.002. That’s a potential 100x upside for initial backers. But Dragoin adds another clever layer: any unsold tokens from each presale stage are automatically burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity as the token progresses toward launch. Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu succeeded without this kind of built-in scarcity. Dragoin, by comparison, is starting with deflationary mechanics hard-coded into its foundation. Community Ownership Through Full Decentralization One of the strongest features of Dragoin is its commitment to transparency. After the presale, ownership of the smart contract will be renounced, making it fully decentralized—an important safeguard in a market often rocked by developer-controlled exploits. That means no dev wallets, no insider control, and no backdoor minting risks—a rarity in the meme coin world. Combined with upcoming staking rewards, airdrop campaigns, and a detailed roadmap that includes CEX listings and influencer marketing, Dragoin is setting up for long-term credibility and mainstream attention. In a time when trust is often the missing piece, Dragoin is aiming to restore it. Could Dragoin Be 2025’s Meme Coin Giant? Dragoin checks all the boxes that made past meme coins explode—but adds the structure that many of those tokens lacked. It offers: A live, playable P2E mini-game Deflationary tokenomics with presale burns Transparent, decentralized launch An early-stage price of just $0.0000292 A realistic path to 100x gains As meme coins rise again in 2025, the market will ask: “Which project combines hype with real value?” Dragoin looks ready to answer that call. With early interest accelerating, an engaged community forming, and a unique game already in development, Dragoin isn’t just riding a trend—it’s building its own.

The tariffs, aimed at fixing trade imbalances, targets countries with major trade deficits with the US, including India, and with plans for more hikes. On Friday it forecasted a full-year contraction in gross domestic product for 2025. JPMorgan’s chief U.S. economist, Michael Feroli, warned that America’s economy is likely to shrink under the pressure of new tariffs, with unemployment expected to rise to 5.3%. Fed’s Cautious Approach Besides, Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed similar concerns, saying that the new tariffs could hit the economy harder than expected. He warned that larger tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth. J.P. Morgan predicts inflation will jump to 4.4% by year-end, up from 2.8% in February. They expect the Fed to start cutting rates in June, with more cuts until January 2026, bringing rates down to 2.75%-3%. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there’s no rush, hinting at a cautious approach despite the economic pressures. China’s Move Triggers Ripple Effects The global outlook is now under pressure as the U.S. trade war’s ripple effects grow. China has already responded by imposing a 34% tax on U.S. goods. Other countries are either threatening retaliation or preparing for tough talks. China’s move triggered a market meltdown. Trump’s tariff war has wiped out over $5 trillion from the U.S. stock market. J.P. Morgan isn’t the only one cutting forecasts—Barclays predicts a downturn next year, Citi expects growth of just 0.1%, and UBS has lowered its estimate to 0.4%. Canadian PM Mark Carney said the U.S. has stepped away from its role as a global economic leader. “The world economy is different today than it was yesterday,” he said while unveiling new countermeasures. Impact on Crypto Markets The crypto market plunged after Trump’s tariff announcement, with investors fleeing to safe havens like gold. Bitcoin dropped below key levels after briefly hitting $88,500, while major altcoins like XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and others fell up to 4.5%. The US crypto stocks also tumbled over the sweeping tariff announcement. The crypto market is facing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to ongoing tariff issues, causing Bitcoin to drop 10% since February 1. Ethereum is hit even harder, down 20%, as tariffs threaten its blockchain ecosystem and future growth. XRP, however, has shown resilience, gaining 2% thanks to the end of regulatory uncertainty after the SEC dropped its case against Ripple. The market sees Bitcoin in two ways: some see it as “digital gold,” a safe bet against inflation during economic uncertainty. If the Fed keeps cutting interest rates, Bitcoin could benefit from increased market liquidity. With financial instability rising, investors might turn to Bitcoin as a stable store of value. Bitcoin’s Future Hinges On Key Factors Bitcoin future now depends on how the Fed handles inflation and the economy. Rate cuts could boost Bitcoin by adding liquidity, but a worsening economy might lower prices. Analyst Alex Krüger says Bitcoin’s fate relies on Monetary policy decisions and recession signs, with volatility expected as traders react to new data. During a recession, spending slows, reducing liquidity, which is key for crypto growth. While Bitcoin has catalysts like ETF approvals and institutional backing, these need fresh money flow to drive gains. To understand Bitcoin’s next moves, equities and global liquidity are 2 key factors. If the stock market continues to decline, Bitcoin is likely to follow suit. However, if stocks stabilize, it could give Bitcoin the boost needed to climb back toward its all-time highs. Additionally, keep an eye on global liquidity by tracking the Fed’s balance sheet (WALCL) and M2 velocity (M2V) as these metrics reveal how much money is flowing into the economy. While the Fed’s current Quantitative Tightening (QT) makes it harder for riskier assets like Bitcoin to thrive, an increase in liquidity could trigger a strong market rally. Experts Note Bitcoin’s Resilience In a recent tweet, Michael Saylor pointed out that tariffs are a reminder inflation is just the beginning—capital also faces risks from taxes, regulations, and unforeseen events. He highlighted Bitcoin’s strength and resilience amid these hidden risks. Today’s market reaction to tariffs is a reminder: inflation is just the tip of the iceberg. Capital faces dilution from taxes, regulation, competition, obsolescence, and unforeseen events. Bitcoin offers resilience in a world full of hidden risks. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 4, 2025 Besides, the famous Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki warns that the biggest stock market crash has hit, pushing us into a recession—possibly a depression. He urges Baby Boomers to ditch traditional investments and turn to real assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, which hold value as the dollar weakens.

The Bitcoin price rose significantly and tried hard to surpass the pivotal resistance at $83,800, but the bears quickly dragged the levels lower, compelling the price to remain consolidated below the range. In the meantime, top altcoins like Cardano, Solana, Chainlink, & XRP are gearing up, suggesting a major price action is on the horizon. The spot markets suggest the markets continue to possess a massive bearish trajectory and as a result, the lower targets remain activated. The funding rates or the fees exchanged between the long and short positions in the perpetual future contracts, may soon rise. The rates across the exchanges are expected to coil up specifically for ADA, SOL, LINK, and XRP. Source: X The rise in the volatility among these altcoins suggests a major breakout is fast approaching, and hence, investors are currently optimistic. This also suggests that the markets are hinting before the surge, which could keep the market participants highly vigilant. Meanwhile, the Chainlink (LINK) price is facing equal bullish and bearish pressures with a drop in the volume in the spot market. On the other hand, the prices of XRP, SOL, and ADA have been recovering significantly, hinting towards a potential altseason soon. On the other hand, the USDT dominance within the market has reached a crucial support. A drop from the range may confirm the beginning of an altseason as the short-term price action of stablecoins hints towards a drop in the stablecoin dominance, which suggests the capital may flow into the risk assets. In the times when the memecoin has been attracting significant liquidity, the upcoming season could be a little diverse with the rise in the fundamentally strong tokens.

Pi Network Pi Network’s cryptocurrency, PI, has faced significant price declines recently. In the past week, the price dropped by 19.58%, and over the past month, it plummeted by 61.48%. However, over six months, the decrease was a milder 9.10%. The current price fluctuates between $0.69 and $0.93, reflecting ongoing volatility. Technical indicators hint at a potential rebound. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.88, suggesting that PI is oversold. The stochastic value is low at 4.49, reinforcing this view. The 10-day Simple Moving Average stands at $0.65, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.71. The MACD level is negative at -0.0126, but a shift could signal upward momentum. If PI breaks above the nearest resistance level of $1.08, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.32, representing a potential gain of over 40%. Conversely, falling below the support level of $0.60 might lead to a drop toward the second support at $0.36. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge PI’s next moves. Cardano Cardano (ADA) has seen significant fluctuations recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 11.11%, and in the last month, it dropped by 24.30%. However, looking back six months, ADA’s price surged by 84.09%. Currently, it trades within the $0.62 to $0.74 range. Technical indicators reflect this volatility. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $0.65 and $0.67, respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index stands at 38.65, indicating that ADA is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator is at 19.82, also hinting at potential overselling. The MACD level is -0.0075, which shows bearish momentum. Considering these factors, ADA may face immediate resistance at $0.82, with a second resistance level at $0.94. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.57, and further support is at $0.45. If the price rebounds, breaking above $0.82 could imply a potential increase of around 20%. Conversely, a drop below $0.57 could lead to a decrease of approximately 8%. Traders should watch these key levels for signs of ADA’s next move. Conclusion PI and ADA are strong, but XYZVerse uniquely blends sports and memes, targets 20,000% growth, and offers community rewards, making it even more promising in the current bull run.
