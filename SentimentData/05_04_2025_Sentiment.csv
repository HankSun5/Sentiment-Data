Here’s what on-chain data says regarding if BTC is going anywhere with them. Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss Ratio Could Shed Light On Broader Dynamics In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the recent trend in the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio for Bitcoin, which is an indicator that can be useful to study how investors are reacting to price volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $0.57 Or $0.06? Analyst Says DOGE’s Fate Hinges On This Level The metric measures, as its name already suggests, the ratio between the amount of profit and that of loss being realized by the holders or addresses as a whole. The indicator works by looking at the transaction history of each coin being sold on the network to find what price it was transferred at prior to this sale. If this previous selling value is less than the latest spot price for any token, then the metric includes it under the profit volume. The total profit realized in the sale of the coin is assumed to be equal to the difference between the two prices. The indicator calculates this value for all coins belonging to the profit volume and takes a total sum to determine the scale of profit realization happening across the blockchain. Similarly, the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio also finds the total amount of loss being realized by referring to the sales of the coins of the opposite type (that is, the tokens with the last transaction value higher than the current spot price). Then, it takes the ratio between the two sums, to estimate the net situation for the sector. During the last couple of months, Bitcoin has been going through a phase of bearish price action. Here’s what investor trading behavior has been like in this period, according to the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio: As the analytics firm has highlighted in the chart, the indicator has seen dips under the 1 mark during each of BTC’s recent lows. A value in this region corresponds to loss-taking being more dominant than profit-taking. “This imbalance typically marks a degree of seller exhaustion, where downside momentum fades as sell-side pressure is absorbed,” explains Glassnode. Due to this reason, capitulation tends to help BTC arrive at local bottoms. From the graph, it’s visible that the cryptocurrency also benefited from this effect during the recent bursts of loss realization, as its price found a rebound following each of them. These Bitcoin rebounds, however, have so far not been anything sustained. Will they eventually culminate into a return of proper bullish momentum, or are they only dead-cat bounces on the way down? To tackle the question, the analytics firm has referred to a long-term view of the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. As shown in the above chart, the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has been sharply trending down recently, despite the jumps in profit realization that have come on the short-term view. “These brief profit-driven surges have failed to reverse the broader downtrend, suggesting that the macro picture remains one of generally weaker liquidity and deteriorating investor profitability,” notes Glassnode. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Among Coins Seeing The Largest Decline In Profit Supply: Data So, as for whether Bitcoin has been witnessing a shift towards bullish momentum with the recent rebounds, the answer is seemingly no, at least from the perspective of the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $83,600, down almost 2% in the last seven days.

However, amidst this exhilarating innovation, the United States has found itself playing catch-up in the regulatory arena. Many argue that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement-first strategy has inadvertently pushed burgeoning crypto ventures and talent overseas, hindering domestic growth. But hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Change is in the air, and it’s coming straight from Capitol Hill. Why is Digital Asset Regulation Suddenly a Hot Topic? For years, the lack of clear digital asset regulation in the U.S. has been a thorn in the side of the crypto industry. Imagine trying to navigate a complex maze without a map – that’s been the reality for businesses operating with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The absence of well-defined rules has led to: Uncertainty for Businesses: Companies wanting to innovate in the crypto space have been hesitant, unsure of the legal boundaries and potential penalties. Investor Hesitation: The regulatory grey area has made some investors wary, slowing down capital inflow into the U.S. crypto market. Innovation Drain: As mentioned earlier, the stringent enforcement approach has encouraged crypto entrepreneurs to seek more welcoming regulatory environments abroad. The urgency for a clear framework has become undeniable, and finally, lawmakers are taking note. The recent move in Congress signals a significant shift towards embracing and regulating this transformative technology. Bipartisan Breakthrough: A Unified Front on Crypto Regulation In a refreshing display of unity, the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees have joined forces, passing the first bipartisan crypto regulation market structure bill. This is not just another piece of legislation; it’s a landmark moment, signifying a growing consensus across party lines on the need for a comprehensive approach to digital assets. This bipartisan effort is built upon six core principles, designed to foster innovation while safeguarding consumers and the integrity of the financial system: Principle Description Benefit Promoting Innovation Creating a regulatory environment that encourages the development and adoption of digital asset technologies. Spurs economic growth, technological advancement, and job creation within the US. Clarifying Asset Classification Establishing clear definitions for different types of digital assets to determine appropriate regulatory oversight (e.g., are they securities, commodities, or something else?). Reduces confusion, provides legal certainty for businesses, and simplifies compliance. Regulating New Asset Issuance Setting guidelines for the issuance of new digital assets, ensuring transparency and investor protection. Mitigates risks associated with fraudulent schemes and protects investors from scams. Overseeing Spot Markets Implementing regulatory oversight for the spot markets where digital assets are traded, enhancing market integrity and preventing manipulation. Builds trust in the market, attracts institutional investors, and ensures fair trading practices. Protecting Customer Funds Establishing robust safeguards to protect customer funds held by digital asset platforms and custodians. Enhances consumer confidence, reduces the risk of loss due to platform failures or hacks, and protects user assets. Safeguarding Decentralized Projects Developing a regulatory approach that accommodates the unique nature of decentralized projects, fostering innovation while addressing potential risks. Allows for the growth of decentralized technologies, recognizing their potential benefits while managing associated risks in a balanced way. These principles form the bedrock of a balanced framework that aims to nurture the burgeoning digital asset market while mitigating potential risks. It’s about creating a space where innovation can thrive responsibly. What’s Next? The Road Ahead for US Crypto Regulation This bipartisan bill is a crucial first step, but the journey towards comprehensive US crypto regulation is far from over. Lawmakers are committed to refining and expanding this framework. A joint hearing is already scheduled for May, indicating the continued momentum and dedication to advancing digital asset regulation. Here’s what we can expect in the coming months: Further Deliberation and Refinement: The May hearing will likely involve expert testimonies, industry input, and further debate among lawmakers to shape the legislation. Collaboration Across Agencies: Effective regulation will require collaboration between various government agencies, including the SEC, CFTC, and Treasury Department, to ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach. International Alignment: As crypto is a global phenomenon, the U.S. will need to consider international regulatory standards to maintain competitiveness and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Focus on Consumer Protection: Protecting consumers from fraud and scams will remain a paramount concern, influencing the final shape of the regulations. The ultimate goal? To establish the U.S. not just as a participant, but as a global leader in the crypto space. By providing a clear, balanced, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment, the U.S. can attract investment, foster technological advancements, and solidify its position in the digital economy. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are a crypto investor, a business owner exploring blockchain applications, or simply a curious observer, this development in bipartisan crypto bill matters. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the developments in Congress and the evolving regulatory landscape. Resources like CoinDesk and other crypto news outlets will be crucial. Engage with Policymakers: If you are part of the crypto industry, consider engaging with policymakers and industry associations to contribute to the regulatory dialogue. Prepare for Compliance: Businesses operating in the crypto space should start preparing for potential regulatory changes. Understanding the six principles outlined in the bill is a good starting point. Consider Long-Term Opportunities: The move towards clearer regulation can be seen as a positive signal for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market in the U.S. A New Chapter for Crypto in America? The bipartisan push for digital asset regulation in the U.S. marks a pivotal moment. It’s a signal that lawmakers are recognizing the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and are committed to creating a framework that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. While the journey is ongoing, this initial bipartisan bill is a monumental leap forward, potentially paving the way for the U.S. to become a global powerhouse in the digital asset revolution. The future of crypto in America is looking brighter, and it’s a space to watch with keen interest.

While the digital asset world keeps us on our toes, a seismic shift is happening in the traditional markets that might just ripple through our crypto universe. Whispers are turning into shouts as reports emerge about a massive stock market decline in the U.S. since Donald Trump’s return to office. According to WhaleWire’s Jacob King on X, we’re talking about a staggering $9.6 trillion wiped out from the U.S. stock market. That’s not just a dip; it’s a plunge! Is this a temporary blip, or are we witnessing the start of a significant economic downturn ? Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you and your investments. Decoding the $9.6 Trillion Market Crash: What’s Behind the Numbers? Nine point six trillion dollars. Let that sink in for a moment. That’s a mind-boggling figure, and it represents a substantial erosion of wealth in the U.S. stock market. But what’s causing this dramatic market crash ? While attributing such complex phenomena to a single factor is simplistic, the timing coinciding with a political shift raises eyebrows. Let’s break down some potential contributing factors: Policy Uncertainty: New administrations often bring policy changes, and the return of a former president can amplify this uncertainty. Markets dislike uncertainty, and shifts in trade policy, regulations, or fiscal spending can spook investors. Economic Outlook Concerns: Are there underlying economic concerns that are being exacerbated by the change in administration? Factors like inflation, interest rate hikes, and global economic slowdown could be playing a significant role. A new administration’s perceived approach to these issues can either calm or agitate market sentiments. Investor Sentiment and Reaction: Market psychology is a powerful force. Investor confidence can be swayed by political events. If the market perceives the new administration’s policies as unfavorable for business or economic growth, a negative feedback loop can be triggered, leading to sell-offs and further declines. Comparison to Previous Administrations: The claim highlights this as the “largest market decline recorded under a new president.” This comparative aspect itself can fuel concern and media attention, further impacting market sentiment. It’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation. While the timeline is noteworthy, a multitude of global and domestic economic factors are always at play in market movements. Trump’s Economic Policy: A Deja Vu or a New Chapter of Investment Losses? Donald Trump’s previous presidency was characterized by significant tax cuts and deregulation, initially cheered by many in the business community. However, it also saw trade disputes and increased national debt. So, how might his return influence the current economic policy landscape and contribute to these investment losses ? Here are some key areas to consider: Trade Relations: Trump’s stance on trade, including tariffs and trade agreements, has historically created market volatility. Any perceived shift towards protectionist policies could worry investors about global economic growth and corporate earnings. Fiscal Policy: Proposed changes in tax policy and government spending can have a direct impact on corporate profitability and investor sentiment. Markets will be scrutinizing any signals regarding fiscal stimulus or austerity measures. Regulatory Environment: Deregulation was a hallmark of Trump’s previous term. The extent to which deregulation is pursued again and in which sectors will be closely watched by investors. While some sectors might benefit, others could face increased risks. Geopolitical Impact: Trump’s foreign policy and international relations also play a role. Geopolitical instability or shifts in alliances can create market uncertainty and impact investor confidence. It’s essential for investors to analyze specific policy proposals and their potential sector-by-sector impacts rather than reacting solely to broad political narratives. Navigating the Economic Downturn: Actionable Insights for Crypto and Traditional Investors Whether this economic downturn is a short-term correction or the beginning of a deeper trend remains to be seen. However, for both crypto and traditional investors, this market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insight For Crypto Investors For Traditional Stock Investors Diversification: Consider diversifying crypto holdings across different types of assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins, stablecoins) and exploring traditional assets for portfolio balance. Ensure portfolio diversification across different sectors, asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities), and geographic regions. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Volatility can be amplified in crypto markets. Review and adjust risk tolerance based on market conditions. Consider hedging strategies or reducing exposure to high-risk assets if necessary. Due Diligence and Research: Stay informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors impacting both crypto and traditional markets. Conduct thorough research on companies and sectors before investing. Understand the potential impact of economic policies on specific industries. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are inherent. Focus on the long-term potential of crypto and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term volatility. Maintain a long-term investment perspective. Market corrections can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong companies. In times of market uncertainty, knowledge is your best weapon. Staying informed, being adaptable, and having a well-thought-out investment strategy are crucial for navigating turbulent economic waters. Conclusion: Weathering the Storm and Seeking Opportunity The reported $9.6 trillion stock market decline is undoubtedly a significant event that demands attention. While the narrative around political factors is prominent, a confluence of economic forces is likely at play. For investors in both crypto and traditional markets, this period underscores the importance of vigilance, diversification, and a disciplined approach to risk management. Market downturns, while concerning, can also present opportunities for strategic investors who are prepared to weather the storm and capitalize on emerging trends. Keep a close watch on economic indicators, policy developments, and market reactions, and position yourself to navigate this evolving landscape with informed decisions.

BTC looked to be on the brink of reclaiming $85,000, but price action turned bearish, with the flagship cryptocurrency dropping to $81,745 before rising above $82,000 and moving to its current level of $82,350. BTC has been marginally up over the past 24 hours, with price action relatively flat after the flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum around $84,500. Genius Group Temporarily Banned From Buying Bitcoin Genius Group, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence firm has announced it has been temporarily banned from buying more Bitcoin after a US court order barred the company from selling shares, raising funds, and using investor funds to buy more of the asset. The preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order (TRO) were issued by a New York District court in connection with a broader dispute regarding its merger with Fatbrain AI. Fatbrain AI and Genius Group completed a merger and purchase agreement in March 2024. However, on October 30, Genius initiated arbitration proceedings to terminate the agreement alleging fraud by Fatbrain AI executives connected to the deal. “Genius Group Limited (NYSE American: GNS) (“Genius Group” or the “Company”), a leading AI-powered, Bitcoin-first education group, today announced that it is being forced to sell its Bitcoin Treasury after having been blocked from selling shares or raising funds, and specifically from using investor funds to buy Bitcoin by the United States District Court Southern District of New York (SDNY).” Fatbrain AI executives Michael Moe and Peter Ritz filed for a TRO and permanent injunction in February, preventing Genius from selling shares, raising funds, and buying more BTC . The injunction forced Genius Group to close divisions, halt marketing activities, and sell 10 BTC from its stash of 440 to fund operations. The firm has not ruled out more sales of Bitcoin. “Genius is taking all necessary measures to minimize Bitcoin sales but anticipates that it will need to downsize its Bitcoin Treasury in the coming months in the event the PI remains in place.” Fatbrain AI shareholders also filed two lawsuits against Fatbrain AI executives, including Moe, Ritz, and Genius, alleging violations of federal securities laws in connection with the merger. However, Genius Group has stated the injunction forced it to break Singapore law by halting employee compensation. “We never dreamed that it was possible that a US court could block the company from being able to issue shares, raise funds, or buy Bitcoin — all actions that would normally be decided by a public company's shareholders or Board rather than a court.” Japanese Gaming Firm Enish Announces Bitcoin Investment Japanese game developer Enish has announced a strategic investment of 100 million yen ($660,000) in Bitcoin . The purchase is set to be completed between April 1 and April 4. The acquisition is part of a broader initiative to deepen the company’s understanding of blockchain technology and enhance its game development capabilities. The game developer plans to integrate crypto assets into its financial strategy while leveraging BTC’s liquidity, market stability, and potential long-term growth. The company also plans to allocate a portion of its liquid funds to Bitcoin, conduct quarterly market valuations of its Bitcoin assets, and include any gains or losses in its financial statement. It has also pledged to disclose any significant market event that could impact its performance. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the red during the ongoing session after giving up most of the day’s gains and trading marginally down at $83,200. BTC attempted a rally during the ongoing session but could only push to the 20-day SMA before losing momentum. BTC’s price action indicates its growing correlation with the traditional markets as governments and major institutions ramp up their interest in the asset. Block CEO Jack Dorsey weighed in on Bitcoin’s popularity with governments and institutional investors, warning about the increasing influence of these institutions over the flagship cryptocurrency. Dorsey stated that while institutional adoption of Bitcoin was bound to happen, it could impact the cryptocurrency’s foundational principles. Dorsey also warned that becoming solely a store of value could reduce Bitcoin's usefulness in regular transactions. BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising to an intraday high of $88,839. However, it lost momentum after encountering selling pressure and volatility. As a result, BTC registered marginal declines on Tuesday and Wednesday, slipping below $87,000 and settling at $86,942. The price registered a marginal increase on Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $84,422. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC fell over 2% on Saturday and 0.36% on Sunday and settled at $82,404. Source: TradingView The flagship cryptocurrency encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $82,511. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 3%, moving past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $85,150. The price surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified in the leadup to Trump’s Liberation Day speech. However, sentiment turned bearish, and BTC fell over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $82,535. BTC recovered on Thursday despite overwhelming selling pressure, rising almost 1% to $83,199. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. The RSI is just under the neutral zone, while the MACD has a slight bullish bias, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42918845,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146505,1743808820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Significant $25M USDC Transfer: DWF Labs Backs Trump’s DeFi Venture – What’s Next?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dwf-labs-usdc-trump-defi/,"In a move that’s sending ripples through the crypto sphere, prominent digital asset market maker DWF Labs has reportedly transferred a substantial $25 million in USDC to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project linked to the Trump family. This news, initially brought to light by Onchain Lens on X, has sparked intense speculation and debate about the intersection of traditional finance, decentralized finance (DeFi), and political influence within the cryptocurrency landscape. What does this USDC transfer signify, and what could it mean for the future of crypto investments and political engagement in the digital asset space? Why is DWF Labs Making a Bold Crypto Investment in a Trump DeFi Project? DWF Labs is no stranger to making headlines with strategic crypto investments . Known for their active participation in the digital asset market and their support for various blockchain projects, their decision to inject $25 million into World Liberty Financial raises several key questions. Let’s break down what we know about DWF Labs and why this move could be strategically important: Who is DWF Labs? DWF Labs is a global digital asset market maker and multi-stage web3 investment firm. They are known for providing liquidity, market making services, and investment to crypto projects across various sectors. Their portfolio includes investments in numerous well-known crypto platforms and protocols. Strategic Diversification: DWF Labs’ investment in WLFI could be seen as a strategic diversification of their portfolio. Investing in a project with a unique political angle, especially one associated with a prominent figure like the Trump family, could open up new avenues and markets within the DeFi space. High-Growth Potential: DeFi projects, while inherently risky, offer the potential for high growth. DWF Labs might be betting on the potential of WLFI to attract a specific user base or community, leveraging the Trump brand and network. Market Influence: A significant investment like this can have a considerable impact on market sentiment. It signals confidence in the WLFI project and potentially the broader DeFi market, attracting further attention and investment. Understanding World Liberty Financial (WLFI): The Trump Family’s DeFi Venture World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is positioned as a Trump DeFi project , leveraging the name and potentially the network associated with the Trump family. While details about WLFI might still be emerging, here’s what we can infer and consider about this project: Brand Association: The clear association with the Trump name is a significant factor. It brings immediate name recognition and could attract a specific demographic of users who are supporters of the Trump political brand. DeFi Ambitions: As a DeFi project, WLFI likely aims to offer decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, or yield farming. The specifics of their offerings will be crucial in determining their success and appeal. Community Focus: Projects associated with public figures often aim to build a strong community. WLFI may be targeting a community that aligns with the political and ideological stances often associated with the Trump brand. Potential for Innovation or Niche Market: To stand out in the crowded DeFi space, WLFI will likely need to offer unique features, target a niche market, or innovate in some aspect of decentralized finance. The connection to a political brand could be their unique selling proposition. The Significance of a $25 Million USDC Transfer in the Crypto World A $25 million USDC transfer is a substantial amount in the cryptocurrency world, especially for a DeFi project in its early stages. Let’s examine why this amount is significant and what it could enable for WLFI: Aspect Significance of $25M USDC Liquidity Injection Provides WLFI with significant capital to bootstrap operations, develop their platform, and offer attractive incentives to early users.

Why China’s 34% Tariffs on U.S. Goods Could Propel ETH 250% Ethereum price traded near $1,820 on Friday, rising 1.6% in a muted performance compared to broader market leaders. While Bitcoin ( BTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and XRP all rallied over 3%, ETH lagged behind. However, China’s 34% tariffs on U.S. imports introduce fresh volatility triggers that could accelerate ETH’s upside momentum. BTC/Nasdaq Correlation Hits 37-Day Low Amid Trade War Tensions Markets reacted sharply to China’s unexpected decision to impose 34% tariffs on a broad range of U.S. imports. Equities dipped in early trading, but crypto assets remained largely resilient. According to TradingView data, Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 fell to 0.42, its lowest level since February 25. Bitcoin Price Correlation to NASDAQ 100 | BTCUSD Historically, such divergence signals capital rotation. When equities experience trade-related instability, investors often seek alternative hedges, initially favouring Bitcoin. If momentum continues, ETH price typically follows with steeper gains. Reallocation Accelerates as Macro Risks Intensify The current geopolitical backdrop mirrors 2019, when market turbulence from COVID-19 lockdowns led to increased capital inflows into crypto. With global retaliation measures now escalating following Trump’s tariff rollout, ETH price could soon surpass the $1,900 resistance level and sustain a broader uptrend. US Fed Rate Pause Could Boost Ethereum’s DeFi Ecosystem Following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, another rate pause now seems likely. If traditional savings and treasury yields remain low, investors may shift capital into DeFi for higher returns. As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum’s DeFi sector could see rising demand, increasing ETH accumulation. If additional retaliatory trade measures emerge, alternative assets like ETH may gain further traction. ETH Price Forecast: Falling Wedge Pattern Hints at a 250% Rally Ethereum price is forming a falling wedge, a historically bullish pattern suggesting a potential 250% breakout toward $3,200. ETH is testing the wedge’s upper boundary near $1,900, with confirmation requiring a sustained close above this level. The MACD indicator signals early bullish momentum, with an imminent MACD line crossover. If buyers sustain pressure above VWAP at $1,804, ETH could confirm the wedge breakout and accelerate higher. ETH Price Forecast However, rejection at $1,900 could invalidate the bullish outlook, exposing ETH to $1,600 support. A breakdown below this level might send prices toward $1,400, aligning with historical support zones. Ethereum next move depends on Bitcoin’s strength and macroeconomic trends. If ETH breaks out, it could mirror past parabolic rallies, but failure to breach resistance may lead to deeper corrections before a true recovery. Traders should monitor volume and momentum for confirmation.

42919118,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=146506,1743809414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Uncertain Path Ahead: Jerome Powell’s Warning on Monetary Policy & Interest Rates,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/powell-uncertain-monetary-policy/,"In a world where every whisper from the U.S. Federal Reserve can send ripples across the cryptocurrency market, Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent speech has sparked both intrigue and anxiety. Crypto enthusiasts and investors are keenly watching every move, trying to decipher the future trajectory of monetary policy. Powell’s message? It’s simply too early to chart a definitive course. Jerome Powell’s Cautious Stance on Monetary Policy Addressing an audience of economists and financial experts, Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. central bank, delivered a nuanced message that essentially boiled down to ‘wait and see.’ He emphasized that the Federal Reserve is in no rush to commit to a specific direction for monetary policy. This cautious approach comes at a time when the global economic landscape is riddled with uncertainties, from trade tensions to fluctuating inflation rates. Powell’s words suggest a period of careful observation and data analysis before any firm decisions are made about the future of interest rates and the overall monetary environment. Key takeaways from Powell’s speech: Patience is Paramount: The Fed is prepared to take its time before deciding on the appropriate path for monetary policy. This signals a data-dependent approach, where decisions will be guided by incoming economic indicators. Tariff Impact Under Scrutiny: Powell acknowledged that the economic impact of tariffs could be more significant than initially anticipated. This is a crucial point, as trade policies can have a cascading effect on inflation and economic growth. Inflation Vigilance: The Fed is committed to ensuring that price increases do not translate into persistent inflation. This highlights their focus on maintaining price stability, a core mandate of central banks. Presidential Pressure: It’s no secret that President Trump has been vocal in his calls for interest rate cuts. Powell’s remarks come against this backdrop of political pressure, adding another layer of complexity to the Fed’s decision-making process. Decoding the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Dilemma What exactly is behind this ‘wait and see’ approach to monetary policy? Several factors are likely contributing to the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance. The global economic outlook is far from clear-cut. While the U.S. economy has shown resilience, there are concerns about a potential slowdown. Globally, trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and varying growth rates across different regions create a complex and somewhat unpredictable environment. In this context, committing to a definitive monetary policy path could be premature and potentially risky. Factors influencing the Fed’s monetary policy decisions: Global Economic Uncertainty: The interconnected nature of the global economy means that events in one part of the world can have ripple effects elsewhere. The Fed must consider these global dynamics when formulating its monetary policy. Trade Tensions and Tariffs: As Powell explicitly mentioned, the impact of tariffs is a significant concern. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses, and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers, contributing to inflation. Domestic Economic Data: The Fed closely monitors a range of domestic economic data, including employment figures, inflation metrics, consumer spending, and business investment. These indicators provide crucial insights into the health of the U.S. economy and guide monetary policy decisions. Inflation Expectations: Beyond current inflation, the Fed also pays close attention to inflation expectations. If businesses and consumers expect inflation to rise, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Managing these expectations is a key part of the Fed’s job. Political Pressure: While the Federal Reserve is designed to be independent, it cannot completely ignore political considerations. President Trump’s repeated calls for lower interest rates add a layer of external pressure that the Fed must navigate. Inflation Concerns and the Fed’s Response Powell’s emphasis on ensuring that price increases don’t lead to persistent inflation is particularly noteworthy. Inflation, the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, is a critical economic indicator. While moderate inflation is generally considered healthy, high or runaway inflation can erode purchasing power, destabilize the economy, and negatively impact financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: to promote maximum employment and maintain price stability. Keeping inflation in check is central to fulfilling the latter part of this mandate. How the Fed manages inflation: Interest Rate Adjustments: The primary tool the Fed uses to manage inflation is adjusting the federal funds rate, the target range for the overnight lending rate between banks. Raising interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and curb inflationary pressures. Conversely, lowering rates can stimulate borrowing and spending. Open Market Operations: The Fed also conducts open market operations, buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply and interest rates. Forward Guidance: Communicating its intentions and outlook to the public, known as forward guidance, is another important tool. By providing clarity about its future policy plans, the Fed can influence market expectations and shape economic behavior. Powell’s recent speech itself is an example of forward guidance, albeit one emphasizing uncertainty. Monitoring Economic Data: Continuously tracking inflation data, along with other economic indicators, is essential for the Fed to assess inflationary pressures and adjust its policy response as needed. Interest Rates Under Scrutiny: What’s Next for Interest Rates? The question on everyone’s mind is, what will the Federal Reserve do with interest rates? President Trump’s repeated calls for rate cuts add significant weight to this question. Lower interest rates can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. However, they can also fuel inflation and potentially lead to asset bubbles. The Fed must carefully weigh these competing considerations. Powell’s statement that it is “too early to tell” suggests that the Fed is not yet convinced that rate cuts are necessary or appropriate at this juncture. They are likely waiting for more data to clarify the economic outlook and the trajectory of inflation before making any decisive moves on interest rates. Possible scenarios for interest rates: Rate Hikes on Hold: Powell’s remarks strongly suggest that further interest rate hikes are unlikely in the near term. The Fed appears to be in a pause mode, assessing the economic landscape. Potential Rate Cuts: While not explicitly stated, the possibility of future rate cuts cannot be ruled out, especially if economic data weakens or if inflation remains stubbornly low. However, the bar for rate cuts seems to be relatively high at this point. Data-Dependent Approach: The Fed’s future actions on interest rates will be heavily dependent on incoming economic data. Stronger-than-expected growth and rising inflation could prompt a more hawkish stance, while weaker data could lead to a more dovish approach. Balancing Act: The Fed is engaged in a delicate balancing act, trying to support economic growth while keeping inflation under control. Navigating this balance in an uncertain global environment is a significant challenge. Navigating Uncertainty in Monetary Policy: Implications for Crypto For the cryptocurrency market, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions are crucial. Lower interest rates can sometimes be seen as positive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets compared to traditional interest-bearing investments. Conversely, rising interest rates can make safer, yield-generating assets more attractive, potentially dampening enthusiasm for crypto. The current uncertainty surrounding monetary policy creates a period of both risk and opportunity for the crypto space. Impact on the crypto market: Volatility Potential: Uncertainty often leads to volatility. As markets try to interpret the Fed’s signals and anticipate future policy moves, we can expect price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If inflation concerns persist or intensify, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, might be viewed as a potential hedge against inflation, potentially increasing demand. Dollar Strength: Monetary policy decisions can influence the strength of the U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can sometimes be correlated with increased interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Institutional Investment: Clarity on monetary policy can provide a more stable macroeconomic backdrop, potentially encouraging institutional investment in the crypto space. Conversely, uncertainty might make institutions more cautious. In conclusion, Jerome Powell’s recent speech underscores the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the future path of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is adopting a patient and data-dependent approach, carefully monitoring economic developments and global risks. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of uncertainty translates into both challenges and opportunities. Staying informed, understanding the nuances of monetary policy, and being prepared for potential volatility will be key for navigating the evolving landscape.

Users can now purchase, transfer, or sell these assets directly from their accounts. This new rollout is expected to happen in the coming few weeks. Once live, it will increase PayPal’s supported digital coins to seven, according to a recent announcement . According to May Zabaneh from PayPal, this new addition would serve PayPal’s goal of increasing its presence in the broader crypto market. It will open PayPal to a larger segment of crypto users including data providers, developers, and retail investors. PayPal seems to be betting on crypto for the long-term. The platform believes that crypto and digital assets will become a major part of digital commerce, despite the temporary volatility in the market. PayPal is racing to adopt crypto While the current CEO of PayPal, Alex Chriss has not said much about PayPal’s plans for crypto adoption, Dan Schulman, the previous CEO has been an open advocate of crypto integration. In 2022, the previous CEO mentioned, “the intersection between digital currencies and the digital wallet is a clear opportunity.” PayPal integrated crypto for the first time in October 2022. At that time, the company allowed US customers to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash directly from the app. Later, PayPal users got a new crypto checkout feature in March, 2021. This new feature made it easier for users to spend their cryptocurrencies at various merchants. The crypto would automatically get converted into fiat currency during a sale.

According to a Bloomberg report , this effort is happening in Washington, where lobbyists for Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. believe they have their best chance yet to challenge Microsoft Corp.’s dominance in government software. By aligning their message with DOGE’s focus on trimming costs, they hope to persuade policymakers that Microsoft’s contracts lead to overspending and lock agencies into outdated tools. DOGE, which is Musk’s brainchild, has already raised questions about the cost of technology across government agencies. Amazon and Google’s lobbyists, in large part through technology trade groups such as NetChoice, are amplifying those questions. They are calling attention to Microsoft’s contracts, arguing that new solutions could offer better prices and more modern products. These lobbyists have reached out to lawmakers known informally as the “DOGE caucus,” along with DOGE contacts at various federal agencies. Microsoft believes Google and Amazon are using a backdoor approach to gain government contracts Microsoft’s spokesperson, Alex Haurek, said the company is not surprised by these lobbying tactics. In a statement, Haurek described certain industry players as “trying to manipulate decision makers, through shadowy front groups, rather than competing transparently on price and quality.” Google has a clear aim, which is to dislodge the legacy systems on which many government agencies rely, including Microsoft Outlook and Word. Meanwhile, Amazon wants to tilt the playing field in cloud computing, an area where it claims Microsoft has used unfair strategies by bundling software and cloud services together. Some observers believe that Musk’s network of mostly young engineers at DOGE may be open to these changes, given the agency’s stated mission to overhaul how the government spends money. Though these companies have historically relied on inside connections, they now find themselves appealing to a newer group of decision-makers. Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Service Administration, is a former software executive. He has met with trade groups about possible changes in how software licenses are purchased. On March 26, Federal Chief Information Officer Greg Barbaccia directed all federal agencies to compile an inventory of their licenses with the government’s five largest software providers. At the top of that list is Microsoft. Barbaccia once worked for Palantir, a firm founded by Peter Thiel, and he framed this move as part of an effort to stop what he called “wasteful spending.” Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa who founded the DOGE Caucus in the Senate, is championing legislation that would make agencies consolidate their software licenses and adopt updated enterprise license agreements. Ernst has cited estimates that such moves could save about $750 million every year. The House introduced its version of the legislation in late March. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and Google, has led the charge for new solutions. In a March letter to DOGE, NetChoice called Microsoft’s role in government software a “monopoly” and said it results in excessive prices and “abysmal cybersecurity performance.” A Government Accountability Office report estimated that the government invests over $100 billion every year on IT and cyber-related projects, including licenses. Leading software vendors by total payments reported by agencies in fiscal year 2021. Source: GAO analysis of agency data Microsoft alone accounted for 31% of software-license spending by 24 major federal agencies in fiscal year 2021. This total reached $2.4 billion and was roughly three times as much as its closest competitor. Exact figures for Microsoft’s total government business remain unclear, as the company does not share detailed data. Still, these numbers signal that the stakes are high for any company seeking to challenge Microsoft’s leadership. One tech lobbyist working with Microsoft’s rivals feels hopeful about chances for Google and Amazon in the face of DOGE’s emphasis on cost-cutting. That optimism grows from Musk’s earlier criticism of agencies for buying more software licenses than the number of workers who would actually use them, and for spending too much on those licenses. In an earlier podcast with Senator Ted Cruz, Musk said that in every government department, “there are far too many software licenses and media subscriptions, more than there are humans in the department.” Elon Musk speaking about government software spending in a podcast by Ted Cruz. Source: Verdict with Ted Cruz on YouTube Google spokesperson José Castañeda stated, “We’ve said for ages that government IT needs more competition to save taxpayers money and improve security, so it’s no surprise that legacy players prefer the status quo and criticize those who want change.” Microsoft has come under scrutiny from Musk’s circle for recent breaches and failures In 2023, Chinese state-affiliated hackers compromised Microsoft’s cloud environment, affecting tens of thousands of U.S. government emails, including accounts belonging to then-Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. There was a report in April 2024 from a government-appointed cyber advisory board that studied the hack and criticized Microsoft’s handling of the incident. It noted that the breach occurred just before a meeting between then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Then, in July 2024, a global failure tied to a faulty update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. disrupted Microsoft systems, halting airline flights and business operations worldwide. Critics seized on these events to argue that government reliance on Microsoft poses risks. Chris Mohr, president of the Software Information Industry Association, said in an interview that Microsoft’s dominance “led to systemic risk.” SIIA has Google and Amazon among its members. He believes DOGE is correct to say that software contracts could be handled more effectively to limit cybersecurity threats and cut costs. Some of the technology trade groups have zeroed in on just such solutions in their conversations with DOGE. They urge the agency to encourage competition in software contracts, claiming it can drive down costs and reduce security vulnerabilities. NetChoice, for example, has proposed measures aimed at blocking what it calls Microsoft’s “predatory” licensing deals, which it believes keep agencies from exploring rival offers. According to Amy Bos, NetChoice’s director of state and federal affairs who drafted the March 14 letter, the group was encouraged when DOGE said it was looking for cost-saving measures. She said, “We had something that was perfectly lined up for this.” The letter argues that removing Microsoft’s tight grip on government software would unlock billions in potential contracts for other firms. Microsoft counters that it earns its share by offering better deals and superior products. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

On April 4th alone, this whale purchased 4,100 ETH at a price of $1,785, spending approximately $7.32 million. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Since March 26th, the same wallet has accumulated a total of 33,441 ETH. Let’s break down the numbers: Total ETH Accumulated: 33,441 ETH Total USD Value (Approximate): $65.5 million Average Purchase Price: $1,959 per ETH Recent Purchase (April 4th): 4,100 ETH at $1,785 ($7.32 million) Period of Accumulation: Since March 26th To put this into perspective, $65.5 million is a substantial investment, even in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. This level of whale activity often indicates strong conviction in the asset’s future potential. But what exactly makes this accumulation noteworthy, and what could be driving this whale’s confidence in Ethereum? Why is ETH Accumulation by Whales Significant for the Crypto Market? Whale movements are often considered leading indicators in the crypto market for several reasons: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large accumulations like this can signal a bullish sentiment among major players. When whales, who have significant capital and often sophisticated market insights, start buying heavily, it can be interpreted as a sign that they anticipate price appreciation. Supply Dynamics: Significant ETH accumulation reduces the available supply of ETH on exchanges. If demand remains constant or increases, reduced supply can lead to upward pressure on prices. Trendsetter Behavior: Whale actions can sometimes trigger a herd effect. Observing large players accumulating an asset can instill confidence in smaller investors and traders, encouraging them to also buy, further driving up demand. Institutional Interest Proxy: While not always the case, whale activity can sometimes be a proxy for institutional interest. Large entities often operate through multiple wallets, making it challenging to pinpoint institutional involvement directly, but significant on-chain movements are often scrutinized for such clues. However, it’s crucial to remember that whale activity is just one piece of the puzzle. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. While whale accumulation can be a positive signal, it’s not a guaranteed predictor of price movements. Decoding Whale Strategies: What Can We Learn from This ETH Accumulation? Understanding the ‘why’ behind such massive cryptocurrency investment is crucial. While we can only speculate on the whale’s exact motivations, here are a few possible scenarios: Long-Term Bullish Outlook on Ethereum: The whale may believe in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a leading blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. This accumulation could be a strategic move to position themselves for future growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. Anticipation of Ethereum Upgrades: Ethereum has been undergoing significant upgrades, including the transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) and ongoing scalability improvements. The whale might be anticipating that these upgrades will enhance Ethereum’s value proposition and drive price appreciation. Diversification and Portfolio Rebalancing: For large investors, diversification is key. This ETH accumulation could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy, shifting assets towards cryptocurrencies, and specifically Ethereum, based on perceived market opportunities. Strategic Market Timing: The whale may have identified the current price levels as attractive entry points. Accumulating ETH at an average price of $1,959 suggests a belief that Ethereum is undervalued at these levels and has significant upside potential. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain and others to track whale movements and significant transactions. This can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential trends. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow whale activity. Always conduct thorough research on projects, understand the underlying technology, and assess the risks involved before making any investment decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies, consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which can help mitigate the risks of market volatility. Manage Risk: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always diversify your portfolio across different asset classes. Ethereum’s Potential and Whale Confidence: A Look Ahead Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized web. Its robust ecosystem, active developer community, and ongoing technological advancements position it as a leading platform for innovation. This crypto market analysis of whale accumulation suggests that significant investors recognize this potential and are strategically positioning themselves for future growth. While the future of the crypto market remains uncertain, the actions of this smart whale provide an intriguing glimpse into the sentiment of large players. Whether this accumulation marks the beginning of a new bull run for Ethereum or simply reflects a strategic long-term investment, it underscores the importance of monitoring whale activity and staying informed in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Watching the Whales The recent $65 million ETH accumulation by a single whale serves as a powerful reminder of the significant influence large investors can have on the crypto market. While it’s essential to avoid blindly following any single market signal, understanding whale activity can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and managing risk effectively, crypto enthusiasts can navigate the exciting and often unpredictable world of digital assets with greater confidence.

As traditional markets reeled from the shockwaves of new tariff announcements, the crypto world, particularly Bitcoin, watched with bated breath. Powell’s recent statements offer crucial insights into the Fed’s current thinking and its potential implications for both traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what Powell’s words mean for the economy and your crypto portfolio. Decoding Powell’s Message: Federal Reserve’s Steady Hand Speaking at the SABEW conference, Jerome Powell addressed the elephant in the room – market volatility spurred by President Trump’s latest tariff initiatives. His message was clear: the Federal Reserve is adopting a wait-and-see approach. Despite the turbulence in the stock market, Powell indicated that the Fed is not yet ready to make immediate adjustments to its monetary policy . This stance suggests a level of confidence within the Fed that current market fluctuations, while significant, do not warrant immediate intervention. Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways from Powell’s address regarding the Federal Reserve ’s current position: Patience is Paramount: The Fed is prioritizing data analysis and seeking further clarity before making any policy shifts. This signals a cautious approach, avoiding knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations. Inflation Focus Remains: Powell reiterated the Fed’s primary focus on controlling inflation. He acknowledged the potential for tariff-driven price increases but characterized these as likely to be temporary. Ignoring External Pressure: Despite public calls from President Trump for interest rate cuts, Powell’s comments suggest the Fed remains independent and data-driven in its decision-making process. Monitoring Global Developments: While not explicitly stated in this excerpt, the Fed is undoubtedly keeping a close watch on global economic developments, which are increasingly interconnected with U.S. market stability. Jerome Powell on Inflation and Temporary Price Hikes A central theme in Jerome Powell ‘s remarks was the issue of inflation. He specifically addressed concerns that tariffs could lead to sustained price increases. However, Powell conveyed a sense of optimism, suggesting that the inflationary pressures resulting from tariffs are expected to be transient. This perspective is crucial for understanding the Fed’s reluctance to immediately alter its monetary policy . Powell’s confidence in the temporary nature of tariff-induced inflation likely stems from several factors: Supply Chain Adjustments: Businesses may find ways to mitigate tariff impacts by diversifying supply chains or absorbing some costs. Consumer Demand Elasticity: Increased prices due to tariffs could potentially dampen consumer demand, naturally limiting the extent of price increases. Broader Economic Factors: The Fed’s overall assessment of the economy, beyond tariffs, likely plays a significant role. If underlying economic conditions are deemed stable, temporary price shocks may be viewed as manageable. Navigating Market Turmoil : Powell’s Words as a Stabilizing Force? The timing of Powell’s speech was particularly significant. Coming on the heels of President Trump’s tariff announcement, which triggered a wave of selling in U.S. stocks, his words were closely scrutinized for any hints of reassurance or concern. The market turmoil was palpable, with investors seeking guidance amidst the uncertainty. Did Powell’s address calm the nerves, or did it add to the unease? While U.S. stocks continued their decline even after Powell’s comments, the reaction could have been far more severe. Powell’s steady demeanor and message of patience might have prevented a deeper plunge. In times of market turmoil , clear and consistent communication from central bank leaders is vital. Powell’s emphasis on data-driven decision-making and the Fed’s commitment to its mandate could be interpreted as a stabilizing force, assuring markets that policy responses will be measured and thoughtful, not reactive and impulsive. Monetary Policy Unchanged: What Does it Mean for Crypto? The Fed’s decision to hold steady on monetary policy has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. While traditional markets reacted negatively to the tariff news and Powell’s non-committal stance on immediate policy changes, Bitcoin displayed a surprising degree of stability. This divergence raises an interesting question: how does the current monetary policy landscape influence the crypto sphere, particularly Bitcoin ? Here are a few potential connections: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Stable Monetary Policy Reduced volatility compared to traditional markets reacting to policy uncertainty. Inflation Concerns (albeit temporary, according to Powell) Potential safe-haven appeal for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, even if perceived as temporary. Continued Low Interest Rate Environment (implied by no immediate policy shift) May encourage investors to seek higher-yield assets, potentially including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Global Economic Uncertainty Increased interest in decentralized and borderless assets like Bitcoin as alternatives to traditional systems. Bitcoin ‘s Resilience: A Digital Safe Haven in Turbulent Times? Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this market episode is Bitcoin ‘s relative stability. While U.S. stocks experienced a notable downturn, Bitcoin remained remarkably steady, hovering around the $83,000 mark. This resilience fuels the ongoing narrative of Bitcoin as a potential ‘digital gold’ or safe-haven asset, particularly in times of economic uncertainty and market turmoil . Why might Bitcoin be showing such resilience? Decentralization Appeal: Bitcoin operates outside the traditional financial system and is not directly influenced by central bank monetary policy decisions in the same way as traditional assets. Global Investor Base: Bitcoin ‘s global nature diversifies its investor base, potentially reducing sensitivity to specific regional economic shocks, such as U.S. tariff announcements. Limited Supply Narrative: The fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin coins continues to resonate with investors, particularly in inflationary environments or when fiat currencies face potential devaluation. Emerging Asset Class Status: Bitcoin is still considered by many as an emerging asset class with growth potential, attracting investors seeking diversification and higher returns, even amidst market turmoil . Conclusion: Navigating the Uncertainty with a Watchful Eye Jerome Powell’s recent address provides a crucial snapshot of the Federal Reserve’s current thinking. His message of patience and focus on data, amidst market turmoil and external pressures, suggests a steady hand at the helm of U.S. monetary policy . For the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin , this period of uncertainty and traditional market volatility could further solidify its narrative as a resilient and potentially safe-haven asset. As we move forward, keeping a close watch on both traditional economic indicators and the evolving crypto landscape will be paramount for navigating the complexities of the global financial system.

China’s trade tariffs fueled a Bitcoin-led crypto rally. Ripple (XRP) sees gains China tariffs sparks crypto market recovery Ripple (XRP) price posted considerable gains on Friday climbing as high as $2.17, as China’s tariffs on the US introduce fresh volatility risks. The global crypto market cap erased losses from Wednesday’s sell-off as China announced retaliatory tariffs on Friday. Investors now fear these measures could impact revenues of U.S. firms worldwide, with concerns mounting as more countries consider retaliatory actions. Crypto market performance, April 4 | Source: Coingecko If the U.S. fails to find a diplomatic solution, equities could slide further, accelerating capital rotation into alternative assets. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against trade policy risks, prompting fund inflows into the crypto market. According to Coingecko data, the total market cap stabilised around $2.78 trillion, with major assets reclaiming key support levels—Bitcoin at $83,000, Ripple price at $2, and Ethereum breaking above $1,800. XRP Price Forecast: XRP Eyes $2.28 as Bullish Reversal Gains Momentum XRP price surged 12.54% in two days, reclaiming the $2.12 level amid strengthening bullish momentum. The rally coincides with an early MACD crossover and a recovery within the Bollinger Bands’ lower boundary. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential volatility expansion after XRP touched the lower band at $1.98 and rebounded sharply. The mid-band resistance at $2.28 aligns with the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $2.09, reinforcing a crucial test for sustained upside. Ripple (XRP) price analysis | Source: TradingView A breakout above these levels could fuel a rally toward $2.58, where the upper Bollinger Band sits. Meanwhile, MACD lines are narrowing, with the blue line approaching an upward crossover. If confirmed, this would mark a bullish reversal, echoing past rallies from similar levels. However, Bitcoin price forecast remains a critical factor, as BTC’s next move could influence XRP’s trajectory. If Bitcoin maintains bullish sentiment, XRP could benefit from broader market strength. Failure to break the $2.28 resistance could trigger another retest of $1.98 support, risking further declines. However, as long as XRP holds above the VWAP, the technical setup leans bullish, suggesting higher probability for further gains.

Martinez points to the bearish patterns on Ethereum’s monthly ETH/BTC chart, specifically mentioning a double-top or M pattern, signaling a 91% drop. If this happens, Ethereum could drop to as low as 0.0020 BTC from its current price of 0.02205 BTC, which is equivalent to $1,866 at Bitcoin’s $84,600 price, according to the market trends. The absence of whales also shows a drop in confidence, pushing investors to seek alternatives like MAGACOIN FINANCE amid Ethereum’s looming storm. Bitcoin’s Resistance Battle: A Death Cross Threat Martinez also discussed Bitcoin, noting that its recent drop below the 200-day and 50-day moving average, now acting as resistances at $86,200 and $88,300. As of April 04, 2025, Bitcoin trades at $84,600, down by 5% in the past week, with its daily volume around $32 billion, according to web data. Martinez has warned that the failure of the asset to break these levels could trigger a “death cross”, a bearish signal showing a likelihood of a further drop, which could see the asset moving to $80,000, as predicted by Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered. Bitcoin’s $1.6 trillion market cap also shows stability in the market, but its 19 million circulating supply might cause issues. With Bitcoin and Ethereum currently facing uncertainties, investors have been eyeing new opportunities to evade the market’s turbulence. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Breakout Moment: Targeting $1 As Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to battle with the bears, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as the best option for investors, with the token aiming at $1 by 2025. Its presale raised about $5 million on April 04, with Stage 6 sold out at $0.000266 and a listing price of $0.007 securing the predicted 2,500% ROI. Analysts predict a 14,185% rise to push the asset to $1, which means a $100 investment could return $142,000. The project has also seen the support of its 50,000 supporter base, with about 10,000 joining every week across 30 countries in addition to its audit that was carried out by Hashex. Stage 7 is 90% sold out in days, with posts on X showing that whales’ interest is mirroring that of Ethereum but with higher chances of gain. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s DeFi lending push could ride on Ethereum’s woes, offering a high-growth alternative. ETH’s Crash vs. MAGACOIN’s Rise: A Shifting Tide Ethereum’s potential 91% drop to 0.0020 BTC–in addition to Bitcoin’s resistance at $88,300, paints a bad picture for the crypto giants. The $1.42 billion whale sell-offs in the Ethereum market and Bitcoin’s $32 billion volume have signaled caution, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 million presale in three months presents the best opportunity to investors. Investors fleeing from Ethereum because of its bearish M pattern see MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $1 target as the best opportunity, comparing it to the early 2021 Dogecoin run. While stability has met uncertainty in the BTC and ETH markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering investors the best opportunity for escape in the current shaky market.

One project making waves is BlockDAG (BDAG). Its ongoing presale has already brought in more than $211.5 million, selling over 19.1 billion coins at just $0.0248 during Batch 27. These numbers reflect strong backing and place BlockDAG among the best crypto projects in 2025 priced under $1. This momentum isn’t based on hype. BlockDAG uses DAG technology, works with both EVM and WASM, runs a live Beta Testnet, and offers a $30 million grant program for developers. These real features show it’s more than a typical altcoin. Built as a complete Layer 1 platform, it has actual use cases and a growing base, appealing to both individual buyers and larger entities. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem with Huge ROI Potential Among many digital coins, BlockDAG (BDAG) sets itself apart with a solid structure. Unlike older blockchain designs, it uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to handle many transactions at once. This design leads to better speed, quicker confirmations, and lower fees. Developers can also benefit from its EVM and WASM compatibility. This lets them build apps in different languages, making BlockDAG suitable for DeFi, NFTs, AI, and other tools with real-world use. These tech advantages help position it as one of the best crypto projects in 2025. Already, the project has a Beta Testnet running across more than 100 global nodes. Unlike projects that only have plans on paper during presale, BlockDAG is showing real-time network activity, boosting its standing among new digital assets. Why BDAG Attracts Whales in the Presale Phase The presale model used by BlockDAG is open and rewarding. At a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27, early backers have seen gains of 2,480% from the original price of $0.001 in Batch 1. With each batch climbing slightly in cost, those who joined early have already gained before the coin reaches any exchanges. If BDAG reaches $1 in 2025, as some experts predict after it launches on trading platforms and grows its system, early supporters could see profits of over 3,900%. This potential rise is why it’s often included in lists of the best crypto projects in 2025. Presale details include: Raised: Over $211.5 million Price: $0.0248 (Batch 27) Coins Sold: 19.1 billion+ ROI Since Batch 1: +2,480% Plans for 10 major centralized exchange (CEX) listings are underway. When trading begins, demand could rise quickly, making this one of the last chances to get BDAG before prices move up. These facts help rank BlockDAG among the best crypto projects in 2025. The Graph (GRT): A Key Data Indexing Tool The Graph plays a big role in making blockchain data searchable. Often called the “Google of blockchain,” GRT lets app creators access data across many blockchains, which is critical for building useful platforms. Priced near $0.10 and used by apps like Uniswap, Aave, and Lido, GRT keeps showing strength under $1. As more digital tools need indexed data, GRT is expected to benefit, and it remains among the best crypto projects in 2025. Sei (SEI): Speed-Focused Chain for DeFi Use Sei focuses on speed, ease of use, and large-scale function. Its Twin-Turbo method allows almost instant trades, giving it a clear edge over slower systems. World Liberty Financial’s support of Sei through a large deal has brought it more attention. With a current value of around $0.20, it provides fast tech and cross-chain support, making Sei another pick for those exploring the best crypto projects in 2025. Ethena (ENA): A Stablecoins with USDe Ethena brings something new to stablecoins with its USDe—a secure digital dollar backed by assets. The launch of the Converge blockchain with Securitize and other partnerships adds strength to its base. Its low price and expanding use make it a smart choice for those looking for hidden gems. ENA’s real-use direction helps keep it listed among the best crypto projects in 2025. Summing Up– Best Crypto Projects in 2025 Though The Graph, Sei, and Ethena are all solid options, BlockDAG holds a stronger position. Its active Testnet, scalable DAG tech, big presale returns, and upcoming exchange listings set it apart. Anyone checking out the best crypto projects in 2025 will see BDAG as a strong candidate under $1. With its active growth and strong start, BlockDAG could turn into one of the biggest gainers next year—and early participants are already positioned to benefit.

Official Trump ( TRUMP ) is trading at $9.03 at time of writing and is down more than 13% in the past 24 hours. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that slapped a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods entering the US, effective April 5th, with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. He also issued a proclamation detailing “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of specific countries effective April 9th, with rates totaling up to 54% on China. The tariffs rattled global markets, with the S&P 500 plunging by 4.84% on Thursday and the Nasdaq Composite dropping by 5.97%. Trump’s announcement also battered the crypto sector, with the overall digital asset market cap taking a 6.5% hit. The president launched the Official Trump memecoin in mid-January, days before he took office. The asset has generated controversy in and out of crypto circles. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

Plume is gaining ground through its AI-based setup for real-world assets (RWAs). Pi Network is moving closer to daily use with its Visa card feature. And BlockDAG is standing out with its strong presale record, working features, and future expansion plans. With $211.5 million raised and 19.1 billion BDAG coins already sold, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best long-term cryptos to watch for 2025. Let’s look closer at these three best long-term cryptos leading the charts now, showing why BlockDAG is catching more eyes than the rest. BlockDAG (BDAG) Unlike other crypto presales that lean on future goals, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already live with working features and a fast-growing system. In Batch 27, over 19.1 billion coins were sold at $0.0248, drawing interest from thousands of people who have poured in over $211.5 million in record time. A major reason behind BlockDAG’s rise as one of the best long-term cryptos is its core Layer 1 system using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tech. It can handle transactions at the same time instead of one by one like Ethereum. This leads to instant results, no delay, and much lower fees, making it better for regular users, builders, and teams. One more strength lies in its support for both WASM and EVM tools. People building apps can use familiar coding tools while enjoying the speed of DAG-based systems. This mix of ease and fast action has made it popular among DeFi users and app creators. BlockDAG also brings working features like the TG Tap Miner game with over 250,000 players, the X1 Miner App downloaded over 800,000 times, and a full mainnet coming after the testnet in March. These parts are not just ideas—they are working now. There’s more for the community, too. The project has ways for people to earn through staking, referrals, and task rewards. A $30 million grant effort and tie-ups with groups like SpaceDev and HackerEarth are helping to bring in more skilled builders. In an area where many talk big before building anything, BlockDAG has done the opposite—creating first, then spreading the word. This is why BDAG stands as one of the best long term cryptos right now. With exchange listings planned in 2025 and a clear push toward $1, it’s drawing strong interest. Plume (PLUME) Plume is working to become the base for handling real-world asset tokenization. With more than 180 protocols on board and over 18 million wallets linked to its testnet, it’s proving itself as a solid platform for serious financial data and tools. A key edge for Plume is its use of Pond, which adds strong AI tools like credit checks, risk checks, and forecast-based NAV tools into its RWA systems. This setup is not just about blockchain use—it’s helping improve smarter financial planning by using clear, on-chain info. With laws getting clearer around RWAs, tools like Plume might help close the gap between common finance and DeFi. Pi Network (PI) Pi Network is making headlines as it pushes toward real-world function. It recently added Visa card access through Teltlk International, letting people use Pi Coin and USDT for services like Amazon, Apple Pay, and eBay. It’s also adding more features like direct Pi withdrawals, faster access to funds, better KYC steps, and new learning tools through Web3 College. Pi is clearly aiming to be more than just a mining app—it wants to become a full system for payments and learning. Even though Pi still faces hurdles in terms of clear rules and listings, its strong focus on payments may help it reach people outside the usual crypto crowd. Final Thoughts All three—BlockDAG, Plume, and Pi—are building in different directions: one focuses on real payments, one on AI-linked tools for finance, and one on a system that can scale fast. But what sets BlockDAG apart among the best long-term cryptos is how much it has already done—offering DAG-based processing, dApp support, mobile mining, staking, and live tools. Its presale has now passed $211.5 million, and it has sold more than 19.1 billion coins. The testnet is already live, top exchange listings are coming, and there’s a big goal to launch 1,000+ dApps by 2026. For anyone checking the best long term cryptos with real products and early chances for growth, BDAG is clearly worth keeping an eye on.

Forget mundane software updates and integration challenges; the latest headline involves accusations of corporate espionage, secret crypto payments, and a full-blown legal battle between HR giants Rippling and Deel. This isn’t your typical HR Tech Lawsuit ; it’s a high-stakes drama unfolding in Silicon Valley, and it’s captivating the tech industry. Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast is dissecting every twist and turn, and we’re here to bring you up to speed on this explosive saga. The Genesis of the HR Tech Lawsuit: Rippling vs Deel What started as fierce competition in the HR software market has escalated into a dramatic legal showdown. Rippling has publicly accused Deel of engaging in corporate espionage, alleging that Deel paid a Rippling employee to act as an inside mole. The lawsuit claims that Deel orchestrated a scheme involving secret cryptocurrency payments to obtain confidential information from Rippling. According to Rippling’s filing, the employee was allegedly tasked with feeding sensitive data to Deel, painting a picture of calculated infiltration. Deel vehemently denies these accusations, dismissing the lawsuit as a theatrical distraction from Rippling’s own legal woes. Key Allegations in the Rippling vs Deel HR Tech Lawsuit: Corporate Espionage: Rippling accuses Deel of paying a Rippling employee to spy and leak confidential company information. Secret Crypto Payments: The lawsuit details alleged payments made in cryptocurrency to the employee, suggesting an attempt to obscure the transactions. Fake Slack Channel Trap: Rippling claims to have set a trap using a fake Slack channel to catch the alleged mole in action. Smashing the Evidence: Adding a touch of dark comedy to the drama, there’s even an allegation of the employee smashing his corporate espionage phone with an ax at his mother-in-law’s house – described as “the oldest trick in the book” by Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast hosts. Why This Startup Rivalry Exploded into Espionage Claims? The rivalry between Rippling and Deel is no secret. Both companies are major players in the rapidly growing HR tech space, offering comprehensive platforms for payroll, benefits, and HR management, often targeting similar customer segments. This intense startup rivalry in a competitive market can sometimes push boundaries, but the allegations in this HR Tech Lawsuit are unprecedented. The lawsuit highlights the intense pressure and high stakes in the tech industry, where access to competitive intelligence can be perceived as a critical advantage. But is this just aggressive business tactics gone wrong, or a genuine case of corporate espionage? The legal proceedings are likely to be lengthy and revealing. Beyond Rippling Deel: Other Headlines from Bitcoin World’s Equity Podcast While the Rippling Deel saga dominates headlines, Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast also covered other crucial developments in the tech and crypto space this week: Gamifying Tax Filing: A startup is attempting to make tax filing less painful by turning it into a game. However, this innovative approach raises complex copyright questions that the industry is grappling with. Circle’s IPO Ambitions: Stablecoin giant Circle is reportedly moving closer to an IPO. This move is significant for the crypto industry, potentially signaling increased maturity and mainstream acceptance, and could pave the way for other crypto firms to go public. The Relentless AI Race: The AI sector continues its breakneck pace of innovation and investment. Key highlights include OpenAI’s record-breaking funding round, challenges related to GPU availability and performance, Anthropic’s plans to introduce its AI chatbot to colleges, and leadership changes at Google’s Gemini project. The AI race is not just about technological advancements but also about market dominance and ethical considerations. Actionable Insights from the HR Tech Drama and Beyond This Corporate Espionage case, while dramatic, offers some crucial takeaways for businesses and individuals in the tech and crypto space: Insight Description Data Security is Paramount The Rippling Deel lawsuit underscores the critical importance of robust data security measures and employee monitoring to prevent internal threats and data breaches. Competitive Intelligence Ethics While competitive intelligence is a legitimate business practice, this case raises questions about the ethical boundaries and legal ramifications of aggressive tactics, particularly when they cross into espionage. Crypto in Corporate Espionage The alleged use of cryptocurrency for payments in this case highlights the anonymity and potential for misuse of crypto in illicit activities, even in the corporate world. Startup Rivalry Intensity The HR tech sector, and the startup ecosystem in general, is characterized by intense competition. Companies need to be prepared for aggressive tactics from rivals and ensure they operate within legal and ethical boundaries. Conclusion: Spy Games and High Stakes in the Tech World The Rippling vs Deel lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a stark reminder of the high stakes and intense competition in the tech industry. The allegations of corporate espionage, secret payments, and dramatic attempts to cover tracks paint a picture of a cutthroat business environment where the lines between aggressive competition and illegal activity can become blurred. As the legal battle unfolds, the tech world will be watching closely, not just for the outcome, but for the lessons it offers about ethics, security, and the true cost of winning in the relentless race for market dominance. The drama in the HR Tech Lawsuit is just beginning, and it promises to be a wild ride.

42920274,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=705788,1743811306,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42920274.jpeg,US Senator Ted Cruz warns about an upcoming bloodbath,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/senator-ted-cruz-warns-bloodbath/,"Republican senator Ted Cruz warned on Friday about a potential “bloodbath” in the 2026 midterm elections if President Donald Trump’s tariffs drag the United States economy into a recession. According to Financial Times , the Texas lawmaker said a long-term trade war could have devastating effects on both the economy and Republican political prospects. Cruz typically aligns with Trump, but his remarks were unusually blunt. He called the possibility of an ongoing conflict with retaliatory tariffs from other nations “a terrible outcome.” In his view, if the tariff standoff leads to a recession, “particularly a bad recession,” voters could turn sharply against the party in power. “2026 in all likelihood politically would be a bloodbath,” Cruz said. The Canada-born Texan added that even the Republican Senate majority, currently 53-47, might not survive if the economy sours and people blame the party leading the country. Republican lawmakers have begun to share these concerns. Their unease intensified when the stock market shed about $5.4 trillion in value after Trump’s so-called “liberation day” levies launched a global market retreat. Observers worry that ongoing trade tensions could hurt U.S. exporters, harm jobs, and worsen inflation if the measures remain in place indefinitely. Democrats want to undo the tariffs On Thursday, Republican senator Chuck Grassley joined forces with a Democrat to introduce a bill that would reassert congressional authority over tariff policy. Under the proposed law, new tariffs would expire in 60 days unless Congress voted to keep them in place. Lawmakers would also have the power to revoke existing levies. By Friday, Republican senators Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, Jerry Moran, and Thom Tillis had signed on as co-sponsors. Although the bill may not advance, the growing support suggests that many in the party are wary of the president’s approach and fear potential fallout ahead of the 2026 midterms. Signs of discontent emerged this week when a conservative candidate backed by Elon Musk lost a state supreme court race in Wisconsin to a liberal opponent. Republicans also underperformed their 2024 results in two special House elections in Florida. These setbacks added fuel to doubts that the current trade policy will help the party maintain control of both chambers of Congress. Cruz said that if the U.S. is in the middle of a recession and “people are hurting badly,” they will likely turn on the GOP. “They punish the party in power.” Cruz also disputed Trump’s claim that tariffs will usher in “a booming economy.” He suggested that there would only be “an enormous economic boom” if the U.S. and any retaliating countries lowered duty rates across the board. Otherwise, if tariffs become permanent, he predicted “real damage” to the economy and warned that a full-blown trade war “would destroy jobs here at home.” It would also “have a powerful upward impact on inflation,” the senator cautioned. He warned that further escalation could lock the country into lasting harm. ​ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

But unlike earlier cycles dominated by hype-only tokens, this quarter’s leading meme coins are backed by real use cases, scarcity-focused tokenomics, and structured roadmaps. Meme coins are maturing—and some are starting to resemble full-scale platforms rather than temporary trends. Among the projects gaining traction, Dragoin ($DDGN) is emerging as one of the most promising. While several meme coins are still finding their footing, Dragoin’s presale model, gaming utility, and decentralization plan are already turning heads. For investors eyeing meme coins with real upside this quarter, Dragoin and a select few others stand out as strong candidates. Dragoin Combines Utility, Scarcity, & Structure Dragoin takes a different approach from the average meme coin. Rather than relying on internet buzz alone, it delivers actual user interaction through a Telegram-based play-to-earn game. Players can hatch dragons, train them, and battle—all while earning $DDGN tokens based on their activity. This kind of gamified utility transforms holders into engaged participants. Its presale adds another layer of strength. Structured into 25 stages, each with a slight price increase, it creates steady upward momentum while rewarding early buyers. Out of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens, 50% are allocated to the presale. Any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation—a strategy that directly reduces supply over time. This deflationary approach matters. As Dragoin’s game rolls out to a broader audience in Q2 and interest grows, reduced supply paired with rising demand can help support long-term price growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely on sudden virality, Dragoin is strategically building a player base while tightening its token supply. At the end of the presale, ownership of Dragoin’s smart contract will be renounced, making the project fully decentralized. No central figure will hold control. This shift appeals to investors looking for transparency and protection against centralized manipulation. With key features like staking rewards, airdrops, referral bonuses, and listings on major exchanges planned for Q2 and Q3, Dragoin appears well-positioned for sustained momentum. Its combination of meme appeal, gameplay, and token strategy places it among the top new meme coins to buy right now—and potentially throughout 2025. Cheems Attempts a Strategic Pivot in Q2 Cheems remains a well-known meme coin, mostly thanks to its iconic image and lighthearted branding. However, Q2 2025 marks a shift in strategy, as the team introduces charitable initiatives and new staking rewards aimed at rewarding long-term commitment. One of Cheems’ consistent strengths is its strong community. Through regular contests, giveaways, and creator partnerships, the project continues to maintain solid engagement. Still, its deep ties to nostalgia may hold back broader growth, especially in a meme coin space that’s shifting toward functionality. Cheems could still deliver in the short term, but its long-term viability depends on how far it can evolve beyond its meme roots. MEMEX Offers Index-Like Exposure to Meme Coins MEMEX, also known as Meme Index, introduces a fresh way to invest in the meme coin sector. Instead of buying individual tokens, holders get access to a basket of trending meme coins—all bundled into a single asset. This concept is similar to an ETF, giving investors diversified exposure without the need to track multiple charts. With dynamic adjustments and automated tracking of meme coin trends, MEMEX simplifies decision-making. It’s not focused on riding a single project to massive returns. Instead, it spreads risk across the space, allowing holders to benefit from overall momentum in the meme coin market. While MEMEX may lack the viral pull of Dragoin or Cheems, it serves as a lower-risk entry point for those who prefer a more hands-off approach. Why Functional Meme Coins Have the Edge in Q2 Early signs in Q2 suggest a shift in investor priorities. While speculation is still part of the game, many traders are gravitating toward meme coins that offer real engagement, transparent economics, and community ownership. Dragoin represents this shift well. Its focus on utility, paired with a supply-reducing presale and a clear product launch timeline, makes it more than just another meme. The project invites users to play, earn, and contribute—not just buy and hold. From its 25-stage token rollout to its upcoming staking features and decentralization, Dragoin has multiple growth levers in place. Cheems and MEMEX still play meaningful roles—Cheems with its community base and MEMEX with its passive investment model. But it’s Dragoin that offers the full package for investors looking ahead. As capital continues rotating into meme coins with substance, Dragoin’s setup positions it well for a breakout quarter and potentially a standout year.

Filed by plaintiff Andrew Willoughby, the suit alleges Capital One Financial Corporation, Capital One N.A. and Capital One Bank (USA) N.A. entities exposed its customers’ personal identifiable information (PII) due to an employee’s negligence. The suit alleges that because of inadequately protected computer systems, customers’ names, Social Security numbers, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, credit card numbers, transaction history, and other financial information exposed via a data breach. The breach happened between August 11, 2022 and May 22, 2023, when an “unauthorized actor” accessed client PII due to the employee’s “failure to maintain an adequate security system,” according to the lawsuit. The Capital One employee also allegedly delayed informing the plaintiffs of what happened in time to save them from potential identity theft crimes. Says the complaint, “Due to Defendants’ negligence, cybercriminals obtained everything they need to commit identity theft and wreak havoc on the financial and personal lives of thousands of individuals… Defendants were negligent and failed to inform Plaintiff and the Class Members of the data breach in time for them to protect themselves from identity theft.” Now, the suit alleges that “for the rest of their lives,” Capital One customers will have to face the threat of identity thieves possessing or misusing their personal information via the dark web. “The unencrypted PII of Plaintiff and Class Members may end up for sale on the dark web or simply fall into the hands of companies that will use the detailed PII for targeted marketing without the approval of Plaintiff and Class Members. Unauthorized individuals can easily access the PII of Plaintiff and Class Members.” Capital One was also recently accused of engaging in “cancel culture” by President Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump. The bank has $490.1 billion in total assets as of the end of last year.

42920353,https://coingape.com/?p=247399,1743811747,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Rules Dollar-Backed Stablecoins Are Not Securities Under Federal Laws,https://coingape.com/us-sec-rules-dollar-backed-stablecoins-are-not-securities-under-federal-laws/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that certain stablecoins, specifically those backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar, do not qualify as securities under federal laws. This decision helps provide greater regulatory clarity in the growing field of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. US SEC Defines Covered Stablecoins In a recent statement, after the US SEC’s incoming chair got voted in by the Senate committee , the Division of Corporation Finance defined “Covered Stablecoins” as those stablecoins that maintain a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. These tokens are backed by assets held in a reserve, which are low-risk and highly liquid, ensuring that they can always be redeemed for U.S. dollars at a one-to-one ratio. The SEC has noted that such stablecoins are intended to be used for payment, transferring of money and for value storage rather than being investment products. The SEC provided an opinion that the process of minting and redeeming these stablecoins does not fall under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act. Consequently, any parties that engage in the issuance and circulation of these stablecoins are not regulated nor required to abide by the US securities laws or register with the US SEC. Marketing of Stablecoins Clarified The US SEC further detailed that Covered Stablecoins are marketed as a stable and reliable medium of exchange, with no promise of profits or returns. In its statement, the SEC noted that these are not advertised as investments and do not provide holders with any governance rights or financial returns based on the issuer’s performance. By clarifying the marketing strategies surrounding these stablecoins, the SEC aims to prevent any confusion about their classification as securities. This moves comes post the U.S. passing the STABLE Act , establishing a regulatory framework for USD-pegged. The SEC’s statement also addresses the importance of maintaining a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. These stablecoins are not meant to fluctuate in price like other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. As a result, their primary role is to facilitate transactions and act as a stable store of value rather than to generate financial returns for holders. Reserve Requirements for Stablecoins The SEC further elaborated that Covered Stablecoins are presented as a stable store of value and medium of exchange that cannot faithfully fill the role of a security promising profits or returns. The SEC, in its statement, stated that they are not promoted as an investment and they do not give the holders any rights or any type of financial returns on the issuer. In this respect, the mission of the US SEC is to define the marketing strategies concerning them in order to avoid any misunderstanding of their nature. The SEC also gives emphasis on the company maintaining stable price that does not fluctuate with the U.S dollar. These coins are relatively stable compared to other cryptocurrencies like the Bitcoin or the Ethereum because they are designed to have fixed values. Consequently, their main functions are to be used as a medium of exchange and serve as a unit of account instead of producing revenue for owners. SEC’s Application of Reves and Howey Tests According to the findings of the legal analysis, the defends used two legal benchmarks known as Reves and Howey tests to establish if the asset is a security. Under the Reves test, the SEC has held that Covered Stablecoins are akin to traditional commercial instruments as opposed to securities. Another reason is the Howey test that emphasizes that these buyers use these assets for commercial reasons with the expectation of gains other than in the form of profits. Based on its decision, the SEC decided that Covered Stablecoins do not fall under the securities definition under the federal securities laws. This decision is founded on the fact they are mainly used as a medium of exchange, and not as an investment vehicle backed by readily saleable assets. This clarification from the SEC comes as Congress continues to work on cryptocurrency legislation. While the SEC’s stance provides clarity on stablecoins, it does not address other digital assets, such as yield-bearing tokens , which may fall under securities regulations. The move aligns with ongoing efforts in the U.S. government to regulate digital assets and cryptocurrency more comprehensively.

The Wisconsin project would be the latest in a series of large data centers being built in the United States. Meta and Wisconsin struck up a significant project that will bring changes to the AI sector Wisconsin struck an incentive agreement in February with an unidentified business operating under a false identity to build a data center in the state with an anticipated $837 million multiyear investment. Based on a statement retrieved from an individual whose identity was disclosed because the information was confidential stated that Meta was the firm in charge of the project . On the other hand, an official from Meta chose not to comment. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation commented on this topic. It raised discussions based on the unidentified business it struck a project with, stating that after a contract was approved, its practice was to list the businesses with which it collaborates. Notably, in recent years, to meet the demands of cloud computing and increasingly complex artificial intelligence models, major tech companies have hurried to increase the capacity of their data centers. For instance, Meta stated that it intends to invest up to $65 billion this year, concentrating on developing AI-related infrastructure, including a sizable facility in Louisiana. In addition, it is worth noting that it already operates data centers in the Midwest, including DeKalb, a suburb of Chicago, and Iowa. Several companies have also eyed Wisconsin as a data center construction site promoting AI innovation Meta implements AI in all areas of its operations, which impacts how Facebook and Instagram target users with advertisements and arrange content in users’ feeds. Additionally, the company uses it in its consumer hardware, such as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and Meta Quest headsets. Following the company’s growing interest in AI, CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed investors that he expected Meta to eventually invest hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence in late January. Furthermore, apart from Meta, other companies have also shown interest in building data centers in Wisconsin. For example, hyperscalers recently found Wisconsin a desirable data center construction site. In addition, Microsoft Corp. is building what may be one of its most powerful facilities south of Milwaukee, located in the state of Wisconsin. Another company on this list is OpenAI’s Stargate venture. The firm stated that Wisconsin was one of the states it was considering for growth. However, in light of Microsoft’s pullback, the rise of less expensive AI models, and the possible effects of tariffs, investors have questioned whether the rate of data center construction was sustainable. The Beaver Dam project promises significant benefits to the local community and region In February, a local economic development authority, the Beaver Dam Area Development Corporation, mentioned that future economic benefits from this project could greatly impact the community and region. That month, the city’s economic development entity stated that it was collaborating with Alliant Energy Corp. on the project and had already authorized water and development agreements. However, according to the group, the project is still pending finalization and non-local approvals. Earlier, a representative for Alliant Energy assured people that more details would be released soon, stating that the company was currently in the “exploratory and due diligence phases” of a possible Beaver Dam project.

Pundit Explains What’s Happening,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-next-direction/,"A crypto analyst has shared insights into the recent strength in the XRP price, suggesting that South Korea may be the reason behind it. The analyst noted that the altcoin has been seeing high trading volume on South Korean exchanges, and this localized demand may be holding up its price while other altcoins struggle to gain traction. How South Korea Is Bolstering The Price According to XForceGlobal South Korea is currently one of the major drivers of the XRP price action. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the analyst disclosed that the engagement and adoption from the crypto users in South Korea was a major contributor to XRP’s bullish performance. Related Reading: Analyst Unveils Extended XRP Price Target To $44, Reveals When To Take Profits Currently, South Korea is one of the most active crypto markets in the world, leading in global trading volume across multiple assets. However, among the numerous cryptocurrencies in the market, XRP stands out the most within the country. The analyst has revealed that even during low trading days, XRP frequently outpaces Bitcoin, underscoring its high demand and adoption in South Korea. XForceGlobal has suggested that South Korea’s notable interest in XRP likely stems from its status as one of the most isolated countries in terms of crypto regulations. The analyst revealed that millions of citizens currently own the altcoin, making up about 20% of the cryptocurrency’s market cap valuation. Moreover, due to a lack of large-scale cross-border payment solutions, most South Koreans opt to use cryptocurrencies like XRP to facilitate transactions. This, in turn, fuels adoption and strengthens the cryptocurrency’s utility, which positively influences its price action. Compared to South Korea, the regulatory uncertainties and legal challenges in the United States (US) have slowed down XRP’s growth. XForceGlobal has stated that the active participation of retail institutions, strong community support, and early adoption in South Korea have helped prop up prices despite the difficulties it faced over the past years. What The Future Holds For XRP In South Korea While discussing the impact of South Korea’s support for XRP on its price action, XForceGlobal offered insights into the cryptocurrency’s future in the country. The analyst revealed that the market is at a pivotal moment where XRP has evolved from a speculative asset to a symbol of Korea’s dominance in the crypto market. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Descending Trendline, Why A Surge To $4 Is Still In The Cards Currently, Upbit, the largest crypto exchange in South Korea, holds the most significant market share of XRP in terms of total supply. The exchange reportedly has about 6 billion XRP, accounting for roughly 5% of the entire supply. XForceGlobal has revealed that the continued demand from retail investors combined with Upbit’s massive XRP reserve will make South Korea a key driver to the cryptocurrency’s global future price action. Moving forward, the analyst has discussed XRP’s price movements on the Korean won chart, suggesting that its current action may be foreshadowing upcoming events. He pointed out that the altcoin has already formed a lower low on the chart, possibly hinting at a more controlled pullback rather than an impulsive decline — an outlook he described as “arguably bearish”. The crypto analyst also noted that XRP may be forming a potential bottom on the Korean won chart, indicating a possible impulse to the upside and a bullish continuation.

For those in the crypto space keeping an eye on technological advancements, understanding the cost and capabilities of AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro is crucial. Why? Because AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain and crypto, from enhancing security to predicting market trends. Let’s dive into why Gemini 2.5 Pro is turning heads, and emptying wallets, in the tech world. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Setting New Benchmarks in AI Performance Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro isn’t just another AI model; it’s positioned as a leader, boasting industry-leading performance across several critical benchmarks. These benchmarks are essentially the gold standard for measuring an AI’s prowess in areas like: Coding: Evaluating how well the AI can understand, generate, and debug code. Reasoning: Testing the AI’s ability to solve complex problems and make logical inferences. Math: Assessing the AI’s mathematical and analytical skills. According to Google, Gemini 2.5 Pro excels in these areas, suggesting a significant leap forward in AI capabilities. But with great power comes a great price tag, and in this case, a surprisingly hefty one. Decoding the AI Model Pricing: What Does Gemini 2.5 Pro Cost? Let’s break down the numbers to understand why Gemini 2.5 Pro is being called Google’s most expensive AI model to date. The pricing structure is based on tokens, which are essentially units of text. Here’s the breakdown: Prompt Length Input Tokens (per million) Output Tokens (per million) Up to 200,000 tokens $1.25 $10.00 Greater than 200,000 tokens $2.50 $15.00 To put this into perspective, 200,000 tokens are roughly equivalent to 150,000 words, far exceeding the length of the entire “Lord of The Rings” series. For most standard use cases, the lower pricing tier applies. However, for extremely large inputs, the price doubles for input tokens and increases by 50% for output tokens. This tiered pricing is noteworthy because it caters to a broader range of applications, but at a premium. Google AI Pricing Compared: Gemini 2.5 Pro vs. The Competition When we stack Gemini 2.5 Pro against other AI models, the “expensive” label becomes even clearer. Consider these comparisons: Gemini 2.0 Flash: A more budget-friendly Google offering at $0.10/M input and $0.40/M output tokens. Gemini 2.5 Pro is significantly pricier. OpenAI’s o3-mini: Priced at $1.10/M input and $4.40/M output tokens, still cheaper than Gemini 2.5 Pro. DeepSeek’s R1: An even more affordable option at $0.55/M input and $2.19/M output tokens. Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet: At $3/M input and $15/M output tokens, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is more expensive for input tokens but matches Gemini 2.5 Pro’s output token price at the higher tier. OpenAI’s GPT-4.5: A truly premium model, costing a staggering $75/M input and $150/M output tokens, dwarfing even Gemini 2.5 Pro’s cost. While Gemini 2.5 Pro is indeed expensive compared to many models, it’s positioned in a complex pricing landscape. It’s more costly than some but cheaper than the absolute top-tier models like GPT-4.5 and even Claude 3.7 Sonnet in certain scenarios. Why the High Price Tag? Demand and Computing Costs So, why are we seeing this upward trend in pricing for flagship AI models? Several factors are likely at play: High Demand: According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Gemini 2.5 Pro is their most in-demand AI model. This high demand, reflected in an 80% usage increase in Google’s AI Studio and Gemini API this month alone, naturally drives up prices. Computing Costs: Training and running these advanced AI models require immense computational power, translating to significant infrastructure costs. These costs are inevitably passed down to developers. Performance and Features: Gemini 2.5 Pro offers extended context windows (handling prompts over 200,000 tokens), a feature not widely supported by competitors. This advanced capability justifies a higher price point for users needing to process massive amounts of data. The tech industry’s initial reaction to Gemini 2.5 Pro’s AI model pricing has been surprisingly positive. Developers seem to appreciate the perceived value for money, acknowledging the performance gains justify the cost. However, the broader trend of increasing prices for top-tier models is undeniable. OpenAI’s o1-pro, for instance, is even more expensive than Gemini 2.5 Pro, signaling a potential new normal in AI pricing. Actionable Insights for Developers and Crypto Enthusiasts For developers, especially those in the crypto and blockchain space looking to integrate AI, here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Needs: Carefully assess your project’s requirements. Do you truly need the cutting-edge performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro, or could a more cost-effective model like Gemini 2.0 Flash or DeepSeek’s R1 suffice? Optimize Prompts: Efficient prompt engineering can reduce token usage, thereby lowering costs. Focus on clear, concise prompts to minimize unnecessary token consumption. Monitor Usage: Keep a close eye on your AI usage to avoid unexpected expenses. Utilize Google’s AI Studio or API dashboards to track token consumption. Explore Free Tier: Gemini 2.5 Pro is available for free with strict rate limits. This could be sufficient for initial testing and smaller projects. For crypto enthusiasts, the pricing trend in AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro highlights the increasing value and cost of advanced computation. As AI becomes more integral to blockchain technology, understanding these cost dynamics will be crucial for future developments and integrations. Conclusion: Is Gemini 2.5 Pro Worth the Investment? Gemini 2.5 Pro is undoubtedly a powerful and advanced Google AI model, setting new standards in various benchmarks. Its expensive AI model pricing reflects its premium capabilities and the high demand it commands. Whether it’s worth the investment depends entirely on your specific needs and budget. For projects requiring top-tier performance and the ability to process massive datasets, Gemini 2.5 Pro could be a game-changer. However, for less demanding tasks, more affordable alternatives might be more practical.

33767162,[object Object],1743813053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Realized Price Model Signals Correction May Still Have Weeks To Run – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-price-model-signals-correction-may-still-have-weeks-to-run-details/,"Bitcoin is under critical selling pressure as bulls fail to reclaim the $90,000 level, while bears struggle to break below the $81,000 support zone. The market remains stuck in a tightening range, with macroeconomic uncertainty and global instability continuing to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff announcements have added fuel to the volatility, further shaking risk assets like Bitcoin. Despite the fragile outlook, some data suggests the worst may be behind. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights based on the Bitcoin Realized Price by Inter-Cycle Cohort Age model — an indicator designed to measure the duration of market corrections through the appearance of a “Dead Cross.” This occurs when the realized price of newer investors crosses below that of longer-term holders, signaling a potential correction phase within a bull cycle. According to Adler, the current Dead Cross began 28 days ago. Historically, similar phases have lasted an average of 85 days. If this pattern holds, the market could spend approximately 57 more days in its current state before resolving. While this doesn’t guarantee an immediate rebound , it offers context for where Bitcoin stands in its correction and hints at how much longer the pressure may last. Bitcoin Correction May Have 57 Days Left As Market Faces Tariff Fallout Bitcoin remains under pressure after US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs during Liberation Day, triggering a wave of selling across global markets. The announcement added a new layer of uncertainty to an already tense economic backdrop, amplifying volatility and shaking investor confidence in both traditional and crypto assets. Bitcoin, known for its sensitivity to macroeconomic risk, reacted with increased selling pressure, further extending its correction phase. Despite the panic, some analysts suggest this downturn may follow a familiar historical pattern. Adler’s insights using the Bitcoin Realized Price by Inter-Cycle Cohort Age model highlight the duration of correction phases by tracking the lifespan of a “Dead Cross,” which occurs when the realized price of short-term holders dips below that of long-term holders. Adler’s analysis marks each active Dead Cross period with a red circle on the chart. Historical data shows that these phases last an average of 85 days. The current Dead Cross has been active for 28 days. Based on past trends, that leaves approximately 57 days until a potential resolution, assuming history repeats. Importantly, Adler emphasizes that a true bear market is typically confirmed only when Bitcoin drops below its 365-day moving average — something that hasn’t occurred yet. For now, this phase remains classified as a correction within a broader bull cycle. While the road ahead may still involve volatility, Adler’s analysis offers a measured view: the correction could be closer to its end than many fear. Investors will now look for signs of stabilization or strength as this historical pattern plays out in real time. BTC Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $83,000 after failing to reclaim the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) near $84,800, signaling ongoing weakness in the short term. The repeated rejection at this key technical level has left bulls on the defensive, struggling to regain momentum as bearish sentiment continues to dominate the market. The $81,000 support zone, which has held up during previous dips, is now under pressure and looks increasingly fragile. If this level breaks, a deeper correction could follow, potentially pushing BTC into the mid-$70,000 range. With macroeconomic fears still looming and broader financial markets facing instability, Bitcoin’s next move remains highly uncertain. However, there is still a glimmer of hope for bulls. A decisive breakout above the $88,000 resistance level would be a strong signal that buyers are regaining control. Such a move could confirm the beginning of a recovery phase and shift short-term sentiment back toward the upside. For now, BTC remains stuck between a weakening support and firm resistance. The coming days will be critical as bulls attempt to defend key levels and avoid further downside while watching for any breakout opportunity that could revive market momentum.

The explosive rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot app, is sending shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Surging to the top of app store charts, DeepSeek is not just another chatbot; it’s a statement. Trained with groundbreaking compute-efficient techniques, DeepSeek’s AI models are forcing analysts to rethink the AI landscape and the future demand for AI chips. But what exactly is DeepSeek, and why is it suddenly a global phenomenon? Let’s dive into the story of this game-changing AI player. DeepSeek AI Chatbot: From Hedge Fund to AI Frontrunner DeepSeek’s origins are rooted in the world of high finance. Backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund, DeepSeek leverages AI’s power for more than just market predictions. Founded by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, High-Flyer Capital Management has been deploying AI algorithms in trading since 2019. In 2023, the company expanded its vision, establishing DeepSeek as a dedicated AI research lab, separate from its core financial operations. This lab then spun off into its own entity, retaining the name DeepSeek, with High-Flyer as a key investor. This unique background gives DeepSeek a financially robust foundation and a deep understanding of leveraging AI for complex problem-solving. From its inception, DeepSeek prioritized infrastructure, building its own data center clusters for model training. However, like other Chinese AI innovators, DeepSeek faces headwinds from US export restrictions on advanced hardware. To train its cutting-edge models, DeepSeek has reportedly utilized Nvidia H800 chips, a less powerful alternative to the H100 chips favored by US companies. Despite these hardware limitations, DeepSeek’s technical team, known for its youth and aggressive recruitment of top doctorate AI researchers from leading Chinese universities, has achieved remarkable progress. Interestingly, DeepSeek also diversifies its talent pool by hiring individuals from non-computer science backgrounds, enriching its tech development with broader perspectives. Unveiling DeepSeek’s Powerful AI Models DeepSeek burst onto the AI scene in November 2023 with its initial suite of models: DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. However, it was the spring 2024 release of the next-generation DeepSeek-V2 family that truly captured the AI industry’s attention. DeepSeek-V2, a versatile system capable of analyzing both text and images, demonstrated exceptional performance across various AI benchmarks. Crucially, it offered this performance at a significantly lower operational cost than comparable models available at the time. This cost-efficiency sent ripples through the industry, compelling domestic competitors like ByteDance and Alibaba to slash prices for their own models and even offer some for free. The subsequent launch of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 only solidified DeepSeek’s growing reputation as a major disruptor. According to DeepSeek’s internal testing, DeepSeek V3 surpasses both open-source models like Meta’s Llama and closed models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o in performance. Further amplifying DeepSeek’s prowess is its R1 “reasoning” model, launched in January. DeepSeek asserts that R1 rivals OpenAI’s o1 model on critical benchmarks. Reasoning models like R1 excel in self-correction, mitigating common errors and enhancing reliability, particularly in complex domains such as physics, science, and mathematics. While reasoning models might take slightly longer to generate solutions, the increased accuracy and dependability they offer are invaluable in fields demanding precision. Here’s a quick comparison of DeepSeek’s key models: Model Description Key Features Release Date DeepSeek Coder Code generation model Efficient code synthesis, supports multiple programming languages November 2023 DeepSeek LLM Large Language Model General-purpose language understanding and generation November 2023 DeepSeek Chat Chatbot application Conversational AI interface, powered by DeepSeek LLM November 2023 DeepSeek-V2 General-purpose text and image analysis Improved performance, cost-efficient operation Spring 2024 DeepSeek-V3 Next-gen general-purpose model Outperforms Llama and GPT-4o in internal benchmarks December 2024 DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Model Self-correcting, high reliability in complex domains, rivals OpenAI’s o1 January 2025 The Shadow of Regulation: Navigating Chinese AI Benchmarks Despite its technical achievements, DeepSeek, as a Chinese-developed AI, operates within a unique regulatory landscape. Its models are subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure alignment with “core socialist values.” This oversight manifests in DeepSeek’s chatbot app, where certain politically sensitive topics, such as Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy, are off-limits. This content filtering is a crucial aspect to understand when evaluating DeepSeek’s capabilities and potential applications in a global context. DeepSeek’s Market Impact and Disruptive Approach DeepSeek’s rapid ascent is undeniable. In March, it recorded over 16.5 million website visits, positioning it as a significant player in the AI arena, second only to ChatGPT, although still trailing far behind in user engagement. What’s particularly intriguing is DeepSeek’s business model, or rather, the apparent lack thereof. The company offers its products and services at prices significantly below market averages, with some even provided for free. Adding to the mystery, DeepSeek is reportedly not actively seeking investor funding, despite considerable VC interest. DeepSeek attributes its extreme cost competitiveness to efficiency breakthroughs, although some experts have questioned the validity of these claims. Regardless, developers are flocking to DeepSeek’s models, which, while not fully open-source, are available under permissive licenses allowing commercial use. Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue reports over 500 derivative models of R1 created by developers on their platform, amassing over 2.5 million downloads. DeepSeek: An AI Revolution or Overhyped Threat? DeepSeek’s impact is undeniable. Its success has been described as both “upending AI” and “over-hyped,” highlighting the polarized opinions surrounding its rapid rise. Notably, DeepSeek’s momentum contributed to an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price in January and even prompted a public statement from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The US government is also taking notice, with the Commerce Department reportedly banning DeepSeek on government devices. Conversely, Microsoft has embraced DeepSeek, integrating it into its Azure AI Foundry service. Even Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged DeepSeek’s influence, stating that AI infrastructure spending remains a “strategic advantage” for Meta. OpenAI has labeled DeepSeek as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” advocating for a potential US ban on DeepSeek models. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” recognizing the computational demands of reasoning models as beneficial for Nvidia’s hardware. Despite endorsements from some quarters, DeepSeek also faces bans from individual companies, entire countries like South Korea, and US states like New York. The Future of DeepSeek and the Global AI Race The future trajectory of DeepSeek remains uncertain. Continued advancements in its AI models are expected. However, growing wariness from the US government regarding potential foreign influence poses a significant challenge. The reported impending US ban on DeepSeek for government devices underscores this concern. Whether DeepSeek can navigate these geopolitical complexities and sustain its disruptive momentum will be crucial in determining its long-term impact on the global AI landscape. One thing is clear: DeepSeek has undeniably injected a new level of competition and innovation into the AI race, forcing established players to adapt and reassess their strategies.

Pi Network: The Cryptocurrency You Can Mine on Your Phone Imagine earning cryptocurrency without expensive hardware or draining your phone’s battery. That’s the promise of Pi Network, a mobile-first crypto-mining community started in 2019 by Stanford graduates. Pi lets you mine its digital currency simply by checking in daily on the app. By nominating trusted contacts, users build a web of verified members, creating a global trust graph that secures the network without massive computing power. Pi Network aims to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-hungry mining, Pi uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is efficient and eco-friendly. Users earn rewards not just for daily check-ins but also for growing their trusted circles and running full nodes. With its focus on decentralization and fair access, Pi could be a game-changer in the crypto space. As it plans to move from its “enclosed” Mainnet phase to an open network, Pi might become an attractive option in the market, especially for those looking to participate without significant investment in hardware. Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Ready to Shine Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a platform that lets developers build apps, tokens, and games without harming the environment. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This means it needs much less energy to operate compared to traditional methods. Its native coin, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and earn rewards by staking. What sets Cardano apart is its unique two-layer design. One layer handles transactions, while the other manages smart contracts. This setup could allow Cardano to process up to a million transactions per second in the future. With the introduction of native tokens in 2021, Cardano has become more efficient and scalable. In the current market, ADA looks attractive, especially for those interested in sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions. As Ethereum faces challenges with scaling and energy use, Cardano’s ADA might be the alternative that investors and developers are looking for. Conclusion PI, ADA, and XYZ are promising, with XYZVerse uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin aiming for significant growth and cultural impact.
